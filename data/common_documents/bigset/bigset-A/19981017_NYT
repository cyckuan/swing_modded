NETWORK, WRITERS GUILD ISSUES SCUTTLE `PFEIFFER' SCREENING

   LOS ANGELES -- Facing objections from the UPN television network
and concerns from the Writers Guild, the Los Angeles Human
Relations Commission canceled a screening and public hearing for
the controversial sitcom ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Hicks, executive director of the Human Relations Commission,
said what was intended as an informal, civil discussion about the
television show was being seen mistakenly by some as part of an
effort of government censorship.
</P>
<P>
   That backlash caused Hicks to decide to cancel Friday's
screening of the program's pilot episode, which had been scheduled
before a crowd of civil rights activists at the office of the
Writers Guild of America in West Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just became untenable,'' Hicks said. ``For one, we were
facing legal objections to airing a show that UPN had not decided
whether to broadcast.''
</P>
<P>
   UPN representatives did not return calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The television comedy, set at the time of the Civil War, has
drawn protests from African-American leaders who believe it makes
light of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that the program was racially divisive, the Los
Angeles City Council recently asked the Human Relations Commission
to screen the show and make a recommendation about whether it was
appropriate for television.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said the screening was to include the controversial pilot
episode, which originally included a scene of two hooded men who
had been hanged in England. When African-American activists
complained that the scene appeared to depict the lynching of blacks
while other characters joked nearby, the scene was edited out

 NEW YORK: a story.''

<P>
   Parker is also remembered as a driven and dedicated editor who
stayed on at Newsweek even after being passed over twice for the
top job. His enthusiasm was particularly apparent on deadline,
colleagues said, when he was known for making last-minute decisions
and savoring every one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would daunt most people was thrilling to him,'' said Evan
Thomas, an assistant managing editor of Newsweek. ``The later, the
harder, the better. He was never happier than when we were either
at war or on the brink of war.''
</P>
<P>
   As an editor, Parker's strength lay in asking the right
questions. He grew frustrated when his staff did not work as hard
as he did, and he criticized them for ``leaning on their shovels.''
As a hands-on editor, he was understated; the sum total of his
notes on a story often amounted to a simple line: ``Say better
pls.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker also loved to scoop the competition. In September 1995,
for example, after losing out to Time on the right to excerpt the
memoirs of Gen. Colin Powell, Newsweek obtained an advance copy of
the book and raced ahead with a cover story.
</P>
<P>
   His career was marred by two decisions. In 1983, he pushed
Newsweek to publicize the so-called Hitler diaries. After
bargaining unsuccessfully for U.S. publication rights to the
diaries from the West German photo-weekly Stern, Newsweek ran an
11-page cover story despite questions about the documents'
authenticity. Newsweek's coverage of the diaries included the
observation, ``Hitler's diaries _ genuine or not, it almost doesn't
matter in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   When German authorities later declared the diaries a hoax,
Newsweek ran a second cover story suggesting that the magazine had
played a major role in uncovering the fraud. Parker described the
experience as the low point in his career.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Parker was forced to answer for having guarded the
secrecy of Joe Klein, then a Newsweek columnist, who had vehemently
denied being Anonymous, the author of the best-selling novel
``Primary Colors,'' even as Newsweek published Klein's denial and
speculated about other writers.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Parker said he did not consider it a conflict that
his magazine published an item at odds with his own personal
knowledge, although in retrospect, he said that perhaps he should
have killed or delayed the item. ``I don't think it's a conflict,''
Parker said in an interview. ``This is not a matter of national
security. This is more a matter of who shot J.R.''
</P>
<P>
   But Parker's job remained secure. In the wake of the Klein
controversy, Parker's superiors at The Washington Post Co., which
owns Newsweek, vouched for his work. Post Co. chairman Donald
Graham said in 1996, ``If magazine editors were all free agents,
without a second's hesitation I would pick Rick and Maynard'' to
lead Newsweek, referring to the magazine's chairman, Richard M.
Smith, and Parker.
</P>
<P>
   Parker's first marriage ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Susan Fraker, an assistant managing
editor at Fortune magazine; a daughter from his first marriage,
Francesca L. Parker of Beaver Dam, Wis.; two sons from his second
marriage, Nicholas Maynard Parker and Hugh Fraker Parker, both of
Manhattan; and his father, C.N. Parker of Bradbury, Calif.

BIGGEST TASK FOR YANKEES: NEUTRALIZE PADRES' BROWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Manager Joe Torre carried a thick red binder through
the Yankees' clubhouse Friday, holding it against his hip, like
mother and child. The binder, as thick as any Yellow Pages,
contained the Yankees' scouting report of the San Diego Padres,
intelligence to be used in the World Series that begins tonight at
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   A section of the report addressed the performances of Torre's
hitters against the San Diego pitchers _ such as Kevin Brown, who
will throw against the Yankees' David Wells in Game 1. Torre could
not have been encouraged by numbers that illuminate Brown's
dominance. Bernie Williams, the Yankees' cleanup batter, has just 4
hits in 17 career at-bats against Brown, for a .235 average. Chili
Davis is a career .170 hitter against the San Diego right-hander,
Tino Martinez .118.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees faced Brown when he pitched in the American League
from 1986 to 1995, before he made improvements. The only regular
with a career average over .300 against Brown is third baseman
Scott Brosius at .409.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws a sinking fastball at about 97 mph,'' Brosius said
drolly. ``That would make him a pretty good pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, coming off a season in which they won 114 games and
had playoff victories against Texas and Cleveland, are strong
favorites in this four-of-seven-game series; their lineup is
deeper, and they have more depth in their pitching rotation and in
their bullpen. If the World Series extends to seven games, four of
those will be played in the Stadium, where the Yankees are 66-20
this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown, who is a sturdy 6 feet 4 inches and 200 pounds and is
a CIA-serious competitor, could be the great equalizer; if the
Padres beat the Yankees and prevent Torre's team from assuming its
place in baseball history, Brown will presumably play a major role.
Brown, perhaps baseball's most durable pitcher, could pitch Games
1, 4 and 7, and in spite of their dubious personal records against
him, the Yankees will probably need to neutralize or beat him at
least once to win this series.
</P>
<P>
   Since he left the Baltimore Orioles after the 1995 season, Brown
has learned how to better control his emotions and has added a
four-seam fastball (which sails high in the strike zone) and a
darting, diving forkball to a repertory that already included a
sinking fastball with stunning movement. He went 18-7 with a 2.38
earned run average for the Padres this season and is 2-1 with a
1.44 ERA in the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he'd make a difference,'' said Bruce Bochy, the Padres'
manager. ``I didn't know he'd make this big of an impact over our
year. He's made a huge difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said: ``Pitchers can dominate a game, no question. We know
Kevin Brown is a good pitcher. Roger Clemens is a good pitcher.
Pedro Martinez is a good pitcher. We just go out and try to do our
thing. Hopefully, if he makes mistakes, we can take advantage of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Brown has sometimes been his own worst enemy, with
a tendency to try too hard and overthrow after he allows one or two
cheap hits or somebody behind him makes an error.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a guy with stuff like that,'' one AL executive said, ``a
lot of times something seems to happen to keep him from winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown will be facing the major leagues' most potent lineup: the
Yankees averaged six runs per game and, with their experienced,
patient hitters, they will force Brown to throw strikes. Torre made
two adjustments to his starting lineup that seemed to be a reaction
to Brown. Brosius, who has batted eighth or ninth virtually the
entire season, was bumped up to seventh, to a position where he has
a better chance to drive in runs; and Ricky Ledee, a rookie, was
inserted in the ninth spot and will start in left field to give the
Yankees six left-handed hitters. Against Brown this year,
left-handed batters hit 20 percentage points higher than
right-handed batters did.
</P>
<P>
   Bochy said that Andy Ashby would pitch Game 2 and Sterling
Hitchcock Game 3. He did not announce his starters for subsequent
games, leaving the option to use Brown on three days' rest in Game
4. Torre, on the other hand, is committed to four starters _ Wells
in Games 1 and 5, Orlando Hernandez in Games 2 and 6, David Cone in
Games 3 and 7 and Andy Pettitte in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Torre acknowledged that he essentially shaped the back end of
his rotation around Cone's needs: the right-hander has sometimes
struggled in cold weather, and by starting in Game 3 on Tuesday,
Cone will throw in the warmth of San Diego. Should the Series go to
seven games, however, Cone would pitch on a late October night in
New York, and the weather could become a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez pitched seven shutout innings against Cleveland in
Game 4 of the American League Championship Series _ and for that he
earned a promotion in the World Series. Pettitte pitched poorly in
his only start in the league championship series, and he is now
also coping with his father's recovery from heart surgery. Pettitte
is in Texas, away from the Yankees, and Torre is not sure when the
left-hander will rejoin the team.

 &HT;    Mauro, Bush go face-to-face
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Democratic challenger Garry Mauro, down in
dollars and trailing in the polls, charged at a Friday night debate
that Gov. George W. Bush has been a do-nothing leader as far as
most Texas families are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro urged voters to support Bush if they can think of anything
he has done for them.
</P>
<P>
   In the campaign's only debate, Bush fired back by charging that
Mauro's overall plan is a multimillion-dollar budget buster.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the challenging rhetoric, and an exchange about whether
Bush will be around for four more years if he is re-elected, the
hour-long event maintained a civil tone.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro launched his toughest shot in his closing statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years and nine months, that's how long Governor Bush has
been in office,'' Mauro said. ``I'll ask you if you can think of
anything that he has done in three years and nine months that was
relevant in your life or your family's life, you ought to vote for
him. But if you believe as I that we ought to put Texas families
first, look at my plan.''
</P>
<P>
   White House issues came up twice. Earlier in the day, Mauro
challenged Bush to say whether he believes the impeachment process
should continue. And, at the debate, Mauro said it's time for Bush
to announce if he will run for president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, at or near the top of all lists of potential GOP
presidential contenders, said he still doesn't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have been one of those types of politicians that says,
`Well, no, I promise not to run' and then turn around and run. But
that's not the way I am,'' he said, adding, ``I told the people of
Texas when I said that, if that bothers you when you go into the
voting booth then make that part of your consideration. I
understand the consequences of not making up my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said Texans deserve a clearer answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect Governor Bush's indecision, but when you are running
for the second largest state in the union and when we have such a
unique opportunity in history, I really think Governor Bush ought
to speed up his decision-making process,'' said Mauro, decrying the
possibility of having a ``part-time governor'' more interested in
Washington than Texas. ``He is running for a job most Texans think
is a full-time job. And I'd like to see him let us know if he is
going to be a part-time governor or a full-time governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Elliott, a political science professor at East Texas
State University in Commerce, said there was no clear winner in
Friday's debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody hit it over the fence,'' Elliott said. ``There was some
condescension and some impatience (by Bush) part of the way
through, and I don't know if that was calculated or if Mauro's
responses were getting to him. Mauro tried to put Bush on the spot
on whether he was going to run for president, and I think he might
have scored points with a few viewers on that.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the debate will serve as an important test run for a
possible national campaign, Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he handled himself pretty well,'' he said, adding that
with Bush's substantial lead in the polls, ``He could stub his toe
a time or two and still get out of it without doing himself
substantial harm.''
</P>
<P>
   And on a Friday night when thousands of Texans were in the
stands at high school football games, Elliott wondered how many
people tuned in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a state contender here, so there wasn't probably
more than a dozen of us watching it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Champagne didn't bother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched it for ten seconds and switched over to Homicide,''
said Champagne, a government professor at the University of Texas
at Dallas. ``I think I came to the conclusion some time ago that
the debate doesn't really matter, that we already know who's going
to win the election.''
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference before the debate, Mauro said Bush owes
voters a clear statement on where he stands on the Clinton
impeachment question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to end this impeachment process, time to get back to
doing the business of the United States of America,'' said Mauro, a
longtime friend of Clinton who collected about $1 million at recent
fund-raisers in Houston and San Antonio that featured the
president. ``I was as mad at Bill Clinton as anybody because I
worked hard to get him elected. As a friend, there is nothing he
did that I can't forgive. As a lawyer, there is nothing
impeachable.''
</P>
<P>
   Still struggling to find a wedge issue, Mauro insisted Bush, as
a leading Republican, can have an impact on the impeachment process
the Democrat said has become a ``political circus.'' Bush, through
connections with key Republicans in Congress, can help
short-circuit the impeachment process, according to Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   At the debate, Bush indicated he had no intention of doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to give the president his day in court before I
rush to judgment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's most challenging comments came on Mauro's spending plans,
which include a $6,000 pay hike for all teachers, borrowing $2
billion from the public school trust fund to build classrooms and
other proposals. Bush said the pay hike would wind up as an
``unfunded mandate'' that could force local school districts to
increase taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commissioner Mauro has made $14 billion worth of promises,''
said Bush, noting that legislative budget writers agree with him.
``We've only got $8 billion worth to spend.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro insisted his budget, which includes ending the sales tax
on motor vehicles, does balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the budget process backwards and forwards,'' said
Mauro, who was elected state land commissioner in 1982. ``My budget
balances.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates also were asked several questions of particular
interest in the El Paso area. El Paso, for years something of a
political outback, has grown in importance this year as Bush has
worked to capture Hispanic votes in unprecedented numbers for a
Republican. A strong showing among Hispanics would be a feather in
his hat if he decides to throw it in the presidential ring in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Mauro differed on what to do about the Tigua Indians'
casino here. Bush believes the tribe's slot machines are illegal.
Mauro disagrees and wants the state to accept the tribe's offer of
a 3 percent cut. The Tiguas have given Mauro $89,000 for his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Both declined to back a constitutional amendment to legalize
casino gambling on reservations.
</P>
<P>
   They also differed on the proposed low-level nuclear waste dump
at Sierra Blanca, about 90 miles southeast of here. Mauro said he
would block the dump, which is up for licensing next week at the
Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Bush noted that Gov. Ann Richards, his predecessor, signed the
bill targeting the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I would ask the commissioner is you make a lot
of noise about this issue relative to me. Why weren't you making
noise when Governor Richards had the issue?'' asked Bush. ``Surely
you weren't playing politics with an issue as sensitive as this.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said he has long opposed plans to put the the facility in
inappropriate places.
</P>
<P>
   On two driving related questions, Bush and Mauro agreed the
state should lower from 0.10 percent to 0.08 percent the
blood-alcohol level at which driving is illegal. But they differed
on whether the state should adopt a graduated license system in
which young motorists slowly get more driving privileges _ like
driving at night _ as the gain more experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the law ought to stay the way it is, at first blush,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said his pre-teen children oppose the idea. But he
believes anything that could save lives should be considered.
</P>
<P>
   In closing statements, Mauro, who at times clearly was reading
from notes, stumbled and stuttered while outlining his proposal to
cut taxes on auto and truck sales.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who remained smooth, said in English and Spanish that he
appreciated the support he's received from all Texans. ``I look
forward to being your governor again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   American-Statesman staff writers Juan B. Elizondo Jr. and Dave
Harmon contributed to this report.

COLUMN: HONORING HIS FATHER'S INSTRUCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Once upon a time, baseball was full of players like
Tony Gwynn. A player spent his career with one team, no jumping
around, no chasing after the money, putting down roots. There was a
covenant: play hard, play well, and chances are you'll have a home
for a while.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 17 seasons, Gwynn has worn the San Diego Padres
uniform. He has kept up his side of the deal: numerous batting
titles, and Gold Gloves. San Diego has nominally kept its end of
the bargain. The Padres have reached the World Series twice in
their 30 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn has been the anchor of a franchise with a zany past. The
Padres were hastily formed for their first season, 1969. Except for
1984, when they reached the World Series, they have experienced a
succession of blunders, screwy deals and chaos. The Yankees have
Gehrig's farewell address, the Padres have Roseanne Barr screeching
the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a history,'' Gwynn said. ``That's what we're
fighting for here. For us, it's more than just trying to win the
World Series. It's trying to establish history.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly an hour Friday, Gwynn held court in the corner of the
visitors' clubhouse at Yankee Stadium while his son, Tony Jr., 16,
sat and took it all in. He didn't mind sharing his father. They had
a private bonding session much earlier in the morning, before
cameras, pens and pads were there. Gwynn and his son approached the
Stadium and walked in together. In 17 seasons in the majors, Gwynn
had never set foot in the venerable House That Ruth Built.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've flown over Yankees Stadium, we've driven by it in a bus,
I had a cab take me _ I was going to Shea and he took me here
instead _ but never been in,'' Gwynn said. ``So it's a big deal to
me to see this place. It's a one-of-a-kind place, the type of place
that sometime in your career, you just hope to get a chance to play
just one game.''
</P>
<P>
   They walked down the left-field line, entered Monument Park,
looked at the retired numbers, the plaques, the monuments. For
Gwynn, Yankee Stadium history made him realize the significance of
this Series for San Diego. Monument Park was a stark reminder of
all that San Diego had not achieved, of the work that still needed
to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the stuff associated with us is not positive,'' Gwynn
said. ``Here's an opportunity for us to establish something
positive in a huge way. You can't get caught up in it. You got to
focus in on the job at hand. But you also know that how you do in
this series is going to have a big impact on not only a lot of
people in our city, but on the history of this club.''
</P>
<P>
   There were deeper roots and reason that drove Gwynn to walk
among the monuments with his son Friday morning. As he looked and
reflected, Gwynn thought about his father. Charles Gwynn was the
pillar of the community in Los Angeles. He was a popular Little
League and Pop Warner coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it all the time when I was a kid, about Yankee
Stadium,'' Tony Gwynn said. ``He'd never been there, but he knew
about Mickey Mantle, knew the history. He used to say that the
Yankees were the team of the decade, of the millennium. So walking
back there looking at those monuments, seeing the names, thinking
about the history, I think of my dad. And I think of how he used to
tell me all the time, `You should take your boy with you.' So
having him here is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gwynn's father wanted him to play football but supported
him when he played baseball. A lifelong Dodgers fan, his dad wanted
him to play for the Dodgers, but supported him with San Diego. When
the Padres began selling off their high-priced players, his dad
became furious and told Tony he should leave the Padres because
they weren't trying to win.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gwynn thought about the argument they had about his leaving
in 1993. Two days later Charles Gwynn died suddenly. Tony Gwynn
contemplated leaving baseball, but then remembered that his father
had always told him to never give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about how
happy he would have been here since 1994, when we really started
rebuilding this team,'' Gwynn said.
</P>
<P>
   David Wells predicted that the Yankees would win the Series in
five games. Gwynn shrugged. A team that wins 114 regular-season
games has the right to be confident. The Padres have climbed too
steep a hill to care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize who we're playing, what we're going against and how
difficult it's going to be,'' Gwynn said. ``But anything can happen
out there between those white lines. Believe me. I've seen it.'' &QL;

DODGERS SEARCH IS NEAR END

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Los Angeles Dodgers hope to end their search for
a manager today when they interview veteran Davey Johnson before
the first game of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Kevin Malone spent almost five hours Friday
speaking with former Texas and Boston manager Kevin Kennedy about
the position.
</P>
<P>
   But sources say Johnson is the favorite to get the job. He led
the New York Mets to a World Series championship in 1986 and the
Cincinnati Reds and Baltimore Orioles to division titles during the
past four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said today's talks with Johnson will be philosophical in
nature, but there is a good chance a new manager could be named on
Monday, the off-day between Games 2 and 3 of the Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have worked with Davey before and we have had a good
relationship,'' said Malone, assistant GM in Baltimore for the past
three seasons. ``He is a proven winner everywhere he has gone. That
is something we are looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, fired after leading Baltimore to the American League
West title in 1997, has been outspoken about his interest in the
Dodgers position. Despite the club's seemingly limitless resources
due to the new owners at Fox, money could be an issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Rockies recently signed Jim Leyland to a
three-year, $6 million contract. The Montreal Expos matched that
figure last week to keep manager Felipe Alou after the Dodgers
offered him more than $3 million for three seasons to come to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Malone has said $2 million per season is too much.
</P>
<P>
   Malone will interview Johnson with new Dodgers farm director
Bill Geivett and assistant GM Ed Creech. There also is a chance
senior vice president and former manager Tom Lasorda will be
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has had trouble with upper management in New York,
Cincinnati and Baltimore. Reds owner Marge Schott and Orioles owner
Peter Angelos are considered difficult to work for, but Malone
conceded Johnson is a ``maverick and very headstrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy led the Boston Red Sox to an American League East title
in 1995 but was fired the next season. He also had the Rangers in
first place in the AL West at the time of the August 1994 strike,
then left to take the Boston job.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who attended Taft High School and lives in Tarzana,
spent several years as a manager in the Dodgers' minor-league
system. He moved on to Montreal as a field coordinator for the
Expos' minor-league operation. There he met Malone, who was GM in
1994-95.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin, like Davey, is a proven winner at every level he has
managed,'' Malone said. ``He did well in the minors and carried
that into the majors. I liked what I heard today.''

 ,  64, is identified with wide-ranging work on poverty. There was
plenty of schadenfreude as well. The forced sale of Long-Term
Capital Management, the immense hedge fund for the very rich and
powerful that had been built upon the application of Merton and
Scholes' latest formulas, seems to have cost the laureates' their
considerable personal fortunes. (They were among its partners.)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yet a look at the pattern of the prizes of the last four years
shows that the Swedish Academy of Sciences, which makes the award,
has put a great deal of effort into saying something about the
state of modern economics that is interesting, encouraging, and, to
many, persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   I say four years because it was five years ago that Assar
Lindbeck, leader of an older generation among Swedish economists,
retired from the committee that prepares the recommendations for
the prize. He had served as its leader since it began. He was no
stick-in-the-mud; far from it. But he took others with him, and
with their departure leadership passed to the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, the economics Nobel is a recent invention. Its proper
name is the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of
Alfred Nobel. The idea was to commemorate the 300th anniversary of
the founding of Sweden's central bank.
</P>
<P>
   The prize was first awarded in 1969, its reception greatly eased
by the long economic boom of the 1950s and 1960s and the sense that
a breakthrough of some sort finally had been achieved by the dismal
science. It joined the five original prizes stipulated in 1895 by
the will of the explosives magnate _ in physics, chemistry,
medicine or physiology, literature, and peace.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the reputation of economics among the general public
has gone mostly downhill. But the Nobel committee was charged with
taking the long view, and for 25 years it carefully charted the
pattern by which economics became its modern self. Within the
profession the committee achieved great authority, working off its
backlog &UR;  &LR; of worthy winners, producing mostly hits and only a few
wheezes in the most political of sciences.
</P>
<P>
   With the general public, too, it maintained credibility,
favoring neither left nor right. In 1974 it split the difference,
dividing the prize equally between Gunnar Myrdal and Friedrich
Hayek.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s, however, the committee was caught up in the
ideological battles of the decade, unable to agree about where the
spotlight should be turned. Economics felt itself to have been
progressing rapidly, yet in 1988 and 1989, prizes went for work
done in 1944. Lags between the work itself and its citation in
Stockholm were averaging 40 years _ as opposed to 10 or 12 in
chemistry and biology as and less in physics.
</P>
<P>
   Then Lindbeck stepped down, the composition of the committee
changed, and whammo! Robert Lucas of the University of Chicago was
cited in 1995. Nobody represented better than Lucas the
discontinuous nature of the change that occurred in economics
during the 1970s. With his 1972 paper on the non-neutrality of
money, he had used high-tech math to bring into sharper focus the
role of individuals' expectations in economic life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, James Mirrlees and William Vickrey were honored. The
fact that they shared the citation seemed to cast the new message
into even sharper relief. Vickery, born in 1914, was an old
fashioned verbal economist, quite brilliant in his day, which
spanned from World War II to the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Mirrlees, on the other hand, born in 1936, was a mathematical
economist whose 1971 article on optimal nonlinear income taxation
was all but indecipherable to those outside the field. And yet
their contributions to the theory of information and incentives
were pretty much the same.
</P>
<P>
   See? the Swedes seemed to be saying: the new high-tech methods
do the same as the old and do it better; they are less ambiguous
and more easily understood and tested. Mirrlees' influence among
his peers was enormous, while Vickrey had been all but forgotten by
the young. As if to underscrore the point, Vickrey died of a heart
attack three days after the award was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the 1997 award to Merton and Scholes. (A third
contributor, Fischer Black, had died the year before.) The
revolutionary Black-Scholes options pricing formula had been
introduced in 1972, generalized by Merton, and shortly therefter
programmed into hand-held calculators used by traders around the
world. It was perhaps the most dominating demonstration of the
practical significance of economic theory ever achieved.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel committee had clearly moved the frontier of
prize-quality work into the era of the Vietnam War. And in this
respect, this year's award to Sen is no exception: ``Collective
Choice and Social Welfare,'' the first of Sen's three books cited
by the committee, was published in 1970. ``On Economic Inequality''
followed in 1973 and ``Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement
and Deprivation'' in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   In another respect, too, Sen's award is similiar to the others.
His work on the theory of ``social choice,'' on which the citation
dwelt at length, is highly technical. An abstract, almost
philosophical field dealing with collective decision-making, social
choice begins with the propounding of axioms, propositions taken to
be true whose relevance is nevertheless hard to pin down.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the other bodies of work, Sen's writings lack the
single drop-dead insight that changes the way a particular problem
is perceived and galvanizes other researchers to work variations on
the theme. Instead, his contributions to social choice are
persistently critical.
</P>
<P>
   They point to difficulties of the ``impossibility'' theorem that
is at the core of social choice: how can satisfactory collective
decision-making be impossible when it happens every day? Sen's
writings therefore raise doubts about the significance of the very
activity of which they are a part. Very clever the insights are,
very provocative too _ but they are not the kind of theory-and-tool
building exercises &UR;  &LR; that won the prize in the three previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Sen's Nobel Prize is being described by many senior
economists as a kind of a ``person'' prize, a lifetime achievement
award instead of a matter of depersonalized science. And so it is.
</P>
<P>
   But what a career! Forty years of calling attention to the
plight of the most impoverished members of society in an
astonishing variety of ways, from high philosophy to measurement
economics to pointed empirical work. Sen's work on famines is well
known _ they are man-made events, he has shown, not vicissitudes of
the weather, and they never, ever happen in democracies, where
those who are starving have a political voice. But perhaps the
single most striking result he ever obtained was the case of the
missing women.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of simple calculations relying on research by
others, Sen showed that women generally outnumber men in Europe and
North America. They are hardier and survive better at all ages.
They don't smoke as much and they don't go to war. So even though
around 5 percent more boys are born than girls around the world,
women outnumber men in the industrial democracies.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia and North Africa, however, the situation is reversed.
Even adjusting for lower life expectancies, there were 44 million
``missing women'' in China in 1992 and 37 million in India, of a
total of more than 100 million worldwide _ if the male-female ratio
of Eurpe and America prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Rough treatment all around, Sen found. Worse health care,
less food, little education, fewer property rights, even the custom
of ``hiding'' newborns who are girls. Social inequality outweighted
the natural survival advantages of women in these lands.
</P>
<P>
   It is a perfect example of the Sen style. No wonder every
university wants him. (He taught at Harvard for a decade until
Cambridge University lured him back last spring with the mastership
of its richest college.) His contribution is not so much a tool as
a sensibility. He is a 20th century Jane Austin, richly cultured
himself, whose topic is not the manners of the rich, but the
problems of the poor.

VAUGHN BENEFITS FROM NON-TRADE TO YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif.)  (Eds: See also BBO-YANKEES, BBO-MATCHUPS, BBO-RHODEN-COLUMN)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was the middle of last summer when Greg Vaughn was
flown into New York only to have Yankee team doctors inspect his
right shoulder as carefully as fine print. Something was up.
</P>
<P>
   But for a Californian as laid back as a palm tree, Vaughn was
not overly paranoid about the completion of a deal between New York
and San Diego that had him becoming a Yankee in exchange for Kenny
Rogers. Hours after doctors poked him like a voodoo doll, Vaughn
was hustling back to San Diego to pick up his packed bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a layover somewhere, and I called my wife,'' Vaughn
said. ``She said, `Hey, you failed your physical.' She saw it on
ESPN. I said, `All right, I'll be home in a little while and unpack
my bags.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Padres were stuck with Vaughn, stuck with a player
they wanted to cast off as a $15 million mistake, stuck with a
misfit who could not consistently find his way into the Padre
lineup. These days, the Padres would not shake him for the world.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Vaughn dropped his bags in a New York hotel room as
a celebrated part of a San Diego team that might not be playing in
the World Series against the Yankees Saturday without the push he
gave his team during his dramatic turnaround season.
</P>
<P>
   Before he cooled a bit, Vaughn's name was inset into this year's
great home run chase. He finished with 50 homers. Still, the
Yankees have not been left wondering what might have been if they
had just listened to the left fielder when he assured them that his
shoulder was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked out for all those clubs involved,'' Yankees general
manager Brian Cashman said. ``They got a player they got to keep
but they didn't want to keep. We used Kenny Rogers in a later deal
to get Scott Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg was a player, at the time, that the Padres made a huge
financial commitment to that wasn't working out, and they tried to
trade a problem for a problem. It didn't work out and maybe that
was the impetus for Greg to turn his career around and get
jump-started again.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But Vaughn's casual nature on the surface did not hint
at any bitterness toward the Yankees as he leaned back in his chair
before Friday's workout at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in trying to throw anything in anybody's
face,'' said Vaughn, who will start in left field after recovering
from a leg injury that kept him out of three games during the
National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just believe in taking a negative and trying to make it a
positive. People have asked, would it be extra special to play the
Yankees instead of Cleveland? I don't care who I'm playing, as long
as I'm in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Greg Vaughn against the Yankees or Greg Vaughn
against the doctors here or Greg Vaughn against George Steinbrenner
because they sent me back,'' he added. ``It's the Padres against
the Yankees. I'm pretty laid back, so not a whole lot bothers me,
except when I'm not playing.''
</P>
<P>
   That issue became the bane of his existence in San Diego a year
ago. He was a wallflower on the Padres team, a player who never did
anything particularly outstanding or exciting, nothing to
foreshadow the season he had this year. To explain his revival,
some point to his more relaxed stance in the batter's box, but
Vaughn attributes it to something more simple than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Dick Vitale says: P.T., playing time,'' said Vaughn,
who was stashed behind Rickey Henderson much of 1997. ``I was
playing Monday and Friday last year, and pinch-hitting in between.
I'd never done that. Playing every day, that's the only thing I
asked when I signed that contract. Let me get 500 at-bats and then
judge me. I got my at-bats this year, and everything took care of
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe everything happens for a reason. With the Yankee
trade, I guess the guy upstairs must have said, `You're a
California boy.' People have asked, `What if you'd been a Yankee?'
and I'm like, `I would have been in the World Series, just like I
am now.'''

<P>
   CASPER, Wyo. _ Matthew Wayne Shepard, the gay student who was
beaten in the dead of night, tied to a fence and left to die alone,
was mourned at his funeral Friday by 1,000 people, including many
who had never met him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt believed that if he had made one person's life better, he
had succeeded,'' his cousin, the Rev. Anne Kitch, said in a homily
that was carried beyond the packed pews of St. Mark's Episcopal
Church, through a filled parish hall, across the street to a packed
Presbyterian church and across Casper on an AM radio station.
``Judging from the world's response,'' she said, ``Matt will have
made a difference in the lives of thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   As the first snowstorm of the fall blanketed Casper, fresh
flowers filled the red brick church here where Shepard had been
baptized as a teen-ager and where he once wore the white robes of
an Episcopal acolyte.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an image that comes to mind when I reflect on Matt on
that wooden cross rail fence,'' said the Rev. Royce Brown, the
pastor of St. Mark's, in a eulogy. ``I replace that image with that
of another man hung upon a cross. When I concentrate on that man, I
can release the bitterness inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, a 21-year-old freshman at the University of Wyoming,
had dreamed of working one day for human rights. In death, he has
become a national catalyst for a new drive to guarantee for gay
people the right to physical safety.
</P>
<P>
   His death hit a nerve in the nation this week, eliciting dozens
of candlelight vigils and rallies for tolerance, several statements
of sadness from President Clinton, and a congressional resolution.
Thursday, the House of Representatives passed by voice vote a
resolution that condemned Shepard's killing as ``outrageous'' and
that urged each member of Congress and every U.S. citizen ``to
denounce this outrageous murder of another human being.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the largest rallies, about 1,000 people, including
members of Congress of both parties, gathered on the steps of the
Capitol in Washington to condemn Shepherd's killing and to urge
passage of a federal bill that would add extra penalties to crimes
motivated by a victim's sexual orientation, gender or disability.
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt urged passage of the bill,
leading the crowd in a chant of ``Now! Now! Now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We will never forget the love that the world has shared with
this kind, loving son,'' said Shepherd's father, Dennis, his
father, outside Casper City Hall, as his mother, Judy, stood by,
weeping. He said the family was ``touched beyond measure'' by ``the
thousands of e-mail comments, Web-site messages, phone calls and
cards offering help, consolation, sympathy and support.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the funeral, about a dozen protesters, largely from
Kansas and Texas, waved signs with anti-homosexual messages. But
mourners stood in front of them, singing ``Amazing Grace'' and
holding umbrellas to block the sight of the spectacle from friends
and family members entering the church.
</P>
<P>
   On hearing of the protest, the Casper City Council held an
emergency meeting Thursday night and unanimously passed an
ordinance banning protests during funerals.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer had warned in advance that anti-gay
protesters were ``just flat not welcome.'' The governor, a
Republican, added, ``What we don't need is a bunch of wingnuts
coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard was born in Casper and attended elementary school,
junior high and several years of high school and college here. With
flags at Casper's public schools flying at half-staff Friday, many
mourners were his old classmates. Others traveled here, one driving
from as far away as New Jersey, out of a sense of solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a pit in my heart and my stomach since I heard
this,'' said Steve Pietrangelo, who drove 300 miles to wait three
hours in cold rain and snow to attend the funeral of a man he never
met. ``I just wanted to pay my respects to him and his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Touching people of all walks of life, Shepard's murder has
elicited calls for tolerance of homosexuals from unexpected
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Wyoming this fall, football players will
wear yellow and green stickers on their helmets in memory of
Shepard. Organizers said that yellow signifies tolerance and green
symbolizesance of homosexuals from unexpected quarters.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Wyoming this fall, football players will
wear yellow and green stickers on their helmets in memory of
Shepard. Organizers said that yellow signifies tolerance and green
symbolizes peace. In Casper, a conservative city of 51,000, located
in the heart of Wyoming's oil belt, tolerance has become the
watchword.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prejudice against homosexuals is just as redneck as anti-black
bias,'` The Casper Star-Tribune, Wyoming's largest newspaper, wrote
in its main editorial on Sunday. ``Violence against our homosexual
friends and neighbors has created a most un-American climate of
fear in Wyoming and the rest of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Jason Marsden, the newspaper's political reporter, wrote
lovingly that, ``Matthew Shepard is still my friend, and not just
because we are both members of the loose-knit community of gay
people striving to make our way in this sometimes hostile place
called Wyoming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt was very short and hard to hug,'' Marsden recalled of the
young man who had grown up in Casper. ``But it was worth trying,
because he'd hug you with everything in his little, fragile
frame.''
</P>
<P>
   In a week of spiritual reflection, Aaron Kreifels, the
University of Wyoming freshman who found his battered classmate
Oct. 7, attributed the chance discovery to ``God's plan.''
</P>
<P>
   On that afternoon, Kreifels, an 18-year-old architectural
engineering student, had nearly completed a rigorous six-mile ride
on a mountain bike up and down Cactus Canyon, in public lands east
of Laramie.
</P>
<P>
   Kreifels recalled in an interview Thursday his only mishap of
the ride, ``I hit this big limestone rock and did one over the
handlebars.''
</P>
<P>
   Dusting himself off and looking around in the fading light of
the day, Kreifels recalled, ``I noticed something out of my eye
that looked like a scarecrow. I walked around the fence, and as I
got closer, I noticed the hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, his hands bound behind his back with a nylon cord and
tied to a fence post, was lying on the ground, face up,
unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I wonder why I found him alive, if he was going to
die,'' Kreifels reflected, before traveling to spend this weekend
at home with his parents in Grand Island, Neb. ``But I guess God
wanted his parents to be with him.''

OWNERS PROPOSE EXPANSION OF UNION'S LUXURY TAX 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three days after the players union proposed a luxury tax on very
high-salaried players as a way of breaking the three-month labor
impasse, the National Basketball Association responded Friday with
a luxury tax proposal of its own that would include the salaries of
many more players.
</P>
<P>
   But while the fact that both sides were now talking about the
same solution _a luxury tax on salaries _ would seem to suggest
some progress, neither the owners nor the union were optimistic
that the latest developments would end the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, dismissed the plan
as a ``masquerade'' by the owners to obtain a salary cap without
exceptions. ``They've taken a step backward,'' he said. Hunter did
not discount the possibility of losing the entire season because of
the way negotiations are going. ``We'll study and analyze it this
weekend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, admitted that the
league's proposal was geared toward discouraging teams from signing
players to exorbitant contracts, but added, ``We can't make any
more deals where the owners take all the risks.''
</P>
<P>
   The public posturing may conceal whether there is room for
negotiation over the next several weeks, and whether a tax system
may eventually lead to the signing of a collective bargaining
agreement and the season's belatedly starting. The first two weeks
of the season were canceled on Tuesday, and league officials have
said another two-week block of games may be eliminated the week of
Oct. 26.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA proposal would tax teams for all contracts signed under
the Larry Bird exception _ re-signing their own free agents for any
amount they choose regardless of the team's salary cap situation _
that exceed the average player salary, which was $2.6 million
during the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
   The league projects that the tax would affect 15 percent of
future contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Using a tax escalation system, a league official said salaries
of $10 million would be taxed 100 percent and salaries reaching $20
million would be taxed 200 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A clause was factored in for current Bird exception players with
huge deals that would prohibit a tax as long as their new deals
were not 5 percent over the current contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The league's plan also includes a provision that says a hard cap
would go into effect if the percentage of league revenue paid to
the players exceeds an agreed-upon level after two years, a
provision the players have said in the past they would not agree
to.
</P>
<P>
   While the league boasted that by the 2001-02 season the average
player salary would be at least $3.1 million, the union contended
the plan will do away with the middle-class salary and exacerbate
the situation of haves and have-nots in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The league proposal was in response to a tax system proposed by
the players on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That plan called for a 50 percent tax on contracts over $18
million with the tax put into a fund that would eventually be
distributed to lower-revenue- generating teams.
</P>
<P>
   The league contended that only two players would be currently
affected by such a tax, and that it would not meet their financial
goals.
</P>
<P>
   If a player received $10 million and had his salary taxed at 100
percent, a luxury-tax system would keep him from making another $10
million that goes directly to a fund for low-revenue teams. ``I
don't think we should get too carried away about the
possibilities,'' Granik said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are awaiting an arbitration decision on Monday by
John Feerick, dean of Fordham Law School, who will rule whether
more than 220 players with guaranteed contracts close to $800
million should be paid during the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   If Feerick rules favorably for the players, the league has
indicated it plans to appeal and tie the matter up in court for
perhaps several months.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, if the league wins the decision, Hunter said his
constituency is determined to show resolve in its stalemate with
the owners.

AGREEMENT ON HOLYFIELD-LEWIS BOUT IS CLOSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The parties negotiating a proposed undisputed heavyweight
championship bout between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis are
inching closer to an agreement that will have both boxers in the
ring early next year. But after five days of talks on two
continents, it is still not officially done.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thomas, Holyfield's lawyer, said that Holyfield signed a
contract for the fight on Thursday and was eager to meet Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evander has signed and is satisfied with all the terms,''
Thomas said. ``Now, Lennox needs to sign. All this nonsense about
Evander not wanting to fight Lennox is now being exposed for what
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   There is speculation that the fight will take place on March 13
at Madison Square Garden, but Milton Chwasky, Lewis' U.S.-based
lawyer, declined comment when asked about that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Chwasky said that at this point he did not see any deal breakers
in the contract. Don King, Holyfield's promoter, faxed it to Lewis'
promoter, Panos Eliades, in London and is awaiting a signature from
Lewis. Chwasky said he would read the contract over the weekend
before Lewis signed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've verbally agreed on the majority of the major issues,''
Chwasky said. ``There aren't any minor issues that can't be worked
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, 35, is guaranteed $20 million and Lewis, 33, is
guaranteed $10 million. However, there is still a major hurdle that
must be cleared before the fight is made. King must reach an
agreement with HBO Sports, which has the rights to the fight by
virtue of its exclusive contract with Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   The bout would be broadcast on TVKO, the pay-per-view arm of HBO
Sports. There is longstanding acrimony between King and Seth
Abraham, president of Time Warner/HBO Sports. King and Abraham were
once partners at HBO, but they split in the late 1980s. King went
over to Showtime, HBO's main cable rival, but recently he and
Abraham put aside their differences and are trying to hammer out an
agreement to make the fight happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of talk, a lot of good will and a lot of
progress,'' Abraham said. ``But in boxing you always want to be
careful that the chariot doesn't become a pumpkin. In boxing you're
so gun-shy you always sleep with a bulletproof vest.''
</P>
<P>
   With both fighters seemingly on board for the fight, the
pressure is now on King and Abraham to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   This is a risky venture for King, because there are no
guaranteed profits for him. King, the lead promoter for the fight,
can drive the show to profitability. Lack of a guarantee for King
should not be a stumbling block to making the fight, but it is just
not the way he normally does business.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield and Lewis are not major pay-per-view draws on their
own. But together this could be a formidable match, because there
is not another compelling heavyweight championship bout on the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'd be surprised if this fight doesn't do a
million pay-per-view buys,'' Thomas said. ``There's been two years
since there was a heavyweight bout that anyone has been excited
about. This is what everyone wants to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson, if he gets his license back in Nevada on Monday and
returns to boxing, will do big pay-per-view numbers. But there will
not be a title at stake, and no one is sure how much Tyson has left
in his tank. With back-to-back losses to Holyfield, Tyson has not
won a fight in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evander doesn't have one trait that Tyson has,'' Thomas said.
``People come to see if Tyson will kill someone or if a piece of
someone will get ripped off. But everyone knows that when they come
to see Evander, they'll see a good fight.''

EDITORIAL: THE LESSON OF MATTHEW SHEPARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 17:
</P>
<P>
   It was a painful and soul-searching moment for the nation when
Matthew Shepard was buried in Casper, Wyo., Friday. The details of
his murder have been a public horror. Singled out, apparently,
because he was gay, tied to a fence, beaten and left in a coma in
the chill of night, his death at the tender age of 21 has brought
home to the American public as nothing else ever has the menace and
hatred that homosexuals still face in being honest in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   There have been many other murders through the years. People
were repelled in 1992 when a Navy enlisted man, Allen Schindler,
was stomped to death in a men's room by two crewmates. Other young
men have died horribly all around the country _ slashed and dumped
into the water off Staten Island, dropped through a manhole to
drown in a Boston sewer, chased and stabbed to death in San
Francisco, strangled and burned in Florida. The Southern Poverty
Law Center, after studying FBI statistics, has calculated that gay
men and lesbians are six times as likely to be physically attacked
as Jews or Hispanics in America, and twice as likely as
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But the pattern has never fixed itself in the public mind the
way racial assaults have. This is a culture that responds to
images, and there is something about the picture of Matthew Shepard
_ a college student, fresh of face and full of promise _ and the
stark cruelty of his death that has held the nation's horrified
attention this last week.
</P>
<P>
   For homosexuals, the key to winning acceptance and respect has
been to make themselves familiar, visible and known. Yet in almost
30 years of struggle to repeal state sodomy laws and win equal
protection under law, the modern gay rights movement has never
achieved a recognizable public face. Now, in a victim, a young man
who wanted to be a diplomat, it has been given one. His murder has
brought out enough sneers, jokes, caricatures and graffiti on
college campuses across the land to make it clear that bias against
homosexuals is not just an attitude among young toughs like the two
high school dropouts who have been charged with the killing. In a
society in which fundamentalist religious leaders and prominent
Republican politicians insist on castigating homosexuals as a
threat, that bias is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The need for hate-crime laws is obvious. But a student at the
University of Wyoming Friday held up a sign declaring a more basic
need: ``Attack Intolerance With Education.'' We can take
inspiration from the example of Judy and Dennis Shepard. On the day
they were to bury their murdered son, they stood in the rain
outside the City Hall in Casper to thank the American people for
messages of sympathy and support. ``We are honored and touched
beyond measure,'' Shepard said, as his wife wept. Then, protected
from radical fundamentalist protesters by a police barricade, they
buried Matthew Shepard from the church in which he had been an
acolyte.
</P>
<P>
   It is a murder that seems to have aroused the deepest decent
sympathies of the nation, a case in which law, religion, love,
dignity and politics all seem on the side of a dead young gay man.
It is a rare moment, and politicians and preachers had better take
a lesson.

</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., N.J.)  (mk) 
 By ELEANOR RANDOLPH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Bill-and-Monica jokes may die down by 2000, but only then
will we see President Clinton's legacy to the next presidential
campaign. In shaping what voters look for and how candidates
present themselves, his impact could be as striking as President
Nixon's on the election of 1976.
</P>
<P>
   After Watergate, voters were looking for a non-Nixon. They found
a soft-spoken born-again Baptist who promised a government as good
as the American people. More concretely, then Gov. Jimmy Carter
vowed that unlike Richard Nixon, the architect of our long national
nightmare, he would never lie to the American people. In one effort
to be scrupulously truthful, Carter admitted that despite his
beliefs, he had strayed into sinful territory himself on occasion.
``I've looked on a lot of women with lust,'' the presidential
hopeful confessed to Playboy, a prime venue for those with similar
failings. ``I've committed adultery in my heart many times,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four years later, lust has moved out of the presidential
heart and into the Congress, and Clinton's earthier sins have
provoked an impeachment spectacle set for the holiday season in
Washington. While Congress revels in the steamy details of another
presidential cover-up, the massive political apparatus that feeds
on presidential politics is also growing ravenously hungry for
candidates. In short, the search is on for the anti-Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As the presidential historian Michael Beschloss mused recently,
Americans sometimes feel the need for a breather. Dwight
Eisenhower, for example, provided relief after the bitterness of
McCarthyism. ``A huge element in Eisenhower's appeal was that his
election would give it a rest, heal the nation after American
nerves had been through so much in the previous years,'' Beschloss
explained.
</P>
<P>
   For the Republicans, being tanned, rested and ready is no longer
good enough. The next GOP presidential candidate will have to swear
up and down to redignify the White House and to be the owner of a
settled and secure marriage. The old Carter formulation about being
as good as the American people may not suffice. After all, the
morals of the American people have been declared slack by Bill
Bennett, the GOP's dean of virtue, and by James Dobson, the radio
evangelist whose lusts tend toward power brokering. Former Vice
President Dan Quayle has already made a public announcement that he
has never strayed on his wife. Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., has also
pronounced himself as morally ready for the next round.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, it will be more of a challenge to find the
antidote to Clinton's negatives. But Vice President Al Gore; Dick
Gephardt, the House minority leader, or former Sen. Bill Bradley, a
mighty fortress of a man who eyes the primary calendar each
campaign season, all seem bland enough for the task. They are not
slick. They stiffen in front of the camera. Their speeches are
often informative, worthy and eye-glazing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it may turn out that searching for Clinton's opposite, Mr.
Good President, might not be as worthy or as predictable an
electoral pursuit as it looks right now. As President Franklin
Roosevelt's adviser Thomas Corcoran once said : ``A great man
cannot always be a good man.''
</P>
<P>
   He could have added that a good man is not always a particularly
good president, a concept the public now seems to get. Clinton
receives high approval ratings for his abilities as president, low
ratings for his morals as a man. Eighteen years ago, a New York
Times poll had 60 percent giving President Carter low marks as a
leader while over 70 per cent saw him as an honest man.
</P>
<P>
   The electorate is always capable of fooling those of us who try
to predict its whims. Perhaps voters will decide that instead of
goodness and honesty and marital fidelity, they want experience or
TV dynamism or a tough hide on the hard issues. If so, the Clinton
political legacy could be something altogether different _ a
private life for presidential candidates.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 17:
</P>
<P>
   It is fitting that this most memorable of baseball seasons
should conclude with a World Series that opens Saturday night in
Yankee Stadium, the aging but still grand cathedral of the sport.
Bedecked in bunting and banners, the revered ballpark always
elevates the game with its aura of history and accomplishment. That
makes it the perfect venue for part of a championship series that
will determine whether the 1998 Yankees are one of the greatest
teams of the modern era, or just a talented squad that owned the
regular season but folded in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers are a boisterous, boastful bunch, and the patter of
the city this week has been loud and arrogant, or so it must seem
to anyone venturing here from San Diego to root for the Padres. The
word on the sidewalks and in the subways is that the Padres don't
measure up against the Yankees. Sure, they have lethal starting
pitchers in Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby, and one of the game's best
closers in Trevor Hoffman, not to mention prolific hitters like
Tony Gwynn and Greg Vaughn, who is hobbling but still dangerous.
But how is that a match for the Yankees' World Series starting
rotation of David Wells, Orlando Hernandez, David Cone and Andy
Pettitte, bullpen flamethrower Mariano Rivera, plus the deepest
batting order in baseball?
</P>
<P>
   Yet the truth is that Yankees fans are terrified the team will
crumple. Baseball fans, even Yankee fans, can spend a lifetime
waiting to see a home team of historic caliber, and this Yankee
team will not reach that sanctified status unless it ends its
record-setting season by winning the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The doubts keep creeping up. The team was pitiful at the plate
through most of the playoffs. Tino Martinez, the top run producer,
has been in a numbing slump. Bernie Williams, the American League
batting champ, hit well in the pennant series against the Cleveland
Indians, but has seemed distracted by personal matters. Shane
Spencer, the rookie slugging sensation of September, hasn't turned
out to be the new Mr. October. Pettitte has been struggling since
August.
</P>
<P>
   The curious thing about this team, which won more games during
the regular season than any team in American League history, is how
quiet and unobtrusive it can be. It sports no dominant superstar,
no swaggering clubhouse leader, no one who seems to belong in New
York. So when the Yankees start to drift on the field, fans tend to
fear the team might simply fade away. Until the Indians surged
temporarily ahead in the playoffs, the Yankees had faced no serious
test of resiliency all season.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers can already taste that ticker-tape parade up
Broadway. But behind every mighty cheer at the stadium Saturday
night will lurk the fear that when the curtain falls on the season,
an unheralded and unlegendary team from San Diego will be the one
that is remembered.

 ,  64, is identified with wide-ranging work on poverty. There was
plenty of schadenfreude as well. The forced sale of Long-Term
Capital Management, the immense hedge fund for the very rich and
powerful that had been built upon the application of Merton and
Scholes' latest formulas, seems to have cost the laureates' their
considerable personal fortunes. (They were among its partners.)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yet a look at the pattern of the prizes of the last four years
shows that the Swedish Academy of Sciences, which makes the award,
has put a great deal of effort into saying something about the
state of modern economics that is interesting, encouraging, and, to
many, persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   I say four years because it was five years ago that Assar
Lindbeck, leader of an older generation among Swedish economists,
retired from the committee that prepares the recommendations for
the prize. He had served as its leader since it began. He was no
stick-in-the-mud; far from it. But he took others with him, and
with their departure leadership passed to the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, the economics Nobel is a recent invention. Its proper
name is the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of
Alfred Nobel. The idea was to commemorate the 300th anniversary of
the founding of Sweden's central bank.
</P>
<P>
   The prize was first awarded in 1969, its reception greatly eased
by the long economic boom of the 1950s and 1960s and the sense that
a breakthrough of some sort finally had been achieved by the dismal
science. It joined the five original prizes stipulated in 1895 by
the will of the explosives magnate _ in physics, chemistry,
medicine or physiology, literature, and peace.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the reputation of economics among the general public
has gone mostly downhill. But the Nobel committee was charged with
taking the long view, and for 25 years it carefully charted the
pattern by which economics became its modern self. Within the
profession the committee achieved great authority, working off its
backlog &UR;  &LR; of worthy winners, producing mostly hits and only a few
wheezes in the most political of sciences.
</P>
<P>
   With the general public, too, it maintained credibility,
favoring neither left nor right. In 1974 it split the difference,
dividing the prize equally between Gunnar Myrdal and Friedrich
Hayek.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s, however, the committee was caught up in the
ideological battles of the decade, unable to agree about where the
spotlight should be turned. Economics felt itself to have been
progressing rapidly, yet in 1988 and 1989, prizes went for work
done in 1944. Lags between the work itself and its citation in
Stockholm were averaging 40 years _ as opposed to 10 or 12 in
chemistry and biology as and less in physics.
</P>
<P>
   Then Lindbeck stepped down, the composition of the committee
changed, and whammo! Robert Lucas of the University of Chicago was
cited in 1995. Nobody represented better than Lucas the
discontinuous nature of the change that occurred in economics
during the 1970s. With his 1972 paper on the non-neutrality of
money, he had used high-tech math to bring into sharper focus the
role of individuals' expectations in economic life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, James Mirrlees and William Vickrey were honored. The
fact that they shared the citation seemed to cast the new message
into even sharper relief. Vickery, born in 1914, was an old
fashioned verbal economist, quite brilliant in his day, which
spanned from World War II to the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Mirrlees, on the other hand, born in 1936, was a mathematical
economist whose 1971 article on optimal nonlinear income taxation
was all but indecipherable to those outside the field. And yet
their contributions to the theory of information and incentives
were pretty much the same.
</P>
<P>
   See? the Swedes seemed to be saying: the new high-tech methods
do the same as the old and do it better; they are less ambiguous
and more easily understood and tested. Mirrlees' influence among
his peers was enormous, while Vickrey had been all but forgotten by
the young. As if to underscrore the point, Vickrey died of a heart
attack three days after the award was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the 1997 award to Merton and Scholes. (A third
contributor, Fischer Black, had died the year before.) The
revolutionary Black-Scholes options pricing formula had been
introduced in 1972, generalized by Merton, and shortly therefter
programmed into hand-held calculators used by traders around the
world. It was perhaps the most dominating demonstration of the
practical significance of economic theory ever achieved.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel committee had clearly moved the frontier of
prize-quality work into the era of the Vietnam War. And in this
respect, this year's award to Sen is no exception: ``Collective
Choice and Social Welfare,'' the first of Sen's three books cited
by the committee, was published in 1970. ``On Economic Inequality''
followed in 1973 and ``Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement
and Deprivation'' in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   In another respect, too, Sen's award is similiar to the others.
His work on the theory of ``social choice,'' on which the citation
dwelt at length, is highly technical. An abstract, almost
philosophical field dealing with collective decision-making, social
choice begins with the propounding of axioms, propositions taken to
be true whose relevance is nevertheless hard to pin down.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the other bodies of work, Sen's writings lack the
single drop-dead insight that changes the way a particular problem
is perceived and galvanizes other researchers to work variations on
the theme. Instead, his contributions to social choice are
persistently critical.
</P>
<P>
   They point to difficulties of the ``impossibility'' theorem that
is at the core of social choice: how can satisfactory collective
decision-making be impossible when it happens every day? Sen's
writings therefore raise doubts about the significance of the very
activity of which they are a part. Very clever the insights are,
very provocative too _ but they are not the kind of theory-and-tool
building exercises &UR;  &LR; that won the prize in the three previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Sen's Nobel Prize is being described by many senior
economists as a kind of a ``person'' prize, a lifetime achievement
award instead of a matter of depersonalized science. And so it is.
</P>
<P>
   But what a career! Forty years of calling attention to the
plight of the most impoverished members of society in an
astonishing variety of ways, from high philosophy to measurement
economics to pointed empirical work. Sen's work on famines is well
known _ they are man-made events, he has shown, not vicissitudes of
the weather, and they never, ever happen in democracies, where
those who are starving have a political voice. But perhaps the
single most striking result he ever obtained was the case of the
missing women.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of simple calculations relying on research by
others, Sen showed that women generally outnumber men in Europe and
North America. They are hardier and survive better at all ages.
They don't smoke as much and they don't go to war. So even though
around 5 percent more boys are born than girls around the world,
women outnumber men in the industrial democracies.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia and North Africa, however, the situation is reversed.
Even adjusting for lower life expectancies, there were 44 million
``missing women'' in China in 1992 and 37 million in India, of a
total of more than 100 million worldwide _ if the male-female ratio
of Eurpe and America prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Rough treatment all around, Sen found. Worse health care,
less food, little education, fewer property rights, even the custom
of ``hiding'' newborns who are girls. Social inequality outweighted
the natural survival advantages of women in these lands.
</P>
<P>
   It is a perfect example of the Sen style. No wonder every
university wants him. (He taught at Harvard for a decade until
Cambridge University lured him back last spring with the mastership
of its richest college.) His contribution is not so much a tool as
a sensibility. He is a 20th century Jane Austin, richly cultured
himself, whose topic is not the manners of the rich, but the
problems of the poor.

CALIFORNIA PREPARES FOR FASTER EXECUTION PACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DON TERRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The largest death row in the United States is not
in Florida or Texas, where executions have become almost routine
rituals of last meals, unanswered prayers, lethal injections and
hearses driving slowly through a prison gate.
</P>
<P>
   With 508 men and 9 women sentenced to die, the largest death row
is in California, the land of sun, sand, surf and once upon a time
the most liberal governor in the country, Jerry Brown, who opposed
capital punishment at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   For years, California's death row was a place where the
condemned were more likely to die from old age, sickness or suicide
than from a lethal injection. In the two decades since the nation
resumed executions, California has put five people to death. This
year alone, Texas has executed 16 people.
</P>
<P>
   No one believes that the Golden State will ever catch up with
Texas. Nor does anyone say that would even be desirable.
</P>
<P>
   But because of a confluence of events in California, from a
congealing of political will to the fact that scores of cases
making their way through the appeals process are about to be
resolved, the pace of executions is likely to increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very real concern that we're going to have a mass
assembly line of executions starting up in this state,'' said Mike
Farrell, the actor and president of the board of Death Penalty
Focus of California, a group that opposes capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, argued Dane Gillette, the senior assistant state
attorney general who oversees death penalty cases, the people of
California have consistently expressed their support for the death
penalty in opinion polls and jury verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can say there is any ambivalence,'' Gillette
said. ``The fact that we have over 500 people on death row and
juries are willing to give out so many death sentences doesn't show
much ambivalence.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, support for the death penalty has been a litmus test
for California politicians for a long time, ever since a Republican
replaced the last governor to oppose state-sanctioned executions,
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, voters sent California politicians a powerful message,
ousting the chief justice of the state's Supreme Court, Rose Bird,
who was widely seen as soft on the death penalty because the Bird
court frequently reversed death sentences. After her ouster, the
new court frequently affirmed death sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who had appointed Judge Bird, is no longer a player in
the major leagues of state politics. He is mayor-elect of Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Now more than ever, the political power in the state lies
squarely in the hands of those who favor capital punishment and the
voices of opposition among elected officials have been all but
silenced. Both candidates for governor this year, Gray Davis, the
Democrat, and Dan Lungren, the Republican, like the current
governor, Pete Wilson, favor the death penalty, so much so that
their campaign commercials quibble over which one supports it more.
</P>
<P>
   Having long ago parted company with their
anti-capital-punishment tradition, even the state's two U.S.
senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, both Democrats, say
they favor it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large percentage of the traditionally liberal wing of the
Democratic Party has caved in on this issue,'' said Lance Lindsey,
executive director of Death Penalty Focus.
</P>
<P>
   A lonely voice of opposition among state officials is state Sen.
John Burton, a Democrat and the president pro tem of the Senate.
Burton said he did not know of a single elected Republican official
in the state who shared his opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he said, ``I have trouble finding Democrats. We're a
vanishing breed.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the government, some organized opposition remains, but
it has failed to ignite California voters.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend in San Francisco, Death Penalty Focus sponsored a
conference of religious leaders opposed to capital punishment. The
conference included Buddhists, Baptists, Roman Catholics, Jews and
Muslims, who signed a ``Statement of Conscience,'' opposing the
death penalty and announced a campaign to stop executions in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen this issue politicized in recent years and reason
and spiritual concerns have been pushed aside,'' said Wilson Riles
Jr., executive director of the American Friends Service Committee,
Pacific Mountain Region. ``Our campaign will not be aimed at
politicians, but at the people who elect them.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, their efforts are having little effect.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, in fact. Both sides in the debate agree that a
major reason the capital punishment process has been so slow in
California is that there are not enough lawyers experienced in the
often-complicated laws on the death penalty. Currently, about 180
death-row inmates in California do not have lawyers for their
appeals, and it can take more than four years before they are
assigned one by the court.
</P>
<P>
   Only then can the lengthy state and federal appeals process
begin. To speed the cases, the California Legislature has created a
new state agency to recruit and train lawyers to represent
death-row inmates. The agency, which is to open its doors within
the next few months, is also intended to satisfy a new law that
puts a one-year time limit on filing federal court appeals in death
cases.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Michael Laurence, a defense lawyer opposed to capital
punishment, has been named to be the first executive director of
the agency, the Habeas Corpus Resource Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawyers who take on these cases,'' Laurence said, ``are
basically signing on to a 10-year commitment. And they're very hard
to find.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers must be qualified, as well as compensated, to
investigate cases that are often years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I recall,'' said state Sen. Bill Lockyer, a Democrat who
was the sponsor of the bill that financed the center, ``the median
time between conviction by a jury, sentencing by a judge and
execution is about 14 years in California. Virtually, no one thinks
that is appropriate or good policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The center will eventually employ 30 lawyers and a staff of
investigators. The initial budget of $5 million also includes money
to hire 15 new lawyers for the state's public defender's office,
for a total of 45 additional government lawyers representing
inmates in death cases.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature also increased the hourly pay to $125 from $98
for private lawyers who agree to take appeals of death penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take us three to five years to get through the
backlog of cases,'' Lockyer said.
</P>
<P>
   He was speaking only of getting lawyers assigned to all the
death-row inmates. Even that will be a daunting task. Every year,
20 to 40 new inmates are sent to the state's death row, according
to the California Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   Laurence's permanent appointment requires approval of the state
Senate, which is pending, and not all interest groups are pleased
with him in the job.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Scheidegger, the legal director for the Criminal Justice
Legal Foundation, which supports the death penalty, put his
reservations this way: ``I'm very concerned about Laurence. From
what I know about him, he is the advocate of the obstructionist
school, the idea that a defense lawyer makes every conceivable
argument. They drag the process out. They deliberately throw sand
in the gears of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Laurence, a former director of the Death Penalty
Project for the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern
California, said he had no intention of using his new position to
do anything to slow justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the state should have the power to kill
people,'' he said. ``But this is clearly not a position that allows
for advocacy. If I wanted an advocacy position, I would not have
left the ACLU. And I don't have any qualms about the agency being
able to provide high-quality representation. That's what we're here
for.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, Laurence plans to take a couple of days off from
setting up the center for a trip to Chicago. He is scheduled to
gave a speech at the Northwestern University Legal Clinic's
National Conference on Wrongful Convictions and the Death Penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 75 people released from death rows around the
country in the last 25 years after evidence of innocence was
discovered are also expected to attend the conference.

COURT BACKS GIULIANI'S BID TO BAR VOTE ON YANKEE STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani gained a crucial victory
Friday in his battle to keep a referendum on the future of Yankee
Stadium off the Nov. 3 ballot, as a state appellate court upheld
his right to replace that referendum with one on campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsor of the stadium referendum, City Council Speaker
Peter Vallone, immediately filed papers to appeal to the state's
highest court, the Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials were buoyed by the ruling, a
strongly worded, unanimous decision by a five-judge panel in the
Appellate Division of state Supreme Court in Manhattan. The
decision overturned a a Bronx judge's ruling that the mayor's
ballot proposal, an amendment to the City Charter dealing with
campaign-finance limits, should not be on the ballot because it had
been devised solely to keep off the stadium question.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate panel, with three Democrats and two Republicans,
relied heavily on the precedents set in a similar Yonkers
referendum case that the Court of Appeals itself decided in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Yankee Stadium referendum is dead,'' said the
mayor's corporation counsel, Michael Hess. Giuliani called the
decision ``a victory for government over politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vallone was not giving up. ``The referendum is very much
alive,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The appellate decision was only part of a hectic afternoon of
sparring over the referendum issue. There was an emergency meeting
of the City Board of Elections, impromptu news conferences by the
litigants and maneuvering in a related federal suit that culminated
in a judge's order Friday night to speed up preparations for tens
of thousands of absentee ballots that have been delayed by the
referendum dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The saga of the dueling referendums, which ultimately became an
issue in the campaign for governor, began when the City Council
authorized a citywide vote on whether city funds could be spent for
a new stadium if the Yankees leave their city-owned site in the
Bronx when the team's lease ends in 2002. Vallone has been pressing
the issue in his campaign as the Democratic candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor opposed the referendum because he wanted the
option of bargaining with the Yankees' principal owner, George
Steinbrenner, for a new stadium site on Manhattan's West Side to
keep the team from abandoning the city for New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   So Giuliani appointed a charter revision commission to draft a
referendum on new campaign finance rules, knowing that the law
provides that a charter-related referendum bumps any other
referendum off the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The Council's lawyers challenged the mayor's referendum in
court, however, claiming that it was invalid because his charter
commission had failed its legal duty to review the entire charter.
Last week, a state Supreme Court judge in the Bronx, Douglas
McKeon, agreed and struck the mayor's referendum from the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor then appealed, leading to Friday's decision by the
appellate judges, Richard Andrias, Angela Mazzarelli, Eugene
Nardelli, Ernst Rosenberger and David Saxe.
</P>
<P>
   The Council had sued for a preliminary injunction against the
mayor's campaign finance referendum, but the appellate court said
``plaintiffs did not show a likelihood of success on the merits''
of the underlying case. The judges also said the Council had failed
to demonstrate ``irreparable injury,'' noting that even without a
referendum, the Council could block a new stadium through its
budget and land-use powers.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision focused mostly on the issue of whether the
mayor's commission had sufficiently reviewed the entire City
Charter. In citing the Court of Appeals' own standards set forth in
the Yonkers case, the panel saw a direct parallel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as in New York City today,'' the judges said, ``the mayor
and City Council of Yonkers were engaged in a power struggle in
which the mayor appointed a charter revision commission
specifically to pre-empt the City Council's referendum proposal
(which would have curtailed certain mayoral powers) from appearing
on the ballot.''

BROWN VS. THE BRONX BOOMER: INTENSITY DRIVES STARTERS 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kevin Brown has been known to punch walls, kick doors
and throw furniture through glass windows when things don't go
right.
</P>
<P>
   David Wells broke his hand in a saloon parking lot brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is a longtime labor warrior, an officer in the Players
Association who loves discussing the issues and getting involved in
head-to-head negotiations with owners.
</P>
<P>
   Wells threatened to punch his owner's lights out.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, according to teammates and associates, is calm and serene
on days he's not pitching, a model of decorum and a devoted family
man who regularly attends bible study.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who wears his uniform like a slob, went on Howard Stern's
radio show Thursday and predicted that the New York Yankees will
win the World Series in five games, adding during the ribald
interview: ``I would like to wrap it up in four.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Wells takes the mound for the Yankees against Brown and
the San Diego Padres in Game 1 of the 94th World Series at Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Wells backtracked yesterday when asked about his prediction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a matter of me taking it back,'' Wells said. ``I
told nobody I was not predicting anything. Whoever wrote it, they
had fun with it. Sometimes when somebody says something and he
keeps coming at you, you have to say something just to make him go
on to another topic.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells and Brown are outspoken and intense, often to the point of
excess, but they are also terrific pitchers who have earned
reputations as big-game performers. It doesn't get any bigger than
this for two 18-game winners.
</P>
<P>
   The teams and cities are opposites. The rowdy Yankees are in
their 35th World Series and have won 23, including the 1996 affair.
New York is the cultural and financial center of the country, if
not the world.
</P>
<P>
   The cool Padres are in their second World Series, having lost to
Detroit in 1984. San Diego is a relatively small-market resort/Navy
town isolated by Los Angeles to the north, the Pacific Ocean to the
west, Mexico to the south and the desert to the east.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities, though, start with their Game 1 starting
pitchers and the fury they bring, on and off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has hurt, it has helped,'' Wells said of his bad-boy
reputation. ``But I could care less.'' He said he doesn't care
``what people think or what they say. That's the way my mom brought
me up. Take me for what I am, and if you don't like it, too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who is 12-3 with a 2.50 earned-run average in his career
against the Yankees, said, ``It's hard for me to judge myself.
You'd have to ask the other guys on the team. I enjoy the game and
have fun the days I'm not pitching. Obviously I am pretty locked
in. I guess I'm not much of a fun-loving guy on the day I pitch.
But the other times I have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Their teammates don't mind the other stuff as long as they
perform when their turn comes around. Most of the Yankees laughed
off the stir Wells caused when the New York tabloids played up his
``Yanks in 5'' prediction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just Boomer,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said.
``Somebody asks his opinion, he's going to give it. That's the way
he feels.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees prefer to dwell on Wells' career record of 7-0 in
postseason, including 3-0 with a 1.90 ERA this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boomer has always had great stuff,'' Torre said. ``He doesn't
necessarily have the same command all the time, but I think it
started in May this year when he pitched his perfect game. In my
mind, he became a very tough competitor at that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past I've seen him go out there with pretty good
equipment and get frustrated and become more of a thrower than a
pitcher. But I think from May on this year, after that perfect
game, he has been as tough a competitor than I have ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres acquired Brown in this off-season as much for his
toughness and competitiveness as for his formidable ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know a tougher competitor than Kevin Brown,'' Padres
manager Bruce Bochy said. ``When somebody takes the mound like
Kevin does, I haven't seen anybody take more fire and intensity out
there, and he pitches all-out to win. The other pitchers have fed
off that. I would say he and Wells are similar in that respect.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why their managers are giving them the ball to start the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   One of them will win.
</P>
<P>
   People will want to stay away from the other.

PATAKI CALLS CAMPAIGN FINANCING `DREADFUL,' BUT HAS NO SOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication notice: also filed in category `p') 
(bl) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York state's campaign finance system is
``dreadful'' and ought to be overhauled, Gov. George Pataki said in
an interview, but he suggested that any real reform would be
difficult to achieve and refused to detail what changes he might
want to make.
</P>
<P>
   In an hourlong interview Thursday with editors, reporters and
executives of The New York Times, Pataki did say he would like to
change the system in a second term, but not precisely how. ``I have
some thoughts, but I don't want to talk about them,'' he said.
Moments later, he appeared to retreat from that, insisting, ``I do
not have a plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the interview, the Republican governor, who is
running for re-election, dwelled on the accomplishments of his
first term, like cutting taxes, promoting business growth and
changing the welfare system. ``There were a lot of skeptics around
the state who didn't believe that we'd be able to achieve what we
set out to do,'' he said. ``But I think if you look back over what
we've achieved in the last four years it is truly historic.''
</P>
<P>
   But the governor had little to say about what he will do if
voters grant him a second term Nov. 3, except that it will be more
of the same. In addition to his coyness on campaign finance, he was
elusive on other topics, including the next state budget,
legislative redistricting after the next census, and whether he
would run for president or vice president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He also refused to be pinned down as to whether he would debate
his Democratic opponent, Peter Vallone, or to explain why, a month
after Vallone began demanding debates, none have taken place or
been scheduled. He said it was up to the candidates' campaigns to
arrange debates, as if he had no say in the process.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to list his agenda for a second term, Pataki
declined. ``In '94 I didn't say there were one or two top goals,
and I wouldn't say it now,'' he said. In fact in 1994, when he was
running for his first term, Pataki did campaign on two main issues:
reducing taxes and reinstituting the death penalty. He often cites
his success in achieving both goals.
</P>
<P>
   Among the few specific objectives Pataki did cite in the
interview were apprenticeships for welfare recipients and removing
pollution from the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   On the way candidates raise money to run for office, the
governor said: ``Our campaign finance system is dreadful. I think
it's dreadful. And I don't like it, I have never liked it. What we
need is a comprehensive approach to solve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments are notable if only because the governor has
done exceedingly well under the current system, and he has shown no
inclination in the past to change it. He raised $14.5 million for
his 1994 run, setting a record for New York campaigns that he has
shattered this year, raising nearly $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said there should be restrictions on ``independent
expenditure'' campaigns that interest groups, from unions to the
tobacco industry, run for or against candidates. ``They don't even
have to file and disclose who they are and what they're spending
money on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There should also be limits, he said, on how much of their own
money wealthy people can spend in pursuit of public office,
referring obliquely to B. Thomas Golisano, the Independence Party
candidate running against Pataki, who plans to spend $20 million of
his money.
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki acknowledged that so far, no one has found a way to
reach either goal without unconstitutionally restricting free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said any attempt at campaign finance reform should
also look at ``soft money,'' the unlimited contributions that
parties can accept as long as they do not go directly into specific
campaigns, and at transfers from parties to candidates, or between
candidates. But he would not say that he opposed either practice.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Looking ahead, Pataki would not pledge to serve out a second
four-year term, or rule out a run for national office. ``It's
flattering when people talk, you know, and say that you could run
for national office,'' he said. ``It has never been an obsession of
mine; New York state has been.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``you never say never.''
</P>
<P>
   He offered some criticism of his party's leaders in Congress,
who, he said, ``had a difficult time transitioning from a minority
to a majority,'' and said that in 2000, governors like him ought to
be more involved in setting the Republican national agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In reviewing his record, the governor concentrated on tax cuts
and on the ways he has lightened burdens on business, like lowering
the cost of worker's compensation and unemployment insurance, and
deregulating hospital pricing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single year we have been number one in America in
reducing taxes,'' he said. The result of his policies, he said, is,
``We're seeing economic growth that we haven't seen in years prior
to that.'' The governor boasted, as he frequently does, that
private-sector employment is up by 360,000 jobs since he took
office, though New York's pace of growth still lags behind the
national rate and has been concentrated in the New York City area.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki defended his handling of state finances, and dismissed
warnings from some independent fiscal monitors that it has become
too dependent on Wall Street, and too vulnerable to a sharp
downturn. He noted that the state had ended each of the last three
fiscal years with a large surplus, and is headed for another
surplus this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never counted on Wall Street continuing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spoke frequently of the sharp declines in crime and in
the welfare rolls, taking much of the credit for both. He asserted
that most of the 570,000 people who have left welfare have found
work, and grew insistent when asked how he knew that to be the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, of course it's true,'' he said. ``If they're not on
social services, what do you think?''
</P>
<P>
   A study earlier this year by the State Office of Temporary and
Disability Assistance found that of people who had left welfare
over a nine-month period in 1996 and 1997, only 29 percent had
found even minimal employment.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York state's campaign finance system is
``dreadful'' and ought to be overhauled, Gov. George Pataki said in
an interview, but he suggested that any real reform would be
difficult to achieve and refused to detail what changes he might
want to make.
</P>
<P>
   In an hourlong interview Thursday with editors, reporters and
executives of The New York Times, Pataki did say he would like to
change the system in a second term, but not precisely how. ``I have
some thoughts, but I don't want to talk about them,'' he said.
Moments later, he appeared to retreat from that, insisting, ``I do
not have a plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the interview, the Republican governor, who is
running for re-election, dwelled on the accomplishments of his
first term, like cutting taxes, promoting business growth and
changing the welfare system. ``There were a lot of skeptics around
the state who didn't believe that we'd be able to achieve what we
set out to do,'' he said. ``But I think if you look back over what
we've achieved in the last four years it is truly historic.''
</P>
<P>
   But the governor had little to say about what he will do if
voters grant him a second term Nov. 3, except that it will be more
of the same. In addition to his coyness on campaign finance, he was
elusive on other topics, including the next state budget,
legislative redistricting after the next census, and whether he
would run for president or vice president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He also refused to be pinned down as to whether he would debate
his Democratic opponent, Peter Vallone, or to explain why, a month
after Vallone began demanding debates, none have taken place or
been scheduled. He said it was up to the candidates' campaigns to
arrange debates, as if he had no say in the process.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to list his agenda for a second term, Pataki
declined. ``In '94 I didn't say there were one or two top goals,
and I wouldn't say it now,'' he said. In fact in 1994, when he was
running for his first term, Pataki did campaign on two main issues:
reducing taxes and reinstituting the death penalty. He often cites
his success in achieving both goals.
</P>
<P>
   Among the few specific objectives Pataki did cite in the
interview were apprenticeships for welfare recipients and removing
pollution from the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   On the way candidates raise money to run for office, the
governor said: ``Our campaign finance system is dreadful. I think
it's dreadful. And I don't like it, I have never liked it. What we
need is a comprehensive approach to solve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments are notable if only because the governor has
done exceedingly well under the current system, and he has shown no
inclination in the past to change it. He raised $14.5 million for
his 1994 run, setting a record for New York campaigns that he has
shattered this year, raising nearly $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said there should be restrictions on ``independent
expenditure'' campaigns that interest groups, from unions to the
tobacco industry, run for or against candidates. ``They don't even
have to file and disclose who they are and what they're spending
money on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There should also be limits, he said, on how much of their own
money wealthy people can spend in pursuit of public office,
referring obliquely to B. Thomas Golisano, the Independence Party
candidate running against Pataki, who plans to spend $20 million of
his money.
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki acknowledged that so far, no one has found a way to
reach either goal without unconstitutionally restricting free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said any attempt at campaign finance reform should
also look at ``soft money,'' the unlimited contributions that
parties can accept as long as they do not go directly into specific
campaigns, and at transfers from parties to candidates, or between
candidates. But he would not say that he opposed either practice.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Looking ahead, Pataki would not pledge to serve out a second
four-year term, or rule out a run for national office. ``It's
flattering when people talk, you know, and say that you could run
for national office,'' he said. ``It has never been an obsession of
mine; New York state has been.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``you never say never.''
</P>
<P>
   He offered some criticism of his party's leaders in Congress,
who, he said, ``had a difficult time transitioning from a minority
to a majority,'' and said that in 2000, governors like him ought to
be more involved in setting the Republican national agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In reviewing his record, the governor concentrated on tax cuts
and on the ways he has lightened burdens on business, like lowering
the cost of worker's compensation and unemployment insurance, and
deregulating hospital pricing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single year we have been number one in America in
reducing taxes,'' he said. The result of his policies, he said, is,
``We're seeing economic growth that we haven't seen in years prior
to that.'' The governor boasted, as he frequently does, that
private-sector employment is up by 360,000 jobs since he took
office, though New York's pace of growth still lags behind the
national rate and has been concentrated in the New York City area.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki defended his handling of state finances, and dismissed
warnings from some independent fiscal monitors that it has become
too dependent on Wall Street, and too vulnerable to a sharp
downturn. He noted that the state had ended each of the last three
fiscal years with a large surplus, and is headed for another
surplus this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never counted on Wall Street continuing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spoke frequently of the sharp declines in crime and in
the welfare rolls, taking much of the credit for both. He asserted
that most of the 570,000 people who have left welfare have found
work, and grew insistent when asked how he knew that to be the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, of course it's true,'' he said. ``If they're not on
social services, what do you think?''
</P>
<P>
   A study earlier this year by the State Office of Temporary and
Disability Assistance found that of people who had left welfare
over a nine-month period in 1996 and 1997, only 29 percent had
found even minimal employment.

MERRILL NAMES NEW CHIEF FOR GLOBAL DEBT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The shake-up in the executive suite at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
continued Friday as the brokerage firm announced that it had
replaced the head of its global debt business.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill named G. Kelly Martin, 39, as chief of the debt
business, replacing Seth Waugh, who will become Martin's deputy.
Waugh had been co-head of the 1,900-employee global debt unit since
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The change was the second in as many days at the firm. On
Thursday, Merrill named Richard Dunn to replace Daniel Napoli as
head of its risk management team. Both Waugh and Napoli were
demoted, but Merrill said it was not assigning blame to them and
that both would remain with the firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was a good idea to bring in some new perspective to
our debt business,'' said Thomas Davis, Merrill's executive vice
president for the corporate and institutional client group.
</P>
<P>
   The demotions are part of a broader revamping at Merrill. On
Tuesday, the firm announced a third-quarter loss of $164 million
and said it would dismiss 3,400 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Waugh had shared responsibility for the debt unit with Conrad
Voldstad, who left the position last month when he was assigned to
a team overseeing Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund that
Merrill helped rescue.

NEW YORK IS SAID TO BE NEAR SECURING NEW SITE FOR STOCK EXCHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ City and state officials told the New York Stock
Exchange on Friday that they were on the verge of securing a site
for a new headquarters and trading complex for the market directly
across the street from its historic home on Wall Street, according
to people involved in the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   But in what has become a high-stakes poker game, the Stock
Exchange did not immediately embrace the proposal, saying it was
exploring all of its options.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to insure that the financial district in lower
Manhattan remains the financial capital of the world, officials
have been scrambling to come up with a real estate deal for the
exchange, which has threatened to move to Battery Park City or New
Jersey unless the city comes up with an alternative by Nov. 4.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, Deputy
Mayor Randy Levine and Charles Gargano, chairman of the Empire
State Development Corp., told exchange chairman Richard Grasso that
they were confident a deal could be struck for the site, according
to people who were there. Four office buildings owned or controlled
by J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. now sit on the block, along with an apartment
building. The site is bounded by Wall Street and Exchange Place,
between Broad and William Streets.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the proposal, the state would condemn the
property and acquire the land, which would be ready for demolition
and construction in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Stock Exchange expressed reservations about the
proposal, yet another indication that they may favor moving to
vacant land at Battery Park City. The exchange has no desire to
directly antagonize city and state officials, however, because it
wants hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds for a new
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``As currently presented, the economics have yet to justify
building a new New York Stock Exchange trading facility on the old
J.P. Morgan site,'' said stock exchange spokesman Richard Adamonis
on Friday. ``We continue to keep all options open.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The so-called J.P. Morgan site first surfaced as a possible home
for the stock exchange in 1991, when Morgan and city and state
officials proposed building a $1 billion super exchange for the New
York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and the city's
commodities exchanges. Negotiations dragged on for a year. But in
the midst of a severe recession that left a quarter of the office
space vacant in lower Manhattan, the New York Stock Exchange
decided not to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, historic preservationists blocked a plan by the
New York Stock Exchange to build a new trading floor on the Morgan
site and a glass atrium over Broad Street that would have connected
the old and the new buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to get out of its cramped space on Wall Street, the
Exchange told city officials in April that it wanted to move to
Battery Park City, where it could build a modern complex on vacant,
state-owned land. And when the stock exchange felt that City Hall
was not paying sufficient attention to its problems, Grasso
announced that New Jersey was offering all kinds of enticements to
move to Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the exchange agreed to give New York officials six
months to come up with an alternative that would keep the market in
the financial district. Landlords and businesses were alarmed that
the loss of the exchange would undercut the downtown renaissance
and spark the exodus of many financial companies.
</P>
<P>
   For four months, city officials negotiated with property owners
on a block bound by Broad and William Streets, between Beaver
Street and Exchange Place. The most difficult problem was at 25
Broad St., where a developer, Crescent Heights Investments, had
spent $100 million converting the vacant office building into 345
apartments _ a move the city encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   Crescent Heights president Bruce Menin said Friday that he had
been in negotiations with city officials but had not heard from
them recently.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, city officials suddenly resurrected the old
J.P. Morgan proposal, hoping to strike a less complicated deal with
J.P. Morgan, which has more than 2,500 employees in four buildings
on the block, and the Elghanayan family, which owns the apartment
house at 45 Wall Street. Real estate executives say that Morgan
believes it is imperative that the stock exchange remain in the
financial district.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the best interest of all of us to have a vibrant
downtown,'' said Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for J.P. Morgan.
``So we have an obligation to listen to all reasonable proposals.''

FAMOUS LIGHTHOUSE GETS FEDERAL MONEY FOR MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal budget agreement reached on Thursday includes a
grant of $9.8 million to the National Park Service for moving the
Cape Hatteras Lighthouse from the shoreline of North Carolina's
Outer Banks to a point 1,600 feet from the sea, Sen. Lauch
Faircloth of North Carolina announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service has maintained for years that the
spiral-striped landmark, the nation's tallest lighthouse, at 208
feet, is threatened by erosion from the encroaching sea. But the
move has been vigorously opposed by residents of the Outer Banks
who fear that the 128-year-old tower may crumble if engineers try
to lift it in one piece with hydraulic jacks and then move it into
the woods on rolling dollies. The opponents also contend that
moving the lighthouse will destroy its heritage and character,
diminishing its appeal as a tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed move became the subject of a political fight on
Capitol Hill between Faircloth, a Republican who supports the move,
and Rep. Walter Jones Jr., a Republican who represents the Outer
Banks and who favors leaving the lighthouse where it is. Jones
backed a less expensive plan to build up the beach in front of the
lighthouse by constructing a new steel jetty. Environmentalists
opposed that proposal as a violation of North Carolina's strict
rules against the artificial renourishment of the beach with
permanent structures.
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth said Friday that the budget agreement insured that
``this irreplaceable symbol of North Carolina will be preserved for
future generations to enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Hooper, a Buxton, N.C., motel owner who led a citizens
group opposing the move, said he was disappointed and would explore
legal options.
</P>
<P>
   Park Service officials said the move would be scheduled for the
spring.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The just-begun, $385 million Hollywood &AMP; Highland
project wrapping around Mann's Chinese Theatre promises to be a
showcase that will restore some of Hollywood Boulevard's tarnished
glitz and glory -- but tucked within the project's fabulous design
is some interesting technology whose effects should delight movie
buffs all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, project architect Vaughan Davies of Ehrenkrantz
Eckstut &AMP; Kuhn Architects said the new, broadcast-ready theater
that will house the Academy Awards will be a much better showcase
than such recent venues as the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and the
Shrine Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike those facilities, the 3,400-seat theater will be designed
for television production, with a basement beneath the seats so
cameras can be moved around quickly, then lifted up into position,
Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras will shoot from just above eye level for performers on
stage, the most flattering angle. And the sound-board area, or
technical pit, also rises from underneath in a position that won't
ruin the view of the seats around it, Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   On the complex's other side, a vast ``Babylon Court'' plaza
themed around D.W. Griffith's ``Intolerance'' will function as a
virtual outdoor theater, with terraced upper levels, each featuring
balconylike cupolas.
</P>
<P>
   And the huge arch at the plaza's northeast end will not only
frame the Hollywood sign in the distance but also hold aloft a
giant screen to show the awards for people without Oscar
invitations.
</P>
<P>
   Davies also said the complex's floors will be ``fabulous,''
using stone and special treatments that will complement the area's
cinematic history, though he declined to be more specific. But
count on something evocative of Busby Berkeley's almost abstract
visual designs in his famous 1930s Warner Bros. musicals.
</P>
<P>
   The project is already under way, with a shindig earlier this
month featuring Quincy Jones, Tevin Campbell and others. And
Hollywood activists, often skeptical of the projects coming into
the area, have given developer TrizecHahn high marks for being
cooperative and trying to protect the Chinese Theatre's special
place in Hollywood history.
</P>
<P>
   The WB Network hit ``Dawson's Creek'' has spawned so many fan
sites on the Internet, around 500 at last count, that Columbia
TriStar Interactive has come up with a nifty, if reality-bending,
new site of its own to entice the show's many ardent followers.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson's Desktop, at www.dawsonscreek.com, mimics what it would
be like if a fan were able to look over lead character Dawson
Leary's shoulder as he used his computer.
</P>
<P>
   Call it Web (ITAL)verite(END ITAL) or true-to-artificial-life,
but the mimicry can be a little unnerving in its accuracy. You can
paw through Dawson's favorite Web sites, his e-mail -- where
correspondents often end up appearing later in the show -- and in
his folder of word-processor documents.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson will even ``participate'' in simulated chat-room
discussions -- thanks to the participation of show writers -- that
will unscroll before a reader's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Fans also will be able to look at video clips from the
multimedia personal journal compiled by Dawson, a budding filmmaker
who worships Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a ``Virtual Capeside'' area, similar to what a
local Internet service provider might create in Dawson's hometown
for businesses and community organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Fans also will be able to homestead their own cyberplace in
Virtual Capeside, adding to the neighborhood. And virtual tours of
Dawson's high school and hometown are available through the site.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, distinguishing between the ``real'' virtual world
and Dawson's virtual virtual world becomes a little difficult.
That's intentional, the site's creators say.
</P>
<P>
   To help make the site more true to the Dawson character's life,
TriStar hired Web masters from a number of the best fan sites as
advisers. They debated details of the site that verged on the
metaphysical and ran to hundreds of pages of e-mail input.
</P>
<P>
   The work paid off. If you're a ``Dawson'' fan, this is one creek
worth paddling up.
</P>
<P>
   Einhander: This PlayStation side-scroller game from SquareSoft
is pretty cool. You pilot a gun-toting flivver against a mess of
bad guys and can pluck weapons from the flaming wreckage of your
defeated foes and generally fly into the face of doom, all in the
name of saving the moon city of Selene from those nasty Earthside
hegemonists. The back story is of bleak cyberpunk kamikazes whose
future is zero. Light fare for the suicidal fighter jockey in you.
Play on.
</P>
<P>
   Running Wild: An offbeat racing game featuring six funky 3-D
animals who run against each other over a series of obstacle
courses. You can beat up on the other guys, even slime them with a
mudball and use other forms of attack while generally having a
merry time running, jumping and jostling. Unlike most PlayStation
titles, this one is good for younger players who otherwise find
their fun on the Nintendo 64.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, it's not a game, but a gizmo for gamers. The
Microsoft Sidewinder Freestyle Pro game controller is a great
add-on to your PC, allowing you to use body English to steer.
Internal sensors figure out when you ``steer'' forward or back,
left or right. Use the D-pad to aim your weapons. Have a great
time. It comes bundled with a very good game, Motocross Madness,
all for about $75.

TriStar hired Web masters from a number of the best fan sites as
advisers. They debated details of the site that verged on the
metaphysical and ran to hundreds of pages of e-mail input.
</P>
<P>
   The work paid off. If you're a ``Dawson'' fan, this is one creek
worth paddling up.
</P>
<P>
   Einhander: This PlayStation side-scroller game from SquareSoft
is pretty cool. You pilot a gun-toting flivver against a mess of
bad guys and can pluck weapons from the flaming wreckage of your
defeated foes and generally fly into the face of doom, all in the
name of saving the moon city of Selene from those nasty Earthside
hegemonists. The back story is of bleak cyberpunk kamikazes whose
future is zero. Light fare for the suicidal fighter jockey in you.
Play on.
</P>
<P>
   Running Wild: An offbeat racing game featuring six funky 3-D
animals who run against each other over a series of obstacle
courses. You can beat up on the other guys, even slime them with a
mudball and use other forms of attack while generally having a
merry time running, jumping and jostling. Unlike most PlayStation
titles, this one is good for younger players who otherwise find
their fun on the Nintendo 64.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, it's not a game, but a gizmo for gamers. The
Microsoft Sidewinder Freestyle Pro game controller is a great
add-on to your PC, allowing you to use body English to steer.
Internal sensors figure out when you ``steer'' forward or back,
left or right. Use the D-pad to aim your weapons. Have a great
time. It comes bundled with a very good game, Motocross Madness,
all for about $75.

HOW THE YANKEES AND THE PADRES MATCH UP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif.)  (Eds: See also BBO-YANKEES, BBO-PADRES, BBO-RHODEN-COLUMN)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   YANKEES
</P>
<P>
   Pitching
</P>
<P>
   The starting pitching enabled the Yankees to advance past
Cleveland in the American League Championship Series. David Wells
is 7-1 in his career in the postseason and he should have an
additional edge against a Padres' lineup that is generally less
effective against left-handed pitching. Orlando Hernandez has four
terrific pitches, pitched seven shutout innings in the pivotal Game
4 of the ALCS and earned the start in Game 2 of this series. David
Cone should benefit from six days' worth of rest when he starts
Game 3, as well as being able to pitch in warm Southern California.
Mariano Rivera's stuff might be as good as it has been all year,
and Mike Stanton continues to be a dominant postseason pitcher.
Reasons for concern: the erratic Andy Pettitte, who needs a
home-plate umpire to call strikes on pitches low and away, and Jeff
Nelson, who lost his command in his last brief outing.
</P>
<P>
   Offense
</P>
<P>
   There were signs in the ALCS that the offense is coming out of
its collective slump _ Chuck Knoblauch is getting on base
consistently, Derek Jeter is back to driving the ball to right
field and through the middle, Bernie Williams had three hits in
Game 6, and Scott Brosius has been a consistent force at the bottom
of the lineup. But the Yankees do have holes: Chili Davis will be
hard-pressed to catch up to the fastballs of Kevin Brown and Andy
Ashby, and Tino Martinez's postseason funk is a problem. The
Yankees could use a contribution from Jorge Posada, who will start
in Games 1 and 2 and may get a chance to drive pitches low in the
strike zone, where he can hit with power.
</P>
<P>
   Defense
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have the best defense in baseball, excellent up the
middle with Jeter and Knoblauch, and at third with Brosius.
Nobody's really taken advantage of the fact that Williams has a
poor arm in center field, but rest assured that Ken Caminiti, Steve
Finley and Greg Vaughn will try. The Indians did expose the fact
that the Yankees' pitchers have trouble preventing baserunners from
stealing from second to third base.
</P>
<P>
   Baserunning
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees run well as they take extra bases, particularly Paul
O'Neill, Brosius, Jeter and Knoblauch going first-to-third;
Williams can make mistakes. The Yankees probably won't be able to
steal against Kevin Brown, who has an effective slide step, but
they could be aggressive against Andy Ashby, or the combination of
Sterling Hitchcock and Jim Leyritz.
</P>
<P>
   PADRES
</P>
<P>
   Hitting
</P>
<P>
   Except for Jim Leyritz, no one in the San Diego lineup is
particularly hot or particularly frightening at the moment. Tony
Gwynn hasn't been as consistent as he usually is, Ken Caminiti and
Greg Vaughn have been streaky. But the Padres are a veteran team
capable of putting the ball in play, getting runners on base and
then moving them along, and so long as they are getting exceptional
pitching, that's all they really need. Quilvio Veras, the leadoff
hitter, is adept at drawing walks and Steve Finley, who has become
more pull conscious in the last two years, could try to take aim at
the right field stands in Yankee Stadium. Vaughn's power could be a
factor if the Yankees' pitchers don't jam him enough to keep him
from leaning over the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown is the best pitcher in this series, capable of
winning three games if necessary, should Padres manager Bruce Bochy
choose to start him in Games 1, 4 and 7. But at some point, San
Diego will need a big outing from either Andy Ashby or Sterling
Hitchcock. When Ashby's right, he's hitting the corners with his
sinking fastball and his slider, and when his command is suspect,
he gets pounded. Hitchcock used his split-fingered fastball to
great effectiveness against right-handed batters in the first two
rounds of the playoffs, but the Yankees' left-handed hitters may
cause him some concern. San Diego's middle relief is the weakest
aspect of the team, with Randy Myers and Mark Langston from the
left side (the stuff of each has waned). But if a lead can be
delivered into the hands of closer Trevor Hoffman, he'll keep it.
</P>
<P>
   Defense
</P>
<P>
   They mostly catch the ball and avoid mistakes, though they are
unspectacular. Shortstop Chris Gomez and the second baseman Veras
are adept at turning double plays, and Caminiti won a Gold Glove at
third base last year; Wally Joyner has good hands at first; the
center fielder Steve Finley is extremely quick in tracking down
base hits and returning the ball to the infield. Tony Gwynn's range
is better toward the right field line, not nearly as good on balls
hit in the gaps. The Yankees will be able to run on the arm of
Vaughn in left field.
</P>
<P>
   Baserunning
</P>
<P>
   Veras can steal bases (24) this year, and Finley can in a tight
spot, as well. In general, however, the Padres are a slow, plodding
team, though Caminiti and Vaughn are good at going first-to-third,
and Gwynn won't make mistakes on the bases.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   PITCHING TO THE PADRES
</P>
<P>
   Quilvio Veras: A switch-hitter who has more power right-handed;
should try to pitch him down-and-in with breaking balls when he's
hitting right-handed, jam him with fastballs when he's batting
left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley: A left-handed hitter who likes to pull the ball.
Left-handers like David Wells can beat him with breaking balls low
and outside.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gwynn: When he's hot, he's impossible. When he's not
hitting well, he can be anxious early in the count, and he should
be fed breaking balls out of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Vaughn: Big-time power on anything high and over the plate.
Because he likes to pull the ball, you must pitch him on the outer
edge, occasionally jamming him to keep him honest.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Caminiti: More power right-handed, a better hitter
left-handed. These days, he's a good lowball hitter and can be beat
by fastballs up in the zone.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Joyner: With runners on base, he'll try to jump on a
fastball early in the count. Is not a strong hitter and can be
jammed.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gomez: Like Derek Jeter, likes to hit pitches inside out,
to right field and through the middle. He can hit with power if you
make a mistake with a breaking ball.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Rivera: An impatient hitter who will chase pitches out of
the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Hernandez: Looks for the first-pitch fastball in the
upper half of the strike zone. Can struggle against breaking balls.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyritz: No apparent holes right now, can hit fastballs in
and away. Best bet is to get ahead in the count and try to get him
to chase breaking balls.
</P>
<P>
   PITCHING TO THE YANKEES
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch: Hard throwers like to jam him with fastballs
because he stands on top of the plate, which is why he gets hit so
often.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter: Sometimes he has a tendency to chase pitches at his
feet, but if you don't get the ball in far enough, he can hammer
the ball over the wall in right.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill: The Yankees' best pure hitter, he sometimes will
chase fastballs up and away, particularly after there is one
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams: A switch-hitter who has trouble resisting
chest-high fastballs. When he lays off them, he is a much better
hitter, and he did this in the last game of the Cleveland series.
</P>
<P>
   Chili Davis: Has a great eye and will work a pitcher deep into a
count, but he can be overpowered with fastballs above his belt.
Cheats some now to get his bat started, making him vulnerable to
off-speed pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez: Nothing seems right at the moment. Is anxious and
chases pitches out of the strike zone when he falls behind in the
count, and isn't taking advantage of mistakes when they're made.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius: A great breaking ball hitter, but he can also
drive a fastball a long way when he anticipates, as Cleveland's
Charles Nagy now knows.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada: When batting left-handed, he fares very poorly
against splitters, curveballs and sliders.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee: Like all young hitters, he has a tendency to expand
the strike zone and chase pitches out of the strike zone after
falling behind in the count. Kevin Brown likely will attack him
aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY'S PITCHERS
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown: Best sinking fastball in the game (91-93) mph, a
four-seam fastball of 95-97 mph to throw high in the strike zone, a
slider that breaks down and away from right-handed batters, and a
forkball that dives at 88-89 mph. Holds runners well.
</P>
<P>
   David Wells: Aggressive, aggressive, aggressive, challenging
hitters with fastballs. His curveball can be exceptional, and his
changeup has improved. Throw strikes: Allowed as many home runs
(29) as walks (29), but has not allowed a three-run homer or a
grand slam all year.

VALLONE CRITICIZES PATAKI FOR VETOING BILLS TO FUND CHILD CARE

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Surrounded by child care advocates, parents and
children assembled for his news conference, Peter Vallone
criticized Gov. George Pataki on Friday for vetoing funds in the
budget for child care, and said his record showed that he would do
a better job of serving the interests of young children and working
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, speaker of the New York City Council, said the governor
had used his line-item veto to eliminate $27 million in low-income
day care subsidies from this year's budget, and also vetoed $25
million that the Legislature had added to the budget for the
construction of new day-care facilities. By doing so, Vallone said,
the governor had deprived the city of even more money for day care
in the form of federal and local matching grants.
</P>
<P>
   As he has on many other issues, Vallone called for the governor
to debate him on child care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be talking about this across the table, face to
face, talking about what human effect does it have when we veto
certain programs and we fund other programs,'' Vallone said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Conway, a spokesman for Pataki's budget office, said the
governor had vetoed the items because they represented ``an
unconstitutional redirection'' of money by the Legislature away
from other important programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially this was a shell game that was being played with
the money,'' Conway said. ``This was not new money. They were just
moving it around.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone said he would pay for additional child care mainly with
money from a special fund controlled by the governor and
legislative leaders. That money, which he said totaled about $600
million, goes to a variety of often politically popular projects
throughout the state. Critics call it pork barrel spending.
</P>
<P>
   Since Pataki took office, Conway said, the state's spending on
day care increased to $456 million from $269 million, and the
number of positions for children in state-financed day care
increased by approximately 50,000. ``In the past two years, we have
witnessed the largest increase in child care funding in the history
of New York state,'' he said.

A STEP UP, OR IS IT TWO BACK?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If this is progress, the NBA season is in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   NBA owners agreed in principle Friday to the players' proposal
for a tax system to slow salary growth _ at first glance, a
positive step toward resolution of a 3{-month-old labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   But the players association immediately rejected the owners'
version of the tax system, calling it worse than previous league
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   As the standoff completed its 108th day, the two sides appeared
as far apart as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears at a quick glance to be a step backward... more
onerous than the proposal we received from them Sept. 24,'' Billy
Hunter, director of the players' association, said of the NBA's
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, the union proposed for the first time a tax
system on player contracts. The union's version was a ``luxury'' or
``superstar'' tax, applying only to players making $18 million or
more annually. The tax would be paid by owners as a penalty on
lucrative deals, and the revenue would be redistributed among
cash-strapped teams.
</P>
<P>
   While agreeing to a tax system, the league offered a far
different approach: a tax on every contract signed under the
``Larry Bird exception'' that exceeds the average salary, $2.6
million this past season. The Bird exception allows teams to
re-sign free agents at any price, without regard to the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Because the tax would apply only to contracts signed under the
Bird clause, the NBA said only 15 percent of player contracts would
be taxed.
</P>
<P>
   NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik said owners would try the
tax system on a two-year trial basis, with the proviso that if
salaries continued to escalate, the league would impose its
long-desired hard salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are willing to try it the union's way, but they have to
agree that if it doesn't work, we then have to try it our way,''
Granik said.
</P>
<P>
   The league called the union's proposal unacceptable, as only two
contracts this past season would have exceeded the $18 million
mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the union's other proposals, it would have increased _
not decreased _ the percentage of league revenue paid to the
players,'' Granik said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the union said the owners' proposal is as bad or worse
than previous calls for a hard salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Though the league said its tax plan would apply to only 15
percent of player contracts, Hunter said it would affect all
contracts and cause 90 to 95 percent of the players to accept the
league minimum salary, currently $272,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be disguised in terms of a tax, but it is in fact a
hard cap,'' Hunter said. ``Our intent was to address the concern of
the superstar contracts, like the Kevin Garnett contract that
everyone points to. The tax they've come back with impacts the
entire system.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a break in the impasse might still come down to an
arbitrator's ruling due Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Arbitrator John Feerick will be releasing his decision on the
union's contention that 220 players with guaranteed contracts must
be paid during the lockout. The players hope a ruling in their
favor would end the lockout, but the league would appeal such a
ruling in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The league already canceled the first two weeks of the season
and more cancellations will follow if the lockout doesn't end soon.

VETERINARIAN'S ARREST PUTS FOCUS ON ASSISTED SUICIDE FOR TERMINALLY
ILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He was a man with advanced AIDS. His pain was
unbearable and constant, lucidity a luxury that floated into each
day with less and less frequency. His life finally ended at home
when he succumbed to large doses of painkillers and tranquilizers
prescribed by his doctor, who knew what their effect would be.
</P>
<P>
   She was a woman with terminal breast cancer. She had stopped
eating and going to the bathroom, and lived in total misery. Her
life ended, police say, when a close friend, a veterinarian,
injected her with drugs at her request while she lay listless in a
hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   The two cases _ the first a few years ago, the second at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in summer 1997 _ appear
similar. Both could be counted among the usually secretive cases of
physician-assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Cara Beigel, the woman with breast cancer, came to
public attention this week when the authorities charged the friend
who assisted her, Marco Zancope, with second-degree manslaughter.
But most cases of friend- and physician-assisted suicide go
undetected _ wrenching, private pacts between two people,
infrequently revealed to others and hardly ever prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Such acts still remain fairly unusual, and there is heated legal
and ethical debate about what role, if any, doctors should play in
the ending of life, and what constitutes ``physician-assisted
suicide'' in the first place. Does it occur only when a doctor
provides a requested prescription for lethal drugs? Or when a
doctor significantly increases a terminally ill patient's dose of
morphine in the name of killing pain, knowing it could bring on a
longed-for death?
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians tend not to talk about this among even
themselves,'' said Dr. Nicholas Christakis, an assistant professor
of medicine and sociology at the University of Chicago and an
expert in end-of-life care.
</P>
<P>
   Although the case history of assisted suicide is mostly
undocumented, experts say the death of the man with AIDS is the
more usual: a dying patient, at home, receives a lethal dose of
painkillers, including morphine, prescribed by a doctor, who also
ends any life-sustaining treatments, and the death is attributed to
the disease. Neither the medical community nor the legal
authorities become involved, even though technically a crime may
well have been committed: a doctor aided a patient in ending his
life.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Ms. Beigel, experts said, is unusual, both in the
way it was carried out and in the arrest of the man who confessed
to giving her a lethal dose of barbiturates.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan-Kettering officials say Ms. Beigel's death was not
imminent, and was hastened with injected drugs, which tend to be
used only in the last days or hours of life. Experts said that a
person in her situation would be more likely to use orally
administered drugs, at home, away from hospital doctors, nurses and
rules. Even more unusual, they said, was that in Ms. Beigel's case
the drugs were administered not by an attending physician, but by a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that is so unique is that the friend has access to
drugs, which is very rare,'' said Dr. Diane Meier, the director of
the palliative care program at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine
and an expert in end-of-life care.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it was unusual in that the case attracted the attention
of the Manhattan district attorney's office, only the second time
in memory the authorities said such a case was pursued by the law.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Meier reasoned that it was Sloan-Kettering's investigation
that brought the case to light. ``Whereas if this had been done at
home, it would not have come to anyone's attention,'' she said.
``And I think it raises the issue of what we can do as a profession
and society to keep people from getting to the point of believing
that the only way to end suffering is to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beigel, 33, whom investigators say sought out her friend
Zancope for help in ending her life, was found dead in her hospital
bed shortly after a visit from friends in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicious because she died sooner than expected and so shortly
after a visit from her family, hospital officials got in touch with
the Medical Examiner's office, which summoned police. Tuesday,
police said, Zancope, who ran the Animal Clinic of New York on
Manhattan's Upper East Side, confessed to assisting Ms. Beigel in
her death. He awaits a grand jury hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But law enforcement officials said juries are loath to indict
people accused of assisting in the suicide of a terminally ill
person, often because they are sympathetic with the person who did
so and believe that the act was merciful. Further complicating a
prosecutor's ability to gather evidence is that family members, who
are often complicit in the act, rarely press charges.
</P>
<P>
   A New York state court decision briefly granted the right to
physician-assisted suicide, but it was overturned last year by the
U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that there was no constitutional
right to assisted suicide. At present, Oregon is the only state
with legal doctor-assisted suicide, and its law is highly
restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for assisted suicide laws contend that, though
mostly hidden, the practice already occurs regularly in various
forms, and will become more frequent as the population ages. The
need is growing, these advocates say, because doctors do not focus
enough on palliative care, treatment that eases pain and suffering
at the end of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens all the time undercover,'' said Don Blake, a
spokesman for the Hemlock Society, the right-to-die group. ``More
and more people are saying this is an option that we should be open
to, even though we know only a small percentage will avail
themselves of this.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The most comprehensive study of physician-assisted suicide,
whose lead author was Dr. Meier, found that fewer than 3 percent of
doctors who were asked for medicine to end a patient's life agreed
to do so, and only 5 percent said they had administered lethal
injections to patients on their deathbeds.
</P>
<P>
   But many doctors and patient advocates say there are other
methods that are not usually regarded as assisted suicide, but that
doctors may use to hasten the end of life: for example, an increase
in morphine, routinely used to kill pain, to an amount that causes
breathing to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Active euthanasia is relatively uncommon,'' Christakis said.
``But the average internist has withdrawn or withheld life support
17 times in the last year. Or in many instances, you stop the pain
or induce sleep and then the patient dies, but since that was not
the intention, it is deemed more permissible. I think that there
are lots of shades of gray here.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are doctors willing to do more, and the stories of
their patients tend to have similar themes: the patients have less
than six months to live, they have decided they would have less
pain or more dignity if they controlled their own deaths, and they
have persuaded a doctor to help after long and difficult
discussions that usually involve other family members.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor has usually treated the patient for some time, and
the deaths, unlike those paraded by Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the
Michigan doctor who has made a career of assisted suicide, tend to
pass without note.
</P>
<P>
   In a small town in Oregon, a man with brain cancer has a small
vial of barbiturates. He got them recently from his doctor, said
George Eighmey, the executive director for Compassion in Dying of
Oregon, the state chapter of a national organization committed to
helping mentally competent terminally ill patients who want to end
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The man, 47, an accomplished violinist, artisan and father of
two, is deteriorating rapidly. His doctor, who refused to be
identified, agreed to provide him with the lethal dose. ``He is
making his decision when to take them,'' Eighmey said. ``He said he
is so relieved to know the pills are there and he can take them
when he can. He doesn't want to subject his family or himself to
the last indignities of incontinence, inability to move, think or
speak.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in a state where such assistance is legal, doctors are
rarely willing to let anyone know they have helped to end a life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who has done it knows it is a tremendous decision that
you carry with you forever,'' said Dr. Howard Grossman, a Manhattan
internist who was a plaintiff in the unsuccessful New York lawsuit
challenging the laws against assisted suicide. ``And under the
current circumstances, there is no one to talk to about it, there
is no support. You can't tell anyone, because it is illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossman, who said he assisted the man dying of AIDS, said his
actions in that case were legal because he simply stopped giving
the patient his regular medication and increased his morphine and
other painkillers. But whether an assisted death falls within legal
parameters or not presents ``no ethical difference for me,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I have to sit there,'' he said, ``and think, `Is this
the end or is it not the end?' It is a very grave decision. I feel
very responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Even strong opponents of assisted suicide say its practice sheds
light, and may provoke action, on the problems of pain management.
Studies show that many patients seek a hastened death because they
are in terrible pain or discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``What seems to have been helpful in this debate is the active
public discussion about how people die,'' said Dr. Ira Byock, the
author of ``Dying Well'' (Putnam Riverhead, 1997) and a past
president of the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides agree that many people die badly,'' he said.
``While care has improved, it is hardly adequate still. I mean, it
is harder to get into a hospice program in Oregon if you have
emphysema than it is to qualify for assisted suicide. So it is not
a mystery as to why people feel miserable and want to kill
themselves.''

MAN CONVICTED IN NYC'S SECOND RECENT DEATH PENALTY TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In this city's second death penalty trial since the
state revived capital punishment three years ago, a Brooklyn man
was convicted of first-degree murder Friday by a jury that will now
decide whether to sentence him to death for killing another man
while robbing him of his jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   The jury in state Supreme Court in Brooklyn found that Jermaine
Page, a 24-year-old ex-convict, fired the shots that killed Marvin
McIntosh, 28, in a 1996 street robbery near Page's home in East New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The jury rejected the defense argument that the fatal bullets
had been fired by a teen-ager whom the prosecution described as a
second gunman on the three-person robbery team. The teen-ager faces
trial on a charge of second-degree murder, which is not punishable
by death.
</P>
<P>
   If the jury decides to sentence Page to be executed by lethal
injection, rather than to life in prison without the possibility of
parole, when it convenes Oct. 27 for the penalty phase of the
trial, Page will join the only other convicted murderer to receive
a death sentence under the 1995 law that restored capital
punishment in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the other man, Darrel Harris, was sentenced to death in
the same Brooklyn courthouse, after a jury in the state's first
trial under the law convicted him of first-degree murder for
killing three people in a robbery at an illegal social club.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another trial under the statute, a jury in Buffalo began
hearing testimony Friday on whether to impose a death sentence on
Jonathan Parker, whom the panel last week convicted of first-degree
murder for shooting a police officer to death last year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the verdict was announced in Page's monthlong trial, the
defendant, a man with closely cropped hair and a slight goatee,
bent his head downward and shook it from side to side as he stood
at the defense table.
</P>
<P>
   In its 12 hours of deliberations during three days, the jury
rejected an alternative charge of second-degree murder, which is
punishable by a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
That charge simply accused Page of being part of a team of robbers
who killed McIntosh, an employee of a private mail service who
lived on Staten Island, without specifying who fired the fatal
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very sad young man,'' one of Page's lawyers, Steven
Chaikin, said of his client after speaking with him after the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Chaikin declined to comment on the jury's action, although he
and Page's other lawyer, Gary Villanueva, are expected to ask
Justice L. Priscilla Hall next week to set aside the jury verdict
as not warranted by the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Chaikin also declined to say what the defense would argue,
should the judge sustain the verdict, to try to persuade the jury
that mitigating factors dictated that Page should be sentenced to
life in prison rather than execution.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, mitigating factors include circumstances like the
defendant's having been mentally or emotionally disturbed or under
the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the murder.
</P>
<P>
   None of the testimony at the trial so far has indicated any such
condition, but that does not preclude the introduction of evidence
during the penalty phase.
</P>
<P>
   One of the prosecutors, Joseph Alexis, an assistant district
attorney, said after the verdict, ``There is no joy or happiness
that anybody can derive from this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One young man has already lost his life and another young man
is going to begin the penalty phase with his life on the line, in
an absolutely senseless but brutal murder,'' Alexis said. ``But the
jury weighed the evidence very seriously and came back with a
verdict that they thought was just and that I think is just.''
</P>
<P>
   McIntosh's grandmother, Martha Reese, who had reared the victim
from age 2, said she was glad of the first-degree murder conviction
and believed Page should be sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son is gone,'' she said. ``He could have robbed him but he
didn't have to take his life.''
</P>
<P>
   But a sister of the victim, Jezebel McIntosh, said of the
sentence, ``The Creator runs the show and the Creator will make
that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Page's relatives would not talk to reporters as they left the
courtroom. His wife, Onika, wept in the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Hall reminded the 12 jurors that they could not discuss
their decision publicly because the trial was not over, given the
jury's role in sentencing the person it convicts of first-degree
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that McIntosh was slain on the night of May 22,
1996, while standing in front of a girlfriend's home in East New
York, Brooklyn. They said he was wearing a gold chain and a large
gold pendant shaped like a bulldog's head, with rubies for eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that Page and two others approached him to
steal the jewelry _ which had cost McIntosh $1,000 _ and that when
he began struggling, Page and the teen-ager, Darryl Gilmore, then
15, shot him. Gilmore has pleaded not guilty to second-degree
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis told the jurors that Page ``wasn't satisfied'' with
having earlier won money from McIntosh in a dice game but also
wanted ``to put that pendant around his neck and call it his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from maintaining that Gilmore had fired the fatal shots,
Chaikin and Villanueva argued that the encounter was a dispute over
the dice game but not a robbery. Both sides presented witnesses to
back their versions.
</P>
<P>
   Both Page and McIntosh had criminal records.
</P>
<P>
   Page had been released on parole just six weeks before the
killing after having serving two and a half years in prison for
attempted assault stemming from a shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Another prosecutor, Barry Schreiber, told the jury that the
killing was an execution, perhaps hinting at why Brooklyn District
Attorney Charles Hynes decided to seek the death penalty for Page.

Gortari, who is accused in connection with the 1994 assassination
of a prominent politician. In a 1200-page legal brief, the
prosecution charged that Raul Salinas ordered a hired gunman to
kill Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, a former state governor, because
of political rivalries between them. If convicted, Salinas faces a
maximum sentence of 50 years in prison. His defense lawyer, Eduardo
Luengo Creel, said prosecutors have not offered any material
evidence linking Salinas to the crime. He has been held in a
solitary cell in a maximum security penitentiary since February
1995.

COMMENTARY: BEHIND FOSTER MOTHER'S FIGHT, A BOND AS THICK AS
BLOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sylvia Rodriguez and her son Andrew recently went
shopping at the Kmart near Co-op City in the Bronx. The place is
huge and Andrew is young, so it was only a matter of time and
nature before the 8-year-old wandered off to explore the aisles
that beckoned with toys. His mother cried as she scoured the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so scared that I asked three managers to call out for
him on the microphone,'' Ms. Rodriguez said. ``Soon, he was by my
side again. And there I was, swallowing my tears. I did not feel
embarrassed. I was crying for something that was mine.''
</P>
<P>
   She has withstood greater pain to keep what's hers. In 1994, she
spent nearly four months without the boy _ a foster child she was
preparing to adopt _ when his foster care agency and the city
removed him from her Morris Heights apartment while investigating
allegations of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rodriguez had not been home when a caseworker found Andrew
and another foster child being looked after by her 12-year-old
grandson. During much of their time apart, Ms. Rodriguez could not
contest the removal or even visit Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was returned when officials found no basis for the
allegations. Last month, a federal judge presiding over a lawsuit
stemming from Andrew's removal ruled that some foster parents have
the same rights as birth parents to promptly contest a child's
removal.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was hailed by foster parent advocates who had been
stymied since 1977 in their pursuit of equal rights for families
who are bound by love but not blood. Ms. Rodriguez, a thin
70-year-old who raised six of her own children before becoming a
foster mother for another six, shares her victory with the
thousands of others like her who have felt shortchanged by the
child care system.
</P>
<P>
   ``These other women have been given the right to fight and say,
`Don't fool us anymore,''' she said. ``I don't have much time. I
won't see it. But others will see it. Others will see this was
done. That this simple woman did this.''
</P>
<P>
   Life as a foster parent was hardly simple. While caring for
other people's children, she was caught in an endless routine of
taking them to doctors, psychologists, caseworkers and visits with
their birth parents. Some children arrived as infants; others were
teen-agers who had grown unruly after shuttling from home to home.
Money was tight and patience was tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I felt proud,'' she said. ``I was giving love to a child
who was not mine. And never, put it down, never did any of my
foster children have to go to a hospital emergency room. For
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Difficult as it was, she also had to accept when a child would
be reunited with birth parents. That would not happen with Andrew,
since a court had taken him away from them. He came to her as an
infant in 1990 from Cardinal McCloskey Children's and Family
Services, a foster care agency that had given Ms. Rodriguez good
evaluations as a foster parent. She soon knew she would adopt him.
She was devastated when he was removed from her home in March 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was something I could not endure,'' she recalled. ``I
have grown children. I have family. I love them, but not like
Andrew. He is alone. He only has me.''
</P>
<P>
   The strength of those emotional bonds was a point her lawyers
pursued in their lawsuit against the foster care agency and the
city. The trial is scheduled for early November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sylvia is the only mother this child had,'' said Howard Seife,
a lawyer with Chadbourne &AMP; Parke, which is handling the case pro
bono. ``She had the kid from when he was 13 days old, and without a
second thought they were separated and refused visitation until
after 4 months we finally forced them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rodriguez can barely speak about the days she went without
food or sleep when Andrew was away. She cries and waves off
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard,'' she said. ``That will always be in my mind
until I die.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be sooner than she imagined. She has a liver tumor, and
she needs an operation. Without a transplant, doctors have told her
there is little they can do. Her lawyers hope that the lawsuit can
help her provide for herself, Andrew and two other children who
still live with her. She prefers not to talk about money, since she
never had much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you about Andrew,'' she insisted. ``I am already
taking steps in case I die. He'll be with whatever person cares for
him the most. That's if I die. It's only a saying. Who knows? I
just want to give whatever time I have left to this little boy.''

RANGERS LOSE 4TH STRAIGHT TO DEVILS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For Rangers coach John Muckler, it was time to pass
out praise and stress the positive. He spoke of how young Todd
Harvey was the ``heartbeat of the team'' with almost 17 energetic
minutes at center. Then there was the impressive play of the rookie
goalie, Dan Cloutier, who stopped 28 Devils shots Friday night in
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   And who could overlook the encouraging debut of Mathieu
Schneider, the defenseman acquired in a trade from Toronto? Muckler
called Schneider a great improvement of his roster, in place of
Aleksandr Karpovtsev. All this is not to ignore the fine play of
the first line of Niklas Sundstrom, Wayne Gretzky and Aleksei
Kovalev. They produced one goal and put 11 shots on Devils goalie
Martin Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' Muckler said. ``We're standing here talking
about all the guys who played well and we didn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   No, they lost by 2-1 to the Devils, their fourth defeat in four
games, their worst start since 1959. Their worst start before that
was 0-11, in 1943. The Rangers have scored only four goals in four
games, and they went 0 for 7 Friday night on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' Patrik Elias scored the game-winner, at 10 minutes
53 seconds of the third period, when he knocked in a rebound past a
sprawling Cloutier after the Devils had controlled a face-off in
the Rangers' zone.
</P>
<P>
   But the play that hurt the most came in the first minute, the
first shot of the game, when Bobby Holik gave the Devils a 1-0 lead
after stripping the puck from Brian Leetch as Leetch tried to skate
out of his own zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Brian Leetch was surprised,'' Holik said. ``I jumped
him.''
</P>
<P>
   After Holik knocked the puck off Leetch's stick, Dave Andreychuk
recovered it, then passed to Holik, who had lots of net at which to
aim at the 22-second mark because Cloutier had shifted toward the
loose puck. Leetch blamed himself, saying that the first thing a
young defenseman learns is not to go in front of his own net unless
he is sure that it is a safe play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unexcusable to do that on the first shift of the game,''
Leetch said.
</P>
<P>
   The goal broke a 26-game slump for Holik, which included five
games in last spring's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Sundstrom scored the only Ranger goal, on the rush, at 6:09 of
the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Sundstrom had a chance to give his team the lead in the third on
a breakaway while short-handed and the score tied. But Brodeur, who
had 24 saves, stopped his forehand wrist shot from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the Devils a 1-2 record under Robbie Ftorek,
their new coach. It was a scrappy, energetic affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always nice to get it on the road, especially in the
Garden,'' Holik said. ``These two teams will not let the fans
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey was playing his second game of the season after having
missed the previous two with a hip injury. He joined the Rangers
late last season in the trade with Dallas that sent Brian Skrudland
and Mike Keane to the Stars. Harvey centered a line with Adam
Graves on the left and Mike Knuble on the right, and they
forechecked hard in the Devils' zone.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the game, Harvey angered the Devils by bumping into
Brodeur. Several Devils tried to avenge this. One was defenseman
Sheldon Souray, who took a roughing penalty early in the second
period. Later, during a Rangers power play, Devils defenseman Ken
Daneyko jousted with Harvey in the slot in front of Brodeur after
Harvey again made contact with the goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the second period, Harvey created another power
play for the Rangers when Andreychuk punched him, snapping his head
back in exaggerated motion. The Devils had only two power plays.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Harvey was explaining his style: ``Sometimes I
bring it upon myself. That's the way I play. If the other team's
mad at me, maybe I'm doing my job.'' But he was interrupted by the
gruff voice of Muckler, on the way to the bus to go to the airport
to go to Pittsburgh for Saturday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd,'' Muckler said, ending the interview. ``We've got a game
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, they headed down the corridor and out into the night,
a short flight and a long season ahead.

LAPERRIERE IS WORRIED

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ A week ago at this time, Ian Laperriere was
about to start a new hockey season. Now he's wondering when or if
he'll play again in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   Laperriere, the Kings' scrappy 24-year-old checking center, is
in the middle of a difficult stretch of uncertainty stemming from
the partially torn anterior cruciate ligament he suffered in his
left knee during the second period of Monday's loss in Vancouver.
</P>

   Sometime soon, he will try to skate, to see if he can play with
the injury and avoid surgery. If he can't, the alternative is grim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary,'' Laperriere said. ``Hockey's all my life.
Hopefully everything is going to work out for me. They don't know
yet if I'll need surgery. Hopefully I won't because you never know
what's going to come out if they go inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Laperriere said he's been told by doctors that if he needs
surgery, the most optimistic projection for a return to the lineup
would be February or March. The pessimistic view would have him
missing the entire year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine myself watching every game on TV,'' said
Laperriere, injured in a collision with a Canucks player. ``I just
want to play. It would be pretty tough for me to sit out all
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Laperriere's rambunctious style on the ice and his smallish
stature make him vulnerable to injuries. Before this season, his
fourth in the NHL, he'd missed 10 games because of three
concussions, three games with a hip-flexor injury and 15 with a
shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   He is listed at 6-foot-1, 197 pounds but admits he's probably
more like 5-11. The listed height, he said, came about when he was
a rookie in St. Louis and the Blues wanted to embellish his
dimensions because they wanted their team to seem bigger. But even
though he isn't very big, Laperriere said injuries won't stop him
from trying to play as if he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't change my game,'' he said. ``That's the way I play.
Sometimes I don't protect myself. I can't change the way I play. If
I change that, I won't be in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Cashing in: &UR; !off! &LR;  Kings coach Larry Robinson said
players will continue to be hit with fines for taking penalties he
deems undisciplined or unnecessary. Such penalties plagued the
Kings last season and were a problem in the Vancouver loss.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said one player objected to his fine because the Kings
scored a goal while he was serving his penalty. Robinson responded
by asking the player whether the fine should have been doubled if
the Kings had allowed a goal while shorthanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``That protest was set aside very quickly,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings will donate last year's fine pool to a charity,
Robinson said, adding that the likely recipient is the Michael Jund
Memorial Scholarship Fund. Jund was a 22-year-old member of the
Kings' media-relations staff when he died of heart failure in May.
</P>
<P>
   __ Loose pucks: Rookie wing Josh Green changed his number from
47 to 21.... It was the Kings' first of 20 regular-season games
with two referees: Bill McCreary and Kevin Maguire.... The Kings
were 15-11-5 in home openers before Friday's game and had won their
previous three home openers. They were 29-74-10 all-time against
the Bruins.

CATS HOPE TO SOLVE THEIR IDENTITY CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORVALLIS, Ore. _ Arizona, a two-quarterback team all season, is
seeking to mend a fractured identity.
</P>
<P>
   Within one quarter eight days ago, the Wildcats went from
contender to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   For 51 minutes, they challenged UCLA, now ranked No. 2 and in
the hunt for a national title. But for the final nine, they were a
team in disarray. It was a full and stunning retreat in front of a
Bruins blitz that left the Wildcats with a 52-28 loss.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been one thing if the timing had been reversed. An
early struggle and late comeback might have provided some
consolation for the Wildcats. Then, they could have used the end to
a tough loss as the initial step in renewal.
</P>
<P>
   But, now, the No. 16 Wildcats (5-1, 2-1 Pac-10) enter today's 1
p.m. game at Oregon State (4-2, 1-2) amid uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Was Arizona's last fourth quarter the signal of an imminent
decline, or just a temporary flaw against a superior team? Who are
these guys?
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dick Tomey isn't expecting easy answers today against an
improved program that hasn't been a winner since Nixon was in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably appreciate winning more than anybody in the
league right now,'' Tomey said of the Beavers, who posted their
last winning record in 1970. ``It will be very hard to take the
game away from them for that reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomey expressed no illusions about either Arizona's all-time
record of 18-2-1 against the Beavers or its status today as the
favorite. He believes his Wildcats will have to be better than they
were at their best two weeks ago in a wild, 31-28 victory at
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are more dangerous than Washington,'' said Tomey, who
argued that the Beavers are more tenacious than the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   The only comparison point be tween the two is Stanford. The
Beavers won at Stanford last week, 30-23. The Wildcats beat the
host Cardinal, 31-14, in their second game on Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   As a guide, the respective Stanford games would appear to favor
the Wildcats. But their rocky fourth quarter last week and signs of
an improving Oregon State create a possible crossroads for both
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're coming in here thinking it's the same Oregon State,''
said Beavers defensive end Inoke Breckterfield, who was a Honolulu
prep rival of several Hawaiian players on the Arizona roster. ``But
they don't know. It's our homecoming, so it's going to be totally
different than we played down there for their homecoming (a 27-7
Wildcats' victory last year).
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take it to them. If they come half-stepping, they'll
leave losers.''
</P>
<P>
   If Arizona can't add several steps to its running game, defeat
is a distinct possibility. Ninety rushing yards against UCLA
resulted in a one-dimensional, flawed attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything revolves around a good running game,'' said
quarterback Keith Smith, who probably will continue to share time
with Ortege Jenkins. ``We've got to get that going.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, perhaps, there have been some questions whether the
Jenkins-Smith rotation was a factor in the loss to UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Receivers Jeremy McDaniel and Dennis Northcutt are threats
regardless of whether the quarterback is Jenkins or Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toss either of those guys a 3-yard pass and they can turn it
into a 60-yarder at any time,'' Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been growing inconsistency in the running game, a
duty shared by Kelvin Eafon and Trung Canidate, a junior from
Central High.
</P>
<P>
   Different handoffs from different quarterbacks? Different
blocking schemes? The two faces of Arizona? Today's game at Oregon
State might provide a single answer. &QL;

NBA OWNERS MAKE COUNTEROFFER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NBA's owners and players may finally have found some common
ground in their effort to break a labor impasse that already has
cost the first two weeks of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the players union made a surprise proposal that
would use a ``luxury tax'' to prevent the escalation of player
salaries, the owners made a counterproposal Friday that accepts the
notion of such a tax.
</P>
<P>
   The tax would leave the Larry Bird exception to the NBA salary
cap in effect, thereby avoiding a ``hard'' salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   That exception allows clubs to re-sign their own free agents for
any amount without regard to cap limits.
</P>
<P>
   The tax plan, however, would charge what amounts to a cash
penalty to owners who exceed the salary cap to sign a player under
the Bird exception.
</P>
<P>
   And the owners are insisting on a provision that would place a
hard salary cap in effect if the percentage of league revenues
being paid to players exceeds an agreed-upon amount after the first
two years of the new contract.
</P>
<P>
   However, a significant gulf exists between the tax plan proposed
by the union and the one offered by the owners.
</P>
<P>
   The union plan called for a luxury tax on salaries of more than
$18 million. Last season, out of about 400 players, only Michael
Jordan's $33 million deal and the $19 million of New York Knicks
center _ and union president _ Patrick Ewing, would have been
subject to the tax.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement released by the NBA, the owners'
proposal would tax any contract signed under the Bird exception for
more than the average salary _ $2.6 million last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We analyzed it every which way, and like the union's other
proposals, it would have increased _ not decreased _ the percentage
of league revenue paid to the players,'' said Russ Granik, league
deputy commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, in the spirit of compromise, we have attempted to
fashion a system that uses a tax, instead of a hard cap, even
though we're skeptical about the ability of any tax system to keep
player salaries at a set percentage of league revenue. We are
willing to try it the union's way, but they have to agree that if
it doesn't work, we then have to try it our way.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the league, the new tax would impact about 15
percent of future contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But with more than 190 free agents this summer, the union is
likely to argue that the league's projection is far too low.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA, also in the announcement, said the proposal guaranteed
that player compensation will rise by at least 20 percent over the
next four years and that the average player salary will reach at
least $3.1 million by the 2001-02 season.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is about $2 billion in annual league revenue. The
players and league wound up in their current fix after owners
exercised an out-clause in the last collective bargaining agreement
which allowed owners to re-open the contract if player salaries ate
up more than 51.8-percent of basketball-related revenue. According
to owners, player salaries accounted for 57 percent of that revenue
last season.
</P>
<P>
   The owners, hoping to roll back salaries to 48 percent, locked
out the players July 1.
</P>
<P>
   And while both sides have exchanged proposals in recent days,
they also still were waiting for an arbitration ruling by Fordham
law school dean John Feerick.
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to decide by Sunday whether the league must pay
those players with guaranteed contracts _ about 220 _ during the
lockout. Players, who have an Oct. 22 meeting planned in Las Vegas,
are scheduled to begin receiving paychecks Nov. 15. &QL;

N.Y. STATE SUES BROKERS ACCUSED OF SCALPING YANKEES TICKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: also sent in category `a') 
(bl) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ State officials, saying they are intensifying efforts
to crack down on ticket scalping as the World Series gets under
way, filed suit Friday against two brokers for selling tickets to
the playoff games between the Yankees and the Cleveland Indians at
about twice their face value.
</P>
<P>
   And in another move to counter scalpers, the city's Department
of Consumer Affairs said Friday that it had impounded a car
belonging to another broker after the driver offered an undercover
agent two $60 tickets to Game 6 of the playoffs for $275.
</P>
<P>
   During the past two weeks, New York City Police patrolling
outside the stadium have arrested 242 people for buying or selling
tickets at inflated prices, said Inspector Edward Delatorre. Three
were arrested on Thursday after they waited 30 hours to buy World
Series tickets and then tried to resell them to undercover
officers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   New York state law prohibits the resale of tickets to
entertainment and sports events for more than face value plus 10
percent of that price, or $5, whichever is greater.
</P>
<P>
   The resale of tickets is also banned within 1,000 feet of Yankee
Stadium. Inspector Delatorre said many sellers are skirting that
restriction by walking as far as 10 blocks from the ballfield to
make their sales.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuits filed Friday, the state attorney general's
office is seeking to force two companies, 2 on the Aisle, of
Manhattan, and Rave Reviews, of Easton, Pa., to refund the amount
their customers were overcharged. But David Corvette, a spokesman
for Attorney General Dennis Vacco, said that investigators did not
know how many scalped tickets the companies had sold.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Silver, the president of 2 on the Aisle, who was named in
the lawsuit, declined to comment. At Rave Reviews, an executive who
would not identify himself said, ``It's old news.'' He would not
comment further.
</P>
<P>
   The car impounded by the city belongs to a third company, All
Events Tickets, of Briarwood, Queens, that was sued by the state in
July. A default judgment was entered against All Events after it
failed to respond to the attorney general's suit, Corvette said.
Company officials could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Consumer Affairs Commissioner Jules Polonetsky,
said that the car, a 1991 Ford Probe, would not be returned until
the company paid a $41,000 fine for operating without a license.
Scalping is a largely mobile business that could be crippled
without access to a car, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Polonetsky said he was also trying to find seven ticket brokers
who are charging up to $2,500 for World Series tickets. Subpoenas
have been issued to get the addresses from telephone companies, he
said, since newspaper ads for the brokers list 800 numbers but no
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've gotten a bit smarter,'' Polonetsky said. ``They used
to advertise using their names.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said many companies are moving to New Jersey to escape New
York City's licensing regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to repeated questions at a news conference Friday,
Vacco said there was no evidence that employees of the Yankee
Stadium box office were involved in ticket scalping.
</P>
<P>
   But Corvette said that his office had requested information from
the stadium regarding box office sales and personnel. The stadium
was cooperating, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, we have absolutely no indication that there's
any wrongdoing occurring at the Yankee Stadium box office,''
Corvette said. ``However, based on our extensive investigations of
ticket fraud in general, we have learned that every ticket to every
event originates in a box office.''
</P>
<P>
   Stadium officials did not respond to a request for comment.

A TALE OF 2 SERIES CITIES  
 CAL IS COOL, NEW YORK IS FIERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like most of the San Diego Padres, Ken Caminiti had
never set foot inside Yankee Stadium before the club's workout
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti and nearly all of his teammates have no idea what
awaits them when the Padres and the storied New York Yankees begin
the 94th World Series tonight.
</P>
<P>
   This will be a series offering as stark a contrast in cities as
conceivable. It will be the laid-back Southern California lifestyle
against the never-enough-time-in-the-day bustle of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Think San Diego, and it's beaches, waves and pina coladas. Think
the Bronx, and it's gangs, police cars and overhead subway tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Padres right fielder Tony Gwynn, who also made his first visit
to the most hallowed stadium in baseball on Friday, got a strong
taste of what awaits him while taking the No. 4 subway from Midtown
to the South Bronx, exiting at the 163rd Street station.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was New York,'' Gwynn said. ``That's the best way I can put
it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a place where subway riders can be treated to anything
from a singing homeless man, who politely asks for donations, to a
near brawl when a mother, holding her infant daughter, defiantly
tells a stranger, ``Back off. Can't you see I got my kid here in my
arms?''
</P>
<P>
   The ugliest type of interaction you could see in San Diego is a
pair of surfers jockeying for a primo wave or someone honking their
horn to be allowed into a lane on the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres are accustomed to their version of a boisterous
crowd, but the generally well-behaved fans of San Diego don't come
close to the battery-wielding fans who file into Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get chills just thinking about what it's going to be like,''
said Padres catcher/first baseman Jim Leyritz, a former Yankee, who
hit a key home run in the 1996 World Series against Atlanta.
``There's nothing better than going to New York for the World
Series.''
</P>
<P>
   This city has hosted a record 145 World Series games. The
Yankees, who have won a record 23 World Series championships, have
hosted 94 Series games, more than double the next club on the list.
The city among those that have played in a Series that has hosted
the fewest? San Diego, with two.
</P>
<P>
   When the Padres step on the field tonight, they will not only be
taking on the 1998 New York Yankees _ who won a franchise-record
114 regular season games, which could be intimidating enough _ they
must also contend with Yankee Stadium's ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   Every player who walks into Yankee Stadium, no matter how many
times, can't help but think about the great players who have worn
the most famous pinstripes in sports. Just the image of the trellis
hanging from the roof of Yankee Stadium invokes memories of
baseball's most storied franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the first great Yankee club of the early 1920s,
the one that featured Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Earl Combs and
heading down memory lane with names such as Joe DiMaggio, Whitey
Ford, Yogi Berra and Mickey Mantle.
</P>
<P>
   Even the recent Yankees _ Thurman Munson, Reggie Jackson and Don
Mattingly _ have fabulous names. In San Diego, the Padres' greats
are named Clay Kirby, Nate Colbert and Gary Templeton, not
necessarily the kind of names that make anyone think of greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't get excited about playing at Yankee Stadium, then
you don't know much about the history of this game,'' Leyritz said.
``There's nothing better than playing in that stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   On one side is a franchise whose alumni list reads like a
``Who's Who'' in Cooperstown. On the other side, there are great
Padres memories like the time then-General Manager Buzzie Bavasi
flipped off the San Diego fans; or the time Roseanne Barr mangled
the National Anthem and topped it off by grabbing her crotch.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget the time then-owner Ray Kroc grabbed the
stadium microphone and offered refunds to every fan in attendance
after an especially putrid performance by the brown and mustard
colored-wearing Padres in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody thinks about San Diego when they think of Southern
California,'' Gwynn said. ``They think about LA, about the Lakers

go to the World Series.'' &QL;

CARDS WANT EVEN MORE FROM SANDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - If there is a nit somewhere, a football coach
will be the first to find it and pick on it.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Cardinals' Frank Sanders, for instance. All Sanders,
the fourth-year receiver from Auburn, has done is lead the team and
rank second in the NFL in receptions (33) for 326 yards and a
touchdown, and offensive coordinator Marc Trestman offers this
evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been solid in practice every week, but his productivity
still is not what we want it to be,'' Trestman said. ``He's getting
catches, but we'd still like to get more out of the catches.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercy, talk about playing to a tough audience.
</P>
<P>
   Trestman, of course, is not being overly critical. He knows
Sanders' fellow wide receiver, Rob Moore, has been hobbling with a
balky hamstring, which has enabled defenses to focus more on
Sanders and create even more problems for quarterback Jake Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   But he also knows that in the past three games _ two wins _
Sanders has contributed 23 catches for 236 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done a great job,'' Trestman said. ``With Rob slowed, we
have had to pick up the slack somewhere, and it has come from
Frank. If Rob is inhibited, or not in the game, everything
constricts, and we don't have the balance in our offense. The
defense can overplay in situations where they normally wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Create a lopsided field with coverage aimed at
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Sanders isn't about to cry foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's been going on the last two or three weeks has been a
blessing for me,'' he said. ``It's always a disadvantage when you
don't have Rob Moore healthy or on the field. But I won't say it
has been tighter. It's been more in my favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it has been going great as far as Jake and I establishing
good eye contact on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't been lost on Plummer, who will make his 16th start _
officially one full season - on Sunday against New York, where he
threw a 70-yard scoring strike to Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been big,'' Plummer said. ``His production has gone up in
the last five games. I've always felt real confident throwing to
Frank. I have faith in his hands, and he runs very good routes and
always gets open.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's nice to have Rob healthy again. He's had two great
days of practice this week, and we've been throwing deep to him.
Hopefully, we can do that Sunday. It will be nice to have an equal
balance in our offense where we can go to Rob, Frank or Larry
(Centers). It will make Frank even more effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Few probably realize it, but Sanders entered this season with
196 career receptions, the most ever by a Cardinals receiver in
three years. It's an organization, mind you, that has rarely been
shabby at receiver, where wide-outs such as Roy Green and J.T.
Smith excelled.
</P>
<P>
   And for his part, Sanders, who worked feverishly to improve his
quickness in the off-season, believes his best is still to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lot different,'' he said. ``I've had to take on a
different role. I'm trying to be more mature and have a better
approach on the field and in the locker room, trying to be a winner
and show it by example and hope the guys will see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role, my ideas and my heart haven't changed. But the game
has taken on a new dimension. When I first got here, the tempo was
hard to adjust to, but now I can. I understand you can't just play
this game on heart. In college, you played on emotion for 45 to 60
minutes. Concentration is more important.''
</P>
<P>
   He also knows that during his short career, the Cardinals have
undergone a face lift that he admits to liking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The personality of this team is totally different from last
year,'' he said. ``We have a lot of young guys, and new guys, in
key positions. We're not a team with a lot of veterans, but we have
enough vets in key spots to stay on an even keel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of fun, but we work hard. We try to approach
practice like it isn't a drudgery, but don't approach it like the
coaches have to pull teeth to get us to work. We're trying to
improve and have desires and goals that pull us together.'' &QL;

FOLEY'S TOUGHEST TEST CONTINUES ON THE BENCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Vinny Testaverde has come through the
trial-by-fire, and so far Glenn Foley has not. That was the gist
Friday of New York Jets coach Bill Parcells' analysis of Foley, the
younger, less experienced and more vulnerable of the two, who has
now been relegated to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde will start Monday night against the New England
Patriots in Foxboro, Mass., where the anti-Jets' sentiment will be
fervent and emotions boiling. This is for bragging rights, a
division game that pits an ascending Patriots team against a
wannabe Jets outfit coached by the former New England coach. That
it is a division game and will significantly affect each team's
playoff hopes only adds to the drama.
</P>
<P>
   In a candid analysis of the Foley situation, Parcells at first
spoke in a parable. But then, as he warmed to the subject of how a
person emerges from trouble, he specifically cited Foley and his
difficulties. Foley has been demoted following his mistake-filled
performance against the Rams last Sunday, when he completed only 5
of 15 passes, was intercepted twice, and fumbled once. He had been
returning from a rib injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lookit, I've said it five times this year,'' Parcells said.
``You don't find you out if you can play in this league until what
happened to Glenn happens. Where do you go from there? For up until
that point you hadn't been the guy. You were always the other guy.
Suddenly, you're the guy _ `You mean me?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean me?'' is a favored expression Parcells uses when
talking about second-stringers who suddenly get their chance. Until
then, they do not get blamed, they have less pressure. Suddenly,
the coach is pointing his finger at them and the reply is, ``You
mean me?''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to relate it to writing a newspaper story, Parcells
added: ``You've got your first opportunity to show your wares.
You're probably going to be your biggest critic. But you're also
going to be scrutinized by some other people for the first time.
There's going to be opinions expressed. Some of them may not be
favorable. You are going to have to deal with things as a writer. I
would assume at some time a writer gets chewed out. And if it's not
going too well, or if the editor doesn't like you, or something's
going on that makes him opinionated about you, you're going to have
to respond in a certain manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be times when good things happened and
everyone's with you and it's going great,'' he continued. ``And
there's going to be times when it's not going so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, jumping back to quarterbacks, Parcells said: ``So you
don't find out what you've got till you're beat up, knocked down,
thrown some interceptions. And what can you do about it? And you
know what? There's not a lot who can do a lot about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears Parcells' opinion of Foley is still being formed. For
now, it is less than favorable. Does he want to see how Foley
reacts to his benching?
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know until a player goes through it and comes out
the other end,'' Parcells said. ``In Vinny's case, no one had to go
through it worse than he did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Foley situation reminded Parcells of the undefeated fighter
who suddenly gets knocked out. He is never the same after that. So
how will Foley react to this knockout?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still early to draw conclusions,'' Parcells said. ``Maybe
the opportunity hasn't been ample enough. I'll say this. This guy
who's playing quarterback now has gone through the process that
Glenn is going through now.'' Foley would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ The Jets' special teams will undergo extensive renovations
with the absence of CHAD CASCADDEN and FRED BAXTER, both injured.
CRAIG POWELL, the linebacker picked up during the week, will see
action on the unit.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Patriots' cornerback TY LAW, who will be matched against
KEYSHAWN JOHNSON, has four interceptions. He leads the American
Conference. No receiver has caught a pass longer than 18 yards
against him this season.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Patriots lost only two home games last season _ to the
Packers and the Steelers. New England is 3-0 at Foxboro this year.

   PHOENIX - Before and after sporting events, he sits on a stool
across the street from America West Arena and plays his tenor tuba.
</P>
<P>
   The melodies are familiar, the round notes from the brass
instrument rich and resonant, mellow as the autumn night.
</P>
<P>
   Passers-by stop and listen, and enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winchester Cathedral.'' The theme from ``The Godfather.''
Between tunes, he turns the pages of his laminated sheet music,
resting on a raised stand.
</P>
<P>
   Smiling, a woman drops a dollar bill into a tarnished loving cup
at the musician's feet.
</P>
<P>
   One evening a fan was drawn to the sounds of the soloist
performing his sidewalk concert. Approaching, he listened as
Everett Taylor, dressed not as a panhandler but more like a member
of an orchestral ensemble, in a fresh shirt and white necktie,
played ``Ave Maria.'' Nine songs later, the man fished into his
pocket and left a $30 tip.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 3 the tuba player won't be at his usual spot near Second
and Jefferson streets. The Suns were scheduled to open the season
that night. But because of the NBA labor dispute, the arena will be
empty. So will downtown streets. The first two weeks of the season
have been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The tuba player and other street musicians will go elsewhere to
supplement their income. ``I'll hustle pool,'' said Taylor, who is
an accomplished billiards player. He will play his euphonium at the
State Fair. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The uniformed vendor stood behind the counter on the main level
of the arena. He works by the hour, selling peanuts, pretzels and
beer.
</P>
<P>
   Business was good at Thursday night's hockey game, but the
vendor wasn't smiling. The NBA preseason was eliminated. Now, the
Suns first five regular-season games have been scrapped _ about 30
hours of work he had been counting on.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NBA owners and players argue over how to share $2
billion in annual revenue. Union President Patrick Ewing, who makes
$18 million a year, said NBA players ``cannot survive'' under a
hard salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   The peanut man knows about survival. With no NBA, he said, ``I'm
gonna have to find another job.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   On nights the Coyotes play at home he wears a T-shirt that
reads, ``Give Blood. Play Hockey.'' In one hand he waved a game
program. On the other he wore a giant foam rubber ``Coyote Claw''
that sells for $6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, pro-grams! ``Pr''o-grams here! Don't be shy!''
</P>
<P>
   Upbeat, smiling, Jim Bracken hawked his wares as fans filed
through the turnstiles, his cheery voice rising above the hum and
buzz of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Programs. Coyote claws. Foam rubber puck hats. Step right up.
Here you go, sir. Thanks. Enjoy the game.
</P>
<P>
   Bracken, who bears a resemblance to a young Dick Vermeil,
appeared tireless. He already had put in a full day at his regular
job.
</P>
<P>
   Bracken is on the staff at Gilbert High School. He teaches
sociology and a motivational class he calls ``Positive Personal
Preparation.'' He also coaches freshman basketball, a labor of
love.
</P>
<P>
   Some evenings he sells programs and novelty items at the arena,
wearing a Suns T-shirt when the NBA team is playing.
</P>
<P>
   Bracken works on commission, earning 10 percent of sales. On a
good night he pockets $100. More at Bank One Ballpark. It's money
he earns standing on his feet, shouting until he's hoarse. Money to
help make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really hurts the little man,'' Bracken said. ``There must
be 500 to 1,000 people working in the building. I'll bet overall
(the canceled games) affect 3,000 people, maybe more. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA game better not think it's foolproof. Lots of friends
tell me they're bored by the NBA. They'd rather watch a good
college game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners want more of the revenue. But without the players
on the floor, there is no product.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dunno. How can you side with either one? They're both
turning people off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pro-grams! ``Pr''o-grams here! . . .'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: FOR UMPS, IT'S NOT A PERFECT WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ohio, Md.)  (Eds: See also BBO-YANKEES, BBO-PADRES, BBO-RHODEN-COLUMN)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last time they were seen on the field at Yankee
Stadium, they were inadvertently influencing the outcome of the
game that sent the Cleveland Indians home and the Yankees to the
World Series. That's not to say the umpires will mess up in the
World Series, but they have shown they are eminently capable of
interfering with the natural progression of postseason games.
</P>
<P>
   All right, so Ted Hendry won't be in the World Series; the
umpires' collective bargaining agreement with the leagues does not
allow an umpire to work both a league championship series and the
World Series. Joe Brinkman won't be here either, even though the
agreement does allow for an umpire to work both a division series
and the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The three American League umpires who are on the six-man World
Series crew did work in the first round of the playoffs. One of
them, Richie Garcia, will be the crew chief and behind the plate in
Saturday night's opener at Yankee Stadium. Gene Budig, the AL
president, Friday called Garcia, a 24-year veteran, one of the
league's ``most respected umpires.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Saturday night, Garcia will move to right field Sunday
night for Game 2. Now why does that combination sound familiar,
Richie Garcia and right field? Ah yes, the last time Garcia worked
a post-season series at Yankee Stadium, he was the umpire in Game 1
of the league championship series two years ago when a young fan
from New Jersey _ no name, please; he has been over-glorified
enough _ reached over the fence and caught Derek Jeter's fly ball
just as Tony Tarasco, Baltimore's right fielder, prepared to catch
it.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia ruled no interference, that it was a home run, then said
oops after watching a television replay clearly showing
interference. Too late. The call helped the Yankees win the first
game and set the tone for the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though he made a mistake, you know you have the best out
there,'' a baseball official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said. That knowledge comes as small consolation to the
Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Budig, too, acknowledged that umpires, like players and
managers, aren't perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major league umpires are skilled at what they do, but they are
human,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``Day in and day out
they do a very good job for Major League Baseball. Rounds one and
two have been difficult, but that happens from time to time.''
</P>
<P>
   The umpires were so human in the American League playoffs that
it happened from time to time to time to time. The Cleveland
Indians suffered the brunt of the fallibility of the umpires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a highlight reel of umpires getting knocked down by
baseballs,'' general manager John Hart said after the Indians'
final game against the Yankees. ``The umpires didn't lose the game
for us, but we had our share of controversies in two playoff series
with umpires.''
</P>
<P>
   In the division series against Boston, Brinkman, the plate
umpire, was so bad with his calls on pitches and plays at the plate
that he immediately provoked disputes that led to his ejecting of
Mike Hargrove, the Indians' manager, three pitches into Game 2, and
Dwight Gooden, their starting pitcher, 19 pitches later.
</P>
<P>
   Hendry was right or wrong, depending on one's point of view, for
his noncall of interference on Travis Fryman in the 12th inning of
Game 2 of the ALCS. That ruling went in favor of the Indians.
Little else did.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 4, Jeter was stealing second in the fifth inning when
the on-target throw from Sandy Alomar Jr. hit Jim McKean, who
jumped to try to get out of the way but instead kicked the ball
into right field. A batted ball, Omar Vizquel's line drive, struck
Hendry in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst call of Game 6 was Hendry's on a force play at
second base. Hendry called Bernie Williams safe, ruling that
Vizquel's foot came off the base before he caught the ball. Members
of the Yankees indicated Friday that they, too, thought the call
was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Williams said when asked what he thought,
``but I'll take it. It was a big play.''
</P>
<P>
   But did he think he was out? ``I'd rather not comment about
that,'' he said. ``It will stir a lot of controversy. I don't want
to get into that.''
</P>
<P>
   When a player believes he was safe, he says so and doesn't worry
about any subsequent controversy. If Williams was implying that he
thought he was out, another member of the Yankees said he had no
doubt that Williams was out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure at first,'' this uniformed member of the team
said, ``but when I saw it was Hendry, I said uh-oh. I also thought
Omar is so smooth you'd think he wouldn't come off the bag. Then I
saw the replay. He was out.''
</P>
<P>
   The game today is faster than it used to be, this observer said.
The umpires have to be sharper.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Garcia, Dale Scott and Tim Tschida from the American
League, and Jerry Crawford, Dana DeMuth and Mark Hirschbeck from
the National League, will be as sharp as an 18th century French
guillotine in these four to seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Coleman, the NL president, said he thought his umpires
were first-rate in the division and league series and added that he
has ``three splendid umpires'' working the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Budig said: ``The World Series crew is proven and first-rate. We
have total confidence in them.''
</P>
<P>
   The umpires should let the players make the errors and the
managers the bad decisions. Then everyone will talk about the
players and managers and not the umpires.

SERIES COULD BE LAST FOR YANKEE STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - All that's missing is the curtain call, a fitting
finish to the season of miracles, a grand crescendo to complete the
renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Take a bite out of this:
</P>
<P>
   You could be watching the last appearance of Yankee Stadium in
the World Series. The place where Gehrig said goodbye, where Reggie
became a candy bar, where little Jeffrey Maier reached over the
railing and became a civic hero. The place where Ruth rumbled,
where Maris humbled, where the owner is spoofed on ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   The place where baseball belongs in October.
</P>
<P>
   But even here, history is no match for the stadium game. Even
here, the old building doesn't work. Even here, the owner and the
mayor are pushing for a new palace, a new home for the cell-phone
crowd and the guaranteed revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   If they can wreck it here, they can wreck it anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the bunting, it is one of the numerous backdrops
framing the Fall Classic. There is controversy, a fire lit when
David Wells' guaranteed a five-game victory on Howard Stern's radio
show. There is idiocy, a foot in the mouth from George
Steinbrenner, who objected to Sammy Sosa throwing out the first
pitch. There is a stark contrast of teams, cultures and traditions,
one of which has won 113 World Series games, the other of which is
only 112 behind.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, there is a sense that this is more
coronation than competition, and maybe that's where the magic lies.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, there are separate mojos at work here. There is the
resiliency of the Padres, the jaw-crazy gaze of Kevin Brown, the
uncanny touch of Bruce Bochy. The team that has eliminated a pair
of 100-game winners, a team that will likely parlay this little run
into its own stadium on the water.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, there is the dance with destiny. A World
Series title would mean 125 wins, enough to make a case that this
is the best Yankees team ever. A team built on depth and
versatility, a team literally designed to be slump-proof. But in
the end, they are a team that might be too bland to rival the
Yankees of lore.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, where the corporate makeover of Bilk One Ballpark
continues to grow like stinkweed, there is plenty of reason to pay
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Would you like Bernie Williams in return for the hike in ticket
prices? Would you prefer Kevin Brown? Or maybe you'll be watching a
pair of future Diamondbacks, a decision that would make a good
portion of fans forget about the greed, the arrogance, the inane
comments of Rich Dozier.
</P>
<P>
   Williams could be the best all-around player in baseball. He's
unhappy about his treatment in New York. He has a good relationship
with Buck Showalter. And absurd as it sounds, he might be too
expensive for the Yankees, a team that must re-up with Derek Jeter
and Mariano Rivera, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, meanwhile, is poised to become the richest pitcher in
history. His competitive scowl makes Jack McDowell look like a boy
scout. He has the opportunity to carry the Padres, to become the
premiere arm in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line, there is no bigger stage than New York. And no
baseball facility with more wealth of tradition than Yankee
Stadium, a building clearly in jeopardy now that Steinbrenner wants
new digs on the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   There are few bastions of pure revelry left in sports. Boston
Garden is gone. Chicago Stadium is a parking lot. The Forum in
Montreal is history. The buzzsaw is on its way to Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   The modern era of professional sports can be summed up in one
awful mouthful: The National Car Rental Center, future home of the
Florida Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there is still sunshine at Wrigley Field. Football
on the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field. Post-season baseball in the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   And here we are.
</P>
<P>
   So savor the scene. Expect the unexpected. After all, if this is
the last big dance for Yankee Stadium, you can count on a little
magic, something to remember before they send the ghosts to the
graveyard. &QL;

UA EXPECTA TIONS TAKE SMALL DIP  
 TALENTED NEWCOMERS PROVIDE HOPE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   You know you have a successful college basketball program when a
step backward means being in the top 20 instead of the top 5.
</P>
<P>
   This year figures to be a step backward for Coach Lute Olson and
his Arizona Wildcats, who lost three starters from their 1997
national championship team and their 30-win team last season that
came within one victory of being the Pac-10's first undefeated
champion.
</P>
<P>
   UA won't be as dominant on the national scene while its
newcomers mature.
</P>
<P>
   That's the bad news. The good news for the Wildcats, who open
practice at McKale Center this morning, is they have replaced Mike
Bibby, Michael Dickerson and Bennett Davison _ all drafted by NBA
teams _ with a recruiting class judged to be in the top five in the
country. Among the newcomers is forward Richard Jefferson of Moon
Valley High.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of question marks ourselves going into the
start of practice,'' said Olson, entering his 16th season at UA.
``Seven of our 13 scholarship players are new. It's a team the
coaches and fans will have to be patient with.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Jason Terry set to follow Bibby at point guard and
6-foot-11, 217-pound A.J. Bramlett challenged to prove he can be a
dominating big man, the Wildcats are expected to make their 15th
straight NCAA Tournament appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Terry has been one of the strongest sixth men in college
basketball the past two seasons on a guard-heavy team. He is known
for his defense (1.74 steals). During the stretch run to the Pac-10
title last season he also provided instant offense off the bench.
He will need to show that he can run the offense on a full-time
basis and be a floor leader who delivers the ball to the right
people in the right places.
</P>
<P>
   Bramlett was the rebounding leader of the NCAA Tournament when
UA won the national title. He wasn't as dominant during the 1998
tournament run, becoming virtually invisible when the Wildcats were
shown the door in the West Regional Final by Utah.
</P>
<P>
   As Arizona's most experienced big man, Bramlett must stay out of
foul trouble. He has to be a force with his rebounding and interior
defense. Without UA's trademark killer perimeter scoring, Bramlett
also has to be an inside scoring threat.
</P>
<P>
   Olson has openings at Simon's shooting guard spot, Dickerson's
small forward spot, and Davison's power forward spot. Because of
the NBA lockout, Dickerson, Simon and former UA players Damon
Stoudamire and Ben Davis have come back to Tucson and worked out
informally with the Wildcats. Dickerson is taking advantage of the
lockout to complete his degree work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't watch those workouts, but our former players have
come in and given us their feedback on the new guys,'' Olson said.
``They've been optimistic, but until we see them ourselves in a
structured practice individually and in five-on-five work, we have
questions. So we're as anxious as anyone for practice to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's nice that the former players come back and work out
before practice officially opens and talk to the guys about the
expectations in the program and what it's like to play in the
Pac-10.''
</P>
<P>
   It is going to be a different style team _ bigger and probably
slower with less extended defense _ than Wildcats fans have seen
the past two seasons when Olson could put three or four guards on
the floor together. Now, he can only hope his golf score matches
the makeup of his roster, with lots of 4s across it.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman power forward Michael Wright (6-8, 220), who helped
Team USA to the gold medal in the Junior World Championship, is the
prize of the recruiting class. He is expected to challenge
sophomore Eugene Edgerson (6-6, 221), senior Donnell Harris (6-11,
203), sophomore Justin Wessel (6-8, 211) and freshman Luke Walton
for the power forward job. Edgerson and Harris were valuable role
players on the national championship team. Walton is the son of
basketball Hall of Famer Bill Walton.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Quynn Tebbs will be challenged at shooting guard by
freshmen Ruben Douglas and Traves Wilson, both of whom can swing to
the point to give Terry relief.
</P>
<P>
   At small forward, newcomers Rick Anderson (6-9, 205) and
Jefferson (6-8, 215) will battle. Wessel, Walton and Wilson also
will work at small forward. &QL;

YANKEES WILL WIN WITH TEAMWORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Yankees will not have Ruth, Gehrig or
DiMaggio in the heart of their order tonight for the first game of
the World Series. Or will they?
</P>
<P>
   The pressure of playing for the most celebrated franchise in
baseball history has undone past Yankees teams. The expectations of
owner George Steinbrenner have turned many high-priced free agents
into mush.
</P>
<P>
   Not this bunch. The 1998 Yankees have embraced the glory of the
past and are bent on adding a little of their own this week.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre said Tuesday _ after the Yankees won their
35th pennant _ that the hardest part was getting here. Believe it.
</P>
<P>
   He was not being disrespectful of their Series opponent, the San
Diego Padres. But the Yankees' blend of pitching, defense and
timely hitting that led to 121 victories create an intimidation
factor that San Diego will not overcome no matter how many times
they pitch Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what anybody says,'' Steinbrenner said after his
team beat Cleveland in the American League Championship Series.
``If the '27 Yankees played this team, they wouldn't stand a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget that the Yankees have outscored the Padres by more than
200 runs or that they have the World Series' only 20-game winner in
David Cone. Forget they won 62 games at home and that their
lifetime Series record is 23-11. This club is much more than
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   That 1927 team of Ruth and Gehrig had 110 regular-season
victories and a four-game sweep of Pittsburgh in the Series. It is
considered the benchmark of Yankee greatness. The 1998 team might
not have any future Hall of Famers; maybe shortstop Derek Jeter or
center fielder Bernie Williams. Instead, they have embodied the
personality of their manager, who has turned the Yankees into
baseball's biggest extended family.
</P>
<P>
   This is a franchise that won the World Series two years ago _
and this year's team is superior to that one because of its
cohesiveness.
</P>
<P>
   From veterans like Cone, Paul O'Neill and Chili Davis to
youngsters Shane Spencer and Jorge Posada, there always seems to be
someone there to pick up a teammate. When first baseman Tino
Martinez went in the postseason tank for a second straight year,
third baseman Scott Brosius countered with a critical three-run
homer and made two spectacular plays at third in last Thursday's
clincher against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the most impressive thing about them is that if there
is a runner on third and less than two outs, they will always get
the run home,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said. ``Sounds small, but
in baseball that is everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's Game 1 starter David Wells owes his entire season to
Torre. After Wells gave up seven runs in less than three innings
May 6 vs. Texas, Torre ripped him for being out of shape and having
poor work habits. It was a side of Torre seldom seen, but Wells
listened.
</P>
<P>
   In his next start, May 12 against Kansas City, Wells settled
down after a rough start and finished strong. The next time out he
pitched a perfect game. Wells enters this game 18-4, with three
more victories in the postseason and an MVP award in the LCS.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of the game's more colorful characters and Torre
occasionally still has to tone him down. When Wells glared at a
teammate for an error several weeks ago, Torre said there would be
no more of that. And this was after the Yankees had already
clinched the AL East with more than a month yet to play.
</P>
<P>
   When Darryl Strawberry went into the hospital to undergo surgery
for colon cancer, every member of the team appeared in a get-well
video. In the two weeks since, which is about two weeks longer than
the average attention span for a big leaguer, Yankees players have
been calling him every day. Strawberry got out Friday and told each
one of them that it was time to go to work.
</P>
<P>
   When Chuck Knoblauch committed a colossal fielding blunder that
cost the Yankees Game 2 of the ALCS, no one jumped in his face. The
New York media jumped on him for a season of subpar play, but this
team doesn't read the papers. Teammates accepted Knoblauch's
apology and moved on _ right into tonight's series opener.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams entered this season without a contract extension
and with free agency looming, the Yankees could have been facing a
Mike Piazza-like disruption. But the focus remained on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Although Williams might leave as a free agent, he won the
American League batting title and with it a Don Mattingly-like
place as a modern Yankees hero.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees inserted Cuban defector Orlando Hernandez into
the starting rotation, players could have resented his new contract
the way they did Hideki Irabu's the year before. Instead, they
embraced Hernandez, who won Game 4 against Cleveland _ probably the
only game they've played this year that could be called critical.
</P>
<P>
   They won't beat the Padres in five games the way Wells predicted
Thursday during an interview with radio shock jock Howard Stern.
But he's close. The Yankees will come back to New York a week from
tonight and wrap it up in six.

RETURNERS GIVE NAU CHANCE FOR NCAA RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By GREG CRAWFORD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. _ When basketball Coach Ben Howland was
interviewing for the job at Northern Arizona University, he
discussed a five-year plan to get to the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his fifth year the Lumberjacks have two Big Sky
Conference championships and a first-ever berth in the NCAA
Tournament, which resulted in a heartbreaking 65-62 loss to
Cincinnati, a No. 2 regional seed last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many people in that room actually believed we
would ever get to the NCAA Tournament,'' Howland said. ``It had
been such a dismal situation here for so many years. It's
encouraging that we've reached that goal, but with any winning
program, we have high expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   As practice begins today, high expectations return. Yet senior
forward Casey Frank sees the accomplishment in a different light.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it was more of a disappointment than it was an
accomplishment (losing to Cincinnati),'' Frank said. ``We felt we
were a better team than Cincinnati at the time, and we felt we were
going to win that game.''
</P>
<P>
   NAU's only significant loss from last season is Big Sky
Conference Most Valuable Player Andrew Mavis, which will be some
big shoes to fill. Now playing in England, Mavis averaged 14 points
and finished the season shooting 47 percent from three-point range.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what Coach wants me to do right now is to take Mavis'
spot,'' junior Ross Land said. ``That will be hard to do, but I'm
feeling confident going into this season with two years under my
belt.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Big Sky co-Freshman of the Year made 43.8
three-pointers and and is 23 three-pointers away from the NAU
record. Senior Pat McGrath, who played at the same junior college
as Mavis, will help anchor that position.
</P>
<P>
   Other returners from last season include 7-foot Dan McClintock,
who has been splitting time with Frank for the past two years at
center and gives NAU one of the most intimidating one-two punches
in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The pair showed just how difficult they were to stop last season
during the Big Sky tournament as McClintock was named tournament
MVP playing behind Frank. This season, however, NAU fans may see
the two play side by side.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is they are both better than they have
ever been,'' Howland said. ``We have wanted them to play together
in the past, but now I know they have the skills to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Kawika Akina and junior Rod Hutchings look to be another
difficult duo at the point guard position. Last season, Akina
missed the first six games waiting to be eligible after
transferring from Dixie Junior College and finished the year second
in the conference in steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked about playing them together some even,'' Howland
said. ``Kawika is such a tough, hard-nosed, tenacious defender, he
can guard the two guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchings gives NAU added quickness with great penetration.
</P>
<P>
   Juniors Billy Hix and Andrew Wolthers play the big forward spot
with Hix staring. Hix is NAU's tough inside player and was second
on the team in rebounding with 135. &QL;

RIGHT NOW, FUTURE CAN WAIT FOR WILLIAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Bernie Williams starts what could be his final
series with the Yankees in Game 1 of the World Series at Yankee
Stadium Saturday night, he wants to do it with a free mind. Free of
worrying about his extremely uncertain future and an undisclosed
personal matter that has made this post-season as perplexing as it
has been pleasing.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not easy to keep the mind uncluttered. Williams does
not know if he will sign with the Yankees and return to center
field next season, because he wants to test free agency. There is a
good chance the Yankees will not offer him the most lavish
contract, so Williams might be forced to decide between the fattest
paycheck and a new situation in the baseball city of his choice or
a pretty fat paycheck and a familiar situation in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Boras, Williams' agent, compared his client with players
in the $10 million-a-year bracket last season, so that price tag
has surely escalated after Williams won the American League batting
title with a .339 average while drilling 26 homers and knocking in
97 runs. Williams was asked if he agreed with the theory that other
teams will outbid the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know,'' said Williams, who has been aloof during this
post-season, but has declined to discuss why. ``And I'm thinking
about this a little more than I would like to. I would like to keep
my focus on the series.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not an issue Williams or the Yankees wants to study
Saturday or in the coming days, because the team is four victories
away from a championship. Still, it is an issue that hovers over
the Yankees as ominously as the owner George Steinbrenner hovers
over general manager Brian Cashman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough thing,'' Cashman said about balancing the
excitement of being in the World Series with the reality of trying
to re-sign Williams. ``You know the ugliness of the future is right
in front of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Williams has been adamant about not discussing the
future, he relented slightly Friday. When a reporter asked him what
the reasons would be for staying with the Yankees, Williams' answer
included an escape clause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the fact that I've been here my whole career,'' Williams
said. ``That has a lot to do with it. The relationships that I've
come to know during the years, I think it would be very hard, but
not impossible, to start from scratch somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams continued: ``But I think the reality of the game in
this day and age is things happen. You can't really write things in
stone that they're going to happen. People get traded. People
become free agents and go to other teams. I have to make a decision
really thinking about all the people I'm accountable for.''
</P>
<P>
   When Williams was asked what better situation could a player
have than being the center fielder for the Yankees, winning a
batting crown and being in the World Series, the 30-year-old was
stumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, that's pretty good right there,'' Williams said. ``It's
funny you mention that, because I really haven't thought about any
of that. I think, at some point in the off season, I was going to
sit down and think, wow, it wasn't a bad year at all.''
</P>
<P>
   While Cashman would not discuss financial matters, another
Yankee official said the team will not offer Williams as much as
$12 million a year _ unless Steinbrenner gets generous after a
possible championship. It is more likely that the Yanks would offer
Williams in the $10 million-a-year range.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate to have to speculate on something at this point,''
Cashman said. ``We'll give it our best effort to sign him at a
level that we're comfortable with. Hopefully, that will be enough.
Then we'll have a marriage. If not, we'll have a divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   While Williams has earned the right to become a free agent and
pursue the contract he wants in the city he wants, he has
interesting choices to make. When a reporter asked Williams how he
would respond to someone who suggested that he accept less from the
Yankees to remain in a city where he is popular, where he likes his
teammates and manager, and where the team has been in the
post-season for four straight years, he did not hesitate to answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My response to that would be it's not the time right now to
start thinking about that,'' Williams said. ``If I start thinking
about that, it'll distract me to what I need to do in the World
Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams then talked about how the Yankees are at the end of a
remarkable season and how he did not want his situation to disrupt
that. But, with Williams' status uncertain, he was asked if the
next four to seven games would be bittersweet, since he could be
ending a 13-year association with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk about that,'' Williams said. ``I'm going
to have a lot of fun out there. I'm going to go all out.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Williams walked away from the interview. &QL;

BEAVERS DREAM OF BOWL BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In only his eighth month as athletic director at Oregon State,
 &UR; Mitch Barnhart already has accomplished the unthinkable. He was
able to call bowl officials in midseason to lobby for his Beavers,
all the while keeping a straight face.
</P>
<P>
   Barnhart made the calls earlier this week just to let the bowls
know that the Beavers (4-2) would be darn proud to play in a
postseason game for the first time since 1965.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that it's been a long time since we've been in
this position and that we were still out there,'' said Barnhart.
</P>
<P>
   He also emphasized that Oregon State fans, who finally have
something to be excited about, would be anxious to travel to watch
their team play in a bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics might say that the Beavers are being a bit hasty in their
dreams of a bowl berth. After all, their upcoming schedule is
brutal, beginning with today's game against 16th-ranked Arizona,
then moving on to Washington, California, second-ranked UCLA and
11th-ranked Oregon. And with victories over Nevada, Baylor, Utah
State and Stanford, the Beavers have yet to beat a good team.
</P>
<P>
   But Oregon State hasn't had a record this good at the midway
point of the season since 1968, so forgive the Beavers their
indulgences.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time since the late '60s, there is a genuine
level of excitement for the fans,'' Barnhart said. ``People are
jumping on for the ride.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers have been in a similar position before, however. In
1988, under  &UR; Dave Kragthorpe, they started 3-2, only to finish
4-6-1. In 1989, they were 4-3-1 and finished 4-7-1. And in 1993,
under  &UR; Jerry
 &UR; Pettibone, the Beavers started 3-3 and finished 4-7.
</P>
<P>
   That's why today's game against Arizona is huge for Coach  &UR; Mike
Riley and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've proven we can compete, now we have to get the big
breakthrough win to convince people we're for real,'' Barnhart
said. &QL; 
A simple answer &QL; 
Earlier this week, Oregon Coach  &UR; Mike Bellotti was asked why his
11th-ranked Ducks haven't earned more respect nationally. After
all, they have one of the nation's best quarterbacks,  &UR; Akili Smith,
who leads one of the country's most explosive offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're not the biggest media market in the world,''
Bellotti said. ``It's hard not to consider us (as a top team).
We're not only winning games, but we're doing it in a manner that's
fairly convincing. We just have to educate everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Ducks (5-0) want to educate people, they should start by
beating a good team. Of Oregon's five opponents, none has a winning
record now, and together they have a mark of 11-18.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks have a chance to prove they are for real today when
they visit second-ranked UCLA in a game that figures to test the
durability of the stadium's scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams are averaging around 50 points and look similar
offensively. That's no surprise, because UCLA Coach  &UR; Bob Toledo
spent six years as the offensive coordinator at Oregon and was
succeeded by Bellotti.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears a lot of the stuff we used when I was there they've
kept, and a lot of the same things I'm doing here at UCLA,'' Toledo
said. &QL; 
Stormin' in Norman  &QL; 
Two things are non-negotiable to Oklahoma football fans. A chicken
fried steak should be tender enough to cut with a fork. And the
Sooners should win nearly every Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Well, a good chicken fried steak is still common enough in the
state, but victories are another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Since  &UR; John Blake became head coach nearly three years ago, the
Sooners are 8-19. This year, they have a 2-3 mark, including a 34-3
loss last week to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   There is much speculation that this is the final year for Blake,
a former assistant with the Dallas Cowboys under  &UR; Barry Switzer.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, ``Daily Oklahoman'' columnist  &UR; Barry Tramel made it
clear that he doesn't think Blake is head coaching material. ``Head
coaches must be sharp,'' Tramel wrote. ``Quick thinkers. They must
know what they believe in. They must be leaders. They must be
communicators. Blake is none of the above.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma has used five different quarterbacks this season. Last
week alone Blake made six substitutions involving three of them.
Blake was still waffling as the Sooners were preparing to play
Missouri today.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, who came to Oklahoma with the backing of Switzer, said
the criticism isn't bothering him. ``We've got a lot of pride on
this football team and the coaching staff,'' he said. ``We will
continue to fight. As far as the rest of it is concerned, that's
out of my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's one thing Sooner fans can cling to: at least their team
doesn't play Nebraska this year. &QL; 
Quick quiz &QL; 
Quiz time: Nebraska Coach  &UR; Frank Solich won five games at Nebraska
before losing one. How long did it take his predecessor,  &UR; Tom
Osborne, to lose a game? Answer below. &QL; 
Calling home &QL; 
The 1-4 Auburn Tigers are off to their worst start in 46 years, but
Coach  &UR; Terry Bowden seems to be holding up well under the pressure.
``When I get up in the morning, I'm more anxious to work on it than
the day before,'' he said. ``Some guys get so wrapped up in it,
they can't function. I'm not one of the them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said a phone call last week to his father, Florida State
Coach
 &UR; Bobby Bowden, inspired him. ``He told me these things happen, and
if you can't handle it, you can't be a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden signed a seven-year contract last December, and his job
seems safe. &QL; 
Quick kicks &QL; 
Texas running back  &UR; Ricky Williams earned the most votes in the
``Rocky'' ``Mountain News''' latest Heisman poll. Quarterbacks
filled out the remainder of the top five:  &UR; Cade McNown, UCLA;  &UR; Tim
Couch, Kentucky; &UR; Donovan McNabb, Syracuse; and  &UR; Akili Smith,
Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota plays at Ohio State today, where the Gophers haven't
won since 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Flashback:  &UR; Barry Sanders won the Heisman Trophy in 1988. He
scored 39 touchdowns that season to set a Division I record. Only
two other players have scored more than 28 _ Nebraska's  &UR; Mike
 &UR; Rozier in 1983 and Penn State's  &UR; Lydell Mitchell in 1971. Each
finished with 29.
</P>
<P>
   Quiz answer: Tom Osborne also lost the fifth game he coached at
Nebraska. His Cornhuskers were beaten, 13-12, at Missouri in 1973.
The Tigers' defensive coordinator then was a clipboard-toting,
30-year-old by the name of  &UR; Vince Tobin. &QL;

NAU FACES MUST-WIN SITUATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Timing is everything, and today's match-up between Northern
Arizona and Montana in Missoula, Mont., might go a long way in
determining the eventual Big Sky champion.
</P>
<P>
   Today's loser likely will be out of the conference race, tagged
with its third loss in four conference games. Cal State-Northridge
(3-0) and Montana State (2-0) will be hard to catch.
</P>
<P>
   It also will be a homecoming for NAU Coach Jerome Souers, who
coached at Montana for 12 years, including eight as the defensive
coordinator. He's trying to remove most of the emotion before
kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a business trip,'' Souers said. ``It has to be that way,
but there is a lot of sentimentality surrounding this. But this
isn't a week to look back for either teams. Both teams need a win
heading into the stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are improving as a team . . . Montana is a good team that
is capable of exploding on anyone on any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the top quarterbacks in Division I-AA, Travis Brown of
NAU and Montana's Brian Ah Yat, could put on quite an aerial show _
if Ah Yat is available. He suffered a back injury a week ago, and
his status won't be determined until shortly before kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Brown missed three games with a dislocated elbow, played about a
quarter last week and will get the start today.
</P>
<P>
   Souers said Brown is close to 100 percent, and that a key
element in the game will be the protection he is afforded.
</P>
<P>
   Montana Coach Mick Dennehy realizes that the return of Brown
gives NAU a big boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though they have shown improvement every week without him
in the lineup, they are now able to get back to more of the things
that they like do do on offense,'' he said. ``Obviously, that makes
them that much more difficult to defend.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, NAU's Afa Faraimo keeps turning in impressive
performances and is being touted for All-America honors at
linebacker. In six games, he has 43 solo tackles, 24 assists, three
fumble recoveries, a blocked punt, 5{ sacks and pass interception. &QL;

BATES MIGHT START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Running back  &UR; Mario Bates won't know until right
before game time Sunday if he will make his first start with the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Bates, who played at Arizona State, worked with the first unit
for the second consecutive day Friday because of starter  &UR; Adrian
Murrell's injured left calf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we have to find out is if Adrian is capable of
playing, and if he is, how well he's capable of playing,'' said
Cardinals Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin, whose team (3-3) plays the New York
Giants at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Bates carried the ball for the first time in last Sunday's 20-7
victory over Chicago and scored on his second and third carries. He
would be backed up by rookie  &UR; Michael Pittman, a fourth-round pick
from Fresno State who had 17 carries for 56 yards against the
Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect them to be gangbusters,'' Tobin said of Bates
and Pittman.
</P>
<P>
   Bates, a fifth-year pro, has 40 career starts. But he has played
mostly on special teams in his first season with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plays are coming,'' Bates said. ``If Adrian is not able to
(play), it changes my role but not how I approach it. I'll be
spending the next (24) hours preparing myself the way I always
prepare myself. You always feel pressure if you're not prepared.
I'll be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Murrell said he hopes to play because ``I feel better today than
(Thursday).''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has a lot of confidence in Bates and Pittman, if he
can't play.
</P>
<P>
   ``They show when they get opportunities that they can play,''
Murrell said. &QL; 
Still ailing &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback  &UR; Tom Knight will miss his third consecutive game with
a hamstring connector injury. He again will be replaced in the
starting lineup by  &UR; J.B. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see the full-speed explosion, which is deadly for a
corner,'' said Tobin of Knight. ``You make one false step and it
can cost you a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Second-year pro  &UR; Chris Dishman, who was expected to alternate
with
 &UR; Jerome Daniels at left guard, reinjured his neck in Friday's
practice and also will not make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I practiced the last two days, and everything was fine,''
Dishman said. ``I never thought a stinger would last three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin is hopeful both players can use the bye next week to get
healthy for the Nov. 1 game at Detroit. &QL; 
Car trouble &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their NBA friends, Cardinals players aren't locked out.
But their union boss,  &UR; Gene Upshaw, was locked out of his rental
car during a routine visit to the team's Tempe training facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better me than the players, that's for sure,'' said Upshaw,
the executive director of the NFL Players Association. &QL; 
Back home &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Murrell was asked if he is looking forward to returning this
weekend to New York, where he starred for the Jets, the other
tenant in Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only because it's a divisional game and it's important,'' he
said. ``Besides, they aren't my fans. Giants fans are a whole
different crowd.  &UR; Dave (Brown, quarterback) has got to be the guy
who's worried, man. I bet he won't take off his helmet.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who started last season as the Giants quarterback before
an injury cost him the rest of the season and his job in New York,
isn't a bit worried about the Big Apple's rambunctious fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take my helmet off . . . but I'm not very smart,'' he
said. ``Actually, it will be good to go home again. I haven't been
there since early July, and it will be good to see my family and
friends again. The crowd reaction to me will probably be mixed.'' &QL; 
Deep thoughts &QL; 
Few of the Cardinals have found success in Giants Stadium, but
receiver  &UR; Frank Sanders has had good days and remembers the 70-yard
touchdown pass he caught from  &UR; Jake Plummer last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started thinking about that the other day,'' Sanders said.
``It's amazing, really. The field is turf _ I don't like turf _ and
it's always cold _ I don't like cold _ but somehow God has blessed
me when I go there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I catch one ball for 9 yards and we win, it will still be
more important to me than having a big day personally.'' &QL; 
Staff writers Tim Tyers and Lee Shappell contributed to this
report. &QL;

VALLEY ANGLER ON ROLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - When the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society (BASS) decided
to come West with a regional tournament schedule more than a year
ago, almost everyone figured that  &UR; John Murray of Phoenix would be
one of the qualifiers for the BassMaster Classic, the most famous
bass tournament in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Endorsements earned from that tournament can make a winner's
career, providing him stable income for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I finish ahead of John in the final (regional) standings,
I'll go to the Classic,'' said the Valley's  &UR; Greg Hines, who was
one of four regional qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble was that Murray never was a factor. He did poorly on
the Delta near San Francisco, finished well at Lake Powell, then
shot craps at Lake Havasu and Elephant Butte Reservoir in New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Murray wondered what happened. He is regarded as perhaps the
best bass fisherman in the West. And his winning record in western
tournaments endorses that belief.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the second year of the Western Region has begun on the
Columbia River in Washington. And Murray definitely is in the
running.
</P>
<P>
   He finished third, won a Ranger bass boat and put himself in a
position to be a front-runner in qualifying for the Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Like stock-car racing, qualifying for the Classic depends on
consistency. Qualifiers don't have to win a tournament, just finish
high in each of the four. Murray has started well, finishing behind
two Oregon anglers who don't figure to do that well when the event
heads farther south.
</P>
<P>
   Murray caught 33 pounds, 8 ounces of bass, all smallmouth. His
nearest Arizona competition came from  &UR; Chris Peebles of Tucson, who
was 18th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used a conservative approach,'' Murray said. ``I didn't run
all over the river. I got a limit every day at a spot almost
identical to the structure at Roosevelt (Lake in Arizona).''
</P>
<P>
   One of the smallmouth weighed five pounds, which is huge for
that area.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said he found a shelf with a drop-off that had ridges.
That's where the fish were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used Carolina-rigged Zipper Worms and Yamamoto grubs to
catch the fish,'' he said. ``This feels a lot better than last
year.'' &QL; 
Upper dwellings to open &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've never visited the cliff dwellings of ancient Salado
Indians near Roosevelt Lake at Tonto National Monument, you've
missed an excellent experience.
</P>
<P>
   The lower dwellings, accessible by paved trail, are open
year-round. But the upper dwellings, a three-mile round trip, is
spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   The guided upper-dwelling tours, limited to 15 people with
reservations, begin Nov. 7 on Saturdays, Sundays and Thursdays.
Beginning Jan. 9, the tours will be offered on those three days
plus Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the National Park Service will interpret Sonoran
Desert ecology and the prehistoric Salado people who inhabited it.
The 40-room upper dwelling, occupied from about 1250 to 1450 A.D.,
is one of the best preserved Salado sites. It also offers a
spectacular view of the Tonto Basin below.
</P>
<P>
   There is no charge for the tours, but there is a $4 entrance fee
for vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The climb to the upper ruins is rather strenuous.
</P>

ABNER HAYNES HONORED BY SCHOOL WHERE HE ENCOUNTERED RACIAL
INDIGNITIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENTON, Texas _ A crowd began gathering around Abner Haynes as
he talked.
</P>
<P>
   He sounded like a preacher, his hands gesturing emphatically as
he talked of his playing days at North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 40 years had passed and instead of his touchdown rushes,
his American Football League days and his many awards, he talked of
a day he always wanted to forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a couple of guys burned my No. 28 at the student
union,'' Haynes said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a unique experience as an African-American trying to
integrate North Texas football in the racially turbulent late
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   He thought of the moment Thursday at a reception given by UNT in
his honor because of the sweet irony that moment represents.
</P>
<P>
   His No. 28 will once again hang at UNT, only this time in honor.
Almost 40 years later, Haynes has been invited back to UNT for the
retirement of his number during halftime of tonight's game at 6:35
p.m. at Fouts Field against Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I played here, in my wildest dreams, I never imagined
this,'' Haynes said. ``I remember my daddy telling me that playing
here was an honor because I had been given a chance to affect so
many people.''
</P>
<P>
   A fork clinked against a glass, and then all glasses raised in
unison. His proof waited before him in a multitude of faces that
had stopped by to say thanks.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, said a school cheerleader from back then, for helping to
open doors and minds. Thanks, said Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar
Hunt, for signing with an upstart Dallas Texans franchise and being
such a classy player. Thanks, said his wife, Lupe Gonzalez, for
always being an inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see how many people he touched shouldn't surprise me,''
Gonzalez said, ``but it still does. He has quite a story.''
</P>
<P>
   So, listen. Let Haynes tell his story.
</P>
<P>
   Let him tell of being denied a dorm room, of being showered with
racial slurs by opposing teams, of being in fear during games
because of his skin color.
</P>
<P>
   Then listen as he says, thanks: ``I always have been thankful to
this university for giving me a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   He signed with North Texas in 1956, mainly because his father,
Bishop F.L. Haynes, convinced him to. Abner Haynes had wanted to
avoid trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year at North Texas, in a freshman game in
Corsicana, trouble found him.
</P>
<P>
   A riot had started, angry opposing fans trying to attack him.
Haynes left that field with a human shield created by his teammates
as his only protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got on the bus and all of my white teammates were in shock.
They hadn't seen white people act like that,'' Haynes said. ``They
started coming to me one-by-one crying, saying: `Abner, we're
sorry. We didn't know it was like this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said: `You don't have to do this. You ain't them. We're a
team.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His team went 21-9-1 from 1957-59, bonded by both talent and
adversity. Haynes finished with 1,864 rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of them, the best one of them, only he wasn't: He
couldn't live on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to live in the black part of town, and I'd hitchhike out
here every day,'' Haynes said.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't eat in the dorms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to go to the black part of town and find a cafe, sleep
30 minutes and then start hitchhiking back,'' Haynes said.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Church members would send me little notes with $2, $3 in there
and I started feeling like I wasn't just representing myself. I was
representing a whole lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   He has represented them well. He was selected AFL player of the
year in 1960, his first season, and had an AFL title by 1962. He
finished his pro career with 4,630 yards rushing and 46 rushing
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The Texans became the Chiefs, and his number was retired with
them. He was honored by the NCAA in 1985 with the Silver
Anniversary Award for living a distinguished life after an
outstanding collegiate athletic career.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be back to where it all started tonight. The university
that once wouldn't feed him was now holding a reception in his
honor, the dorms that wouldn't house him were now welcoming him,
and the crowds that once jeered him will probably be cheering for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows what is possible,'' Haynes said.

RONNING'S LINE MAY KEEP ROENICK WITH TKACHUK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - A lot of attention has been focused on the
line combination of  &UR; Keith Tkachuk and  &UR; Jeremy Roenick and whether
the two stars can coexist on one line with only puck.
</P>
<P>
   The answer may have nothing to do with them, however, but rather
how well the Coyotes' other top line continues to produce.
</P>
<P>
   If center  &UR; Cliff Ronning and wingers  &UR; Greg Adams and  &UR; Rick
Tocchet keep showing the chemistry they displayed during Thursday's
5-2 rout of Colorado, Roenick and Tkachuk will have no choice but
to try to make it work on their own, along with gritty right wing
 &UR; Dallas Drake.
</P>
<P>
   Ronning said he thinks his line, which produced a goal and three
assists, is a match made in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some chances in the first game (a 4-1 loss Sunday to
Ottawa), but we weren't really clicking on the passes. We were a
little bit off,'' he said. ``But I felt it was just a matter of
time. All you've got to do is get those guys the puck one time
clean, and they're going to put it in the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping there's going to be some good things to come. We
enjoy playing on the same line, and we just seem to click. . . . We
want to be able to help our big stars and take some heat off of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronning and Tocchet are simply picking up where they left off
last season, when the duo combined for 46 points (15 goals, 31
assists) during the Coyotes' final 32 regular-season games. The
addition of the veteran Adams, a good finisher with skilled moves,
only figures to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking good,'' Coach  &UR; Jim Schoenfeld said. ``When our
other top guns start getting untracked, it's only going to be that
much better.'' &QL; 
Put a cork in it &QL; 
After two games, center  &UR; Bob Corkum already ranks among NHL
leaders, having won 23 faceoffs. He was 12 for 20 against Colorado
and 11 for 17 against Ottawa. And in both games, he was sent out to
take a majority of the critical draws when the puck was dropped in
the offensive zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a situation where you can have your best offensive people
on the ice, but if you lose the draw, it's behind the net or it's
up on the wing and the other team is breaking out,'' Schoenfeld
said. ``I want to make sure we come up with possession on the
faceoff and try to get scoring chances from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go with your gut sometimes. You go with what works, like a
Corkum, who's always a steady guy.'' &QL; 
Opening Night III &QL; 
Because the Coyotes have had three days off between each of their
first three games, all of them on home ice, Schoenfeld said it's
like playing three different opening nights, which is good and bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with the length of time we have to play three
games,'' he said. ``To lose (to Colorado) and then have another
three days before the next one (Monday against Boston), you'd end
up driving yourself crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier once you're into a
three-games-in-five-nights situation. You go through a little bit
of withdrawal this way.'' &QL;

PADRES HAVE MORE TO LOSE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a cold, damp Sunday night in the South Bronx, seventh game
of the World Series, ninth inning. Moments like this, the New York
Yankees have owned for three-quarters of a century.
</P>
<P>
   So why are the San Diego Padres crouched on the third-base
dugout steps, poised for an on-the-field party while long-faced
Yankees slouch on their bench?
</P>
<P>
   This October, more than any other, was supposed to belong to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   So why is Trevor Hoffman stomping a path to the pitcher's mound
for the bottom of the ninth, about to finish off the Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be the night New York won its 125th game of
1998, laying claim to the title, Greatest Yankees of Them All.
</P>
<P>
   So why is Fox TV filling the precious minutes between
half-innings with a video jubilee of Kevin Brown strikeouts, Ken
Caminiti backhanders, Tony Gwynn gappers and Jim Leyritz home runs?
</P>
<P>
   This, their second World Series in three years, was supposed to
mark the new Yankees dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   So why is the guy who cues up the postgame ``New York, New
York'' tossing that tape aside, realizing ``One for My Baby'' might
be a more appropriate song to send this Yankee Stadium crowd home?
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks couldn't lose.
</P>
<P>
   So what in the name of Brian Boehringer went wrong?
</P>
<P>
   What happened is that this October, which began as a referendum
on the Yankees, has been taken over by the Padres. By Brown,
Leyritz, Sterling Hitchcock and 65,000 fans in 59,000 Qualcomm
Stadium seats. And now the Padres are about to win their first
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   When they do it, we'll look back and say the Yankees went down
for the same reason the past eight teams with the major leagues'
best regular-season record failed to win it all.
</P>
<P>
   Their bats weighted down by expectations, they stopped hitting.
The 1990 Oakland A's, the '92 Atlanta Braves and the '95 Cleveland
Indians, regular-season leaders and World Series failures, averaged
less than three runs a game against the Cincinnati Reds, the
Toronto Blue Jays and the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it could even happen to the Yankees. By next weekend, we'll
realize the Padres were just the team to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Look at how the Yankees beat the Texas Rangers and the Indians
in the AL playoffs. Not with homers but with pitching, winning
games by 2-0, 3-1, 4-0, 4-0 and 5-3. The Yankees had David Wells,
David Cone and El Duque. The Rangers (4.99 ERA, 12th in the AL) and
the Indians (4.44, fifth) couldn't match up.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres (3.63, third in the National League) bear no
resemblance to the Rangers and the Indians. They won playoff games
by 2-1, 2-1, 3-2 (in 10 innings), 3-0, 4-1 and 5-0. Brown
outpitched Randy Johnson and Tom Glavine. Andy Ashby outpitched
John Smoltz. Hitchcock outpitched Glavine and Greg Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres weren't afraid of a little pitchers' duel. So much
for that Yankees advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have David Wells on a season-long roll. The Padres,
by virtue of having finished off the Braves in six games, have
Brown ready to face him in tonight's World Series opener.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is the playoffs' hottest starter (0.38 ERA). The Padres
played .600 ball against left-handers like Wells in the regular
season. So much for THAT Yankees advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are playing for a place in history. But seriously,
do even they believe a team with Chuck Knoblauch leading off,
Bernie Williams batting cleanup and Ricky Ledee in left field could
be the greatest Yankees of them all? That rallying cry won't cut
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, meanwhile, are playing for nothing less than the
survival of the franchise in San Diego, for voter approval in
November of a new ballpark. That's a rallying cry to be proud of.
So much for THAT Yankees advantage.
</P>
<P>
   When the Padres win it, we'll look back and say it was because
they were the right team for the right time, because Gwynn couldn't
hit .220 for an entire postseason, because Leyritz might be the
most ungainly specimen ever to fit into Cinderella's slipper, and
because a club with Hoffman in the bullpen really has to play only
eight innings a night.
</P>
<P>
   So we go to the bottom of the ninth. Last chance for the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Chili Davis chases a high Hoffman fastball and strikes out. Tino
Martinez flails at a Hoffman slider and strikes out. Ledee golfs a
soft fly ball to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman throws both fists in the air. Wally Joyner bounds toward
him, arms spread wide. Caminiti glides toward them, his legs
pain-free for the first time in months. The catcher-cam attached to
Leyritz's mask puts the nation in the middle of the incipient
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   In right field, Gwynn has been waiting for this ball for 16
years. He squeezes it. Series over.
</P>
<P>
   Padres in seven.
</P>

DESERT STAR WILL FADE FROM SIGHT

<P>
   PHOENIX - Wave bye-bye to the Desert Star Classic at Phoenix
International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   But don't put down the welcome mat just yet for the NASCAR Busch
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we're talking to NASCAR about a Busch race next year,''
PIR President  &UR; Buddy Jobe said. ``We want one. We think it's a
dynamite series. But whether we get one is 50-50 right now. If it
was close to being a done deal, I'd tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jobe would (wink, wink).
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the only certainty is there will be no Desert
Star event in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The event brought together on one April weekend the NASCAR
Craftsman Truck Series, NASCAR Winston West and U.S. Auto Club
Sprints. Although the truck race was moved to the March 26-28
weekend, where it will share the spotlight with the Indy Racing
League _ the Winston West and USAC sprints disappear entirely from
the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Desert Classic) wasn't losing money, it just wasn't
reaching the potential we always hoped it would,'' Jobe said.
</P>
<P>
   Jobe believes moving the trucks to the same weekend as the IRL
race also will aid the growth of the fledging IRL, whose events at
PIR have been poorly attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think moving the trucks to the IRL weekend is a better time
slot for our race fans,'' Jobe said. ``And we also felt if we
combined the two, it would maybe boost up the IRL a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the only cure for PIR's poor IRL crowds would be to
add the rival Championship Auto Racing Teams series to the docket.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry about that, Buddy.
</P>
<P>
   Jobe, however, remains adamant that the IRL series was the
direction to go when it was created three years ago by Indianapolis
Motor Speedway President Tony George.
</P>
<P>
   But if that were true, wouldn't fans be knocking down the PIR
door by now?
</P>
<P>
   They're not, but that's another subject for another day.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the Busch Series topic, all NASCAR officials will say
is that the 1999 schedule likely will be released within two weeks,
perhaps as early as next weekend during the Dura Lube 500 at PIR.
</P>
<P>
   If PIR is awarded a Busch date, the race would be held next Nov.
6, the day before a scheduled NASCAR Winston Cup race. A Busch race
also would displace a second Truck Series race held every year at
PIR during its Winston Cup weekend, leaving PIR with one annual
truck race, not two.
</P>
<P>
   A Truck Series official said next year's schedule will be
announced on Friday at PIR.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can tell you is we're pushing for a Busch race next
year,'' Jobe said. ``Whether it happens next year is anybody's
guess. But I think they would like to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens, the NASCAR Southwest Tour Series will
return as a support race next year during the Winston Cup weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting next year's IRL and truck pairing will be a Formula
2000 race. But the STAR Mazda series, which appeared this year with
the IRL cars, has been dropped. &QL; 
Pit stops &QL; 
Team Menard has announced plans to participate in all 11 IRL races
next season.  &UR; Thomas Knapp is the new general manager, but who will
replace driver  &UR; Tony Stewart?  &UR; Robby Gordon?  &UR; J.J. Yeley? If I had
a few extra bucks to bet, I'd pick  &UR; Greg Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget today's 1 p.m. Race Against Drugs celebrity event
on a temporary oval track near First and Washington streets in
downtown Phoenix. Drivers will be racing half-scale NASCAR
machines. Indianapolis 500 winners  &UR; Arie Luyendyk and  &UR; Tom Sneva
are two of the participants.
</P>
<P>
   Lealand McSpadden is the newest member of the Arizona Auto
Racing Hall of Fame. It's about time. &QL;

GALAXY LOSES IN SHOOTOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Everything the Los Angeles Galaxy accomplished the
last six months _ all the goals, all the wins, the level of
dominance never before seen in Major League Soccer -- came crashing
down Friday night in the cruellest manner imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Another tense showdown with the Chicago Fire turned disastrous
after the final whistle as L.A. watched its season reach an abrupt
end in little more than a crapshoot, their hosts pulling out a 2-1
shootout victory before 32,734 at Soldier Field to nail down a spot
in MLS Cup '98.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Marsch -- the hero of the Fire's victory in the opener of
the Western Conference finals -- and Jerzy Podbrozny converted on
the final two rounds of the tiebreaker to send Chicago up against
D.C. United or Columbus in next weekend's championship game at the
Rose Bowl and leave the Galaxy wondering about what might have
been.
</P>
<P>
   ``This spoils it,'' Cobi Jones said of L.A.'s record-breaking
regular-season campaign. ``It doesn't matter how great a season you
have, if you don't make it to the final and win it, it takes it
away.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a typical Galaxy-Fire battle, defined by defense --
particularly Chicago's -- and determined by the Fire's better
fortune at the finish. ``It's a flip of the coin,'' said L.A.
defender Greg Vanney, who missed his shootout attempt after his
first touch wasn't strong enough. ``You might as well flip a
coin.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how the series has played out all season, with five of
six meetings coming down to the final minutes; this one might have
been determined earlier if not for an inspired performance from
Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman and a pair of posts, which teamed
to keep Chicago from scoring more than once.
</P>
<P>
   Twice shots by Ante Razov cracked into the left post -- once
after slamming off defender Joe Franchino -- but Hartman's best
save turned against him, just like in the opener. It occurred in
the 31st minute, after a long pass from C.J. Brown got caught in
the wind, floating over Robin Fraser and leaving Razov one-on-one
against the goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman dove to push it aside, but Peter Nowak -- following up
the play -- ripped the rebound into the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``C.J. played the ball where I expected he'd play it, but the
wind put it over my head,'' Fraser said. ``These things happen.
Hopefully, they never happen in a big game, but it turned out,
obviously, to be a fatal mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy, which dominated the opener but couldn't penetrate
the Fire defense, pulled even six minutes later when Chicago left
Danny Pena alone in their box. Jones, on the right wing, sent in a
cross and Pena had time to trap it, set it, look up to see his
options and calmly slot it home.
</P>
<P>
   L.A., which had promised a few new wrinkles, offered just one,
sending defender Ezra Hendrickson to the front line in place of
Welton. It didn't lead to much, L.A. managing few chances although
it was the better team in the second half, when it had the wind at
its back. That also meant little: It got off four shots on goal,
none in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some opportunities,'' Jones said. ``They handled us
pretty well, but we broke through their defense a few times, and
there were some lapses on their part that we needed to capitalizde
on and we didn't. We might have been a little out of sync.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't seem so at the beginning of the shootout, although
Jones' first try was stopped when the five-second clock failed to
start. He didn't get as good a touch on his second attempt and
fired wide after racing past goalkeeper Zach Thornton, but Welton's
blast gave L.A. an advantage on the second round. Thornton stopped
the Galaxy's final three attempts, by Martin Machon, Mauricio
Cienfuegos and Vanney.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman also started strong, stopping Nowak and Razov and
forcing Tom Soehn to fire wide. But Marsch chipped him and
Podbrozny's passing shot finished the Galaxy off.
</P>
<P>
   And the Galaxy was left wondering if the better team won.
</P>
<P>
   If you look at the teams, player to player, Jones offered, we
have the better players. But tactically, they were the better team.

ARIZONA MEASURES INCLUDE WATER PROJECTS, ANTI-DRUG EFFORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 and ADRIANNE FLYNN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ States will have temporary veto power over any new
Indian casinos under a massive budget bill that also further
postpones a controversial Southwest border-entry program.
</P>
<P>
   The $500 billion budget also contains new border drug-fighting
money and approval for several water projects in Arizona, including
one labeled ``an environmental disaster'' by a conservation group.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the bill includes language prohibiting the use of
federal funds to study draining Lake Powell _ a plan once floated
by environmentalists to try to restore the Grand Canyon to its
natural state.
</P>
<P>
   But the foot-thick budget bill, which was agreed upon Thursday
but will not be voted on by Congress until Tuesday, is just as
noteworthy for what was left out.
</P>
<P>
   Omitted was Arizona Sen. John McCain's legislation designed to
create new competition in the airline industry by adding new slots
at airports, along with more air traffic controllers. Also absent
was McCain's companion measure requiring new environmental reviews
before commercial air tour planes could fly over national parks.
</P>
<P>
   The omissions were surprising given McCain's sway as chairman of
the Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am deeply disturbed that the House leadership has killed
aviation competition legislation this session of Congress,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the session, McCain saw his giant tobacco-regulation
bill and his campaign-finance reform bill killed by senators of his
own party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was not the only Arizonan who sponsored ambitious
legislation that came up short at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., couldn't move on his victims' rights
constitutional amendment, patterned after Arizona law, and also saw
his bill to ban gambling on the Internet stalled in the House. GOP
Rep. Bob Stump's crusade to impose a stricter burial policy for the
nation's premier veteran's cemetery, Arlington, stalled in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The budget bill, which averted a partial government shutdown,
was cobbled together on the fly as lawmakers sought to return home
to campaign for the election in a little more than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the bill was at a premium; staff members at
federal agencies said some elements of the final budget agreement
were scrawled on notepads and still had not been translated into
legislative language.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, for example,
said they had still not seen a copy of the final language covering
new tribal casinos.
</P>
<P>
   However, White House and congressional sources said the tribes
won a partial victory.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Republican senators, backed by the Las Vegas casino
industry and the Christian Coalition, had pushed for a provision to
give states veto power for a year over new Indian casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration argued that Indians need a remedy
when states refuse to discuss Indian gaming. The tribes supported a
plan by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt for his department to step
in and negotiate gaming agreements directly with tribes when states
decline to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   The battle ended in compromise. Lawmakers finally agreed to
postpone consideration of Babbitt's plan for six months _ which
means states can block new casino plans until then, but perhaps not
forever.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also:
</P>
<P>
   Mandates a delay of 2{ years in an entry-exit documentation
program on both the U.S. southern and northern borders. At one time
during negotiations, the program was to be delayed indefinitely
along the Canadian border but delayed only a year along the Mexican
border. Arizona members charged that was inequitable treatment and
argued for the common delay. Critics say the program, which will
require border crossers to fill out forms to enter or exit the
country, will create border congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Also being delayed, for two years, is a fraud-proof visa. The
cost of the new visas, which will replace standard border crossing
cards, will be higher than Arizona members wanted: $45 for adults
and $13 for children under the age of 15.
</P>
<P>
   Approves the transfer of a Colorado River basin agricultural
water project from the federal government to the Wellton-Mohawk
Irrigation District. The district repaid the government for the
cost of construction and is now taking title from the Department of
the Interior under a negotiated memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   Provides $690 million to keep drugs from entering the United
States, including $90 million to be spent directly on the Southwest
border.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the $90 million is for X-ray machines to detect drugs
hidden in vehicles. It also includes resources to bring three
Blackhawk helicopters out of mothballs for Customs Service patrols,
and $13 million to bring anti-drug technology to state and local
law-enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Provides funds to continue the Tres Rios effluent reclamation
project in Phoenix and creates language to prohibit federal funds
from being used to study the draining of Lake Powell. The draining
idea was floated in 1996 by the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   Provides $15 million for a health center at Fort Defiance.
</P>
<P>
   Provides $4 million to purchase the Bar T Bar Ranch outside
Flagstaff for a park. &QL;

WARNER LAST CAL HERO AGAINST HUSKIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ They were two football teams headed for losing
seasons. California's glory had come the previous year, with a
Pacific-8 co-championship in 1975. Washington, on the other hand,
was a season away from a Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Juxtaposed between those benchmark years was 1976, and an early
November game at Husky Stadium between the Bears and Huskies. In a
meeting of small consequence, the day would boil down to pride and
personal initiative, and maybe that explains why the hero was Bob
Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's married, 43 years old, and has children 14 and 12, and
Warner will drive down from his home in Burlington Saturday to see
if Cal might do it again. The Bears haven't beaten Washington since
'76 _ 15 straight games _ when Warner, as a 6-foot, 220-pound nose
guard, had 19 tackles and was named Pac-8 defensive player of the
week in Cal's 7-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a couple of games where I did reasonably well,'' Warner
said, recalling his Cal days, ``but that was probably by far my
best outing.''
</P>
<P>
   Huskies don't much remember that day, nor was there reason to.
Warren Moon, 19 years old then and the UW quarterback, can't recall
it. Washington was 4-4, Cal 3-5, and this was an undistinguished
game that would steer the Huskies toward their only losing season
under Don James.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, they rampaged to the Rose Bowl and started a
streak of winning seasons (21) that hasn't stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Taylor, the late Post-Intelligencer sportswriter, was no
more inspired by the game than the small crowd of 42,932. Taylor's
lead paragraph the next day:
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington and California, a couple of teams going nowhere,
spent the better part of a long, dull afternoon at Husky Stadium
heading in the same direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner had grown up in Arlington and played two seasons of
junior-college ball at Everett. At that time, both major-college
programs in Washington were in a state of flux, with Jim Owens
giving way to James after the 1974 season and Jim Sweeney stepping
down at Washington State a year later. So Warner accepted Cal's
scholarship offer.
</P>
<P>
   Warner was in the final month of his football-playing days when
the Bears came to Seattle for a slug-it-out affair by the lake. The
Huskies relied then on the pounding thrusts of 250-pound fullback
Robin Earl.
</P>
<P>
   Moon was a junior not yet popular with Seattle fans. The Huskies
that year completed 44.4 percent of their passes, a depth they
haven't visited since.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran out on the field,'' recalls Ralph DeLoach, a Cal
defensive lineman on that team and later an NFL player. ``One of
our defensive tackles ran at the dog (the UW mascot) and kind of
barked at it. The dog ran away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defensive line was pretty small, but we basically had the
idea that if we stopped Robin Earl before he got to the
linebackers, we had a good chance of stopping him.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was scoreless late in the first half when Washington
mounted four straight first downs and found itself facing
third-and-2 at the Cal 31 with 24 seconds and one timeout left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole stadium knew where it was going,'' says Ken
McAllister, a Cal cornerback now in investment counseling in the
Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Earl went straight ahead but came up about a foot short of the
first down. There were still seconds enough for the Huskies to
signal timeout and send on the field goal team.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, however, Moon gathered the offense, reared up and
threw the ball out of bounds to stop the clock, turning it over to
Cal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe what he had just done,'' McAllister said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took heat for that,'' said Jeff Toews, former UW and NFL
guard now living in San Jose. ``That was a tough thing. Of course,
the rest is history.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the play this week, Moon said, ``I don't remember
much about it. I thought it was against Stanford.''
</P>
<P>
   And this was before Moon got knocked out. He was rendered woozy
by a hit in the third quarter and replaced by Duane Akina, now an
assistant at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Moon re-entered, but the Husky offense went nowhere. The
penetration before the half was Washington's deepest of the game.
And finally, Cal broke the standoff on Tom Newton's 2-yard
touchdown run in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Says Warner of Moon, ``I just remember, at that time the Huskies
didn't utilize him as the throwing quarterback he turned out to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two years later, Moon is still throwing footballs for the
Seahawks. Warner works for a beer distributor in Burlington. And
Cal will try again to beat Washington, with the stakes higher than
they were that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It meant nothing,'' Warner says, ``other than to just play the
game, and for personal pride. For me, I knew I'd have a lot of
people _ parents and family and friends _ that would be there
watching.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLoach remembers what those people saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby Warner,'' he says, ``had the game of his life.''

ROBITAILLE LIFTS KINGS IN OVERTIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ A year ago, the Los Angeles Kings and Boston
Bruins were the most improved teams in the National Hockey League,
making their gains by working hard and concentrating on defense.
</P>
<P>
   It became clear Friday night in the Kings' home opener, a 2-1
victory before a sellout crowd of 16,005 at the Forum, that the
formula for the teams won't be any different this year _ the NHL's
offense-friendly rules changes have yet to have much effect.
</P>
<P>
   It took a goal by Luc Robitaille with 2:13 to play in overtime
to break the stalemate, a 40-foot slap shot between the pads of
Boston goalie Byron Dafoe, an ex-King.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, if it hadn't been for a pair of rookies with six
games of NHL experience between them, there wouldn't have been any
goals. The Kings' 20-year-old Josh Green scored his first NHL goal
in the first period, and 25-year-old Finnish rookie Antti Laaksonen
responded in the second for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Stephane Fiset was solid in stopping 22 shots for the Kings
(2-1), and Boston (2-1-1) got nearly as strong an effort from
Dafoe, who made 25 stops.
</P>
<P>
   Kings defenseman Steve Duchesne saved the game for the Kings in
the closing minutes of regulation when he stood in the crease to
block a 10-foot shot by Boston's Sergei Samsonov with Fiset out of
position.
</P>
<P>
   The night began with the now traditional laser-and-fireworks
festivities that mark home openers, with an appearance by former
Kings star Marcel Dionne and the presentation of the Norris Trophy
to Rob Blake thrown in for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the game, exactly the sort of defensive struggle that
could have been predicted between the Kings and Bruins. For most of
the first two periods, the Bruins could muster only seven shots on
goal, though they were denied one goal by the length of a skate
blade in the crease early in the middle period.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins entered the game with a two-game shutout streak and
hadn't allowed a goal in the previous 151 minutes, 29 seconds.
Dafoe had started all three games for Boston, posting an
absurdly-low 0.97 goals-against average while stopping 91 of 94
shots.
</P>
<P>
   But the streak ended 10:50 into the game, with the Kings on a
power play after Bruins defenseman Don Sweeney was sent off for
holding Robitaille at 9:30.
</P>
<P>
   The play leading to the goal began with a strong effort by Yanic
Perreault along the left boards to keep the puck in Boston's zone.
Perreault got the puck to Robitaille, who passed the puck to Doug
Bodger at the blue line. Bodger fired a 59-footer at Dafoe, who
made the save with his right leg. Green, left all alone to the
right of Dafoe, pounced on the rebound and slipped it into a
virtually empty net.
</P>
<P>
   Six minutes into the second period, it appeared the Bruins had
tied the score on a power play, when Rob DiMaio deflected a
blue-line shot by Darren Van Impe.
</P>
<P>
   But a review of the videotape revealed that just before the puck
entered the net Boston forward Chris Taylor, while tangled with
Blake, had his right foot into the crease, and the goal was
disallowed.
</P>
<P>
   The disallowed goal was the third involving the Kings in the
last two games. In their 4-2 loss at Vancouver four days earlier,
two Kings goals were disallowed, including a late controversial
call that cost them a tying goal.
</P>
<P>
   Given the reprieve, the Kings continued to play solid defense
but mustered little in the way of an attack of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, though, the Bruins broke through, with a goal off a
faceoff to the right of Fiset. A quick shot from the left circle by
Laaksonen beat Fiset, who appeared to be screened by teammate
Philippe Boucher and Boston's Ken Baumgartner, an ex-King.
</P>
<P>
   With the goal, the Bruins seized the momentum, almost taking the
lead one minute later when Fiset was caught out of position with
Jason Allison alone in front with the puck. Duchesne made the
goal-saving play, knocking the net off its moorings for a
comparatively harmless delay-of-game penalty.
</P>
<P>
   It almost wasn't so harmless, however, because defenseman Sean
O'Donnell's subsequent and needless roughing penalty with 1:01 left
in the period put his team two men short for 32 seconds, a crisis
the Kings were able to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Into the third period the game proceeded, with scoring chances
few and far between. The Bruins got a very dangerous opportunity
midway through the period, when Allison was left alone to Fiset's
right for a 10-foot one-timer. But Fiset calmly swatted away
Allison's shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' chance to win in regulation came with 5:14 left, when
Bruins defenseman Dave Ellett, reaching for an airborne puck,
clipped Steve McKenna in the face with his stick and drew a
two-minute penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings were unable to do anything with the opportunity,
and had to wait until the extra period, when Robitaille caught
Dafoe off-guard by firing the puck on a rare outnumbered rush.

ARTHUR I. BLOOMFIELD, ECONOMIST AND EDUCATOR, 84

 (ATTN: Md.)  (js) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arthur I. Bloomfield, an economist, author and educator, died on
Oct. 6 at the Maplewood Park Place Nursing Center in Bethesda, Md.,
from degenerative neurologic disease, his wife, Dorothy, said. He
was 84 and lived in Bethesda.
</P>
<P>
   A specialist in international trade and finance, Bloomfield
wrote many books on the topic, including ``Capital Imports and the
U.S. Balance of Payments'' (1950), ``Monetary Policy under the
International Gold Standards, 1880-1914'' and ``Essays in the
History of International Trade Theory'' (1994).
</P>
<P>
   A native of Montreal, Bloomfield received his bachelor's and
master's degrees from McGill University.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the University of Chicago in 1942 with a
doctorate in economics, he joined the staff of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, where he was a senior economist and consultant
until 1958.
</P>
<P>
   From 1949 to 1950, while at the New York Fed, Bloomfield served
as a financial adviser to the Bank of Korea, helping to create the
foundation of the country's central bank in the post-war world. He
later served as a financial adviser to the Korean Ministry of
Finance and the U.N. Korean Reconstruction Agency.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, Bloomfield left the New York Fed to accept a teaching
post at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   He remained a member of the economics faculty there until he
retired in 1985. During that period, he was also a visiting
professor at a number of institutions, including Columbia and
Princeton Universities and the University of Melbourne in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomfield is survived by his wife, the former Dorothy E. Reese;
a sister, Harriet Joseph of Scarsdale, N.Y.; a stepson, Alan Reese
of Memphis; five nephews; and four nieces.

PIANIST JACQUES ABRAM, 84 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.Y.)  (js)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jacques Abram, a pianist who performed regularly as a recitalist
and concerto soloist in New York in the 1940s and '50s, died in
Tampa, Fla., on Oct. 5. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Abram was known for performances that combined virtuosity and
precision with a modernist's interpretive coolness. He was praised
for the chiseled details he brought out in works by Scarlatti,
Haydn, Beethoven and Chopin, and he introduced contemporary works,
notably the Britten Piano Concerto and solo works by Norman Dello
Joio. He gave the Britten its U.S. premiere in Salt Lake City in
1948, and its first New York performance, with Stokowski
conducting, in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Lufkin, Texas and began improvising at the piano
when he was 3 and performed publicly when he was 6. During his
tours, he was heard by Rachmaninoff and Paderewski, who urged his
parents to enroll him at the Curtis Institute of Music in
Philadelphia, where he became a student of Ernest Hutcheson. He
studied at Curtis until he was 13, then with Josef Hofmann and
David Saperton at the Juilliard School.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, Abram won the National Federation of Music Clubs'
Schubert Memorial Award for young artists. The following year he
made his New York debut as a soloist with the Philadelphia
Orchestra, and played as a soloist with the New York Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   In the '50s he was an artist in residence at the University of
Toronto and the Royal Conservatory of Music. He moved to Tampa,
Fla., in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two sons, Jonathan, of Washington and Gregory,
of Croton, N.Y.; a daughter, Nell Abram of Tampa; and a brother,
Lynwood Abram of Louisville, Ky.

 PETER PAUL ARTASERSE, 98, JUDGE AND LAWMAKER IN NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Paul Artaserse, a retired Jersey City lawyer, Superior
Court judge and former state legislator, died Sunday at General
Hospital Center in Passaic. He was 98 and lived in Clifton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   He had suffered a brief illness, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Artaserse was the son of Italian immigrants and had eight
siblings. He was born in Manhattan and grew up in Jersey City,
where he lived most of his life. He never attended college, but
took night classes to earn his academic high school certificate and
the degree from New Jersey Law School with which he went into
private practice.
</P>
<P>
   He soon became active in the Hudson County Democratic Party and
in 1934 was elected to the Assembly. He held elected office for 17
years, rising to Democratic minority leader and dean of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Alfred E. Driscoll, a Republican, appointed him to Superior
Court in 1954, and he worked as a judge for 17 years in Hudson
County and on the Appellate Division. He stepped down as
assignment, or administrative, judge for the county in 1971 after
reaching the mandatory retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   Artaserse was then affiliated with what is now the Jersey City
firm of Schumann, Hanlon, Doherty, McCrossin &AMP; Paolino. He retired
from practice in 1989 at age 89.
</P>
<P>
   A former president of the Hudson County bar, he was also active
in Italian-American organizations in Jersey City. Among other
things, he was a past president of the Jersey City chapter of the
Dante Alighieri Society, a national organization for people
interested in the work of the author of ``The Divine Comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife of 53 years, Muriel Dodd Artaserse, died in 1997. He is
survived by their son, Peter, also of Clifton.

BATTLE OF PHONE GIANTS HAS A LONG DAY IN COURT  
 SHOPPING LIST SAYS DIAPERS; SAVING LIST SAYS CAP AND GOWN

<P>
   As the Microsoft antitrust lawsuit lurched toward trial, another
important technology case, consolidating eight suits about local
phone service, received a hearing from the Supreme Court last week.
</P>
<P>
   The complexity of the case _ oral arguments lasted two hours,
twice as long as the court usually permits _ should not obscure its
importance to consumers. The litigation has potentially slowed the
timetable for allowing residential consumers to choose their local
service providers, a step that could save Americans billions of
dollars on their phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the Telecommunications Act of 1996 lets
the Federal Communications Commission set a national structure of
rates that local phone companies can charge for access to their
networks. The government and long-distance carriers say yes. The
regional Bells _ Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, SBC
Communications and U S West _ and GTE would rather have state
commissions do it. A ruling is expected next year.
</P>
<P>
   The case may not have the Microsoft cachet. Still, only about
half of the nation's homes have computers, while almost all have
phones.

   The poll, conducted for Alliance Capital Management, a
money-management firm in New York, was based on phone interviews
with 1,006 adults. It found that more parents _ 55 percent _ were
saving regularly for college costs than last year, when 46 percent
said they were. They were also starting to save when their children
were younger: an average of 3.8 years old, compared with 5.1 last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe because they have more recent experience with college
expenses, the youngest parents were best at saving early: those 18
to 29 years old said on average that they began when their children
were younger than 2.

<P>
   Interviewers Glimpse More With Their Ears Than Their Eyes
</P>
<P>
   Body language, facial expressions, sweating patterns _ all
essential information for evaluating a would-be employee? Guess
again. Susan Straus, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University's
Graduate School of Industrial Administration, says that a job
interviewer can tell a lot more from the disembodied voice than the
live-and-in-person applicant.
</P>
<P>
   After mock interviews between graduate students and company
recruiters _ 29 by phone, 26 in person and 23 by videoconference _
applicants were appraised for conscientiousness, extroversion and
intelligence. ``The validity of interviewers' judgments of
applicants' traits generally was higher in telephone interviews
than in face-to-face or videoconference modes,'' she said. A
possible reason: On the phone, an interviewer cannot make judgments
based on physical stereotypes.

COMMENTARY: RENOVATING HUD  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quietly in this season of scandal the Clinton administration has
managed a significant advance in the most unlikely of areas:
low-income housing.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago the hard-riding, right-leaning Republican
majority in Congress brought a halt to all efforts to bring
additional units of affordable housing to poor families. Public
housing was in deep trouble and the prevailing political sentiment
seemed to be, ``Put it out of its misery.''
</P>
<P>
   The abolition of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, which administers the nation's public housing program,
was seriously considered.
</P>
<P>
   This regressive effort went further than anything that had taken
place during the Reagan years. It was particularly insidious in
that it occurred at a time when the nation's overall supply of
affordable housing was shrinking and the overall demand, because of
stagnating wages and other economic pressures, had increased
dramatically. The number of poor families in deep distress _ living
in grossly substandard housing, for example, or spending well over
50 percent of their gross incomes on rent _ had reached record
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Housing advocates spoke in tones of despair.
</P>
<P>
   Now, suddenly, comes passage of a housing measure that bolsters
HUD's budget by $2 billion, that will provide rent subsidies to
90,000 new families, that will begin to mix stable, working
families into housing projects that have been overwhelmed by the
indigent, and that will begin to desegregate projects that have
been racially segregated for decades.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the architect of this turnaround is Andrew
Cuomo, who took over as HUD secretary in January 1997. Cuomo
streamlined the agency and worked hard to salvage one of its most
important missions _ to provide safe and decent housing to families
shut out of the regular housing market.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s the number of new families getting rent subsidies
from the government each year was measured in the hundreds of
thousands. Ronald Reagan ratcheted that down to the tens of
thousands. By the time Cuomo became HUD secretary, the number of
new families getting subsidies was zero.
</P>
<P>
   So rent subsidies (in the form of housing vouchers) for 90,000
new families are a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy of ``deconcentration'' is also a big deal. The
idea is to begin admitting families with working adults and
somewhat higher incomes into projects populated almost exclusively
by very poor families. The goal is to provide an economic mix and
models of behavior that will ward off the social instability that
has ruined many public housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Cuomo, with the support of President Clinton,
has insisted that public housing projects begin to desegregate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public housing across the nation is as segregated as private
housing,'' said Cuomo. ``You have black projects and white
projects. There are places where you have Asian projects. The
president has spoken about one America. So we are saying that where
the federal government is the landlord, in our own house, let us
end segregation once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   The new legislation, which is about to be signed by the
president, requires housing authorities to submit for Cuomo's
approval a plan showing how they will begin deconcentrating and
desegregating their housing.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also will end what Cuomo called a major and
``foolish'' disincentive to work. Under existing rules, the amount
of rent in public housing can increase as a family's income
increases. The new legislation freezes rent for the first two years
of a family's increase in income.
</P>
<P>
   What is remarkable about Cuomo's effort is not the scope of the
bill. It's the fact that he was able to secure its passage in the
midst of the Lewinsky scandal and at a time when Congress is
controlled by conservative forces that have long been hostile to
the very idea of public housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The progressive forces stood their ground here,'' said Cuomo.
``There is a real hunger for intelligent, progressive leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I give Cuomo a lot of credit,'' said Robert Greenstein,
director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ``He turned
out to be a great negotiator. He did a brilliant job.''
</P>

COMMENTARY: IT WAS EVER THUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Best news of the week: Soccer moms may be history.
The election of 1998 may be decided by waitress moms.
</P>
<P>
   Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, says the most sought after
voters this year are working women under 55 who never went to
college and have children at home. They used to be Democratic
voters, but the Clinton sex scandal has alienated them and left
them up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   CNN interviewed a bunch of Flos at a Baltimore diner. And it
gave me a nice safe feeling to know that the fate of America is in
the sensible hands of gals who smoke and call customers ``Hon.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaniest news of the week: The New York Post reported that Saddam
Hussein, as part of his ``essential medical supplies'' package, has
asked the U.N. to send him a liposuction machine. (A U.N. official
confirmed the story, observing that the Iraqis did have a problem
with obesity before the war.) Saddam also ordered $209,000 worth of
teeth-whitening equipment. There was an unconfirmed report that the
Iraqis' humanitarian wish list also included silicone breast
implants. Their cosmetic requests are on hold. There is always the
danger that the technology of liposuction could be used to make
long-range missiles. And silicone has been known to be useful in
the manufacture of projectiles.
</P>
<P>
   Spookiest news of the week: Lucianne Goldberg, the Clinton
operetta's own literary agent, put a message on the Internet urging
anyone who can still muster a shred of interest in this stupid
scandal to come to a citizens' rally in Washington on Halloween.
This summit of Clinton-bashers, which Ms. Goldberg is calling the
National March for Justice, will take place in Lafayette Park,
across from the White House. Speakers will include the former FBI
agent Gary Aldrich, the psychologist Paul Fick, author of ``The
Dysfunctional President,'' and Larry Klayman of Judicial Watch. Ms.
Goldberg may be trying to balance out the march proposed by
``Beloved'' author Toni Morrison, who wants Clinton defenders to
rally in defense of the man she calls ``our first black
president.''
</P>
<P>
   All this, of course, underscores the need for more waitresses
and fewer literary lionesses involved in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Most Dada news of the week: HBO is talking to Oliver Stone about
developing a mini-series on the Founding Fathers, their ``trials
and tribulations.'' When the maker of ``JFK'' and ``Nixon'' is done
demystifying and demythologizing the Fathers of our country, Bill
Clinton will look like Solon.
</P>
<P>
   HBO's bright idea provides an unprecedented opportunity for
paranoia to go backward in time. It isn't hard to imagine what the
fearless and independent mind of Stone will discover.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson's dirty secret was not that he had an affair
with a black woman. It was that he was a black woman.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't Aaron Burr who was responsible for the shooting of
Alexander Hamilton. It was Lyndon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   One of the authors of the Federalist Papers _ Stone is not yet
prepared to say which one _ really was named Publius.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington, who was a natural-born killer, did not
destroy the cherry tree with an ax. He destroyed it with Agent
Orange.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Franklin's kite experiment was secretly subsidized by
the military industrial complex. Franklin's discovery of
electricity was not inadvertent. Its purpose was to prevent John
Kennedy from getting the United States out of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The famous muckraker James Callender was a cynical running dog
of the media elite who was secretly working for Rupert Murdoch _ a
fact you would know if you played Fleetwood Mac's ``Don't Stop
(Thinking About Tomorrow)'' backward.
</P>
<P>
   John Adams got George Washington to sign the Jay Treaty with
Britain in order to block the rise of Napoleon, which precipitated
the French sale of Louisiana, where Clay Shaw hatched the plot to
kill Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Henry did not really say, ``Give me liberty or give me
death.'' He said: ``Liberty, SI. Death, NO.'' This brought the
United States closer to its dream of dominating and plundering
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   It was not tea that was thrown overboard at the Boston Tea
Party. It was heroin smuggled in by Manuel Noriega and Samuel
Adams. This was a form of eco-terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Abigail Adams was really Lucianne Goldberg.

McWIDOWS GROUP MOST AT EASE JUST SHOOTING THE BREEZE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DENNIS McCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It's 9 a.m. at the McDonald's restaurant on
Ventura Boulevard in suburban Sherman Oaks, and the McWidows are
checking out a tableful of retired men across the room to see if
there are any new, interesting faces they haven't seen before.
</P>
<P>
   Nope, the McWidows agree. All the usual suspects. All married.
</P>
<P>
   ``How's Iser?'' Sara Roberts asks Dina Sofer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good,'' Sofer says, looking at her husband sitting with the
men.
</P>
<P>
   Dina's the only McWidow who has remarried, but the girls don't
hold it against her. Once a McWidow, always a McWidow.
</P>
<P>
   The only ground rule is that Iser stays over there with the men,
which doesn't seem to bother him too much.
</P>
<P>
   It's been going on this way for years now, even before the '94
earthquake really cemented their friendship, the women say.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, 9 a.m. sharp, the McWidows walk in and order a
cup of coffee, but no food, find a booth and sit down to shoot the
breeze.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, they get up and get on with their own separate,
diverse lives.
</P>
<P>
   They have little in common except their widowhood. Different
political bents, different religions and certainly different
backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what makes these morning meetings at McDonald's a
must, the McWidows say. It's like a therapy session and social
outing all rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   And it all began years ago with one lonely woman looking across
the eating area of a fast-food restaurant and seeing the face of
another lonely woman.
</P>
<P>
   She must have looked pretty forlorn the day Kathryn Goldstein
walked up to her to introduce herself about seven years ago,
Elizabeth Sachs says.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Henry, had been coming to this McDonald's
in Sherman Oaks most mornings from their apartment a few miles
away. He would drive; she would walk for the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Now Henry was gone, and she was feeling pretty lonely sitting
here all by herself, sipping a cup of coffee in this restaurant
full of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come join us,'' Kathryn said that morning. ``We're an informal
little group. We call ourselves the McWidows.''
</P>
<P>
   Sachs found a smile starting to form on her face, the first
smile she felt coming on in quite a while. The McWidows: What a
marvelous name, she thought. She would love to join them, she told
Kathryn.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it began for her, how it began for all of them. For
Rosemond Demetropoulos, Millie Finell, Marion Kassoy, Sara Roberts
and Dina Sofer. One widow reaching out to another at a fast-food
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friendship'' is the word you hear most from the McWidows, but
what these women have runs deeper than that, much deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Sara could never have made it through those dark days when her
son was battling a malignant brain tumor if the McWidows had not
been there for her, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, there was a note or a card in the mail, a message
on my answering machine, a prayer being offered,'' she says.
``These were women who had been strangers to me only months
earlier, and were now like family, helping me get through one of
the toughest times of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   If any of them misses a couple of mornings, Marion and Millie
say, the phone starts ringing in their homes. ``Are you OK?''
Rosemond will ask. ``Do you need anything?'' Elizabeth will want to
know. It goes on this way for all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all keep busy and have our own lives,'' Millie says. ``But
that hour in the morning belongs to the McWidows.''
</P>
<P>
   It took about a month after the Northridge Earthquake for them
to find their bearings again. About a month to come back to the
Valley after moving in with their kids or other relatives while
they got over all the shaking and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   But once the ground started to settle down, and their lives took
on some sort of normalcy, they began to wander back into McDonald's
again to see if any of the other McWidows had made it back.
</P>
<P>
   They had. One by one.
</P>
<P>
   They hugged and cried, glad to see each other. Missing each
other. It didn't take them long to take up where they left off.
</P>
<P>
   Wandering in every morning around 9 a.m. to order a cup of
coffee, but no food. Sitting in their favorite booth and shooting
the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, looking over to check out the table where the
retired men sat. Trying to see if there were any new, interesting
faces that morning -- instead of the usual, married suspects.

SPORTS COLUMN: ADD PADRES TO YANKEES' SERIES LORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the Yankees, it's as if the San Diego Padres were
a new theatrical troupe on the other side of the World Series
stage. Some of the new actors are sure to endure in the Yankees'
Series lore.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees having appeared in more than a third of all the
World Series since 1903, their opponents are always as much a part
of Series history as their own October icons: Babe Ruth, Lou
Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle and Reggie Jackson. And now two
or three Padres will have their Series moments, for better or for
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Will a Padre (Tony Gwynn?) torture the Yankees the way the
Pirates' Bill Mazeroski did with his Series-winning homer off Ralph
Terry in 1960?
</P>
<P>
   Will a Padre pitcher (Kevin Brown?) dominate the Yankees as
Johnny Podres did in his seventh-game 2-0 shutout in 1955, the only
time the Brooklyn Dodgers won the Series?
</P>
<P>
   Or will a Padre (almost anyone) be as embarrassed as Dodger
catcher Mickey Owen was in 1941 when he let a third strike get past
him in Brooklyn?
</P>
<P>
   The Padres also offer the possibility of a twist to the Yankees'
usual Series plot. Except for Lew Burdette, a late-season Yankee
rookie in 1950 who won three games for the Milwaukee Braves in the
1957 Series, the Yankees have never had an ex-Yankee haunt them in
the Series, but the Padres have four familiar ex-Yankees: catcher
Jim Leyritz, left-hander Sterling Hitchcock, outfielder Ruben
Rivera and right-hander Brian Boehringer.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz, whose three-run homer off Mark Wohlers in Game 4 at
Atlanta turned the 1996 Series, could end up being the first Yankee
Series hero to become a Yankee Series nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres have another ex-Yankee, sort of. Their left fielder,
Greg Vaughn, was traded to the Yankees during the 1997 season but
flunked a physical exam because of a damaged shoulder, killing the
deal. This season he was healthy enough to hit 50 homers.
</P>
<P>
   In winning a record 23 of 34 Series, the Yankees have conquered
eight other National League franchises _ the Dodgers (both in
Brooklyn and Los Angeles), the Giants (both in New York and San
Francisco), the Cardinals, the Braves (both in Milwaukee and
Atlanta), the Reds, Cubs, Pirates and Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Cardinals hold a Series edge on the Yankees, 3-2,
winning in 1926, 1942 and 1964 against losses in 1928 and 1943.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are 8-3 in Series against the Dodgers, 5-2 against
the Giants, 2-1 against both the Braves and the Reds, 2-0 against
the Cubs, 1-1 against the Pirates and 1-0 against the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Padres, who lost to the Detroit Tigers in five games in
1984 in their only other Series appearance, have an opportunity for
their players to be chiseled into Series lore as so many other
Yankee opponents have, good or bad.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Casey Stengel managed the Yankees to seven victories
in 10 Series (including five consecutive triumphs from 1949 through
1953), he was remembered as the New York Giants' center fielder who
hit an inside-the-park home run in the 1923 Series opener at Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh inning of the seventh game in 1926, Grover
Cleveland Alexander shook off a hangover from the night before,
shuffled out of the Cardinals' bullpen at the Stadium, struck out
second baseman Tony Lazzeri with the bases loaded, and preserved a
3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Waner, Lloyd Waner and their Pirate teammates were awed in
1927 when Ruth, Gehrig and the rest of Murderers Row took batting
practice the day before the Series that the Yankees swept.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Root was the Cubs' pitcher at Wrigley Field in 1932 when
Babe Ruth did or did not ``call'' his home run; some say the Babe
pointed to the center field seats, others say he pointed at Root.
</P>
<P>
   Cookie Lavagetto, a Dodger pinch-hitter, broke up Bill Bevens'
no-hitter with a two-out ninth-inning double at Ebbets Field for a
2-1 victory; Bevens had walked two previous batters, one
intentionally.
</P>
<P>
   Don Newcombe lost, 1-0, for the Dodgers in the 1949 opener at
Yankee Stadium on Tommy Henrich's ninth-inning homer.
</P>
<P>
   Willie McCovey drilled a two-out line drive to second baseman
Bobby Richardson in 1962, completing the Yankees' 1-0 victory
behind Ralph Terry in Game 7 in San Francisco with Matty Alou on
third base and Willie Mays on second.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Koufax struck out 15 Yankees for the Los Angeles Dodgers
in the 1963 opener at the Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Barney Schultz, the Cardinals' bullpen ace, fired the fastball
that Mickey Mantle smashed into the upper deck at Yankee Stadium
for a 2-1 victory in game 4 in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Burt Hooton, Elias Sosa and Charley Hough threw the pitches that
Reggie Jackson slugged for home runs at the Stadium against the
Dodgers in the 1977 finale.
</P>
<P>
   And now, at last, the Padres will be creating their own World
Series moments against the Yankees, win or lose.

L.A. SCHOOL DISTRICT STRUGGLES WITH ACCOUNTABILITY ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERRI HARDY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Nearly everyone agrees there is a simple,
dominant reason L.A. schools are broken: Teachers and
administrators are not being held accountable for student
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Even as test scores for students in the Los Angeles Unified
School District remain far below national and state averages, the
Board of Education and unions are negotiating to raise salaries
again without fulfilling their agreement to achieve accountability
rules under the contract negotiated just a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, other school districts including those in
Texas and Philadelphia have found ways to make teachers and
administrators responsible for improving student achievement, but
the L.A. district is lagging far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students are not achieving,'' said Bobbi Farrell, president of
the 31st Parent Teacher Student Association and member of a
district task force researching accountability policies. ``The time
has come to look at ourselves and figure out how to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond accountability, the sprawling Los Angeles school system
-- the nation's second-largest -- is struggling with how to involve
more parents and the community, how to give campuses more authority
and flexibility to tailor curricula, and how to address the
challenge of preparing children before they enter school.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle goes beyond the LAUSD.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere across the country, people are in a crucial
struggle to find what can be done to help schools and students
doing poorly -- California is behind the curve,'' said Gary Hart,
co-director for the Institute for Education Reform in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``People realize that the economic prosperity for the country is
dependent on an educated work force. The pressure is there to do
something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' efforts to establish accountability measures so far
have bogged down in finger-pointing between the school board and
unions. They cannot even agree on what constitutes accountability.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the LAUSD thought it was well on the way to
establishing a plan: Teachers and other employees agreed to work
together to come up with a way to link salary to student
achievement in return for a 10 percent raise over three years.
</P>
<P>
   Today there is still no plan, and the unions want another raise.
</P>
<P>
   Day Higuchi, president of the powerful United Teachers Los
Angeles, said he believes accountability has nothing to do with
coupling pay and student performance. Its main component, Higuchi
said, is setting up a system where failing teachers are evaluated
and supported by a peer review team.
</P>
<P>
   Doing anything more, Higuchi said, is unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no measurement device that works, that takes into
account all variables and provides an accurate account of a
teacher's performance,'' Higuchi said.
</P>
<P>
   Even school board members say they feel betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We operated on good faith, but they backed away from their
promises,'' said Victoria Castro, president of the Board of
Education, who last week voted in the minority against reopening
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our largeness works well for us often, in this case it works
against us,'' Castro said. ``To be successful, you have to include
everyone and have them buy into the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt such radical changes present an enormous challenge in
the nation's second-largest school district, with 910 schools and
centers that stretch from suburban West Hills to the port of San
Pedro, with 33,000 teachers and 690,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over the past year has met with some success,
including the formation of a task force and board committee to
search the nation for plans that work.
</P>
<P>
   But even though ``accountability'' is this year's buzz word for
educators, Los Angeles Unified and its unions have done little to
implement the concept.
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   --The Accountability Task Force failed to turn in its research
and recommendations by its August deadline, causing board member
David Tokofsky to ask, ``Where's the accountability for the
Accountability Task Force?''
</P>
<P>
   --Because task force recommendations were not available, board
members had no concrete proposals to use in negotiating with the
unions for pay hikes. Board members were forced to hastily craft a
few provisions, prompting Castro to note that a crucial opportunity
to implement meaningful reform was missed.
</P>
<P>
   --Superintendent Ruben Zacarias allowed his predecessor's
union-approved plan for accountability to expire. It would have
allowed intervention teams to evaluate and provide support for
failing schools.
</P>
<P>
   --Other LAUSD employee unions are not blameless. All nine
bargaining units that got raises last year and promised
accountability plans never provided them.
</P>
<P>
   (2ND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   The head of United Teachers Los Angeles, who pledged at a news
conference last year that a proposal would be completed by January,
blames the delay on the district.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias was so preoccupied in his first year that ``no one
could talk to him about anything,'' Higuchi said. He added that an
accountability plan is nearly ready to present to the union's board
for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Higuchi has recognized the handwriting on the wall. In
Higuchi's recent state of the union address printed in a
newsletter, he said: ``Accountability is not going to go away. It
will either come from us or be done to us. Let's take charge!''
</P>
<P>
   Recommendations for reform in the LAUSD by the Accountability
Task Force are expected to reach the superintendent by Oct. 31,
said Assistant Superintendent Gordon Wohlers.
</P>
<P>
   For some members of the LAUSD's Accountability Task Force,
accountability goes beyond choosing between incentives and
penalties for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Mitchell, a task force member who is the vice president for
education at the Getty Trust, said he is pushing for annual report
cards on each school's performance to be published.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best accountability plans involve parents and the
community _ report cards provide vital information for people to
get involved,'' said Mitchell, who also serves as senior education
adviser to Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   The PTSA's Farrell said parents' No.1 desire is more
communication with schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents want to hear from the teacher often, not just when
their child is not doing well,'' Farrell said. ``Any accountability
plan must require teachers to share expectations with parents and
students.''
</P>
<P>
   The board's Castro is frustrated that the task forces'
well-planned research was not included in the accountability
proposal the board gave to the teachers union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several people were advising the board to take their time,
including myself. Unfortunately, that didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 32 states and 34 large urban districts that have
accountability systems based, in part, on test scores.
</P>
<P>
   LAUSD might be the first urban school district to try to link
pay to student achievement, said Paul Hood, director of planning
and evaluation for WestEd, an educational research, development and
service firm based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: strong unions that resist such change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers unions argue that when you begin to pay teachers
differently you create problems,'' Hood said. ``Those problems
don't exist in the commercial world where employees are paid at
different levels, based on their work.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many states and large districts already have implemented
get-tough reform plans.
</P>
<P>
   Many educational experts agree that accountability systems that
work start with standards, or academic expectations for students at
each grade level. Over the past 12 months, California adopted
standards for core academic subjects: language arts, mathematics,
science and social science.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is deciding how to measure school performance
under those standards. This year, the Stanford 9 national
standardized test was given to all California students in grades 2
through 11. Some critics, however, believe those scores are not
representative of what children know and what teachers teach.
</P>
<P>
   Educators are split on the subsequent phase _ consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Texas school officials said they've seen a dramatic turnaround
just by publishing a list of poor performing schools. But other
school systems said it's crucial to take a ``carrot and stick''
approach, rewarding schools that do well and punishing those that
do not.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Board of Education agreed to cut the
superintendent's salary if he could not meet certain goals, such as
developing a districtwide training system for all employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hired the superintendent to implement a top to bottom
reform,'' said Philadelphia schools spokeswoman Pam Weddington.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it has worked. Schools are evaluated on several
indicators, including test scores, graduation and attendance rates.
Of the 260 schools, 60 percent have exceeded their goals,
Weddington said.

CHARTER SCHOOL TIES PAY TO TEACHERS' PERFORMANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERRI HARDY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Principal Yvonne Chan has beaten the L.A. school
district again: She has found a way to tie student achievement to
teacher performance.
</P>
<P>
   The much-praised head of the suburban San Fernando Valley's
first charter school said she is offering financial incentives for
teachers and other staff members who improve student test scores
and attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be the first ones within the LAUSD to pay
teachers for what they know and what they do,'' said Chan,
principal of Vaughn Next Century Learning Center in Pacoima.
</P>
<P>
   As a charter school, which operates almost completely
autonomously from its member district and state regulations, Vaughn
is free to carry out the plan without the rest of the Los Angeles
Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Los Angeles Board of Education is
wrestling with how to incorporate accountability for teachers and
administrators at its other schools. The board currently is
considering across-the-board raises for teachers and employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are being aggressive, proactive,'' Chan said. ``But anybody
could do it -- even the LAUSD.''
</P>
<P>
   Day Higuchi, president of United Teachers Los Angeles, said
Vaughn's incentive plan is complex and would be difficult to
implement districtwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we need to do is get our basic salary raised,
and then we could look at some of this stuff,'' Higuchi said.
</P>
<P>
   Chan said at Vaughn this year, only those that are competent
will be awarded.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers, for example, will be given a base pay depending on the
number of years worked. Then, their performance, as well as their
students', will determine if they get any additional money.
</P>
<P>
   If a teacher is judged to teach reading and writing effectively,
they get a $1,300 bonus. If the school's test scores go up, they
receive $1,500. If attendance rises, that's an extra $250.
</P>
<P>
   Other pay areas include competence with technology, encouraging
parent participation, and effectively disciplining students.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers will be ranked by their peers, administrators, parent
feedback and through a self-evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   A high-performing first year teacher, who is paid $31,000 at
other LAUSD schools, could make as much as $37,000 per year at
Vaughn, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools can't keep new teachers, there's a 50 percent
turnaround,'' Chan said. ``This is a way to keep the good ones.''
</P>
<P>
   For this year, only new teachers and those with under five years
of experience who chose to be on the plan -- about one-third of all
instructors -- are involved. Veteran teachers, Chan said, are more
reluctant because they believe, Why should I?
</P>
<P>
   Still, she believes that by next year, after the staff sees
positive results from students, all will come on board.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of financial incentives for teachers is a relatively
new one in the education community. There is no research to show
its effectiveness, and many educators are dubious, said Jerry
Hayward, co-director of Policy Analysis for California Education, a
joint project of Stanford University and the University of
California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Most troubling, Hayward said, is the use of standardized tests
to gauge a teacher's effectiveness, especially if the exam is not
aligned with what is taught in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``They run the risk of the teacher teaching to the test,''
Hayward said. ``And pitting teachers against each other is risky
business.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Hayward said other elements of Vaughn's plan are good,
including incentives that will encourage teachers to gain more
skills.
</P>
<P>
   A state accountability task force made up of business leaders
and educators that issued recommendations this year was split on
the incentive issue, said Hayward, a member of the panel.
</P>
<P>
   All agreed that schools showing progress should be rewarded,
with educators believing it should go to the campus for materials
or training, while business leaders thought the money should go to
individual teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, we were still split half and half,'' Hayward said.
</P>
<P>
   All other non-teaching employees at Vaughn are on the incentive
pay plan, including herself, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
   A scheduled 2 percent pay raise planned this year for all LAUSD
employees, as well as any additional hikes, will be collected by
Vaughn for all workers and placed in a fund. Incentives come from
that money.
</P>
<P>
   If Vaughn workers don't excel, the funds will go toward programs
to improve student performance or for training, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Vaughn's budget will be recast to include the
incentive program.

 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just over two weeks from Election Day, Republicans
are retreating from their hope that the White House scandal will
drive huge gains for their party, while some newly confident
Democrats now are daring to predict that they will even pick up
congressional seats this year.
</P>
<P>
   As a volatile election season enters its final stretch,
strategists in both parties said this week that the environment for
candidates seems to have returned to that of January, before the
scandal broke: Most incumbents are still widely favored to win, and
there are no overarching issues playing to one party's advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Many strategists in both parties agree that, for now, it appears
that Republicans, who hold a thin 11-seat majority in the House,
will pick up no more than a dozen seats there, perhaps far fewer.
These experts also expect that the Republicans will be short of a
net gain of five Senate seats, which would give the party the magic
60 votes needed to cut off a Democratic filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as late August, after President Clinton admitted
that he had had an affair with Monica Lewinsky and misled the
public about it, Republicans and Democrats alike boldly offered
scenarios of how the matter could cost Democrats dozens of House
seats and perhaps five Senate seats.
</P>
<P>
   But now, instead of chastising Clinton, many Democratic
candidates are waiting anxiously for results of a poll being
conducted this weekend for the House campaign of former Rep. Jay
Inslee in Washington state. Inslee is the only Democrat now
broadcasting a television commercial that attacks his opponent for
dragging out the impeachment inquiry. If the poll finds that Inslee
is gaining support, other Democrats may run similar advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as lawmakers who were stranded in Washington forging a
budget deal headed back to their districts to campaign this
weekend, there was great uncertainly _ and a feeling that more
political gyrations lie ahead. Political professionals and
candidates in both parties said they could not recall a year where
there was so much uncertainty over how to proceed so close to the
election _ or over what messages to push in the final days. The
next few days will be critical as candidates scramble to buy their
final waves of television commercials and put in place those
messages for the all-important close of their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unprecedented in my experience how unsettled the national
environment is two weeks from a national election,'' said Steve
Elmendorf, the chief of staff to Rep. Richard Gephardt, the
minority leader. ``This thing could tip either way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Brookover, who as political director of the National
Republican Congressional Committee offers a more upbeat assessment
than many in his party, said he expected Republicans to gain House
seats ``in the 10-to-15-plus range.'' His forecast of gains, he
said, was now ``not as big as in that last week in August but
certainly bigger than we ever expected last June.''
</P>
<P>
   Brookover's counterpart at the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, Paul Frick, said, ``I feel fairly optimistic. What we
know right now is that the same races that we thought were in play
in January are in play today. We haven't had many additions to our
list of vulnerable incumbents.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a significant shift _ at least in expectations. Even
this late in the campaign, some Republican candidates were clinging
to the idea that the Clinton scandal would be their ticket to
Capitol Hill, said Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this fundamental belief that this alarm clock is
going to go off and everybody is going to wake up and say, `We
really despise this guy Clinton, and anybody whose been around him
we're throwing out,' '' Fabrizio said. ``It's just not going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have been forced to re-assess their prospects
because voters have made clear that they want the nation to put the
scandal behind it. And with the hardy economy and no galvanizing
issues to arouse the electorate, the dynamic seems to favor
incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that suggests a status quo outcome involves the
realities of the field this year: There are relatively few races in
which no incumbent is running, usually the most competitive
contests. Prospects for a major shift have also diminished because
there are well under 100 truly competitive House races this year,
probably fewer than than 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we're holding our own is a real break for us,''
said Jon Hutchens, a Democratic media consultant based in Denver
whose company is handling about 40 races. ``The way this fall
started, we really could have been in a lot of trouble.''

GOVERNOR, LAWMAKERS PUSHING AHEAD WITH SCHOOL REFORMS
</HEADLINE>

By TERRI HARDY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- With education reform emerging as this year's
hottest political issue, lawmakers in Sacramento are proposing a
host of plans to transform California schools.
</P>
<P>
   The ideas are varied: Make teachers and graduating seniors pass
competency tests, create an education czar to rank all schools, set
up councils of parents and teachers at each school to make
curriculum and budget decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Gov. Pete Wilson has signed into law legislation that
will end social promotion and require mandatory summer school or
other remedial instruction for students who do not perform at grade
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``All across the country, people are focusing on what can be
done to help schools and students doing poorly,'' said Gary Hart,
co-director for the Institute for Education Reform in Sacramento.
``California has been behind on this, but I think now what we're
seeing is a pretty serious effort for reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The state has used two approaches to foster change at schools:
the carrot and the stick.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage improvement, schools have been given more money
based on their success in reducing class sizes, the Legislature
wrote a proposition that will ask voters Nov. 3 to spend more money
on schools, and changes have been made to recruit more teachers.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, a law will go into effect that will give potential
teachers more flexibility in getting their credentials. Instead of
taking all their classes in a fifth year of college, students will
be allowed to take fast-track courses as undergraduates, for
example. And new teachers will be guaranteed one-on-one coaching
with mentor instructors -- something that's only done in a small
percentage of districts now, said Ron Hockwalt, Walnut Valley
schools superintendent, who served on a state task force that made
recommendations for teacher training legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely necessary because we lose so many teachers
after the first year,'' Hockwalt said.
</P>
<P>
   Born out of frustration, however, are measures intended to force
districts and their employees into accountability. A new law will
call for new teachers, at the end of their credential preparation,
to be evaluated to ensure they are ``able to perform and do what's
expected of them,'' Hockwalt said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, voters passed Proposition 227 in June, virtually banning
bilingual education and for the first time, students throughout the
state were required to take the same standardized test to establish
a base line for achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson wrote Proposition 8, an initiative on the November
ballot, that would in part create a chief inspector of public
schools, who would report on the quality of public K-12 campuses.
</P>
<P>
   The chief inspector would be appointed by the governor for a
10-year term. The office would inspect all public schools a least
once every two years, and publish the results.
</P>
<P>
   Reports would include a school's strengths, weaknesses and
student achievement data. The annual reviews would cost about $15
million to $20 million, according to the Legislative Analyst's
Office.
</P>
<P>
   State Superintendent of Instruction Delaine Eastin criticized
Wilson's plan, saying even though ``accountability was on
everyone's lips,'' it wasn't in the governor's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that's being set up is a system of ranking schools,''
Eastin said.
</P>
<P>
   Hart agreed that Proposition 8 doesn't go far enough for true
reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be rewards and sanctions,'' Hart said. ``The key
question is what to do when schools don't measure up to standards
or when they exceed those standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Zak, spokesman for the Yes on Proposition 8 campaign, said
that an independent analysis of the quality of schools is an
important first step.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to policymakers to take this data and implement
meaningful accountability plans,'' Zak said.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 8 would also maintain funding for class-size
reduction and set up school site councils of parents and teachers.
With the principal, the council would make budgetary and curriculum
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Another provision in the ballot measure would require teachers
to pass a competency test -- something that's also being urged by
gubernatorial candidates Gray Davis and Dan Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren also wants high school students to pass a competency
test before they receive their diplomas and is an advocate of
school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Neither candidate has talked much about what he wants to happen
to schools that consistently show poor student performance -- the
centerpiece of most accountability plans.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Davis' election campaign said the lieutenant
governor does not support the idea, as proposed by Wilson, of
spending millions to rank schools.
</P>
<P>
   However, Davis does want to reward master teachers, as well as
schools that show measurable increases in performance. Conversely,
Davis would support sanctions, including dismissals for those
school officials who continually fail their students, said Michael
Bustamante, spokesman for Davis' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Davis is pushing for more parental
involvement, including having them sign contracts saying they will
spend more time helping their child with homework and that they
will volunteer at school.
</P>
<P>
   ``When parents take an active role, their child's performance
increases,'' Bustamante said.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren's campaign spokesman said the candidate had been
studying accountability plans and will be making an announcement
about his proposals this month.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general strongly supports local decision-making,
but is investigating whether accountability plans need to be
created at the school site, district or state level -- or a
combination of all three, said spokeswoman Sara Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan Lungren strongly supports accountability and standards,
and is now looking at how that can be implemented,'' Brown said.

 WASHINGTON: of trouble.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some Democratic strategists are counseling their candidates to
come up with messages that do not simply attack Republicans for
trying to prolong an impeachment inquiry but meld that notion with
the idea that by emphasizing the scandal Republicans are giving
short shrift to important policy matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it takes is one to start a flood,'' Saul Shorr, Inslee's
media consultant, said of the prospect that other Democrats may
follow his candidate's lead and denounce the impeachment
proceedings. ``Republican incumbents who are in marginal districts
with suburban bases outside the South should be concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than wait for the poll results on the Inslee race,
another Democratic challenger, Ralph Neas, in suburban Maryland,
began broadcasting a radio advertisement that castigates Rep.
Constance Morella for voting for an open-ended impeachment inquiry.
Neas has an uphill battle and clearly is hoping that the move will
enliven his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I favor censuring the president but then getting on with the
business of government,'' Neas says in the advertisement. ``The
facts don't justify an impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a resurgence of confidence, there is no reason for
jubilation among Democrats _ only relief that things do not look
worse. Few Democrats dare to boldly predict, as some did early this
year, that their party will retake the House. And most strategists
on both sides are still expecting Republican gains, but ones that
are more modest than even seemed realistic a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful that the dynamics could shift yet again, Brookover said
in an interview on Friday, ``I've never seen a climate where with
17 days to go there's not a clear picture about what you need to do
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hutchens put it this way: ``Here we are, two weeks out, and
no one has a clue either on an outcome or a solid handle on how
you're going to influence that outcome. The vast majority of
campaigns on both sides probably wish Clinton would go to Bulgaria
for a couple of weeks _ at least it would all be less
unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   While most candidates are now reluctant to use public speeches
or advertisements to try to turn the Lewinsky scandal to their
advantage, Democrats and Republicans are planning to use the matter
in more discreet mailings and telephone calls and other efforts to
embolden their hard-core voters and get them to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic pitch is that Republicans are unfairly dragging
out the impeachment inquiry; the Republican pitch is to link
Democratic candidates to a president who they say has brought
disgrace to the office and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party is about to launch a comprehensive radio
campaign that will be concentrated in black and Hispanic areas. The
advertisements will feature Hillary Rodham Clinton and Jesse
Jackson, who will implore loyal Democrats to vote. ``The
Republicans are hoping you won't bother to vote,'' Mrs. Clinton
says in one commercial. ``I'm Hillary Clinton and I'm asking you to
prove them wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   With recent polls showing a backlash against Republicans
pressing for the impeachment inquiry, the party's candidates are no
longer raising the matter in their commercials. But some
Republicans are still arguing that the scandal could play to their
benefit, particularly in conservative districts in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Significant gains for the Republicans on Election Day would make
it harder for Democrats to turn back any move toward the
impeachment of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to acknowledge it is to ignore the elephant sitting in the
room,'' Brookover said. Like some Democrats, he said the best
option for Republicans may be to talk about the scandal indirectly.
``It's a matter of putting it in people's faces, `This president
has done something wrong,' or alluding to it, `We need to deal with
it so we can move on.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Since the party that controls the White House traditionally
loses seats in midterm elections, Democrats are already planning to
declare victory even if they suffer moderate losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``My benchmark is the six-year-itch,'' said Jill Alper,
political director of the Democratic National Committee. She laid
down the party line early by citing the tradition of voters getting
restless with a president and his party after six years. ``Losing
less than 26 House seats and losing less than six Senate seats is a
huge victory for this party,'' she said.

Office on down. By Jason DeParle.
</P>
<P>
   TAIWAN-VETS (New York) _ They have been together for five bitter
decades, and they will stay together, it seems, for the foreseeable
future. As teen-agers in the 1940s, they became Nationalist
soldiers in China and followed Chiang Kai-shek to Taiwan. As
middle-aged bachelors in the 1960s and '70s, they fled to the
United States, angry that Taiwan did not have a pension system for
veterans. As graying immigrants with no immediate relatives within
a hemisphere, they toiled in menial jobs in Manhattan's Chinatown.
And since 1989, William Wong, Chi-ching Tung, Tong-yu Yang and
Hsi-shan Chang have occupied the same half-bedroom in a dilapidated
apartment on the Lower East Side. Together, these four men have
come to symbolize the penury and pathos saturating the lives of
many of the 100 or so Nationalist veterans in Chinatown, and
thousands of others scattered throughout the country. (With

<P>
   YALE-POLITICS (New Haven, Conn.) _ During the Vietnam War and
the Watergate crisis, the campus of Yale University, like many
others, was politically energized if not radicalized. No such
passions grip the Yale campus today as President Clinton faces an
impeachment drama in which a number of Yale alumni are playing
central roles. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   REPUBS-SANANTONIO (San Antonio) _ If the Republican National
Committee's site selection team picks San Antonio for the party's
presidential nominating convention in 2000, as the backers of the
city's drive predict, the nation will be treated to a love fest of
diversity aimed at drawing Hispanic-Americans into the Republican
tent, backers say. By Rick Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-TOBACCO (Los Angeles) _ A lifelong Democrat, film director
Rob Reiner does not have a lot in common politically with people
like millionaire Republican Michael Huffington or actor Charlton
Heston, a conservative icon. But the three men have put aside their
differences to battle he tobacco industry over a ballot initiative
that would add 50 cents to the price of a pack of cigarettes, and
use the money to finance early childhood development and prenatal
care programs.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-ABOUTFACE (Washington) _ Just over two weeks from
Election Day, Republicans are retreating from their hope that the

some newly confident Democrats now are daring to predict that they
will even pick up congressional seats this year. By Richard L.
Berke.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-HYDE (Washington) _ Rep. Henry Hyde, the Republican
presiding over House impeachment proceedings, is discovering the
price of fame: Every word he speaks counts. In 12 terms in the
House, Hyde, 74, helped build his reputation through eloquence,
oratory and wit. Republicans consider him to be the best insurance
that the impeachment inquiry will be perceived as judicious and
will win public respect. But even he has been stumbling under the
white-hot glare of an impeachment proceeding against a popular
President. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-105TH (Washington) _ The 105th Congress, which is to
wrap up its final legislative business this week, rejoiced a year
ago over a landmark bipartisan balanced-budget agreement. It
provided the biggest tax cut since the height of the Reagan years.
But the big question today is whether the 105th will be remembered
instead for something else _ the bitter, protracted preoccupation
with President Clinton's personal life and his lies about it. By

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ In building a bridge from welfare to work,
Wisconsin, perhaps more than any other state, has prided itself on
doing things right. It has spent heavily and pledged lavishly to
give poor families the tools they need, from baby sitters and bus
passes to case managers and community service jobs. On paper, no
state has done more to replace welfare checks with workers'
supports.
</P>
<P>
   But a year after moving from the shelves to the streets,
Wisconsin's celebrated effort bears only an intermittent likeness
to the program of customized employment services outlined in
planning documents and praised from the Oval Office on down. In
practice, even supporters of the program complain that uneven
casework and unresponsive bureaucracies can make services
cumbersome, if not impossible, to use.
</P>
<P>
   Some administrative glitches are inevitable, of course, in an
effort to move tens of thousands of low-skilled, single mothers
into the work force. And despite their frustrations, many former
welfare recipients have achieved a kind of back-door success simply
by walking away from the program to find jobs on their own. Still,
the gaps between generous theory and bumpy practice are noteworthy
here because Wisconsin's ethos _ less welfare, but more help _ has
helped shape a national consensus on aid to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we see in Milwaukee isn't what we envisioned,'' said
state Sen. Alberta Darling, one of a half-dozen Republican
legislators who have balanced their enthusiasm for the program's
theory with frequent criticism of its practice. ``There have been
problems from the get-go, with child care and management systems.
We're not demanding enough of the people delivering the services
and there are a lot of excuses on the table that I don't find
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Administrative problems were just what the state was trying to
avoid when it privatized the program _ called Wisconsin Works or
W-2 _ in Milwaukee County, which accounts for 87 percent of the
state's 11,000 welfare cases. But despite the effort to import
business-world efficiencies, many of those in the program describe
their caseworkers as distant and distracted figures who neglect to
return phone calls rather than the partners in self-sufficiency
depicted in state manuals. Many recipients find themselves bouncing
between part-time or temporary jobs, suffering income gaps that
planners failed to anticipate.
</P>
<P>
   And the state's offer of subsidized child care, a crucial
support service, has foundered on the confusion between rival
agencies, one public, the others private, whose staffs and
computers often fail to communicate. This year, as many as 60
percent of the child-care placements begun by one agency were
invalidated by another, leaving thousands of bewildered mothers
with no one to care for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Albirta Glenn was left to search for a job on her own, though
she lacked child care and was facing an eviction threat. When
Sheila Baker was laid off, she did not look to her caseworker for
help. ``They don't return phone calls,'' she said. ``I'll find a
job better working with myself than working with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ta-Tanisha Powell had so many problems getting her child care
approved that she left her job to care for her son herself. Indeed,
the bureaucratic foul-ups forced her back on the welfare rolls,
after she had proudly worked her way free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just really frustrated now, ladies,'' she said, in tears
at a recent meeting with the two child care officials who share
authority over her case. ``I've been working for six years and I
never had to deal with anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the snags of its start-up year, Wisconsin Works enjoys
broad support. It has cut the rolls by 70 percent in the last year
alone, while producing no sign of the surging deprivation that some
critics feared.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Gov. Tommy Thompson cited the decline in
the number of welfare recipients as compelling evidence of the
program's success. ``I'm extremely happy,'' Thompson said. ``We
expected about 36,000 cases left on the rolls, and we're down to
10,875. It's exceeded any and all expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, a three-term Republican who has staked much of his
reputation on Wisconsin Works, acknowledged that ``we've had some
problems,'' particularly with child care. But he called them
inevitable growing pains during ``the biggest change in social
welfare policy in 60 years,'' and he said he had moved quickly to
fix them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking that into consideration, it's been handled extremely
well,'' Thompson said. ``There should be no apologies.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Jean Rogers, the state official with daily oversight of W-2,
said the agencies were good and getting better with experience and
smaller caseloads. ``It's a matter of, `Is the glass half-empty or
is the glass half-full?''' she said. ``I think the customized
aspects of W-2 have room to grow. But I think there's 100 times
more customized service than there was'' under the old welfare
system.
</P>
<P>
   Darling said Thompson had moved quickly to fix problems once
they were identified. But John Gardner, a member of the Milwaukee
County School Board, argues that the inefficiencies were built into
the program. Each of the five private agencies that run the program
gets paid a flat fee, no matter how many people they place in jobs.
Each serves an exclusive territory where other agencies cannot
compete.
</P>
<P>
   And much like a health maintenance organization, each
theoretically has an incentive to withhold services. The less they
spend, the more their profits rise. ``In theory it's a privatized
model of efficiency,'' Gardner said. ``In reality it's a
politically gerrymandered cartel.'' But while Gardner complains of
``an abysmal implementation,'' he also said the hassles had
prompted many recipients to find work on their own. ``It works
despite itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has run experimental welfare programs since first
taking office in 1987. But Wisconsin Works, which went into effect
in September 1997, is by far his most ambitious effort. While every
state is now running a work program, W-2 is unusually bold. It
demands work from everyone who receives state aid, virtually
without exception. To help make that possible, it has financed
thousands of community service jobs, like clerical work at the W-2
agencies, at $673 a month. And it pledges abundant support services
to keep people moving up an earnings ladder. State officials say
the program will spend 45 percent more per person than the old
welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   But administrative difficulties were quick to arise. In child
care, one problem stems from the power-sharing arrangement between
the county workers who used to run the welfare system and the
private agencies that have otherwise displaced them. The private
agencies determine child-care eligibility. The county workers
review the arrangement and pay the child care providers. By leaving
a role for the county workers, the state sought to preserve their
jobs. But the result brought conflicts among cultures, procedures
and computers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of recipients left their appointments at the private
agencies, thinking their child care had been approved, only to find
a later snag. Many child care providers went unpaid, and some began
declining W-2 cases altogether. ``The Milwaukee community is
rapidly losing faith in our ability to make the child care
component of W-2-and thus W-2 itself work,'' Darling and five other
Republican legislators wrote Thompson in July.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Powell's case is instructive. Her problems began in March
when the county stopped paying her son's child care center for
reasons she has yet to determine. ``I went to pick him up, and they
said, `You're not authorized, you can't leave him here anymore,'''
she said. She then left a full-time job as a security guard for
part-time work as a nursing aide.
</P>
<P>
   But when she tried to return to full-time work a few months
later, she found herself in a Catch-22. The private agency
authorized full-time child care. But given her part-time schedule,
the county declined to approve it. ``I tried to call six times,''
she said, ``and I never got called back.'' After her make-shift
baby-sitting arrangements kept falling through, Ms. Powell was
forced to quit. Now she is unemployed for the first time in years
and awaiting a community service job. ``This infuriates me,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Buschmann, who oversees child care for the Milwaukee
County Department of Human Services, said glitches like those arose
in as many as 60 percent of the cases in the program's first six
months. Since then, the county replaced its director of human
services, added staff members and streamlined its procedures.
Though Buschmann said service had greatly improved, he added:
``It's not working well yet. We still have a ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   While the child care problems are widely acknowledged, the
quality of the broader case management remains subject to dispute.
In theory, the privatized caseworkers are the all-purpose coaches
at the program's heart, routing clients to everything from job
fairs to drug counseling. In practice, many clients describe their
workers as impersonal clerks, urging them to look for work on their
own or warehousing them in group motivation classes that lead
nowhere. Though the program envisioned that each caseworker would
have just 55 clients, a study for the County Board of Supervisors
found some caseworkers with more than 150 clients.
</P>
<P>
   Buschmann, the county official, remains a strong supporter of
the program, but he agrees that it has provided less personal
attention than it advertises. ``Everybody talks that stuff, about
the `individualized approach,' `customer service,''' he said. ``But
in the first year, there was such a drive to move the mass through
the system, you couldn't do that.'' With smaller caseloads now,
Buschmann predicts the individual attention will increase.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Taylor, director of YW-Works, one of the five private
agencies, said customized casework was already on the rise.
``There's a lot more of that going on than people realize,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   William Martin, who runs the largest W-2 agency, Employment
Solutions, said, ``I feel pretty proud about the quality of the
casework.'' But he also said the amount of contact between
caseworkers and clients was ``all over the waterfront,'' depending
in part on ``the ability of the individual to articulate their
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Crawford, 38, said YW-Works had made an extraordinary
effort to help her, as she faced the break-up of her marriage and
problems with domestic violence. First, it combined her community
service work with several months of psychological counseling. Then
it placed her in a training program to run a plastics-molding
machine. Eight months after joining W-2, Ms. Crawford has a
full-time job with a plastics company, starting at $7.40 an hour.
``They treated me with respect,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Glenn said she received little help when she applied to
her agency in August. At the time she was utterly destitute and
perhaps more troubled than her caseworker knew. Having moved to
Milwaukee three months earlier, she was living in a partly
boarded-up house that was under police surveillance for drug
activity by neighbors. Without birth certificates for her four
young children, she could not enroll them in school. But she says
her caseworker told her to spend 30 days looking for a job on her
own, with little help or supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Pat DeLessio, a public interest lawyer who helped Ms. Glenn
secure a community service job, said her client's case exemplified
the system's laissez-faire approach. ``They should have helped her
get the kids in school,'' Ms. DeLessio said. ``They should have
made sure her shelter was stable. And they should have monitored
her job-search closely.''
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials said they had tried to follow up with Ms.
Glenn, but she had not answered their letters.
</P>
<P>
   With or without customized service, many former welfare
recipients do seem to be working. But the work is often part-time,
low-paying and quick to end. There are no thorough studies of W-2.
But a study of the transition period, by John Pawasarat of the
University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, found 75 percent of those
hired lost their jobs within nine months. Only 28 percent sustained
projected annual earnings of $10,000 for two consecutive quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baker's seems an illustrative case. Until the transition to
W-2, she had spent 11 years on welfare, giving little thought to
employment. But once she was forced to do community service, she
went out and found a job on her own. She became a dishwasher at the
Bradley Center, Milwaukee's major arena.
</P>
<P>
   But the work is seasonal. And once she found it, her contact
with W-2 essentially ended. Although officially she received ``case
management services'' for six months, Ms. Baker does not even know
her caseworker's name. Her pay stub shows earnings of $3,555 for
the first half of this year, or $483 less than she would have
earned in a community service job. She left the Bradley Center for
a housekeeping job over the summer, then lost it when her child got
sick. Now, once again, she is looking for work on her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to work on trying to help people a little more,''
she said.

ACCEDING TO SPAIN, BRITAIN ARRESTS FORMER CHILEAN LEADER AUGUSTO
PINOCHET 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who ruled Chile
with an iron fist for 17 years, has been arrested in London by the
British police after Spain asked that he be extradited for the
presumed murders of hundreds of Chilean and Spanish citizens during
his dictatorship, British authorities announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Chilean government immediately demanded the former
dictator's release, arguing that he has diplomatic immunity since
he currently sits in the Chilean Senate. But so far the British and
Spanish authorities have shrugged off the protests, setting up what
promises to be a legal struggle that could have wide implications
for the prosecution of alleged human rights violators under
international law.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, who is 82 and only stepped down as commander in chief
of the Chilean military five months ago, was arrested on Friday
night, little more than a week after he arrived in London for
surgery on a herniated disc.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant said the general was wanted for questioning for
``crimes of genocide and terrorism that includes murder.'' British
authorities refused to say where Pinochet is being held, nor did
they set a date for when he would be questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since he led a violent coup to overthrow Salvador Allende
Gossens, the elected Socialist president in 1973, Pinochet has been
a political icon throughout Latin America, representing the
excesses of a long period of military rule.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 3,000 Chileans were shot in the streets or
``disappeared'' during his rule, and a senior member of his regime
was imprisoned under U.S. pressure for the murder of former Foreign
Minister Orlando Letelier in Washington in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet cast a long and wide shadow in economic affairs as
well, launching a privatized social security system and other free
market policies that set examples that are still models from
Argentina to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Under a Constitution that he guided to enactment, Pinochet was
able to become a senator for life upon his retirement from the
military, a position that afforded him continued political
influence and immunity from prosecution as a state official. He is
facing several lawsuits in Chile by relatives of disappeared people
and political opponents seeking to take away his immunity, but few
observers think any will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Chileans are deeply divided in their opinion of the
Pinochet legacy, with approximately a third of the country viewing
him as a hero, another third viewing him as a villain and the rest
voicing ambiguous opinions to pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Spanish judicial official said on Saturday that Judge
Baltasar Garzon issued the international arrest warrant against
Pinochet on Friday after Interpol warned that the former dictator
was about to be released from the hospital and would probably leave
London.
</P>
<P>
   The initial warrant is based on a single case of the kidnapping
and disappearance in 1976 of a Chilean leftist leader, Edgaro
Henriquez, 35.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Spanish judicial official said that Garzon is planning on
Monday to send to British authorities the names of 78 other people
of various nationalities who were also kidnapped in Chile and taken
to Argentina where they disappeared between 1976 and 1983. He will
also seek the general's extradition to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon has also demanded the extradition of various former
Argentina junta rulers, but Argentina has refused to abide by
warrants. The focus of his investigation is the so-called Condor
Plan, in which the military juntas of various Latin American
countries allegedly collaborated to eliminate their enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Both President Eduardo Frei of Chile and President Eduardo Menem
of Argentina have resisted the Spanish legal motions, arguing that
they infringe on their nations' sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The Chilean government said on Saturday that it was filing a
formal protest. ``What we must do is make clear that Mr. Pinochet
is a senator who travels with a diplomatic passport,'' said Mario
Artaza, Chile's ambassador to London, in a radio interview
Saturday. Artaza added that Pinochet would not be able testify any
time soon because he was recuperating from painful surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest warrant was transmitted through Interpol from Madrid
to London last Tuesday from Garzon and another Spanish magistrate,
Manuel Garcia Castellon, who is pursuing his own investigation of
murder, torture and disappearances during the Pinochet era.
</P>
<P>
   Chilean officials who served in the Pinochet government have so
far been left virtually untouched for their alleged crimes because
the armed forces still command broad political influence.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Argentina, several military officials served
prison sentences in the 1980s, but they were released under amnesty
laws enacted in the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, retired
Gen. Jorge Videla, who led one of the Argentine juntas that ruled
while Pinochet was in power in Chile, is currently under house
arrest as a judge investigates his alleged role in kidnapping
newborn children of political prisoners so they might be adopted by
military families.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International, the human rights group long critical of
Pinochet, earlier this week urged the British government to assist
the Spanish judges in their prosecution of the former dictator. In
a statement, the group said, ``This would be a clear manifestation
of the British government's commitment to human rights.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A good portion of the financial system was buried
under a mountain of bad debts that was growing bigger with each
passing day. Yet politicians, pressed by powerful interests and
afraid of committing huge sums of taxpayer money to the problem,
were dithering about how to respond. Other nations looked on with
concern and disdain.
</P>
<P>
   There are striking parallels between the United States in 1988
as it struggled to address its savings and loan crisis and Japan in
1998 as it grapples with a banking system so burdened with sour
loans that it has virtually stopped lending.
</P>
<P>
   In those similarities are many lessons about mistakes to be
avoided. And given that the United States eventually dealt with the
near-collapse of its savings and loan industry _ decisively if
belatedly _ there may also be a road map in the American experience
toward a solution for Japan and other nations where a recovery from
the global economic crisis depends on resuscitating their enfeebled
banking systems.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is still in the process of recognizing the severity of its
banking problems and that any solution will be expensive and
painful. It took a big step down that path Friday when the
Parliament agreed on major elements of a plan to spend around $500
billion of taxpayer money to shore up ailing banks and make it
easier for the government to take over insolvent ones.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Japanese government, which has allowed the problem to
fester for years, has to prove to a skeptical world that it has the
resolve to use those tools. The Clinton administration, in
particular, is convinced that Japan cannot pull itself out of
recession and help address the rest of Asia's woes until it has
dealt with the problem. It has grown increasingly impatient with
Tokyo for not moving more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   It maybe worth remembering, however, that it took the United
States years to face up to the damage done to the economy by the
wholesale failures that swept the savings and loan industry during
the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Much like their Japanese counterparts now, U.S. regulators and
industry executives initially bet that they could wait out the
problem, that depressed prices for the real estate they had
foreclosed on would bounce back, that a stronger economy would
eventually strengthen their borrowers and enable them to pay up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing is getting a consensus that you have a
problem that can't be solved by conventional means,'' said John
Ryan, a former head of the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency set
up to sell off real estate and other assets of failed savings
institutions. ``It's a very difficult consensus to achieve and we
were a long time in achieving it. You can remember the time we
spent in this country kidding ourselves and believing that the
markets would bail us out.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was only in 1989, after hundreds of savings
institutions had failed and economists began frightening
politicians into action by estimating that the problems would cost
hundreds of billions of dollars to fix, that Congress and the Bush
administration became serious about dealing with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1989, Congress passed legislation intended to make it
easier for regulators to seize control of insolvent or failing
savings institutions and sell off their component parts. The idea
was that the financial system's problems and the depressive effect
they were having on the real estate market and the general economy
were best solved by taking a painful hit in a concentrated period.
</P>
<P>
   The key to making it work was the RTC, which quickly became the
repository of all the repossessed office buildings, strip malls and
houses accumulated by unwise or unlucky or crooked savings and loan
managers around the country, as well as their money-losing
portfolios of high-risk junk bonds and other questionable assets.
</P>
<P>
   There was not much of a market for many of the properties. To
get things moving, the agency sold some real estate and other
assets for bargain prices. The sales drew more buyers for other
properties, generating more competition and higher prices. The
agency packaged some properties together to make them more
attractive to investors, and spruced up others.
</P>
<P>
   From 1989 through the early 1990s, the government shut down 747
savings institutions with assets of $455 billion. By the time they
had all been picked apart and sold off by the RTC, the gap between
what they owed depositors and what all their assets were worth was
$84.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with the $70 billion in losses run up by the several
hundred additional savings institutions that had failed between
1986 and 1989, the total bill to the taxpayer and the
industry-financed deposit insurance program was nearly $155
billion. But the problem was dealt with in just a few years _ the
agency, its job completed, was disbanded in 1995 _ and the country
and the economy could move on.
</P>
<P>
   Now governments in Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan,
among other countries, are trying to adopt big portions of the U.S.
approach. Officials from Japan in particular have spent
considerable time with officials at the Office of Thrift
Supervision and other regulatory agencies in Washington. The main
message they hear from the United States is the necessity of moving
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The RTC made the very tough decision just to sell at market
regardless of what market was,'' said Jonathan Fiechter, the former
top savings and loan regulator in America, who now works for the
World Bank advising developing nations how to clean up financial
messes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Asia they're running into great trouble with criticism
about fire sale prices, since you're often selling assets of people
who are friends of very senior people,'' he said. ``The lesson of
the RTC was that eventually you get through it.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is by no means clear that Japan, whose problems dwarf
those of other nations, has accepted that lesson. Banks are
reluctant to seek help from the government voluntarily, since doing
so involves a loss of face for the managers, if not the loss of
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Big borrowers, especially construction companies that are major
contributors to the governing Liberal Democratic Party, are
pressing the government to give banks more time. Troubled banks
continue to hide their losses from regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has cleared a big hurdle in proving willing in principle
to spend huge sums of money on the problem. But Bert Ely, a
consultant who tracked the savings and loan crisis here, said the
Japanese plan so far has been nothing more than a facade, since the
government has been unwilling to force banks to prove they can
survive or shut them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks almost entirely like what we were doing before 1989
in the sense of delaying the inevitable, postponing a resolution of
the banking problems and of the bad loans,'' Ely said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned that the hole in fact kept getting deeper,'' he
added. ``It's like a credit card balance. It doesn't peak and then
subside, the problem just keeps getting bigger.''

   WASHINGTON _ A good portion of the financial system was buried
under a mountain of bad debts that was growing bigger with each
passing day. Yet politicians, pressed by powerful interests and
afraid of committing huge sums of taxpayer money to the problem,
were dithering about how to respond. Other nations looked on with
concern and disdain.
</P>
<P>
   There are striking parallels between the United States in 1988
as it struggled to address its savings and loan crisis and Japan in
1998 as it grapples with a banking system so burdened with sour
loans that it has virtually stopped lending.
</P>
<P>
   In those similarities are many lessons about mistakes to be
avoided. And given that the United States eventually dealt with the
near-collapse of its savings and loan industry _ decisively if
belatedly _ there may also be a road map in the American experience
toward a solution for Japan and other nations where a recovery from
the global economic crisis depends on resuscitating their enfeebled
banking systems.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is still in the process of recognizing the severity of its
banking problems and that any solution will be expensive and
painful. It took a big step down that path Friday when the
Parliament agreed on major elements of a plan to spend around $500
billion of taxpayer money to shore up ailing banks and make it
easier for the government to take over insolvent ones.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Japanese government, which has allowed the problem to
fester for years, has to prove to a skeptical world that it has the
resolve to use those tools. The Clinton administration, in
particular, is convinced that Japan cannot pull itself out of
recession and help address the rest of Asia's woes until it has
dealt with the problem. It has grown increasingly impatient with
Tokyo for not moving more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   It maybe worth remembering, however, that it took the United
States years to face up to the damage done to the economy by the
wholesale failures that swept the savings and loan industry during
the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Much like their Japanese counterparts now, U.S. regulators and
industry executives initially bet that they could wait out the
problem, that depressed prices for the real estate they had
foreclosed on would bounce back, that a stronger economy would
eventually strengthen their borrowers and enable them to pay up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing is getting a consensus that you have a
problem that can't be solved by conventional means,'' said John
Ryan, a former head of the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency set
up to sell off real estate and other assets of failed savings
institutions. ``It's a very difficult consensus to achieve and we
were a long time in achieving it. You can remember the time we
spent in this country kidding ourselves and believing that the
markets would bail us out.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was only in 1989, after hundreds of savings
institutions had failed and economists began frightening
politicians into action by estimating that the problems would cost
hundreds of billions of dollars to fix, that Congress and the Bush
administration became serious about dealing with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1989, Congress passed legislation intended to make it
easier for regulators to seize control of insolvent or failing
savings institutions and sell off their component parts. The idea
was that the financial system's problems and the depressive effect
they were having on the real estate market and the general economy
were best solved by taking a painful hit in a concentrated period.
</P>
<P>
   The key to making it work was the RTC, which quickly became the
repository of all the repossessed office buildings, strip malls and
houses accumulated by unwise or unlucky or crooked savings and loan
managers around the country, as well as their money-losing
portfolios of high-risk junk bonds and other questionable assets.
</P>
<P>
   There was not much of a market for many of the properties. To
get things moving, the agency sold some real estate and other
assets for bargain prices. The sales drew more buyers for other
properties, generating more competition and higher prices. The
agency packaged some properties together to make them more
attractive to investors, and spruced up others.
</P>
<P>
   From 1989 through the early 1990s, the government shut down 747
savings institutions with assets of $455 billion. By the time they
had all been picked apart and sold off by the RTC, the gap between
what they owed depositors and what all their assets were worth was
$84.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with the $70 billion in losses run up by the several
hundred additional savings institutions that had failed between
1986 and 1989, the total bill to the taxpayer and the
industry-financed deposit insurance program was nearly $155
billion. But the problem was dealt with in just a few years _ the
agency, its job completed, was disbanded in 1995 _ and the country
and the economy could move on.
</P>
<P>
   Now governments in Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan,
among other countries, are trying to adopt big portions of the U.S.
approach. Officials from Japan in particular have spent
considerable time with officials at the Office of Thrift
Supervision and other regulatory agencies in Washington. The main
message they hear from the United States is the necessity of moving
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The RTC made the very tough decision just to sell at market
regardless of what market was,'' said Jonathan Fiechter, the former
top savings and loan regulator in America, who now works for the
World Bank advising developing nations how to clean up financial
messes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Asia they're running into great trouble with criticism
about fire sale prices, since you're often selling assets of people
who are friends of very senior people,'' he said. ``The lesson of
the RTC was that eventually you get through it.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is by no means clear that Japan, whose problems dwarf
those of other nations, has accepted that lesson. Banks are
reluctant to seek help from the government voluntarily, since doing
so involves a loss of face for the managers, if not the loss of
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Big borrowers, especially construction companies that are major
contributors to the governing Liberal Democratic Party, are
pressing the government to give banks more time. Troubled banks
continue to hide their losses from regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has cleared a big hurdle in proving willing in principle
to spend huge sums of money on the problem. But Bert Ely, a
consultant who tracked the savings and loan crisis here, said the
Japanese plan so far has been nothing more than a facade, since the
government has been unwilling to force banks to prove they can
survive or shut them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks almost entirely like what we were doing before 1989
in the sense of delaying the inevitable, postponing a resolution of
the banking problems and of the bad loans,'' Ely said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned that the hole in fact kept getting deeper,'' he
added. ``It's like a credit card balance. It doesn't peak and then
subside, the problem just keeps getting bigger.''

SPORTS COLUMN: SECRET LOVE FOR YANKS POURS OUT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because it was for so long a love that dared not speak its name,
the current outpouring of adoration for the Yankees is almost
poignant. Finally, Yankee fans are feeling secure enough to come
out. People who over the years sneered at the Yankees in public or
at least allowed those who slobbered over the Mets, the Red Sox,
the Cubs, the memory of the Brooklyn Dodgers, to prattle on about
the arrogant, smug, rich, elitism of the Yankees are willing to
identify themselves and flash pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   But why now, not two years ago when the Yankees won the World
Series? What turned the switch, what convinced closeted fans that
their sports cult was as worthy as any other, that loathing the
Yankees is a kind of self-hate? How did they finally come to
realize that their secret passion was really for the democratic
ideal, that rooting for the Yankees has always been about rooting
for meritocracy, possibility, the promise of a country where you
would be judged not on your neighborhood, toys or pedigree, but on
what you did when you stepped up to the plate?
</P>
<P>
   Beats me.
</P>
<P>
   I got this smart in the '50s when there were three teams in New
York, two of which were hypes. The Dodgers supposedly represented
family, neighborhood, earthy pleasures, integration and religious
tolerance. And yet, the subtext, wait till next year, also implied
a willingness to be type-cast as losers. The Giants were cool, the
Polo Grounds a favorite destination for actors and celebrities, and
their fans were insufferable in victory and unavailable in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees _ mostly according to the Dodger, Giant, Cub and Red
Sox fans who ruled the media _ were supposedly bloodless, cold, the
machine-age-modern-times juggernaut that won because it was more
interested in what went on above the bottom line than between the
white lines, the U.S. Steel of sports.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, even after the Dodgers and the Giants left town for
larger profits these myths maintained. In fact, some of the
Dodger-Giant affection was passed on to the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone really knew better. The Yankees in their temple to
excellence in the South Bronx represented the chance of being
judged on your batting average. Yankee back-stories _ the Babe was
a throwaway kid, the Clipper was the high-school drop-out son of an
immigrant fisherman, the Mick was escaping the Oklahoma lead mines,
Reggie was an all-American hybrid, Billy was nuts and George was
desperately struggling out of his father's shadow _ were inspiring
to newcomer generations trying to make their own places.
</P>
<P>
   And here we are again, with Bernie, Boomer, El Duque. If the
team needed a sense of the city it represents, nothing could have
been more fitting than Chuck Knoblauch's now-amusing brainlock.
What is more New York than becoming outraged when you are being
wronged although you are absolutely right? This in a city where
honest citizens argue with cops, get handcuffed behind their backs
and almost never get satisfaction because there is no functioning
Civilian Review Board.
</P>
<P>
   This Yankee team has been praised for its collective, adult
play. The team has no overwhelming stars and the manager is an
authority figure with his ego in control. The owner, whose
manipulation, pettiness and fragmentation recalls some of the
city's mayors, has behaved so well that some sportswriters are
going soft on him, urging him not to sell the team and take several
hundreds of millions in profit.
</P>
<P>
   In such an era of good feeling, who wouldn't want to identify
with this team. But even winning the World Series should not be
enough. Now the Yankees must really prove that they are worthy of
the secret love that is not secret anymore. They need to stay in
the Bronx, improve their neighborhood as Steinbrenner promised 25
years ago and fulfill their promise as a positive force.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer's ``Safe
at Home'' plan seems like the best idea for the club's future. The
$535 million redevelopment of the Stadium and the area is far
cheaper than any midtown Manhattan plan. It includes the luxury
boxes for which Steinbrenner lusts and Yankee Village, a retail
area that would integrate the needs of the team and the needs of
the surrounding neighborhood. Public transportation and highways
would be improved and the Bronx Terminal Market turned into a
waterfront park.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if the Yankees win the Series, according to reports,
the team's price tag could approach $900 million. Steinbrenner's
potential deal with Cablevision, which owns Yankee TV rights for
the next 12 years, includes incentive bonuses. There are those who
believe that if Steinbrenner, the devil we know, actually sells the
team to a corporate cabal of which Rupert Murdoch is involved, the
Yankees will become arrogant, smug elitists, the Microsoft of
sports. Then it may be time to truly, madly and finally with good
reason, hate them.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been a good month for blasphemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corpus Christi,'' playwright Terence McNally's retelling of
the story of Jesus with a gay savior and disciples, has sold out
its New York run despite furious picketers and dismissive reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Portuguese author Jose Saramago was awarded the Nobel Prize for
Literature despite the offense caused by his 1992 novel ``The
Gospel According to Jesus Christ,'' presenting a lustful Jesus used
as a pawn in God's plan to expand his influence.
</P>
<P>
   And Salman Rushdie was finally freed, more or less, from the
death sentence imposed by Iran's mullahs nine years ago for
insulting the Koran in ``The Satanic Verses.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of works deemed sacrilegious goes on and on, from
Andres Serrano's notorious crucifix in a jar of urine to Martin
Scorsese's 1988 film ``The Last Temptation of Christ.'' And the
ecclesiastical mud fights they seem to spawn with monotonous
regularity, regardless of their quality, are a revealing window on
the convoluted politics of impiety in art.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of ``Corpus Christi'' in particular offers at
least two lessons. The first is that when it comes to religion,
controversy _ even recycled controversy _ still sells. The second
is that sometimes your friends can never do as much for you as your
enemies can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sometimes authors must hope and pray someone will
condemn their work, because it's the greatest thing that could
happen to it,'' said the Rev. Thomas J. Reese, editor of America, a
magazine published by the Jesuit order. ``It's like the old `Banned
in Boston' ad for pornographic films.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Corpus Christi'' was canceled and then reinstated by the
Manhattan Theater Club last summer after the Catholic League for
Religious and Civil Rights condemned it and the theater received
death threats.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic League and others said they objected to both the
play's content and what they saw as a continuing double standard.
They say that in artistic expression there are protected groups
(blacks, Jews, gays) about whom anything remotely offensive rarely
sees the light of day, while others (Christians, WASPs, lower-class
whites) are considered fair game for abuse.
</P>
<P>
   When the furor over ``Corpus Christi'' erupted last summer,
columnist Patrick J. Buchanan termed it ``nothing less than a hate
crime of modernity directed against Christians, the moral
equivalent of Nazis marching through Skokie.''
</P>
<P>
   William Donahue of the Catholic League said, ``The need to
offend Catholics is so deep and so sick it can only be described as
pathological.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the liberal leanings of many dramatists and other artists
and those who sponsor them, the charge of a double standard is not
without merit. It's hard to imagine, for example, jokes about poor
whites stirring quite the same outrage as virtually identical ones
about poor blacks.
</P>
<P>
   And while it's conceivable that Saramago could have won the
Nobel if he were a gay-bashing fascist instead of a committed
communist critical of the Catholic Church, it doesn't seem likely.
</P>
<P>
   But the double-standard argument only goes so far, as some
Catholic intellectuals concede. There are far uglier things than
negative portrayals, as was made clear last week when a gay college
student in Wyoming died after being kidnapped, robbed,
pistol-whipped and left tied to a fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some anti-Catholic sentiment that runs deep in the
culture, but you don't see Catholics being targets of violence,''
said the Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit deacon and associate editor of
America. ``You can't compare it to virulent racism or
anti-Semitism. I think it trivializes your argument when you try to
put everyone on the same level.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin added that the notion of Christians as a free-strike zone
in art and popular culture is an outdated one at a time when
fundamentalist organizations and groups like Donahue's now play the
game of victimhood with all the zeal of other special interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the Catholic League is that they cry wolf too
frequently,'' he said. ``I don't think every criticism of the
church is de facto anti-Catholicism.''
</P>
<P>
   The deeper and more complicated issue is what is fair and what
goes over the line in dealing with religious themes.
</P>
<P>
   There is no more resonant story in the Western world than that
of Jesus' life, so it inspires many retellings, with the Jesus
figure being appropriated by Latinos, blacks, gays _ you name it.
The ultimate tribute to the power of the story is that so many
groups want to reinterpret it 2,000 years later.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, that makes the story of Jesus a target for
cheap shots and tiresome, ritualistic debates like the one over
``Corpus Christi.'' Indeed, when the play opened, the general
critical reaction was not that it was so offensive but that it was
so lame. The Philadelphia Inquirer dismissed it as ``a terrible
play, a hopeless jumble of juvenile humor and mawkish
sentimentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, ``Corpus Christi'' has sold lots of tickets, no
doubt a side effect if not an aim of all the controversy. Which
perhaps offers a final lesson about raising such a ruckus before
the first curtain rises: It probably makes sense to see a play
before waging a holy war against it.

<P>
   HOUSTON _ The crime was horrific enough; cunningly cruel, brutal
and utterly senseless. But it was the way the victim was chosen _
singled out because he was part of a despised minority _ that
aroused the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The murder in June of James Byrd Jr., a black man torn to pieces
when he was dragged behind a pickup truck in Jasper, Texas, spurred
demands for toughening the state's broadly worded hate-crime law
and for passage of federal hate-crime legislation.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the brutal and equally senseless death last week of
Matthew Shepard, slashed, bludgeoned and tied to a fence post in
rural Wyoming, apparently because he was homosexual, is spurring
new demands for a hate-crime law in Wyoming, one of 10 states that
has none, and for passage of federal hate-crime legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But the argument for hate-crime laws, especially as they relate
to capital crimes like the murders of Byrd and Shepard, is not so
clear, prosecutors and others say. In the case of Byrd, for
example, the prosecutor does not intend to invoke the Texas
hate-crime law against the three white men charged with the murder.
He says it would be pointless.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas, our hate-crimes statute works by elevating the
punishment,'' said Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray.
``But this one is already as high as you can go. It's a capital
case. There's no room to elevate it any higher.''
</P>
<P>
   The same would probably be true in the Shepard case if Wyoming
had a hate-crime law. And that's the paradox: The very cases that
cause a national outcry for hate-crime laws are cases in which the
laws are unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``These hate-crime laws make a statement about how we feel about
hate crimes and, in some respects, it will probably help,'' said
Kelly Anders, a policy associate for the National Conference of
State Legislatures in Denver. ``Unfortunately, for the worst of
these crimes, the kind that we all hear about, it probably wouldn't
have any effect. If something is egregious enough, like what
happened to that poor guy in Wyoming, that surpasses any kind of
penalty on the books. That's the death penalty right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, an argument can be made that such laws are valuable.
</P>
<P>
   They probably have some deterrent effect, Ms. Anders said. And
there are certainly some cases involving misdemeanors or other
lesser crimes, she added, where those convicted have faced harsher
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to determine the effectiveness of hate-crime laws are
hampered by the lack of statistics. The Hate Crime Statistics Act,
enacted in 1990, called on the FBI to compile data from local
law-enforcement agencies about crimes that ``manifest prejudice
based on race, religious, sexual orientation or ethnicity.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI reported 4,558 hate crimes in 1991 and 7,587 in 1993,
for example. But the accuracy of those numbers is in doubt because
the number of agencies reporting hate crimes has fluctuated from
year to year. Only about 60 percent of the 16,000 law-enforcement
agencies in the country regularly report hate crimes to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations like the Anti-Defamation League and the National
Gay and Lesbian Task Force say the laws are valuable because they
shape the way society thinks about itself and draw boundaries of
what society will tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   And advocates argue that society's speaking out, clearly and
specifically, against crimes directed at members of a minority
group can make the members of that group feel less isolated and
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Also, they argue, people convicted of hate crimes, especially
the young, could be helped if they are given counseling. And, they
say, police officers might become more vigilant about such crimes
if the laws require training on the issue, as the laws in eight
states do.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of these laws say they are a sneaky way of
restricting political speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law historically has gone against punishing people for
their thoughts, and that is what hate-crimes laws do,'' Ms. Anders
said. ``That's what makes it so delicate. You have to make sure
when you're drafting legislation that you're not punishing people
for their thoughts. And that's a very difficult thing, because
that's what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been two significant legal challenges to hate-crimes
laws, both involving free-speech issues.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on a case involving a
Minnesota statute used in the case of a white man who burned a
cross in a black family's back yard. Minnesota's highest court had
ruled that the statute was constitutional because it was proper to
criminalize ``fighting words,'' or speech that would almost
inevitably result in a violent response. But the Supreme Court
disagreed, saying that Minnesota had not criminalized all such
``fighting words,'' and to single out only some for special
treatment was improper.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, however, the Supreme Court upheld a Wisconsin
statute that imposed higher penalties for hate crimes. This
approach has since been adopted by all but 10 states, to varying
degrees and in accordance with the Supreme Court's view that it is
proper to add penalties for existing crimes, but not to create a
new category of crime.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, including Texas, aren't explicit about which groups
are covered by their hate-crimes statutes. Of those that do
specify, 20 states mention race, religion or ethnicity, 11 mention
sexual orientation, 11 mention gender and 12 mention other
categories, like mental or physical disability.
</P>
<P>
   And some states have penalties that vary with the severity of
the crime. In Wisconsin, for instance, a simple fine might be added
to the penalty for a misdemeanor conviction, while five years could
be added to a felony sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, the prosecutor in Texas, said his decision not to use a
hate-crime law in the murder of Byrd should not be viewed as a lack
of support for such laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does have an impact,'' he said. ``It's one more tool that a
prosecutor can use.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another case underway in Jasper County, he said, a case
involving the firing of a weapon in which no one was injured. It
happened for racial reasons, he said, and the use of the hate-crime
law led to tougher punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you present hate-crime evidence in a courtroom, the jury
normally becomes angry over some offense that is, in effect,
senseless and they impose a stronger punishment,'' he said. ``What
the legislation does is give the jury the opportunity to increase
the level of punishment, and they do take advantage of it.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Talk about high expectations. It's not just the man
from Tampa who has them anymore. Knowing their baseball as well as
they do, everybody in the Joe Torre family passed up tickets for
the divisional series and the league championship series as just so
much parsley on the plate of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure was on to get to the World Series, so I can see
all those people,'' Torre, the Yankees' manager, was saying before
New York went out to play the here-we-are, let's-go-for-it San
Diego Padres in the Stadium Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Yankees are in the Series, their Florida-based
owner and their fans and they themselves can see nothing more
appropriate than four more victories.
</P>
<P>
   Anything less than 125 would feel like emptiness. But why should
the Yankees be any different from the six teams that already fell
off the bus to this World Series? The gloom and doom in the six
other cities will not compare to the letdown that would grip New
York and the owner's insatiable little heart should the Yanks come
up short.
</P>
<P>
   The three-tiered playoff system has practically turned baseball
into football, where the survival-of-the-fittest mentality produces
one exalted Super Bowl champion and a league full of chumps and
losers, condemned to a nether world of Parcells-like demons kicking
them in their sore spots for eternity.
</P>
<P>
   The World Series used to be a short and sweet reward for
excellence, but that was when there were eight teams per league,
and the winners met in daylight in early October. Even if the
Yankees clubbed my poor Brooklyn Dodgers into submission once
again, well, there was always next year.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1969, baseball began league championship series, and in
1995 it began a two-layered playoff system. The World Series is
still different, which is why we should all resist the babble of
``post-season records'' flung at us by the hyperactive computers
and the hyperactive broadcasters from the dozens of different
networks that carry baseball. The World Series is still a
competition between one league that encourages pitchers to be
athletes and another league relatively devoid of strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow the ``playoffs'' leave just about everybody feeling
inadequate. Think about it. The Houston Astros are going around
feeling they cannot perform in the post-season. The Texas Rangers
are sulking because they had the best hitting in the league and
could hardly touch Yankee pitching when it counted.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, the glory of winning a special playoff for the
wild-card spot and Sammy Sosa's 66 home runs has been pre-empted.
The very city that beat the Cubs for the 1969 eastern title held a
parade for Sosa Saturday in the canyons where Lindbergh and John
Glenn and the 1969 Mets were once hailed.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of indignity, there are the Red Sox, whose occasional
qualification for the playoffs is merely a signal that nothing good
can come of it.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, the team of the '90s has won exactly one World
Series, and now it is up to management to keep repeating that:
``The main goal is to get to the Series. This is a recorded
announcement. This is a recorded announcement. This is a recorded
announcement.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cleveland, the fans had to live with the phrase ``Nineteen
forty-eight!'' being chanted at the Indians in the Bronx as the
Yankees put the Indians out of misery.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the Padres as the only team with virtually nothing
to lose. This can be good, or it can be bad. Bruce Bochy, the
manager, a reserve on the 1984 San Diego World Series team, has
said: ``A lot of the players on that team said, looking back, we
wish we would have had a little different attitude instead of just
saying, `Hey, we are in the World Series.' And this year, I think
you will see the players out there playing to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre recalled being the underdog in 1996, but he said his
Yankees felt they could beat the Braves. ``I am sure that is the
way the Padres feel right now, that maybe other people aren't
predicting a lot for them, but I am sure they are for themselves,''
Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think getting here is where the pressure is,'' Torre added.
``You want to win, but getting to the World Series is so tough
after playing 162 games and getting into post-season and then
having to fight, bite and scratch and everything else to get
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre continued: ``You don't think about in spring training that
we want to go and win the World Series. You want to get to the
World Series. Then you get there, well, you have played well enough
and won enough games, then of course, we want to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as legitimizing our season _ I hate to even think in
negative terms, but if San Diego happens to win the World Series,
sure it takes a little bit of the luster off what we have
accomplished by getting here, but I think that was our goal,
initially.''
</P>
<P>
   The key word in that sentence is ``initially.'' The Yankees
built an insatiable demand for more victories _ and World Series
tickets in the Torre family. While they're at it, the Yankees had
better win the whole thing. They are a victim of their own
excellence.

PERU AND ECUADOR AGREE TO PUT BORDER DISPUTE IN OUTSIDERS' HANDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ After emotional debates, the congresses
of Peru and Ecuador have agreed to give the United States, Brazil
and two other guarantor nations the power to impose a solution on
South America's longest-running border dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations have tried war, once in the early 1940s and
again in 1995, and negotiation, but have been unable to agree on
who should have a 49-mile stretch of the Condor Mountains that lies
between them.
</P>
<P>
   The votes passed overwhelmingly Friday in both countries just as
President Alberto Fujimori of Peru and his Ecuadorian counterpart,
Jamil Mahuad, headed for the Eighth Iberian-American summit meeting
in Oporto, Portugal. There they were to meet with leaders and
representatives of the four guarantor nations _ the other two are
Argentina and Chile _ to formally deliver the votes of their
Congresses and to chart their next moves.
</P>
<P>
   Casualties from the brief 1995 war ran into the hundreds; the
hostility over the border has also been the pretext for a sizable
arms buildup that neither nation can afford. The heavily fortified
frontier, now closed, has divided Indian tribes who once lived
there. Those visiting kin must now travel for days through river
networks via Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual decision in both capitals to allow the guarantor
nations to impose definitive borders indicates how intractable the
problem remains. At a meeting here last year, the two countries
agreed to a strict timetable for confidence-building measures and
settling of disputes, and there was even talk of turning the entire
contested area into an international nature reserve.
</P>
<P>
   But the heart of the contention, the border markings, has eluded
solution. The two presidents eventually appealed to President
Clinton and the other guarantors, who said they would help only if
the Congresses in both Ecuador and Peru agreed to abide by their
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Though legislators overwhelmingly agreed to turn the guarantors
into arbiters, debates in both capitals revolved around martyrs,
national sovereignty and the nature of democracy. As the Congresses
convened Thursday afternoon, demonstrators turned out in both
capitals calling for ``peace with dignity,'' and legislators in
both countries said _ perhaps inauspiciously _ that they expected
final borders favoring their side.
</P>
<P>
   In Quito, Ecuador, Gen. Paco Moncayo, chief of the armed forces,
told Congress there was no other way to resolve the dispute and
presented a letter signed by top military leaders backing that
view. Jaime Nebot, a party leader who had lost the presidential
election to Mahuad in July, also supported the move Friday, saying
it was time for Congress ``to assume responsibilities and make
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Those opposing the vote labeled it a surrender of national
sovereignty. Carlos Ferrero, a Peruvian legislator whose cousin,
Eduardo Ferrero Costa, had resigned his post as foreign minister
over the proposal, called for a popular referendum to approve any
borders that the guarantor nations present. ``To try to close the
border by punching a hole in democracy is an error as dangerous as
can be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Chirinos Soto, a columnist for a Peruvian daily,
Cambio, called the congressional vote a ``jump into the void,''
since the Congresses had no idea what they were ultimately
accepting.

policy in the State Department.''
 &HT;    _ Sen. Joseph McCarthy, Feb. 9, 1950, Wheeling, W.Va.
 &HT;    
 By ETHAN BRONNER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the most infamous speeches in U.S. politics.
Delivered just months after the Soviet Union detonated its first
atomic device _ a replica of the U.S. bomb right down to the bolts
_ and months before the communist North invaded South Korea and
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were charged with selling nuclear
secrets to Moscow, McCarthy's words set off a period of political
hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   It would be some time before the nation grasped that he not only
had no scruples but that he also had no list. By then, many
honorable Americans whose sentiments leaned to the left _ among
them, teachers and actors, journalists and government functionaries
_ had lost their jobs in a witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   But half a century later, with Soviet-era archives open, it
turns out there was a list. Not the fake one brandished by McCarthy
before a group of Republican women, but a real one, with code names
and salary receipts and carbons of sensitive messages on the
Manhattan Project and U.S. diplomatic strategy that were passed to
the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of the Soviet evidence starting in the early
1990s, after the breakup of the Soviet Union, and the 1995-1996
declassification of U.S. intelligence files on the interception of
Soviet spy cables _ now widely known as the Venona decryptions _
has unleashed a flood of scholarship. In a replay of old battles,
it is a debate over U.S. communism and McCarthyism with two
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   One side is asking: If the left was so wrong so recently, why
should it be listened to at all? The other side counters that when
the right is given a chance, as it was in the early 1950's, it
becomes vicious. And with the Cold War won, it argues, there is a
whiff of right-wing triumphalism in the air that must not go
unaddressed.
</P>
<P>
   The new documents certainly sully many icons of the old left.
Julius Rosenberg, it is now clear, was guilty (though there is
still debate about his wife's complicity). Alger Hiss, according to
respected new scholarship, was probably a Soviet agent and the U.S.
government in the 1930s and '40s harbored hundreds of communist
spies and even more fellow travelers.
</P>
<P>
   And there is more to come. Next year, Ronald Radosh, a senior
research associate at George Washington University, will publish
what he says is a devastating picture of the Spanish Civil War _ as
a gruesome example of Soviet imperialism dressed up as
anti-fascism, rather than as the epic, noble battle the left has
always said it was.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that, given the ferocity of the political
struggle at the time, the scholarly struggle over the new data is
raw and impassioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand you have scholars showing that many members of
the Communist Party were motivated by a legitimate desire to fight
social injustice,'' said Jonathan Brent, editorial director of Yale
University Press, which is publishing 25 volumes on the new
material titled ``Annals of Communism.'' ``But at the top of the
party they were controlled by Moscow. How do you reconcile the
two?''
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence has appeared so quickly and so forcefully, and
at a time when communism is so bereft of defenders and intellectual
capital, that some have flirted with the rehabilitation of McCarthy
himself.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, The Observer of London stated: ``McCarthy has gone down
as one of the most reviled men in U.S. history, but historians are
now facing the unpleasant truth that he was right.''
</P>
<P>
   In The Washington Post, Nicholas von Hoffman wrote, ``Point by
point, Joe McCarthy got it all wrong and yet was still closer to
the truth than those who ridiculed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Such assertions send chills down the spine of Ellen Schrecker, a
historian at Yeshiva University, whose new book, ``Many Are the
Crimes: McCarthyism in America'' (Little, Brown), argues that
whatever harm may have come to the country from Soviet-sponsored
spies is dwarfed by McCarthy's wave of terror, which crushed
livelihoods as well as any alternative political discourse.
</P>
<P>
   She said social developments like government-provided health
care and strong labor unions _ things commonplace elsewhere in the
West _ were stymied in America. And, she added, the China hands in
the State Department who could have fended off the disaster of the
Vietnam War had been purged for suspected communist sympathies.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the gush of new scholarship from the archives is less
rigorous than it appears, say Professor Schrecker and others,
including Victor Navasky, publisher of The Nation, who wrote
``Naming Names'' (Viking, 1980), a book about Hollywood
blacklisting. The scholarship relies heavily on the boasts of
Soviet-paid agents in America eager to impress their Moscow
masters. And, they say, it is scholarship with an agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening today is an effort to deny the legitimacy
not just of those who favored the Communist Party but the entire
left-wing political movement in the post-Berlin Wall moment,'' said
Nelson Lichtenstein, a history professor at the University of
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole anti-racist, anti-capitalist impulse in American
life, which reached its apogee in the 1930s and '40s, is on the
line. If it turns out these movements were the results of
communists advancing their goals, are they still legitimate? People
like Ron Radosh want to discredit not only that historical episode
but the moral legitimacy of the left in the United States today.''
</P>
<P>
   Radosh says he has little patience for these arguments. ``I deal
with issues of historical truth,'' he said. ``The left's inability
to accept this truth is what discredits the left.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, too, something more personal is at stake. Many of the
most passionate advocates on both sides of this struggle, including
Radosh and Professor Schrecker, were ``red diaper'' babies, weaned
on the left. The debate pits those upholding the honor of their
idealistic parents against those who believe their own honor
requires them to expose the deceptions on which they were raised.
</P>
<P>
   William F. Buckley Jr., whose new novel on McCarthy is due out
next summer, said many Americans looking back on the espionage
dismiss its significance because there is so little threat from
Moscow today that to them it is hard to remember how serious the
peril was.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion of stealing secrets is seen today as a kind of
misjudgment, a form of eccentric behavior,'' said Buckley, who was
an early friend and defender of McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how much damage was done is a matter of some contention.
No one suggests that a communist coup was afoot or that the nation
was in existential danger. But the Soviets did build the bomb a
year or two earlier than they would have _ no small feat _ and it
is not hard to imagine other damage that might have resulted from
unchecked spying.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Klehr, a historian at Emory University and co-author of
the new book ``The Soviet World of American Communism'' (Yale
University Press), has mused that if Franklin D. Roosevelt had died
earlier, his vice president during the third term, Henry Wallace,
would have become president. Wallace had once said that as
president he would make Laurence Duggan his secretary of state and
Harry Dexter White his Treasury secretary. Evidence in the Venona
messages suggests that both were Soviet agents, Professor Klehr
said.
</P>
<P>
   That is why people like Buckley argue that McCarthy has been
maligned by history. ``McCarthy's excesses have to be taken in the
context of other work he did,'' Buckley said. ``For example, his
concentration on security loyalty practices was absolutely
correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Naftali, a senior fellow at the Miller Center of the
University of Virginia, said McCarthy gave anti-communism a bad
name, but that a fair examination of communist activity during and
after World War II would show that anti-communist paranoia was
understandable and reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI and military officials had lists of hundreds of
unidentified code names that appeared in Soviet intelligence
traffic and had every reason to believe that many of those names
belonged to agents still operating,'' he said. Many of the code
names have yet to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets became aware of U.S. interceptions by the end of the
1940s _ thanks to Kim Philby, then a Washington-based double agent
of British intelligence _ and shut down their operation just as
McCarthy was coming on the scene and U.S. counter-intelligence was
swinging into action.
</P>
<P>
   So by the time McCarthy was hunting communists, most of the
agents were gone. It is a quirk of history, but one apparent only
through the perspective of the archives.
</P>
<P>
   As the century draws to a close, communism and Nazism are being
increasingly grouped as 20th-century paradigms of totalitarian
horror. But once the Soviets were seen for what they were, were
those who insisted on waiting for ``true'' communism fools? Or
knaves?
</P>
<P>
   It was Hitler who said people prefer a big lie to a small truth,
and the proponents of Soviet communism certainly understood that.
It was the very depth of their betrayal that made it so hard for
American communists to grasp the deception.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we realized that what we thought was heaven really was
hell, we fell into silence,'' said Robert Schrank, a former
communist and union leader who has just published a memoir titled,
``Wasn't That a Time? Growing Up Radical and Red in America'' (MIT
Press). ``We were overwhelmed with shame.''
</P>
<P>
   That explains, in part, the uncivil nature of today's dialogue
and why it will likely be some time before a full accounting can be
offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``As these first documents come out, we are having a debate,''
said Brent of Yale University Press. ``But it is a slow historical
process, something involving our national consciousness, and I
think it will be at least five to 10 years before a historian
arises who can really put this all in perspective.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The House of Unions, like so many buildings in Russia, has
served many different masters. In the 18th century, a Crimean
prince commissioned its construction in Moscow. Russian nobles
later converted it to a private club. Lenin, Stalin and Brezhnev
lay in state behind its bright green facade.
</P>
<P>
   And in June, as Russia lurched toward a financial crisis that
set off global shock waves, the House of Unions was rented for a
glittering celebration of capitalism, with one of the country's
most ardent bankers, Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., as its host. Goldman
flew in former President George Bush, paying him more than
$100,000, and entertained Russia's former prime minister. But
between toasts to U.S.-Russian ties, the talk was about what really
mattered to Goldman and many Wall Street brethren: deals.
</P>
<P>
   True, Russia was a mess, the government's bank accounts were
almost empty and even the postal system was near collapse. But
Goldman wanted to become Russia's leading deal maker, paid
handsomely to finance the government and newly private businesses.
Now was the time to prove that Goldman could come through with
money in a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   So in the days preceding its elegant soiree, Goldman helped the
government raise money by selling $1.25 billion in bonds. A few
weeks later, it arranged a complex deal in which short-term debt
was exchanged for long-term debt to give Russia financial breathing
room.
</P>
<P>
   It was not enough. By late August, the Russian government
stopped paying what it owed on much of its debt. Buyers of the
bonds that Goldman sold now hold nearly worthless paper. Goldman
itself escaped the blood bath: in the course of those bond deals it
earned tens of millions of dollars in fees and protected hundreds
of millions of dollars it had at stake in Russia. When the
government defaulted, Goldman said its losses were ``absolutely
minimal.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Goldman executives expressed regret that Russia's
economic program collapsed and that the deals that bear Goldman's
imprimatur did not always work as intended. But they defended the
firm's role there as ``very constructive'' and attributed the
country's troubles to problems that had little to do with
investment banking. Goldman maintains a small office in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But the firm's troubled bond deal and the skillful protection of
its own money are a window on the role that many investment banks
played in the breathless rise and fall of the newly liberated
Russian economy. To critics, including Russian officials, analysts
and some investment bankers who worked in Russia, Wall Street
helped hook Russia on easy money, rarely saying no or advising
clients to take it slow. They fed the seemingly insatiable appetite
for borrowed money.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers helped the Russian government borrow billions from
foreign investors before it could reliably collect taxes to pay
them back. Bankers flattered the country's oligarchs, an emerging
class of elite businessmen, with generous loans that many
commercial banks shunned as too risky. They helped regional
governments raise money for farms through ``agro bonds,'' even
though the system of money-draining Soviet-style collectives never
ended.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of investment bankers, Russia built a roaring bond
market, but never developed a bricks-and-mortar banking system that
provided loans the conventional way. Nor did Russia attract much
investment from multinational companies. Such companies have
committed about $8.7 billion to the country, while Russia's
governments and businesses have incurred more than four times that
much in short-term debt that must be repaid within a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Russian problem reflects is that today's bankers
often don't have long-lasting concerns about customer-client
relations,'' said Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal
Reserve and an occasional adviser to Russian government officials.
``You just do the deal and get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Volcker noted that Russia was part of a broader problem in many
emerging markets, where local companies and governments have tried
to raise money quickly by issuing securities even before they are
ready to handle the demands of shareholders and debt payments.
``Greed prevails over prudence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's experience stands in sharp contrast to the developing
world's other heavyweight, China. In the last seven years, foreign
companies have invested about $181 billion in China, much of it to
finance long-term industrial joint ventures or wholly owned foreign
factories. Though investment bankers eagerly knocked at the door,
Beijing has restricted the freedom of its companies and local
governments to borrow money abroad, fearing such money could leave
as quickly as it came.
</P>
<P>
   Some Wall Street bankers acknowledge that in pursuit of profits
they glossed over some warning signs about Russia _ corporate
corruption, failure to pay loans on time, gross accounting
irregularities and tax evasion _ because they were blinded by the
country's enormous natural wealth. Others say they were lulled into
complacence by a presumption of international backing for the
Russian experiment with markets. Many bankers acknowledge privately
that they courted Russia more eagerly, and sometimes with less
discretion, than they did many other darlings of the developing
world, including many countries where capitalism had much longer to
gestate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a short time, we went from having a sovereign government
that was not considered credit worthy to a situation in which
virtually every regional government and every top company was
coming to the investment banking community or being approached by
them to talk about stocks and bonds,'' said Jim Dannis, head of
European emerging markets for Salomon Smith Barney. ``We very
rapidly had an oversupply of services, followed by a sudden
collapse.''

<P>
   The Rush: A Market Ripe For the Picking
</P>
<P>
   From November 1996, when J.P Morgan and SBC-Warburg jointly
marketed Russia's first international bond since the days of the
czar, to August, when the country defaulted on its debt, there was
a stampede of bond and stock deals. The rush was so great that
bankers sometimes nearly tripped over themselves in pursuit of
clients that some thought marginal even at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, for example, many leading investment
bankers crowded first-class sections on Aeroflot flights from
Moscow to the central Siberian city of Irkutsk, where the soil was
underlain with permafrost and a local energy company,
Irkutskenergo, was thinking of raising money abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Managers at the power plant had so many suitors that they made
bankers prove their mettle: Those who wanted to underwrite
Irkutskenergo's bond were required to provide up-front loans of $50
million, then guarantee in writing that the company would pay
interest rates only modestly higher than what the U.S. government
pays, bankers who competed for the business said. Most scoffed, but
several investment banks accepted Irkutskenergo's terms.
SBC-Warburg, the Swiss-British investment bank, eventually won the
company's nod to underwrite the bond.
</P>
<P>
   There were a wave of stock deals, too. Shares of 28 Russian
companies, including a department store, several banks, half a
dozen energy companies and a few industrial concerns, were offered
to the public by big Wall Street names including Salomon, Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, and Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette and trade on
the New York Stock Exchange through direct or indirect listings.
All those Russian stocks now trade at one-fifth, one-tenth, even
one-twentieth of their offering prices, meaning that investors who
bought in early and held have lost most of their money.
</P>
<P>
   For an immature market, Russia also took on some of the
financial trappings of developed countries, with Wall Street help.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Credit Suisse First Boston, the Swiss-American
investment bank, pioneered a way for foreign speculators to buy and
sell high-interest Russian government debt. The bank was one of the
most active traders in Russia, adding to an already overheated
market. It was also one of the biggest sellers of Russian debt
derivatives to foreign investors, earning big profits in 1996 and
1997 but losing what analysts expect will amount to $500 million to
$2 billion this year because of its heavy exposure in Russia after
the country defaulted.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, nearly every big Wall Street firm had an active and
growing operation in Russia before the collapse. From the start,
however, Goldman, Sachs stood out. In 1992, under its chief
executive, Robert Rubin, who is now the U.S. treasury secretary,
Goldman was named banking adviser to Boris Yeltsin's new
government, recruited to help attract foreign investment. Business
was slow, however, and Goldman pulled out of Russia entirely in
1994, angering some senior Russian officials, bankers said.
</P>
<P>
   When Russian markets took off two years later, however, Goldman
rushed back in _ and opened its checkbook to make temporary loans
as a prelude to winning investment banking business. Goldman's
willingness to shell out big, up-front loans bolstered Russia's
confidence that Wall Street was unlikely to shut off the financing
spigot, and that even companies with spotty track records could
count on a flow of money from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Investors _ including big mutual funds and hedge funds _ also
complain that Goldman was so eager to prove its underwriting
prowess to the Russian government that it flooded the international
market for Russian bonds in the final weeks before the country
defaulted. Moreover, Goldman used a bond deal to pay back one of
its own temporary loans. It also used $550 million of its own
capital to create momentum for its second big bond deal, but
reduced that exposure to Russian bonds shortly after the deal was
complete. Those moves raised some concerns among investors,
especially because the bonds are now worth much less than they were
when they were first sold.
</P>
<P>
   But Glenn Earle, a Goldman managing director who oversees the
firm's Russian business as head of its new markets team, dismisses
such criticism as ``largely carping from competitors and the
misrepresentation of sound transactions with the advantage of 20/20
hindsight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a very significant impact in the Russian market,''
Earle said. ``We had the very high-profile assignments, the most
difficult ones, which we were pitching for along with all the other
major banks. It is obviously extremely unfortunate that the market
turned out this way. But the speed and extent of the collapse was
both unforeseen and unforeseeable by our competitors and
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the firm's tactics were among the most aggressive of
Western banks scouting business in Russia's still-untapped market,
other bankers said. Goldman, for example, made loans as sweeteners
to Russian companies that were considered by most commercial banks
to be risky borrowers. The idea was to lock up new investment
banking in the future by advancing them money, a practice common to
many, but not all, of its investment banking rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman officials said that they were not eager to make such
loans and that they fended off many Russian demands for cheap
short-term financing. But they said that in some cases they
considered it the price of making business contacts in Russia's
fledgling banking market.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman made loans to at least four clients, the oil giant
Yukos, the Russian banks Inkombank and Menatep and its largest
client, the Russian government. The firm said those loans were
often arranged in conjunction with other Western banks, and that
its chief rivals recruited or tried to recruit the same clients.
</P>
<P>
   The Oligarchs: Goldman Courts A Young Tycoon
</P>
<P>
   The loans sped Goldman's rush into Russia's feverish market. An
early target: companies controlled by the oligarchs, businessmen
who control most of the country's big industries. A few such
businessmen have acknowledged that they took control of Russian
national companies in auctions that were deeply flawed, allowing
them to buy once-prized national energy and mining companies at
fire sale prices. Analysts suspect that many big Russian
conglomerates have siphoned cash from the companies they took over,
putting it in foreign accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials speak openly of their worries that the
conglomerates, many of them publicly listed, often flouted the law.
``Most of the companies were ignoring most of the regulations and
used to violate them all of the time,'' said Dmitri Vasiliev, who
recently resigned as chairman of Russia's Federal Commission for
the Securities Market. ``It's not easy to enforce securities laws
here because we don't have the courts we need to prosecute
violators.''
</P>
<P>
   Eager to forge alliances with businessmen who could one day
prove to be Rockefellers or Gettys, Goldman sought to develop close
relations with Menatep. The bank was the financing arm in the
empire of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a 35-year-old, tough-talking
businessman who controlled one of the country's biggest business
networks, including Yukos and other big oil concerns. Goldman's
calling card: a $200 million loan for Menatep.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers who have had direct dealings with Khodorkovsky said that
he used Menatep and Yukos to wangle cash out of smaller companies
in which Menatep had big equity stakes. Some of those subsidiary
companies are publicly listed, and they have minority shareholders
who do not benefit from profits at Yukos or Menatep. Yukos has also
pledged much of its projected short-term earnings as collateral to
go on a huge borrowing binge, analysts said, raising serious doubts
about the company's ability to pay its debts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Khodorkovsky, as well as Menatep and Yukos officials in Moscow,
declined repeated interview requests by telephone and fax. A lawyer
for the company in Washington declined to comment, and was unable
to obtain a response from company representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Yukos had approached several banks, including Morgan Stanley and
Chase Manhattan, seeking a $500 million loan in the summer of 1997
_ some more than once _ but was repeatedly turned away. Then
Goldman entered the picture. Late last year, Goldman arranged for a
group of banks, including Credit Lyonnais and Merrill Lynch, to
join in lending Yukos $500 million, with oil-export earnings used
as collateral, in advance of a proposed bond offering.
</P>
<P>
   The banks had hoped to repackage the loan as a security and sell
it to other investors. But as was often the case in Russia, their
ardor was not matched by market demand: Much of the loan remains on
their books, meaning that Yukos still owes them money. While Yukos
missed a debt payment last spring, putting the loan into technical
default, Goldman says the payments are now current, and does not
consider it a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's help in raising money for Yukos had a direct impact on
some American companies. The Dart Management Co., which oversees
Russian investments of the Michigan industrialist Kenneth Dart, has
stakes in several formerly independent oil companies that Yukos now
controls.
</P>
<P>
   E. Michael Hunter, Dart's manager in Russia and a former banker,
said Yukos routinely squeezed profits out of its new subsidiaries
by forcing them to sell oil to the parent company at below-market
prices. Yukos then resold the oil abroad at market prices and
collected the profits at the expense of its subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said he wrote letters to Goldman's chairman and chief
executive, Jon Corzine, and the heads of other banks in the lending
syndicate detailing Yukos' business practices. He urged the banks
not to accept the disputed oil exports as collateral for the loan
they made to Yukos. Hunter said his pleas were rejected by the
banking syndicate's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are horribly bad at doing due diligence,'' Hunter
said of Goldman and Yukos' other bankers. ``They were moved by
greed, frankly. They preferred to hitch their horse to these guys
rather than to face the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman officials said that they believed that Yukos acted
legally under Russian law, though the firm declined to discuss the
details of its relationship with the client.
</P>
<P>
   The Investors: So Many New Bonds, So Little Confidence
</P>
<P>
   Since the default in August, investors in Russian bonds have
criticized Goldman and another top adviser to Moscow, J.P. Morgan,
for their work in issuing Russian bonds. Investors and some rival
bankers argue that bond issues underwritten by those two firms
swamped an already-soggy bond market, accelerating a loss of
investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   By the spring of this year, Russia found it nearly impossible to
issue any more ruble-denominated bonds in its domestic market.
After a flood of issues over three years that left Moscow
struggling to pay interest on tens of billions of dollars in
borrowings, investors lost faith and declined to buy more
short-term Russian debt. The government was also having great
difficulty collecting taxes. So, it sought bankers who would help
find new sources of foreign money. Before the summer, Russia had
issued a cumulative total of $4.3 billion in medium- and long-term
dollar bonds overseas, and that market was viewed as potentially
much larger.
</P>
<P>
   To the Russians, Goldman was the key. It underwrote a $1.25
billion issue of dollar-denominated bonds known as Eurobonds in
June _ the first new dollar bonds Russia managed to sell since the
fall, before Asia's turmoil spread. Goldman also arranged a $6.4
billion bond swap in July, which allowed investors in Russia's
short-term ruble debt to exchange their holdings for longer-term
dollar bonds. This offered at least temporary breathing space for
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with a separate $2.5 billion Eurobond issue
underwritten by J.P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank in late June, the
investment banks tripled the total supply of Russia's dollar bonds
in just six weeks _ from $4.3 billion to nearly $15 billion _
despite growing investor squeamishness about emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   Many bankers judge the merits of a bond or stock deal by whether
prices rise or at least hold firm after the issue is sold to
investors. That's because clients do not want to see the market
value of their securities plummet, which makes it harder to raise
money later. Russia's summer bond deals did not pass that price
test: while the new issues prompted a brief market rally, they soon
tumbled.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan's Russia Eurobond index gives the tally: the Russian
benchmark bond price hovered above $100 all year until the new
issues began reaching the market in June. By late July, just before
the giant Goldman swap of ruble bonds for dollar bonds, the
benchmark price had fallen to just above $80. But it was soon after
that Goldman bond swap, in late July, that the bottom fell out. The
crash to about $50 directly preceded Russia's default.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some investors in Russian dollar bonds complain that
the deals contributed to the default: With the international bond
market collapsing along with the domestic one, the Russian
government saw another of its channels for raising money blocked,
perhaps concluding that it had little left to lose by defaulting.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Merrell, a manager for the IDS Global Bond Fund and an
active investor in Russian dollar bonds, said that underwriters
torpedoed the market with the deluge of new issues, undercutting
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight there was no plan,'' Merrell said. ``Just take as
much money as the market will give and hope it holds together.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior J.P. Morgan banker responsible for the firm's business
in the Russian region said that his institution acted with good
faith in Russia and that the firm considered the June bond deal it
underwrote to be a success.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Michael Sherwood, head of Goldman's emerging-markets
syndicate desk in London, argued that Goldman's June bond deal was
well received by investors, selling out in less than an hour and
raising much-needed money for Russia at a tough time.
</P>
<P>
   The July debt swap, he said, fell short of Goldman's goal of
relieving Russia's domestic debt burden, though he said that it was
the right thing to do. The reason the swap failed, he said, was
because it was too small, not too large. If investors had opted to
swap more of their short-term ruble debt for long-term dollar
bonds, the deal might have allowed Russia to continue to pay
interest on all its debt, avoiding default. He said he suspected
that investors might have chosen not to participate in Goldman's
swap because they had a false sense of confidence that Russia would
continue to honor its high-interest ruble debt, a favorite source
of income for speculative hedge funds. Many also may have hoped
that the International Monetary Fund would pump enough money into
Russia to insure that it did not fail.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the merits for Russia, the deals were good for Goldman.
The firm earned fees of about $56 million for arranging the July
debt swap alone, rival bankers say, though they add that that fee
is standard in the industry for the work performed.

</P>
<P>
   Part of the proceeds Russia raised from the June bond issue also
went to pay off Goldman's half-share of $500 million in short-term
financing known as a bridge loan to the Russian government late
last year. That loan, Goldman officials acknowledge, was made to
put its name at the front of the list of banks jostling to be named
advisers and underwriters for the government. Goldman officials
said they had an agreement with the government to have the loan
repaid as soon as Russia raised money through a foreign bond
offering. Goldman was the underwriter for the first such offering
made after the loan was extended.
</P>
<P>
   Rival bankers and investors say the bridge loan raises the
question of a conflict of interest because Goldman, with nearly 4
percent of its partners' capital tied up in that one loan, was
highly motivated to market the June bond deal _ and make sure that
it was big enough for Russia to pay Goldman back. Goldman itself at
that time was preparing to issue shares to the public, a move that
would require the private partnership to open its books to scrutiny
for the first time in its 130-year history. A large bridge loan to
the Russian government, unsecured by collateral and made at a time
of considerable turmoil in emerging markets worldwide, would have
raised a red flag for brokerage firm analysts and credit rating
agencies, which view that kind of lending as high risk.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman also had a great deal of its own capital at stake in the
second bond deal, but managed to take it off the table well before
the August default. The firm said that it sought to generate
momentum for the July debt swap by buying ruble-denominated
securities in the days leading up to the swap for the purpose of
including them in the swap transaction _ a standard, though
somewhat risky, underwriting activity, not altogether unlike a
publisher snapping up books from stores to try to get the title on
the best-seller list. After the swap was completed, that left
Goldman with a store of newly minted Russian dollar bonds valued at
about $550 million. Goldman disclosed in financial documents that
it had the right to participate in the swap offering in this way.
</P>
<P>
   But the story has another twist: Even as Goldman proclaimed
publicly as recently as its elegant House of Unions party that it
was in Russia for the long term, the firm appears to have had
limited faith in the country's financial future. Goldman confirms
that its trading position on Russian debt went from ``quite long''
in the days around the swap to ``flat'' or even ``short'' by
August, meaning that it substantially trimmed its $550 million
holdings of Russian bonds or even had trading positions that would
have benefited from a fall in prices of those bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman officials declined to talk in detail about the trading
the firm does on its own account. But officials said the
international dollar bond market was large, accommodating large buy
and sell orders each day, and that Goldman was an active trader in
that market. The firm, these officials said, frequently buys large
blocks of bonds and sells them to investors when it thinks the
price is right, a practice they describe as a routine part of
Goldman's core business.
</P>
<P>
   Rival bankers agree that Goldman would not have been wise to
invest lots of money in Russian dollar bonds at such a volatile
time _ though other firms do often keep a store of bonds in which
they are dealers to facilitate trading. But several bankers who
followed the transaction noted that Goldman accumulated its
holdings of Russian bonds specifically to create momentum for its
swap deal, then quickly sold the bonds when the deal was done, a
sequence that Goldman does not deny. Goldman officials said that
market demand for Russian dollar bonds was still strong when it
trimmed its position. But other bankers said Goldman's heavy
selling almost certainly worsened the sharp drop in Russian dollar
bond prices in the days following the debt swap.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, by quickly selling off its own holdings just after it
led investors to purchase the same securities suggests that it was
worried more about the firm's own money than the long-term
interests of its client, the Russian government, these bankers say.

 By JOSEPH KAHN and TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The House of Unions, like so many buildings in Russia, has
served many different masters. In the 18th century, a Crimean
prince commissioned its construction in Moscow. Russian nobles
later converted it to a private club. Lenin, Stalin and Brezhnev
lay in state behind its bright green facade.
</P>
<P>
   And in June, as Russia lurched toward a financial crisis that
set off global shock waves, the House of Unions was rented for a
glittering celebration of capitalism, with one of the country's
most ardent bankers, Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., as its host. Goldman
flew in former President George Bush, paying him more than
$100,000, and entertained Russia's former prime minister. But
between toasts to U.S.-Russian ties, the talk was about what really
mattered to Goldman and many Wall Street brethren: deals.
</P>
<P>
   True, Russia was a mess, the government's bank accounts were
almost empty and even the postal system was near collapse. But
Goldman wanted to become Russia's leading deal maker, paid
handsomely to finance the government and newly private businesses.
Now was the time to prove that Goldman could come through with
money in a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   So in the days preceding its elegant soiree, Goldman helped the
government raise money by selling $1.25 billion in bonds. A few
weeks later, it arranged a complex deal in which short-term debt
was exchanged for long-term debt to give Russia financial breathing
room.
</P>
<P>
   It was not enough. By late August, the Russian government
stopped paying what it owed on much of its debt. Buyers of the
bonds that Goldman sold now hold nearly worthless paper. Goldman
itself escaped the blood bath: in the course of those bond deals it
earned tens of millions of dollars in fees and protected hundreds
of millions of dollars it had at stake in Russia. When the
government defaulted, Goldman said its losses were ``absolutely
minimal.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Goldman executives expressed regret that Russia's
economic program collapsed and that the deals that bear Goldman's
imprimatur did not always work as intended. But they defended the
firm's role there as ``very constructive'' and attributed the
country's troubles to problems that had little to do with
investment banking. Goldman maintains a small office in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But the firm's troubled bond deal and the skillful protection of
its own money are a window on the role that many investment banks
played in the breathless rise and fall of the newly liberated
Russian economy. To critics, including Russian officials, analysts
and some investment bankers who worked in Russia, Wall Street
helped hook Russia on easy money, rarely saying no or advising
clients to take it slow. They fed the seemingly insatiable appetite
for borrowed money.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers helped the Russian government borrow billions from
foreign investors before it could reliably collect taxes to pay
them back. Bankers flattered the country's oligarchs, an emerging
class of elite businessmen, with generous loans that many
commercial banks shunned as too risky. They helped regional
governments raise money for farms through ``agro bonds,'' even
though the system of money-draining Soviet-style collectives never
ended.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of investment bankers, Russia built a roaring bond
market, but never developed a bricks-and-mortar banking system that
provided loans the conventional way. Nor did Russia attract much
investment from multinational companies. Such companies have
committed about $8.7 billion to the country, while Russia's
governments and businesses have incurred more than four times that
much in short-term debt that must be repaid within a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Russian problem reflects is that today's bankers
often don't have long-lasting concerns about customer-client
relations,'' said Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal
Reserve and an occasional adviser to Russian government officials.
``You just do the deal and get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Volcker noted that Russia was part of a broader problem in many
emerging markets, where local companies and governments have tried
to raise money quickly by issuing securities even before they are
ready to handle the demands of shareholders and debt payments.
``Greed prevails over prudence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's experience stands in sharp contrast to the developing
world's other heavyweight, China. In the last seven years, foreign
companies have invested about $181 billion in China, much of it to
finance long-term industrial joint ventures or wholly owned foreign
factories. Though investment bankers eagerly knocked at the door,
Beijing has restricted the freedom of its companies and local
governments to borrow money abroad, fearing such money could leave
as quickly as it came.
</P>
<P>
   Some Wall Street bankers acknowledge that in pursuit of profits
they glossed over some warning signs about Russia _ corporate
corruption, failure to pay loans on time, gross accounting
irregularities and tax evasion _ because they were blinded by the
country's enormous natural wealth. Others say they were lulled into
complacence by a presumption of international backing for the
Russian experiment with markets. Many bankers acknowledge privately
that they courted Russia more eagerly, and sometimes with less
discretion, than they did many other darlings of the developing
world, including many countries where capitalism had much longer to
gestate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a short time, we went from having a sovereign government
that was not considered credit worthy to a situation in which
virtually every regional government and every top company was
coming to the investment banking community or being approached by
them to talk about stocks and bonds,'' said Jim Dannis, head of
European emerging markets for Salomon Smith Barney. ``We very
rapidly had an oversupply of services, followed by a sudden
collapse.''

<P>
   The Rush: A Market Ripe For the Picking
</P>
<P>
   From November 1996, when J.P Morgan and SBC-Warburg jointly
marketed Russia's first international bond since the days of the
czar, to August, when the country defaulted on its debt, there was
a stampede of bond and stock deals. The rush was so great that
bankers sometimes nearly tripped over themselves in pursuit of
clients that some thought marginal even at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, for example, many leading investment
bankers crowded first-class sections on Aeroflot flights from
Moscow to the central Siberian city of Irkutsk, where the soil was
underlain with permafrost and a local energy company,
Irkutskenergo, was thinking of raising money abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Managers at the power plant had so many suitors that they made
bankers prove their mettle: Those who wanted to underwrite
Irkutskenergo's bond were required to provide up-front loans of $50
million, then guarantee in writing that the company would pay
interest rates only modestly higher than what the U.S. government
pays, bankers who competed for the business said. Most scoffed, but
several investment banks accepted Irkutskenergo's terms.
SBC-Warburg, the Swiss-British investment bank, eventually won the
company's nod to underwrite the bond.
</P>
<P>
   There were a wave of stock deals, too. Shares of 28 Russian
companies, including a department store, several banks, half a
dozen energy companies and a few industrial concerns, were offered
to the public by big Wall Street names including Salomon, Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, and Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette and trade on
the New York Stock Exchange through direct or indirect listings.
All those Russian stocks now trade at one-fifth, one-tenth, even
one-twentieth of their offering prices, meaning that investors who
bought in early and held have lost most of their money.
</P>
<P>
   For an immature market, Russia also took on some of the
financial trappings of developed countries, with Wall Street help.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Credit Suisse First Boston, the Swiss-American
investment bank, pioneered a way for foreign speculators to buy and
sell high-interest Russian government debt. The bank was one of the
most active traders in Russia, adding to an already overheated
market. It was also one of the biggest sellers of Russian debt
derivatives to foreigninvestors, earning big profits in 1996 and
1997 but losing what analysts expect will amount to $500 million to
$2 billion this year because of its heavy exposure in Russia after
the country defaulted.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, nearly every big Wall Street firm had an active and
growing operation in Russia before the collapse. From the start,
however, Goldman, Sachs stood out. In 1992, under its chief
executive, Robert Rubin, who is now the U.S. treasury secretary,
Goldman was named banking adviser to Boris Yeltsin's new
government, recruited to help attract foreign investment. Business
was slow, however, and Goldman pulled out of Russia entirely in
1994, angering some senior Russian officials, bankers said.
</P>
<P>
   When Russian markets took off two years later, however, Goldman
rushed back in _ and opened its checkbook to make temporary loans
as a prelude to winning investment banking business. Goldman's
willingness to shell out big, up-front loans bolstered Russia's
confidence that Wall Street was unlikely to shut off the financing
spigot, and that even companies with spotty track records could
count on a flow of money from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Investors _ including big mutual funds and hedge funds _ also
complain that Goldman was so eager to prove its underwriting
prowess to the Russian government that it flooded the international
market for Russian bonds in the final weeks before the country
defaulted. Moreover, Goldman used a bond deal to pay back one of
its own temporary loans. It also used $550 million of its own
capital to create momentum for its second big bond deal, but
reduced that exposure to Russian bonds shortly after the deal was
complete. Those moves raised some concerns among investors,
especially because the bonds are now worth much less than they were
when they were first sold.
</P>
<P>
   But Glenn Earle, a Goldman managing director who oversees the
firm's Russian business as head of its new markets team, dismisses
such criticism as ``largely carping from competitors and the
misrepresentation of sound transactions with the advantage of 20/20
hindsight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a very significant impact in the Russian market,''
Earle said. ``We had the very high-profile assignments, the most
difficult ones, which we were pitching for along with all the other
major banks. It is obviously extremely unfortunate that the market
turned out this way. But the speed and extent of the colapse was
both unforeseen and unforeseeable by our competitors and
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the firm's tactics were among the most aggressive of
Western banks scouting business in Russia's still-untapped market,
other bankers said. Goldman, for example, made loans as sweeteners
to Russian companies that were considered by most commercial banks
to be risky borrowers. The idea was to lock up new investment
banking in the future by advancing them money, a practice common to
many, but not all, of its investment banking rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman officials said that they were not eager to make such
loans and that they fended off many Russian demands for cheap
short-term financing. But they said that in some cases they
considered it the price of making business contacts in Russia's
fledgling banking market.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman made loans to at least four clients, the oil giant
Yukos, the Russian banks Inkombank and Menatep and its largest
client, the Russian government. The firm said those loans were
often arranged in conjunction with other Western banks, and that
its chief rivals recruited or tried to recruit the same clients.

<P>
   The Oligarchs: Goldman Courts A Young Tycoon
</P>
<P>
   The loans sped Goldman's rush into Russia's feverish market. An
early target: companies controlled by the oligarchs, businessmen
who control most of the country's big industries. A few such
businessmen have acknowledged that they took control of Russian
national companies in auctions that were deeply flawed, allowing
them to buy once-prized national energy and mining companies at
fire sale prices. Analysts suspect that many big Russian
conglomerates have siphoned cash from the companies they took over,
putting it in foreign accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials speak openly of their worries that the
conglomerates, many of them publicly listed, often flouted the law.
``Most of the companies were ignoring most of the regulations and
used to violate them all of the time,'' said Dmitri Vasiliev, who
recently resigned as chairman of Russia's Federal Commission for
the Securities Market. ``It's not easy to enforce securities laws
here because we don't have the courts we need to prosecute
violators.''
</P>
<P>
   Eager to forge alliances with businessmen who could one day
prove to be Rockefellers or Gettys, Goldman sought to develop close
relations with Menatep. The bank was the financing arm in the
empire of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a 35-year-old, tough-talking
businessman who controlled one of the country's biggest business
networks, including Yukos and other big oil concerns. Goldman's
calling card: a $200 million loan for Menatep.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers who have had direct dealings with Khodorkovsky said that
he used Menatep and Yukos to wangle cash out of smaller companies
in which Menatep had big equity stakes. Some of those subsidiary
companies are publicly listed, and they have minority shareholders
who do not benefit from profits at Yukos or Menatep. Yukos has also
pledged much of its projected short-term earnings as collateral to
go on a huge borrowing binge, analysts said, raising serious doubts
about the company's ability to pay its debts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Khodorkovsky, as well as Menatep and Yukos officials in Moscow,
declined repeated interview requests by telephone and fax. A lawyer
for the company in Washington declined to comment, and was unable
to obtain a response from company representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Yukos had approached several banks, including Morgan Stanley and
Chase Manhattan, seeking a $500 million loan in the summer of 1997
_ some more than once _ but was repeatedly turned away. Then
Goldman entered the picture. Late last year, Goldman arranged for a
group of banks, including Credit Lyonnais and Merrill Lynch, to
join in lending Yukos $500 million, with oil-export earnings used
as collateral, in advance of a proposed bond offering.
</P>
<P>
   The banks had hoped to repackage the loan as a security and sell
it to other investors. But as was often the case in Russia, their
ardor was not matched by market demand: Much of the loan remains on
their books, meaning that Yukos still owes them money. While Yukos
missed a debt payment last spring, putting the loan into technical
default, Goldman says the payments are now current, and does not
consider it a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's help in raising money for Yukos had a direct impact on
some American companies. The Dart Management Co., which oversees
Russian investments of the Michigan industrialist Kenneth Dart, has
stakes in several formerly independent oil companies that Yukos now
controls.
</P>
<P>
   E. Michael Hunter, Dart's manager in Russia and a former banker,
said Yukos routinely squeezed profits out of its new subsidiaries
by forcing them to sell oil to the parent company at below-market
prices. Yukos then resold the oil abroad at market prices and
collected the profits at the expense of its subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said he wrote letters to Goldman's chairman and chief
executive, Jon Corzine, and the heads of other banks in the lending
syndicate detailing Yukos' business practices. He urged the banks
not to accept the disputed oil exports as collateral for the loan
they made to Yukos. Hunter said his pleas were rejected by the
banking syndicate's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are horribly bad at doing due diligence,'' Hunter
said of Goldman and Yukos' other bankers. ``They were moved by
greed, frankly. They preferred to hitch their horse to these guys
rather than to face the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman officials said that they believed that Yukos acted
legally under Russian law, though the firm declined to discuss the
details of its relationship with the client.
</P>
<P>
   The Investors: So Many New Bonds, So Little Confidence
</P>
<P>
   Since the default in August, investors in Russian bonds have
criticized Goldman and another top adviser to Moscow, J.P. Morgan,
for their work in issuing Russian bonds. Investors and some rival
bankers argue that bond issues underwritten by those two firms
swamped an already-soggy bond market, accelerating a loss of
investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   By the spring of this year, Russia found it nearly impossible to
issue any more ruble-denominated bonds in its domestic market.
After a flood of issues over three years that left Moscow
struggling to pay interest on tens of billions of dollars in
borrowings, investors lost faith and declined to buy more
short-term Russian debt. The government was also having great
difficulty collecting taxes. So, it sought bankers who would help
find new sources of foreign money. Before the summer, Russia had
issued a cumulative total of $4.3 billion in medium- and long-term
dollar bonds overseas, and that market was viewed as potentially
much larger.
</P>
<P>
   To the Russians, Goldman was the key. It underwrote a $1.25
billion issue of dollar-denominated bonds known as Eurobonds in
June _ the first new dollar bonds Russia managed to sell since the
fall, before Asia's turmoil spread. Goldman also arranged a $6.4
billion bond swap in July, which allowed investors in Russia's
short-term ruble debt to exchange their holdings for longer-term
dollar bonds. This offered at least temporary breathing space for
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with a separate $2.5 billion Eurobond issue
underwritten by J.P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank in late June, the
investment banks tripled the total supply of Russia's dollar bonds
in just six weeks _ from $4.3 billion to nearly $15 billion _
despite growing investor squeamishness about emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   Many bankers judge the merits of a bond or stock deal by whether
prices rise or at least hold firm after the issue is sold to
investors. That's because clients do not want to see the market
value of their securities plummet, which makes it harder to raise
money later. Russia's summer bond deals did not pass that price
test: while the new issues prompted a brief market rally, they soon
tumbled.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan's Russia Eurobond index gives the tally: the Russian
benchmark bond price hovered above $100 all year until the new
issues began reaching the market in June. By late July, just before
the giant Goldman swap of ruble bonds for dollar bonds, the
benchmark price had fallen to just above $80. But it was soon after
that Goldman bond swap, in late July, that the bottom fell out. The
crash to about $50 directly preceded Russia's default.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some investors in Russian dollar bonds complain that
the deals contributed to the default: With the international bond
market collapsing along with the domestic one, the Russian
government saw another of its channels for raising money blocked,
perhaps concluding that it had little left to lose by defaulting.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Merrell, a manager for the IDS Global Bond Fund and an
active investor in Russian dollar bonds, said that underwriters
torpedoed the market with the deluge of new issues, undercutting
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight there was no plan,'' Merrell said. ``Just take as
much money as the market will give and hope it holds together.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior J.P. Morgan banker responsible for the firm's business
in the Russian region said that his institution acted with good
faith in Russia and that the firm considered the June bond deal it
underwrote to be a success.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Michael Sherwood, head of Goldman's emerging-markets
syndicate desk in London, argued that Goldman's June bond deal was
well received by investors, selling out in less than an hour and
raising much-needed money for Russia at a tough time.
</P>
<P>
   The July debt swap, he said, fell short of Goldman's goal of
relieving Russia's domestic debt burden, though he said that it was
the right thing to do. The reason the swap failed, he said, was
because it was too small, not too large. If investors had opted to
swap more of their short-term ruble debt for long-term dollar
bonds, the deal might have allowed Russia to continue to pay
interest on all its debt, avoiding default. He said he suspected
that investors might have chosen not to participate in Goldman's
swap because they had a false sense of confidence that Russia would
continue to honor its high-interest ruble debt, a favorite source
of income for speculative hedge funds. Many also may have hoped
that the International Monetary Fund would pump enough money into
Russia to insure that it did not fail.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the merits for Russia, the deals were good for Goldman.
The firm earned fees of about $56 million for arranging the July
debt swap alone, rival bankers say, though they add that that fee
is standard in the industry for the work performed.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Part of the proceeds Russia raised from the June bond issue also
went to pay off Goldman's half-share of $500 million in short-term
financing known as a bridge loan to the Russian government late
last year. That loan, Goldman officials acknowledge, was made to
put its name at the front of the list of banks jostling to be named
advisers and underwriters for the government. Goldman officials
said they had an agreement with the government to have the loan
repaid as soon as Russia raised money through a foreign bond
offering. Goldman was the underwriter for the first such offering
made after the loan was extended.
</P>
<P>
   Rival bankers and investors say the bridge loan raises the
question of a conflict of interest because Goldman, with nearly 4
percent of its partners' capital tied up in that one loan, was
highly motivated to market the June bond deal _ and make sure that
it was big enough for Russia to pay Goldman back. Goldman itself at
that time was preparing to issue shares to the public, a move that
would require the private partnership to open its books to scrutiny
for the first time in its 130-year history. A large bridge loan to
the Russian government, unsecured by collateral and made at a time
of considerable turmoil in emerging markets worldwide, would have
raised a red flag for brokerage firm analysts and credit rating
agencies, which view that kind of lending as high risk.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman also had a great deal of its own capital at stake in the
second bond deal, but managed to take it off the table well before
the August default. The firm said that it sought to generate
momentum for the July debt swap by buying ruble-denominated
securities in the days leading up to the swap for the purpose of
including them in the swap transaction _ a standard, though
somewhat risky, underwriting activity, not altogether unlike a
publisher snapping up books from stores to try to get the title on
the best-seller list. After the swap was completed, that left
Goldman with a store of newly minted Russian dollar bonds valued at
about $550 million. Goldman disclosed in financial documents that
it had the right to participate in the swap offering in this way.
</P>
<P>
   But the story has another twist: Even as Goldman proclaimed
publicly as recently as its elegant House of Unions party that it
was in Russia for the long term, the firm appears to have had
limited faith in the country's financial future. Goldman confirms
that its trading position on Russian debt went from ``quite long''
in the days around the swap to ``flat'' or even ``short'' by
August, meaning that it substantially trimmed its $550 million
holdings of Russian bonds or even had trading positions that would
have benefited from a fall in prices of those bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman officials declined to talk in detail about the trading
the firm does on its own account. But officials said the
international dollar bond market was large, accommodating large buy
and sell orders each day, and that Goldman was an active trader in
that market. The firm, these officials said, frequently buys large
blocks of bonds and sells them to investors when it thinks the
price is right, a practice they describe as a routine part of
Goldman's core business.
</P>
<P>
   Rival bankers agree that Goldman would not have been wise to
invest lots of money in Russian dollar bonds at such a volatile
time _ though other firms do often keep a store of bonds in which
they are dealers to facilitate trading. But several bankers who
followed the transaction noted that Goldman accumulated its
holdings of Russian bonds specifically to create momentum for its
swap deal, then quickly sold the bonds when the deal was done, a
sequence that Goldman does not deny. Goldman officials said that
market demand for Russian dollar bonds was still strong when it
trimmed its position. But other bankers said Goldman's heavy
selling almost certainly worsened the sharp drop in Russian dollar
bond prices in the days following the debt swap.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, by quickly selling off its own holdings just after it
led investors to purchase the same securities suggests that it was
worried more about the firm's own money than the long-term
interests of its client, the Russian government, these bankers say.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A few hours before boarding the plane that would
take him to Washington for the peace talks that started last week,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stood on a stage here and
handed out etched glass trophies to 53 foreign businessmen whose
companies had each sunk $50 million or more into the Israeli
economy.
</P>
<P>
   As the executives filed by, each exchanged a greeting with the
prime minister that was drowned out by a big band blasting ``Blue
Moon'' and ``I Did It My Way.'' Netanyahu turned to the audience,
composed mostly of Israeli business executives, to relay the
comments as if they were an informal poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``About a third said, `Do everything you can to bring peace,'
and another third said, `Don't give away the store,' '' Netanyahu
reported. ``The rest just said, `Good luck.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli business leaders responded by giving Netanyahu an
unsolicited poll of their own. They interrupted his tally to
applaud the sentiment for peace, then clapped only politely through
the rest.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat have been wrangling in
Maryland over land, guns and limits on sovereignty. Back home, it
is striking how the business community not only has accepted what
it sees as the inevitability of an independent Palestinian state,
but is already preparing to profit from it.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli executives are hardly peaceniks. The military industry
is still at the technological heart of the economy, and corporate
leaders tend disproportionately to be former high-ranking military
officers. But they have clearly concluded that a settlement with
Arafat is in their interest. And they voice rising impatience with
a peace process that, as one leading industrialist grumbled last
week, has so far produced ``too much process and not enough
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is ultimately governed by his own conceptions of
Israeli security as well as his partisan political constraints. But
he cannot be unmoved by the business consensus that a peace deal
would provide an economic boon to his constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israeli CEOs, in fact, say that beyond a negotiating
breakthrough at the Wye Plantation summit, what they really are
waiting for is a final accord with a sovereign Palestinian state,
because that would remove remaining regional barriers to Israeli
exports and investments. Globalized though the Israeli economy
might now be, they say, its greatest opportunity for further growth
is here in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The awards ceremony that Netanyahu took part in was at a two-day
international business conference organized by the prime minister's
office to commemorate Israel's 50th anniversary. There was much
bold talk of ``privatizing peace'' through joint ventures with Arab
partners, including a Gaza industrial park, a $60 million
Israeli-Palestinian investment fund backed by the World Bank, and
two bi-national projects with Jordan _ a tourist airport on the Red
Sea and a duty-free industrial zone straddling the Jordan River.
``This kind of cross-border cooperation costs a lot less than an
F-16, and it offers a much better return on investment,'' said Omar
Salah, a Jordanian investor in the free zone project.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly strong business consensus for a peace settlement
does not necessarily translate into direct pressure to cut a deal,
however. Israeli corporate leaders are cautious about overt
intervention in politics and diplomacy, and most are not natural
allies of Netanyahu and his Likud bloc. They are closer to the
political and military leadership that governed under the Labor
Party. ``My fear is that business criticizing the government will
help them, not us,'' said Dov Lautman, chairman of Delta Galil
Industries and board chairman of the Peres Peace Center, an
institute that promotes joint Israeli-Palestinian business
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even Israeli economic officials talk about potential
peace dividends. ``We hope that the peace process is successful,
because then we will be able to do what all other countries in the
world do, which is trade with our neighbors,'' said Max Livnat,
senior deputy director general of the Trade and Industry Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no dispute that a peace process will be good for
the Israeli economy,'' said Jacob Frenkel, governor of the Central
Bank. ``This is not a political statement, it is a factual
statement. Our ratings agencies, our investors, all look at the
geopolitical situation, and they vote with their feet.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days following the signing of the Oslo accords five years
ago, business leaders within and outside the region began holding
conferences on the brave new business world of a peaceful Middle
East. Multilateral lenders and money-center bankers drew up plans
for regional investment funds and a Middle Eastern Development
Bank. But momentum flagged as the peace process stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, with talks resuming, some of the optimism is
returning. Israeli executives were talking confidently last week of
a free trade bloc that would include Israel, Jordan and an
independent Palestine as an almost immediate byproduct of a peace
settlement; under this vision, broader regional trading
arrangements could eventually extend west through Islamic Africa,
east to the Persian Gulf states and north into Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Israel as the hub of a Middle Eastern free trade area no longer
seems so improbable here. The Israelis like to note that theirs is
the only country with free trade agreements with both the United
States and the European Union. This is true technically, as the
West Bank and Gaza is not a country. But the Palestinian Authority
has free trade privileges from both Washington and Brussels. It
also has open trade with Egypt and Jordan, and a de facto customs
union with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For potential Middle Eastern trading partners, disentangling the
Palestinian-Israeli interrelationship would be more difficult than
simply embracing it as a single market.
</P>
<P>
   And any regional trade arrangement that included the
Palestinians but omitted the Israelis would be like NAFTA without
the United States, or the European Union without Germany. Israel's
economy is now far larger than that of all its contiguous neighbors
_ Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Egypt _ combined. Per capita gross
domestic product stands at $17,000, well within European norms, and
some 20 times greater than Jordan's and Egypt's average incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The peace process has already been good for business, Israeli
executives say. The Arab boycott of Israel _ and of multinationals
that did business here _ began to fracture after the Oslo accords
were signed. Foreign investment climbed dramatically from $400
million yearly before 1993 to a reported $2.4 billion in 1996, as
dramatized by last week's parade of CEOs from Boeing, Unilever,
Nestle, Cable &AMP; Wireless, Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Motorola, and other
multinational heavyweights. Israeli businessmen are penetrating
markets in Asia, Africa and the former Soviet bloc, and Japan, long
conspicuously absent from the Israeli business scene, opened a
trade promotion office here last year.
</P>
<P>
   Oslo may get more credit than it deserves. The Israeli expansion
of the 1990s was also fueled by the worldwide growth of investment
in emerging markets. And most of the high-tech companies nurtured
by this capital influx have their origins in the Israeli defense
industry, not in the peace process; their natural markets are in
the United States and Europe, not the Middle East. But the impact
of expanded international opportunities should not be
underestimated, Israeli business leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic benefits of the peace process are irrefutable,''
said Benjamin Gaon, an industrialist. ``Our diplomatic
relationships have doubled, and we have open business relationships
around the world. Gone are the days of secret dealings through
intermediaries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The business community should not just reap the rewards of the
peace process, but should assist it, even lead it,'' he added.
``Peace is too precious a thing to be left in the hands of
politicians, or even generals.''

Palestinians but omitted the Israelis would be like NAFTA without
the United States, or the European Union without Germany. Israel's
economy is now far larger than that of all its contiguous neighbors
_ Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Egypt _ combined. Per capita gross
domestic product stands at $17,000, well within European norms, and
some 20 times greater than Jordan's and Egypt's average incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The peace process has already been good for business, Israeli
executives say. The Arab boycott of Israel _ and of multinationals
that did business here _ began to fracture after the Oslo accords
were signed. Foreign investment climbed dramatically from $400
million yearly before 1993 to a reported $2.4 billion in 1996, as
dramatized by last week's parade of CEOs from Boeing, Unilever,
Nestle, Cable &AMP; Wireless, Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Motorola, and other
multinational heavyweights. Israeli businessmen are penetrating
markets in Asia, Africa and the former Soviet bloc, and Japan, long
conspicuously absent from the Israeli business scene, opened a
trade promotion office here last year.
</P>
<P>
   Oslo may get more credit than it deserves. The Israeli expansion
of the 1990s was also fueled by the worldwide growth of investment
in emerging markets. And most of the high-tech companies nurtured
by this capital influx have their origins in the Israeli defense
industry, not in the peace process; their natural markets are in
the United States and Europe, not the Middle East. But the impact
of expanded international opportunities should not be
underestimated, Israeli business leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic benefits of the peace process are irrefutable,''
said Benjamin Gaon, an industrialist. ``Our diplomatic
relationships have doubled, and we have open business relationships
around the world. Gone are the days of secret dealings through
intermediaries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The business community should not just reap the rewards of the
peace process, but should assist it, even lead it,'' he added.
``Peace is too precious a thing to be left in the hands of
politicians, or even generals.''

<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ Four years ago this month, Haiti's
future seemed so promising that people here were dancing in the
streets. American troops had just overthrown a brutal dictatorship,
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was on his way back from exile,
and a procession of foreign aid donors and investors was following
in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   Today, those hopes for an era of prosperity and stability have
evaporated, and with them the patience of most Haitians. A 16-month
political squabble between Aristide and other leaders of the
fracturing Lavalas coalition has left the country without a working
government, the population to fend for itself, and Haiti's foreign
allies disillusioned and exasperated.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to break the impasse, the United States has sent
one high-level emissary after another, with nothing to show for it
but broken promises and frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; Anthony Lake, the former
national security adviser, and Bill Richardson, the former U.N.
delegate, all have tried to negotiate a settlement _ and all have
failed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Clinton administration, which four years ago
was hailing Aristide's restoration as a major foreign policy
triumph, has changed its tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a national disaster,'' said Chavannes Jean-Baptiste,
leader of the country's most prominent peasant group and a former
Aristide ally.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the impasse, President Rene Preval, Aristide's
hand-picked successor, has been unable to get a government budget
drawn up and approved for a second consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   In the cities, civil servants _ teachers and doctors included _
have gone months without being paid. In rural areas, grievous
social problems, like an illiteracy rate that is the highest in the
hemisphere and a life expectancy that is the lowest, go unattended
but for the work of private relief organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign donors have pledged more than $1 billion in aid, but
much of that money remains on hold because government ministries,
some now without senior staff, are unable to organize programs or
comply with other requirements for spending the money. What is
worse, there are no signs that the stalemate will end any time
soon. ``All the institutions are paralyzed and the Cabinet is not
functioning,'' Jean-Baptiste said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Misery is advancing, public services are lacking, aid is not
flowing and there is no budget to confront the emergency. The
situation is one of total desperation and confusion, and nobody is
opening an exit door.''
</P>
<P>
   The crisis began in June 1997, when Prime Minister Rosny Smarth
resigned to protest what he described as efforts by the Aristide
camp to undermine his program. Since then, Preval has sought four
times without success to nominate a new prime minister who can win
the approval of Parliament, which is dominated by a left-center
party of former allies who accuse Aristide of reneging on promises
of power sharing and of trying to install a dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heart of the matter is the use Aristide has made of his
influence and his domination from the sidelines, with the
president's complicity, of many institutions in this country,''
said Gerard Pierre-Charles, the main leader of the party, the
Organization of the People in Struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The worse the situation becomes, he added, ``the more Aristide
likes it, because he has this messianic idea that he and only he
will be the one to save Haiti from chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   In private, many American policy-makers, too, express irritation
at what they describe as Preval's passivity and Aristide's
duplicity, while in public, Washington is showing signs of mounting
impatience with the squabbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we have been disappointed that Haitian political
leaders have taken so long to resolve their differences,'' Albright
said during a visit here in April, when Preval was on his second
attempt to name a prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Haitian people deserve a democratic form of government and
they deserve the ability to have the fruits that the international
community is trying to give them.''
</P>
<P>
   Preval declined requests for an interview, and members of
Parliament aligned with him were back in their home districts,
where communications have been disrupted by Hurricane Georges.
Aristide, who holds no public office and spends most of his time in
his walled mansion on the outskirts of the capital, was unavailable
for an interview. He was said to be traveling abroad, and
associates said they did not wish to speak on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets, the mood is one of despair with the situation
and anger at political leaders. In a poll the U.S. Information
Service conducted in cities and towns here this summer, nearly
three-quarters of those surveyed said they would leave Haiti if
they could; more than 60 percent said they did not intend to vote
in the next election, and a majority said that elected officials
``care nothing at all'' about their problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were Monaco or Luxembourg, you could just laugh and
say it's all a commedia dell'arte,'' said Frantz Voltaire, a
respected intellectual who has served as chief of staff to former
Prime Minister Robert Malval, who was Aristide's representative
here during the military dictatorship. ``But it's not. There is
poverty everywhere and growing misery on the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and employees of international relief organizations
say they worry that the impasse is also eroding faith in democracy.
Ordinary Haitians seem unsure whom to blame for the paralysis, but
know that because of it, prices of food and other necessities are
rising, unemployment is growing, salaries are stagnant and the
promises of better times made in 1994 are going unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all hoping that something good was going to happen,''
said Wilner Andre, 35, an unemployed father of four. ``But to me,
democracy is just a word that the Lavalas government uses to make
money. You vote, and nothing changes, so why bother to vote? The
big eaters are still in power.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What appears to be keeping the country afloat, diplomats and
political and business leaders say, is the money that Haitians
living abroad, especially in the United States and Canada, are
sending back home. Those remittances are estimated at $500 million
to $700 million this year, or more than double the entire
government budget.
</P>
<P>
   But that money has not been enough to halt a conspicuous slide
in every measure of life here. Per capita income has dropped to
about $250 a year, and last month, when the United Nations
published its annual ``human development index,'' Haiti, already
the poorest nation in the hemisphere, had slipped to 159th in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the decade, when Aristide was first elected to
office, after 33 years of dictatorship, Haiti had ranked 124th on
the scale. By contrast, the Dominican Republic, which shares the
island of Hispaniola with Haiti, ranks 88th.
</P>
<P>
   Among the poor, people like Donasyon Dieusibon, 33, the mother
of five who has been a fruit vendor since dropping out of school at
age 10, say they can feel that deterioration in their daily life.
The new school year, for instance, began on Oct. 5, but Ms.
Dieusibon, a widow, is keeping her children at home, even though
she recognizes that education is their only hope for a better
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is always hard, but things are worse now than they have
ever been,'' she said as she tried to sell bananas outside the main
post office here. ``Just look at the streets. There's no activity,
and so I can't sell anything. That means I can't afford to buy
books or supplies or clothes for my children, and so they are not
going to attend school this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, Haitian diplomats might be able to mitigate some of
that damage through lobbying for aid in foreign capitals. But
Foreign Minister Fritz Longchamp acknowledged that, because of the
impasse, more than half of Haiti's 32 missions abroad are currently
without ambassadors, including those in the United States, France
and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   For similar reasons, the justice system is also stalled, eroding
faith in the rule of law. Judges who have resigned or been
dismissed for corruption have not been replaced, meaning that many
cases, including some against those accused of human rights abuses
under the dictatorship, are not being heard, much less decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole country is on hold, and if this mess is not resolved
soon, we are going to have not only an institutional void, but also
a major constitutional crisis,'' warned Lionel Delatour, leader of
a business group that supports economic and political reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had our window of opportunity, but it is closing,'' he
added. ``The political actors are unwilling to budge, and civil
society is too weak to have its voice heard or to play a broker's
role. We are so deep in the hole that we can no longer see how to
get out.''

JETER: THE SHORTSTOP WHO (ALWAYS, WITHOUT FAIL) THINKS HE CAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   To see the depth of Derek Jeter's confidence is to see him at
those moments he fails. When Jeter fouls off a pitch he believes he
should have smashed, a tiny, wry smile invades his face _ like he's
grinning ever so slightly at the good fortune of the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees shortstop makes a mistake in the field, he
usually turns to watch the replay on the scoreboard, wanting to
answer the question, Why? And he wants to know immediately, so he
doesn't do it again.
</P>
<P>
   There is far more failure than success for position players in
baseball, more outs than hits. Before the 1998 Yankees came along,
baseball's best teams routinely would lose 40 percent of their
games. The ability to cope with failure, to remain confident, is as
important an asset as a good throwing arm or speed.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter's unique confidence, Yankees Manager Joe Torre once said,
is what ``makes him a very special player. He's absolutely sure of
himself all the time, but not in a way that can be
counter-productive. He's not arrogant; he's confident. Nothing
bothers him. He's sure he's going to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, whose childhood dream was to play shortstop for the
Yankees, was a regular in his rookie season of 1996 and was part of
a team that won the World Series; two years later, at age 24, Jeter
is already one of the best players on a club that may be called the
best ever. He batted .324 during the regular season, with 203 hits,
25 doubles, 8 triples and 19 home runs, with 127 runs scored, 84
RBI and 30 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Raines, Jeter's teammate and good-natured antagonist, says
he has never seen the shortstop in awe of anything, any situation,
any player, any circumstance. ``I've never seen him come in here
and hang his head in his locker,'' Raines said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter will make an out in his first at-bat, Raines said, then
return to the dugout and pass judgment on the opposing pitcher.
``This guy doesn't have anything,'' Jeter will say aloud. ``He's
going to get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Jeter return to the dugout, Raines was asked, and ever
compliment an opposing starting? ``Never,'' Raines said. ``That's
the type of confidence he has. He'll go 0 for 4 and he'll say, `I
can't believe I didn't get a hit.'''
</P>
<P>
   When David Wells was just one or two outs removed from pitching
his perfect game May 17, some of his teammates huddled nervously in
the Yankees' dugout, legs shaking, arms crossed. On the field,
Jeter remembered thinking to himself, Hit the ball to me.
</P>
<P>
   There was no fear. He wants the ball. He wants to be out front.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, when a pop-up fell between Jeter and two
outfielders, Wells turned disgustedly and gestured, a serious
violation of baseball etiquette; from his position, Jeter yelled to
the pitcher, in so many words, Hey, we don't need that kind of
stuff on this team.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees score, Jeter is always the first out of the
dugout to congratulate teammates _ something Jeter has been doing,
he said, since he was in Little League.
</P>
<P>
   When pitching changes are made in the post-season, or when the
pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre goes to the mound to give a breather
to a tiring pitcher, Jeter walks to the mound and most of the time,
he is smiling. Crisis is looming, and Jeter is smiling. A reliever
is walking from the bullpen into a potential disaster, and Jeter
will always reach over with his gloved hand _ his grin broad _ and
pat Torre on the chest.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, said second baseman Homer Bush, Jeter ``is always
upbeat, he's always encouraging me. Like if I make a mistake, he'll
say, `Hey, you're all right,' always trying to pump me up.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of confidence, Raines said, is not developed in the
minor leagues, or taught by a manager. Raines said, ``That sort of
confidence starts from an early age.''
</P>
<P>
   Raines is a father himself _ his eldest son just began playing
minor-league baseball for the Baltimore Orioles last summer _ and
he mentioned Jeter's strong relationship with his parents, how
Jeter was raised to respect others and respect himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gathered they were very strict but cared a lot,'' Raines
said. ``He takes his confidence from that. He takes everything
right out front, like a Brahman bull _ but in a nice way.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter said: ``You're going to make a lot of mistakes. The worst
thing you can do when you come back is give a pitcher or an
opponent too much credit, because when you come up the next time,
you're beaten already.''
</P>
<P>
   If he makes an out or a mistake, Jeter said he believes he will
get a hit in his next at-bat. ``It may not happen,'' Jeter said.
``But that's the attitude you have to have. You have to want to
compete. If somebody gets you, you want to get them back.''
</P>
<P>
   No. If you are Derek Jeter, you are certain you will get them
back. The pitcher has nothing, he's going to get killed.

WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE BRAVES WHEN IT MATTERS? SOME OPINIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves are not playing in New York this weekend,
which means they are not playing in the World Series for the third
time in their seven-season run as division champions and therefore
cannot seek victory in the World Series for the sixth time in their
seven-season run as division champions.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Braves remain the most consistently good team of
the '90s, the enduringly best actually since the 1949-64 Yankees,
something has to be missing from the mix that gets them to the
post-season year after year, at least something that rears its ugly
head in October.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations with officials from several other clubs elicited
views that could explain the Braves' problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing the Braves have that no one else has is depth in the
starting rotation,'' said Dave Dombrowski, the Marlins' general
manager. ``Over a 162-game season, that is very difficult to beat.
I don't think you can beat them unless you match up the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in a short series most clubs you're playing are going to
throw three quality starters at you. The fifth starter is not a
factor. The fourth starter may or may not be a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the team, however, falls short of their pitching in
championship status, another general manager said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not that good a club if you take away their starting
pitching,'' said the general manager, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ``If you put their starting pitching on several National
League clubs, those clubs would be better. Their bullpen is
ordinary at best. Their defense is average at best. If they don't
hit home runs, they're going to struggle because they're not going
to score. They've done it with starting pitching and timely hitting
for years.''
</P>
<P>
   An executive of another club suggested that the Braves spend so
much money on their starting pitchers they don't have much left to
spend on their hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they have four good hitters,'' he said. ``If the other
team's pitching can neutralize those hitters, they can beat them.
If you pitch well against them, you have a good chance of beating
them because their offense and their bench aren't that great. If
you match up with starting pitching, you can neutralize their
power.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres' pitchers did their part, shutting down most of the
Braves' key hitters. Galarraga had two hits in 21 at-bats for a
.095 batting average and four runs batted in. Ryan Klesko had one
hit in 12 tries (.083). Chipper Jones batted a relatively torrid
.208 but drove in a single run, matching Klesko's output.
</P>
<P>
   In the league series, Andy Ashby held the Braves to 1 run in 7
innings in the first game, Kevin Brown shut them out on 3 hits in
the second and Sterling Hitchcock stymied them in 2 starts,
allowing 1 run and 5 hits in 10 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Also, defensive breakdowns at critical moments hurt the Braves
in the league series against Florida last October, and a relative
flood of errors killed them in the league series against San Diego
this year.
</P>
<P>
   From the double error by Andres Galarraga on one play in the
first game to Danny Bautista's muffed catch of a fly ball in the
last, the Braves self-destructed in the series that sent the Padres
to New York this weekend. Eight errors in six games is not the
formula for post-season success.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no perfect clubs,'' Dombrowski observed. But he
added, ``You tip your cap to the Braves because they're there every
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Hunsicker, Houston's general manager, has experienced the
post-season the past two seasons and wasn't ready to find fault
with the Braves for their latest loss. He gave credit to the
Padres, who also defeated the Astros in the division series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Padres were an overlooked team coming into the
playoffs,'' Hunsicker said. ``They were underrated. This is a team
that for four and a half months was arguably the best team in the
National League. Suddenly, in September, they had a slide and
everybody forgot about them. We got Randy Johnson and the hype got
carried away. The impact Randy would have on our team was
overexaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   While everyone was expecting great things from the Astros and
the Braves, Hunsicker said, people were underrating the Padres'
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have quality starters and the best closer in baseball,''
he said. ``In low-scoring games, if your pitching is going to keep
you in the game, then it's just a matter of who rises to the
occasion. This season it happens to be Jim Leyritz. Right now, Jim
Leyritz is playing like Superman.''

<P>
   With congressional elections just around the corner and the
House impeachment inquiry of President Clinton set to start shortly
afterward, public opinion polls are more numerous, more important
and possibly more confusing than usual.
</P>
<P>
   In any election year, pollsters try to predict which voters will
go to the polls and what they will do when they get there. Turnout
is important, but issues and circumstances like the state of the
economy are what often drive the result.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the conventional wisdom has it, turnout is
everything. If the presidential sex scandal galvanizes Clinton
opponents, Republicans win. If the widespread public distaste for
impeachment proceedings mobilizes a backlash vote, Democrats may
gain the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   So pollsters are focusing even more than usual this year on
figuring out who will really take the trouble to vote, searching
for that mythical beast known as the ``likely voter.''
</P>
<P>
   In assessing pre-election polls, here are some things to look
for:
</P>
<P>
   Accurate Sampling
</P>
<P>
   Good polls start with good samples of the population from all
geographical areas and segments of society. In recent decades, this
has been accomplished by ``random digit dialing,'' in which a
computer selects area codes and exchanges and then makes up the
last four digits at random to form complete telephone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   For decades pollsters have demonstrated how 1,000 or so people
can accurately represent all adults in the entire nation _ plus or
minus a few percentage points, the potential fluctuation that is
inherent in every poll because it is a sampling rather than a
census.
</P>
<P>
   Likely Voters
</P>
<P>
   In the period leading up to any election, pollsters make a big
mistake if they try to represent all adults in their polls. In the
1996 presidential election, only about 49 percent of all adults
actually voted. In the 1994 midterm election, about 39 percent
voted.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it is critical to screen for likely voters by discarding
the opinions of half to two-thirds of all adults polled.
</P>
<P>
   Each polling organization has its own screening method. The
Gallup Organization, which polls for USA Today and CNN, has one of
the most elaborate and well-tested systems. It gives respondents
points for voting in past elections, their current intention to
vote and their knowledge of where to go to vote, among other
factors. Respondents score from zero to seven points; Gallup then
picks those respondents with the most points, working down until
they reach a percentage of the total group that is equal to the
expected nationwide turnout (expected to be 39 percent this year).
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times/CBS News Poll, by comparison, screens in
several ways. ``Likely voters'' in this year's polls are those who
say they voted in either 1996 or 1994, who say they are paying
attention to this year's campaign, and who say they will definitely
vote in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``More likely voters'' differ by saying they voted in both 1996
and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Times has found that its polling results become more
pro-Republican when the focus is limited to likely and more likely
voters, suggesting that if turnout is lower than usual this year,
it will help Republicans. But Gallup does not find nearly so strong
a pattern, suggesting that the contest remains very close at all
levels of turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Gallup vice president David Moore maintains that the
organization's standard ``likely voter'' questions should still be
adequate even in this unusual year. Moore says a person who shows
little history of voting in past elections but who becomes
motivated to vote this year by the presidential scandal or the
impeachment hearings might well be overlooked as a likely voter.
But he added that he thought the people most likely to be roused to
vote by the scandal or hearings would probably be strong
Republicans or strong Democrats who are already frequent past
voters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Phrasing of Questions
</P>
<P>
   Even though the latest Gallup and Times/CBS News polls issued
last week agree in many areas, Gallup found that most Americans
believe their incumbent Representatives deserve re-election. The
Times/CBS News poll, on the other hand, found Americans to be
narrowly split on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Closer examination suggests that the discrepancy may be due to
the different wording of the questions. Gallup asked: ``Please tell
me whether or not you think each of the following political
officeholders deserves to be re-elected. First, most members of the
House of Representatives; second, your own representative.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS News poll linked re-election to job performance,
and also asked whether it is time to give new candidates a chance,
thus offering a potential reason why a respondent might prefer not
to re-elect an incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Both sets of questions clearly show that people like their own
Representative better than they like Congress in the aggregate, and
both organizations find, each using its own questions, that
willingness to re-elect incumbents is higher now than it was in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple Polls
</P>
<P>
   It is a pollster's maxim that the truth lies not in any one poll
but at the center of gravity of several polls. When polls agree, it
often means the findings are solid. But when they disagree, it
often means the findings are more fragile or tentative.
</P>
<P>
   The best advice, therefore, is to track the findings of several
organizations.

<P>
   With congressional elections just around the corner and the
House impeachment inquiry of President Clinton set to start shortly
afterward, public opinion polls are more numerous, more important
and possibly more confusing than usual.
</P>
<P>
   In any election year, pollsters try to predict which voters will
go to the polls and what they will do when they get there. Turnout
is important, but issues and circumstances like the state of the
economy are what often drive the result.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the conventional wisdom has it, turnout is
everything. If the presidential sex scandal galvanizes Clinton
opponents, Republicans win. If the widespread public distaste for
impeachment proceedings mobilizes a backlash vote, Democrats may
gain the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   So pollsters are focusing even more than usual this year on
figuring out who will really take the trouble to vote, searching
for that mythical beast known as the ``likely voter.''
</P>
<P>
   In assessing pre-election polls, here are some things to look
for:
</P>
<P>
   Accurate Sampling
</P>
<P>
   Good polls start with good samples of the population from all
geographical areas and segments of society. In recent decades, this
has been accomplished by ``random digit dialing,'' in which a
computer selects area codes and exchanges and then makes up the
last four digits at random to form complete telephone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   For decades pollsters have demonstrated how 1,000 or so people
can accurately represent all adults in the entire nation _ plus or
minus a few percentage points, the potential fluctuation that is
inherent in every poll because it is a sampling rather than a
census.
</P>
<P>
   Likely Voters
</P>
<P>
   In the period leading up to any election, pollsters make a big
mistake if they try to represent all adults in their polls. In the
1996 presidential election, only about 49 percent of all adults
actually voted. In the 1994 midterm election, about 39 percent
voted.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it is critical to screen for likely voters by discarding
the opinions of half to two-thirds of all adults polled.
</P>
<P>
   Each polling organization has its own screening method. The
Gallup Organization, which polls for USA Today and CNN, has one of
the most elaborate and well-tested systems. It gives respondents
points for voting in past elections, their current intention to
vote and their knowledge of where to go to vote, among other
factors. Respondents score from zero to seven points; Gallup then
picks those respondents with the most points, working down until
they reach a percentage of the total group that is equal to the
expected nationwide turnout (expected to be 39 percent this year).
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times/CBS News Poll, by comparison, screens in
several ways. ``Likely voters'' in this year's polls are those who
say they voted in either 1996 or 1994, who say they are paying
attention to this year's campaign, and who say they will definitely
vote in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``More likely voters'' differ by saying they voted in both 1996
and 1994.

<P>
   The Times has found that its polling results become more
pro-Republican when the focus is limited to likely and more likely

it will help Republicans. But Gallup does not find nearly so strong
a pattern, suggesting that the contest remains very close at all

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ When the San Diego Padres advanced to the World
Series, Alan Aiello went into his closet, pulled out his
30-year-old Yankee cap, dusted it off and put it on the dining room
table. The next morning, his wife, Gail, an avid Padres fan, put
two San Diego hats next to the relic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make your choice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For Aiello, who was born in Brooklyn in 1947, a Padres-Yankees
World Series matchup has caused emotional distress and an inner
struggle about whom he is going to root for: the team that is part
of his soul, or the team of underdogs that has grabbed most of the
hearts here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a Yankee fan before I was old enough to walk,'' said
Aiello, who is president of Evergreen Wealth Management and has
lived in San Diego for 28 years. ``At 18 months old, my brother
would take me to Yankee Stadium when he was supposed to be
baby-sitting me in our house. I grew up loving Whitey Ford, Mickey
Mantle, Roger Maris. I was hoping this would never come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have decided only one thing,'' he said. ``My tailor is going
to take half of my Yankees hat and half of my Padres hat and sew
them together.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of this city is showing their colors for the Padres _
Mayor Susan Golding called for a blue and orange day on Friday _
there are many transplanted New Yorkers who have mixed feelings
about the Yankees playing in San Diego for a World Series title.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there is no consensus at the Brooklyn Club, a
group in San Diego whose members must either have been born in
Brooklyn or have attended a Brooklyn high school. Its 10 members
get together and enjoy their favorite New York foods, including
cheesecake flown in from Junior's Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   A club organizer, 58-year-old Dr. Michael Grossman, has never
been to Yankee Stadium. He was a Brooklyn Dodgers fan at 7 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about the New York-Padre thing at our meeting,''
said Grossman, a chief executive officer for First Dental Health in
San Diego. ``It's more about being a baseball fan from New York. If
you were a Yankee fan and now live in San Diego, you will root in
your heart for New York. But being a Brooklyn Dodger fan is totally
different. I hated them for moving to L.A. They were the most
traitorous of teams. I want to beat the Yankees because the Dodgers
always wanted to beat the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Sal Rotolo, the new owner of Brooklyn Pizza here won't be
cheering for the home team there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees will sweep right through the Padres,'' said
Rotolo, 28. ``Look, it's true you can take the kid out of Brooklyn
but you can't take the Brooklyn out of the kid. I love San Diego.
But the Padres are not the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Penner, a local radio talk show host for PBS, grew up in
Bedford Stuyvesant and organized the Brooklyn Club. She attended
games at Ebbets Field in the 1940s with her parents, who loved
baseball. Recently, she moved her 93-year-old mother, Ethel Stern,
out of Brooklyn to a retirement community here. Her mother worked
at the Lord &AMP; Taylor department store in Manhattan until she was
85.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now she says she has two of the best teams in baseball to
root for,'' Penner said. ``When you are born and bred and educated
in New York, which is what I was as a result of the public school
system, from kindergarten to Brooklyn College, New York is
ingrained in your soul, your heart and your karma, and that can
never be extricated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though in San Diego there is a sense of pride for the
Padres, your heart will always be in New York. I am not going to
the game because I am a public person and I can't scream and yell
for the Yankees. I will be at home rooting for the Yankees in
private.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Sobell, a 51-year-old writer who was born in Brooklyn,
grew up listening to the Yankees on the radio with her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up binds you to a particular image,'' Sobell said,
adding that she is rooting for the underdog Padres. ``And to me,
the Yankees were special. Before I was 10, it was about sharing the
camaraderie with my Dad and a neighborhood boy, listening to the
voices on the radio, in secret, because we were the only Yankee
fans in the neighborhood. Now, the Padres playing the Yankees
brings me close to the memories of what I did with my Dad, who has
been dead a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Torrence, a history teacher at the La Jolla (Calif.) Day
School, said: ``I want the Padres to win. I'm a diehard Met fan. If
the Padres were playing the Mets, I would be rooting for the Mets.
I was born on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and we moved to
Brentwood on Long Island. You will find that Yankee fans live in
the Bronx and Manhattan and Met fans live in Brooklyn and Queens.
The Yankees have won enough. Tony Gwynn deserves one.''

BASEBALL NOTES AND NEWS

<P>
   &UR; For Want of an Ace &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the four years of their modern resurgence, the Cleveland
Indians have never had a legitimate No.1 starting pitcher. That
missing link may very well be the reason they have not won the
World Series and are not playing the World Series in Cleveland this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We readily admit we don't have one of those dominant Cy Young
marquee guys,'' John Hart, the Indians' general manager, said.
``But we usually have five or six guys who are good. Maybe they're
going to pitch anywhere from 2 to 4. We've done it without a
dominant No. 1 guy. Does that keep you out of the World Series? No.
Does it keep you from winning it? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   In their four successive forays into post-season play, the
Indians have started Dennis Martinez, Orel Hershiser, Charles Nagy,
Ken Hill, Jack McDowell, Jaret Wright, Chad Ogea, Bartolo Colon and
Dwight Gooden. At times some of of those pitchers were considered
No. 1's, but with the Indians they were past their prime.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we built our club,'' Hart said, ``we built it as an
American League team _ small ball parks, lack of pitching. We built
our club early on around offense. To win and still compete
economically, we thought we would sign starting pitchers that would
be able to keep us in games and hope to develop
front-of-the-rotation starters. Along the line, we tried to sign
some guys, but that didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians pursued Roger Clemens, John Smoltz and Alex
Fernandez as free agents and Pedro Martinez and Randy Johnson in
trades. They still await the arrival of a pitcher of that caliber.
</P>
<P>
   The system they have succeeded in building, Hart said, has
carried the club to four consecutive division titles and three AL
championship series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably not the perfect world, but you kind of have to
deal with what you have to work with,'' he said. ``There's not a
bottomless pit where you can go out and say we're going to have a
star at every position.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Thaw in the Union &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The strong union feeling about players who served as replacement
players in spring training of 1995 during the strike is apparently
thawing. The melting of bitter feelings can be seen in the
post-season shares voted by players on high-finishing teams. For
the most part, based on a survey of club votes, players have
treated replacement players like anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, for example, voted Shane Spencer, the home run
legend, half a full share based on the time he was with the team
during the season. Ron Reed of the Mets automatically received a
full share because he was with the team all season, but Jeff Tam, a
relief pitcher, was voted a share equal to the percentage of the
season he spent with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Boston players voted pitcher Ron Mahay a one-quarter share as
did the Chicago Cubs with infielder Jason Hardtke. Pitcher Tom
Martin will receive just under half a share based on service time
with Cleveland. Catcher Mandy Romero will get a partial share based
on service time from San Diego and a $3,000 cash award from Boston,
where he was traded June 21.
</P>
<P>
   Among players who were not replacements, Randy Johnson, who
pitched for Houston the last two months, was voted a full share;
Jim Leyritz will receive $10,000 from Boston's post-season players'
pot and about 54 percent of a share from San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   A player automatically receives a full share if he is with a
team from June 1, but the Yankees voted Orlando Hernandez a full
share even though he missed that date by a couple of days. Hideo
Nomo missed by four days, and the Mets voted him a three-fourths
share. The Mets acquired Tony Phillips, Willie Blair and Jorge
Fabregas on July 31, but the players voted Phillips a
three-quarters share and the other two about one-third.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; An Eye on the NBA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the baseball players union has been its ability
to maintain a solid front among players and, in more recent labor
wars, player agents. Union officials are watching the National
Basketball Association lockout closely and were thus bothered by
the action of an agent in filing an unfair labor practice charge
with the National Labor Relations Board last week against the
basketball players union.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very troublesome,'' Donald Fehr, the baseball labor
chief, said, ``because such agents would not appear to understand
the most basic fact here, which is if there appears to be division
and dissension, there is nothing more reasonably calculated for the
NBA to take a harder negotiating position. They ought to know that
they're not operating in their own best interests or the best
interests of their clients.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that baseball agents have never disagreed
with the union's bargaining position, but they have always kept
intramural disputes internal and never given the owners legitimate
reason to believe the union would develop fatal cracks.

HYDE QUICKLY FEELS THE HARSH HEAT OF THE LIMELIGHT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Ill.)   By ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Henry Hyde, the Republican presiding over
House impeachment proceedings, is discovering the price of fame:
Every word he speaks counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned the only way not to be misquoted is to shut up
and not to talk,'' the Illinois Republican told a friendly
gathering of the Chicago Bar Association on Thursday, veering far
from his ostensible topic of judicial independence. ``That
sometimes is the procedure of choice, but it's not in my nature,
unfortunately.''
</P>
<P>
   In 12 terms in the House, Hyde, 74, helped build his reputation
through eloquence, oratory and wit. Republicans consider him to be
the best insurance that the impeachment inquiry will be perceived
as judicious and will win public respect.
</P>
<P>
   But even he has been stumbling under the white-hot glare of an
impeachment proceeding against a popular president, conducted under
the pressures of 24-hour-a-day media. And his off-the-cuff comments
can have unintended effects in a process that has become as much
political war as quasi-judicial proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   One news conference by Hyde left aides dashing out to clarify or
retract statements that telegraphed more of his intentions than
might have been politically wise. And last month, Hyde's genial
admission that questions about whether a deal could be cut with the
president were ``above my pay grade'' was seized on by the White
House to charge that Speaker Newt Gingrich was really running the
show.
</P>
<P>
   One official who has watched Hyde says that when he is torn and
ambivalent he ``muses out loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself discovered early in his presidency that such
thinking out loud is not wise in a high-profile environment
requiring one-message-a-day discipline. And the only member of
Congress who has ever experienced such searing White House-level
scrutiny _ and was badly singed by it _ is Gingrich, who acted like
the surrogate president in the first year of the Republican
revolution and saw his popularity drop.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Hyde has said that impeachment must be
bipartisan. He acknowledged on Thursday that public opinion
mattered, too. ``The people ultimately have the solution to this,
whatever it is, because the senators will follow the parade,'' he
said in Chicago, and added, ``I think human nature dictates that
where the public is, if you can perceive it, is where the pendulum
will swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Public support for Congress has been eroding since the House
authorized a formal impeachment inquiry into Clinton's attempts to
hide his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. The House Judiciary
Committee, over which Hyde presides with pride, has quickly become
almost as unpopular as the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   That has emboldened Democrats to condemn Clinton's behavior but
fight fiercely against impeachment. Republicans themselves are
splintered, with conservatives seeking a free-ranging investigation
of Clinton, even as some Republican moderates want the proceedings
to be wrapped up quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Not many days after his hand-picked chief investigative counsel,
David Schippers, set out a broad 15-charge case against Clinton,
Hyde appeared to back away last week from that case in his own
quest to bring House impeachment proceedings to a conclusion by the
end of December.
</P>
<P>
   He said the committee would be ``streamlining its work to focus
on the core charges against the president of lying under oath,
obstruction of justice and witness tampering.''
</P>
<P>
   That left Republicans scrambling to reconcile the differences
between the approaches of the two men. They said Schippers had been
instructed to go through the evidence presented to Congress by
Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, and enumerate possible
federal crimes. Hyde, they said, is considering how the committee
can best meet his self-imposed deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would liken what Dave Schippers did for us to a case agent
coming to a U.S. attorney and saying, ` Prosecutor, these are all
the charges that might be provable,''' said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.
``The job of the prosecutor is not to take all of these and put
them down verbatim but do it in a way that captures the fundamental
charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Hyde pointed out that the case against Richard Nixon 24
years ago eventually amounted to just three articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde did not say which of Schippers' possible charges would be
dropped, but Republicans indicated that a broad allegation of a
conspiracy to obstruct justice might require too much
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are expected to keep the impeachment
investigation low-key until after the elections _ although tapes of
Linda Tripp's conversations with Ms. Lewinsky might yet be released
before Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in the inquiry comes on Wednesday, when Clinton's
lawyers meet investigators for the House Judiciary Committee for
the first time since the formal inquiry opened.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides plan to discuss what rights Clinton's lawyers will
be accorded to participate in closed committee sessions, the
deposition process and the investigation. They will also discuss
whether the sides can agree to much of the factual record set out
by Starr in order to speed proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Hyde called his job ``a terribly onerous duty.''

<P>
   The concept of a trillion has shifted in recent weeks from a
fuzzy, imprecise and somewhat abstract notion into a hard-edged
number like, say, 47 or 254 or 7,453.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, because of the Long-Term Capital Management fiasco,
trillion has become the next big thing. (Of course, the federal
budget passed $1 trillion several years ago, but nobody pays
attention to it.)
</P>
<P>
   Before this recent shift in consciousness, a trillion, at least
in everyday usage, was an expression more akin to zillion,
gazillion and jillion. It was a way of connoting scads, heaps,
plenitude and humongosity. In this it was like a light year. No one
ever experienced a light year and no one ever saw a trillion
anything. It was a poetic concept like all the stars in the heavens
and all the grains of sand on the beaches.
</P>
<P>
   But when Long-Term Capital Management's troubles became
newsworthy in early October, it was reported that the firm had
entered into ``exotic financial transactions'' valued at $1.25
trillion. Derivatives and forward contracts might not be
universally comprehensible, but the basic image conveyed by the
news stories was not at all meant as an abstract concept, like
stars in the Milky Way. Anyone who plays poker could understand it;
a group of people, a very finite group of people, were sitting
around a table and making bets trying to win a pot worth $1.25
trillion, a figure even more impressive when it is represented like
this: $1,250,000,000,000. That is quite real. It is so real it is
scary.
</P>
<P>
   For perspective, it may be useful to note that if somebody
wanted to distribute $1 trillion equally among all 240 million
Americans, he would have to dispense more than $4,000 to every man,
woman and child.
</P>
<P>
   Putting a dollar sign in front of very big numbers tends to make
them real, though this does not always work for other units of
wealth. For example, one can go to the Numismatic Museum in New
York and gaze at the quintillion pengo note that circulated in
Hungary during a period of hyperinflation after World War II.
Despite its 18 zeros, six more than those of a trillion, it is not
really awe-inspiring. Even in the heyday of the pengo, one probably
couldn't get much for a trillion, or quartillion or quintillion of
them.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a lesson here. Dollars, like pengos, fluctuate over
time. And just as there are forces of inflation and devaluation
affecting currencies, so there are semantic shifts in the numbers
that come to be associated with money. Take millions and billions,
which were as mythical as trillions were before Long-Term Capital
helped make them a household concept.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when a million dollars was a pretty high
standard. Telling somebody they looked like a million was
considered a high compliment. Similarly, a millionaire was a rare
species, generally depicted in cartoons as a cigar-smoking person
in a top hat. Now, according to ``The Millionaire Next Door,'' a
best seller since it appeared in 1997, there are 3.5 million of
them. That's 3,500,000, households. Though this is not exactly a
dime a dozen, it is not one in a million either.
</P>
<P>
   And within the last decade, some people began to be designated
as billionaires. This has led to some confusion between the
categories, notably the assumption that millionaires and
billionaires are related subspecies who graze together. This is a
fallacy that may be made clear by the following facts: A person
with the net worth of $1 is closer in wealth to a person with a net
worth of $50 million than the person with $50 million is to the
person with $1 billion. Much, much closer. After all, the person
with $1 is only $49,999,999 behind the millionaire, while the
millionaire is $950,000,000 behind the billionaire.
</P>
<P>
   This co-mingling of truly fat cats and the merely plump has long
bothered John Allen Paulos, a Temple University mathematician who
has written entertainingly about mathematics in everyday life. He
advocates using scientific notation to describe the rich instead of
the indistinct millionaire or multimillionaire, which could mean
anyone who possessed more than a million or less than a billion
(which the British refer to quite correctly as a thousand million).
</P>
<P>
   Paulos thinks exponents would help put the very rich in their
appropriate places. For example, if one were to read about a 6 x
107 centerfielder, one could immediately determine that this was a
$60 million variety of millionaire. A 3 x 106 adolescent baby
sitter would be established as a $3-million member of the phylum.
And so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Greater precision could also be achieved by borrowing from
Indian usage. Indians, who number at least 8 x 108, have an
increasingly useful word _ crore _ which means 10 million. And
should the time come when the currently awesome trillion turns out
to be small potatoes, there is the googol, which is the number 1
followed by 100 zeros, or 10100. And if that's not enough, there is
the googolplex which is 10 to the power googol.

<P>
   Hey, does this ring a bell? Dogged by an aggressive prosecution,
a political leader denies an illicit affair _ ``I did not have sex
with her!'' _ although one of his own associates swears to it. In
addition, the leader is accused of hitting up constituents for
illicit contributions, of using government employees and resources
for his own purposes and even of sending operatives out to threaten
people.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, 1998?
</P>
<P>
   Try Mesopotamia, circa 1400 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   In a coincidence confirming that sex in politics is truly
ancient news, the Semitic Museum of Harvard University is
exhibiting cuneiform tablets from a corruption-and-sex
investigation about as old as Moses.
</P>
<P>
   You might even call these tablets the original Starr
transcripts. They were unearthed in northern Iraq in the late 1920s
thanks largely to years of digging by Richard F.S. Starr, an
archaeologist from the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard. Could he and
Kenneth, the independent counsel, be related?
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, ``Nuzi and the Hurrians: Fragments From a
Forgotten Past,'' opened in April. Curator James Armstrong said it
was planned well before the news broke in January of the
presidential sex scandal involving President Clinton and Monica
Lewinsky. But the parallels soon became clear.
</P>
<P>
   The tablets, from the museum's collection, record a judicial
panel's impeachment proceedings against Mayor Kushshiharbe of Nuzi,
a regional center of the ancient Mittani empire, near present-day
Kirkuk in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, not all of the impeachment tablets are on display, since
some were left behind in Baghdad _ including the testimony covering
the illicit affair. But not to worry: Those and others, many having
a lot to do with sheep, were previously translated, and are
excerpted here.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats are salivating over the prospect of
making Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr their star witness in next
month's House impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   They hope that by criticizing the special prosecutor and putting
his tactics in the spotlight, they may deflect some attention from
President Clinton's legal problems.
</P>
<P>
   But would Starr accept an invitation, or a summons, to appear
before the Judiciary Committee? It is not clear that he has to, but
he almost certainly would.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Starr will continue to cooperate with and respond to the
Congress,'' said Charles Bakaly, a spokesman for the independent
counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   There is precedent for having an independent counsel testify
before Congress. In 1997 Donald Smaltz, the independent counsel who
has been investigating former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy,
appeared before the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee
to complain that the Justice Department had undermined his
investigation by opposing its expansion.
</P>
<P>
   After complaining about White House delaying tactics and
stonewalling, it would be difficult for Starr to avoid testifying.
And after more than four years of keeping largely mum as he
investigated President Clinton and faced mounting attacks from
White House allies, Starr might actually welcome the opportunity to
introduce himself to the American public in his own words. Even
some Democrats are worried that Starr, a former federal judge and
solicitor general, might give a strong performance as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   As Democrats planned an expansive inquisition of Starr, House
Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde was talking of streamlining the 15
separate impeachment charges outlined by his committee's chief
counsel, David Schippers, and of trying to wrap up the proceedings
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde and his Republican colleagues would be hard-pressed to
oppose Democratic moves to put Starr on the witness stand, even if
they had the votes to do so. (The 21 Republicans on the committee
can overrule the 16 Democrats, but Hyde has said he hopes there can
be bipartisan agreement on witnesses.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that they'd be clobbered politically if they
didn't call Kenneth Starr,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently recognizing that reality, Hyde has said that an
appearance by Starr is fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Judiciary Committee allies have put Starr at the top
of their wish list of witnesses. ``Kenneth Starr deserves to be
before the Judiciary Committee for many, many things,'' said Rep.
John Conyers Jr., the panel's senior Democrat, who also served
during the Watergate hearings two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats on the committee have said they may also want to
summon some of Starr's deputies, as well as a group of conservative
lawyers, including a one-time law partner of Starr. These lawyers
advised the legal team working on Paula Corbin Jones' sexual
harassment lawsuit against the president and helped steer Linda
Tripp to Starr last January, launching the sex-and-perjury probe of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Although the first meeting between White House lawyers and the
committee lawyers will not begin until later this week, the
president's allies are already mapping out the areas on which they
would like to grill Starr.
</P>
<P>
   A major focus for the Democrats will be to pursue allegations of
collusion between the Jones lawyers and Starr's office. Democrats
have reviewed an Oct. 5 letter from David Kendall, one of Clinton's
private attorneys, to Attorney General Janet Reno in which Kendall
raised questions about communications between Starr's office and
the Jones team.
</P>
<P>
   One issue raised in the letter is a report in The New York Times
about Starr's office having received, through intermediaries, a tip
about Ms. Tripp before she contacted the independent counsel's
office. Democrats have also seized on a National Public Radio
report about Starr's conversations with one of Ms. Jones' former
lawyers before he was appointed independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Starr did not disclose these consultations to the Justice
Department before requesting an expansion of the investigation into
matters relating to Monica Lewinsky and the Jones case, lawyers
familiar with the discussions said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats may also question Starr about whether his office
leaked confidential information to the news media, a matter that is
already under investigation on the orders of a federal judge in
Washington. Starr has denied any improper contacts with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Other areas the Democrats plan to pursue, according to several
committee aides, include the grounds on which Starr sought to
expand his Whitewater inquiry into the Lewinsky case; his office's
treatment of Ms. Lewinsky during early immunity talks last January,
and the independent counsel's dealings with Ms. Tripp in the days
before he received permission to expand his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to show that Starr is the most overzealous
prosecutor ever,'' said a strategist with close ties to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   But the potential for such a strategy to backfire is not
insignificant. The fanatical prosecutor Democrats hope to introduce
in televised hearings is a polished lawyer whose testimony could
deflate the caricature of a pursed-lipped chief of the nation's sex
police. Though his White House critics have portrayed him as having
a tin ear when it comes to public relations, Starr could use his
turn as a witness to lay out a compelling case against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to come off the way James Carville portrays
him,'' said Theodore Olson, a Washington lawyer and friend of
Starr. ``He doesn't drool. He doesn't have two heads or pointed
teeth.'' Olson said he expected Starr to be a sympathetic witness
who would not lose his cool no matter how hostile the questions
get. ``I don't think I've ever seen Ken get mad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats are so nervous that Starr's appearance could
boomerang that they want to take his deposition behind closed
doors, a proposal Republicans would probably reject.
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic strategist fretted that a Starr appearance at
impeachment hearings might wind up like Clinton's videotaped
testimony before Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans kept saying how devastating the tape would
be,'' said the Democrat, ``but the public sympathized with him.
It's natural to sympathize with the person in the hot seat.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ No, it's not your imagination. New York really does
seem to be living through 1987 all over again. Just look at the
calendar: Monday is Oct. 19, the very date that will live in
financial infamy as Black Monday, when the stock market plunged 23
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other, creepier parallels, as a glance over some
old and new headlines will attest.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, Donald Trump was bent on gracing the city's
skyline with a new ``world-class'' tower _ although back then it
was the West Side (``Celebrities Open Wallets to Fight Trump's
Project''), while this time it's the East Side (``Trump Starts New
Tower Near the U.N.'').
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, scandal rocked Wall Street's elite _ except then
it was insider trading starring Ivan Boesky, not hedge-fund havoc
with John Meriwether.
</P>
<P>
   And then, as now, George Steinbrenner was threatening to move
the Yankees to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   As they do today, tourists thronged the streets, to the
increasing annoyance of the natives. In the city, prices of luxury
co-ops were in the stratosphere, as they are now, and new office
towers were sprouting in midtown, a little to the north and west of
today's hot spot, Times Square. Unemployment dropped to levels
unseen in years, like nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   But the stock market began falling from its peak in the summer,
just as it did this year. Worrywarts brooded about the city's
growing dependence on Wall Street. And, as if to confirm those
fears, Salomon Brothers on Oct. 12, 1987, announced big layoffs _
much as Merrill Lynch announced last week (on Oct. 13, to be
precise) that it was eliminating thousands of jobs, including 1,000
employees and outside consultants in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are differences, and not merely the Land Rovers in
place of Jaguars as status symbols. Investment in the stock market
is more pervasive, thanks to mutual funds and retirement plans, but
investors seem less likely to be spooked _ at least so far. After
all, they still have the gains they made during three years of
astonishingly high returns.
</P>
<P>
   And most important, interest rates are far lower than they were
in 1987; in fact, they are lower now than they were just last week,
thanks to the Federal Reserve's actions Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After the Crash of 1987, there were some immediate forecasts of
gloom and doom, but many in the city pooh-poohed the notion that
Wall Street's troubles would have a broad effect on most New
Yorkers. For a time they seemed to be right.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the following year, New York City government
revenues had fallen sharply, including toll collections, since
there were fewer commuters into Manhattan. The jobless rate began
to climb. By the spring of 1989 many who had bought apartments at
the peak found that they could not sell them for enough to cover
their mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   The real recession had begun.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that axing all those fat cats on Wall Street had
an effect on other people _ restaurant owners, accountants,
lawyers, bicycle messengers, real estate agents, panhandlers. It
just takes a while for the economic effects of any change to filter
out into the broader society.
</P>
<P>
   None of this means that a similar recession is just around the
corner in the city that considers itself the world's financial
capital. This time around, the national economy is in much better
shape: The federal government is not running a deficit, inflation
is not a worry, and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan isn't
raising interest rates as he was in 1987. The city's finances are
in far better shape too, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has already
budgeted for lower tax receipts from Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   But those who forget history _ well, you know. Or, as they say
on Wall Street, ``The most dangerous words in the English language
are, `It's different this time.' ''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Oct. 18, moved Saturday in the `a' category. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The originally budgeted BAD-SAMARITANS-REVIEW is held, replaced
by CRASH-DEJAVU-REVIEW. This final budget also adds GRAPHICS notes
to three stories.
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTHYISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Recently declassified Soviet and
U.S. documents indicate there was some truth to Sen. Joseph
McCarthy's charge that communist agents were at work in the U.S.
The data has unleashed a flood of scholarship and revived old
debates. By Ethan Bronner.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-ECON-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ The Israeli business community
and foreign investors have a deep interest in seeing a genuine
Israeli-Palestinian accord. While the political arguments have
focused on security and land, the economic case for achieving peace
is a powerful background factor as Netanyahu and Arafat meet. By
William Orme Jr.
</P>
<P>
   POLLS-VOTERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ With the Republican-led House
moving toward an impeachment investigation of President Clinton,
voter turnout will be especially important this year; polls on who
will turn out are therefore also important. A look at how to assess
pre-election polls. By Michael R. Kagay. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   HATE-CRIMES-REVIEW (Houston) _ Laws against hate crimes raise a
paradox: such laws are designed to magnify an offense and show our
condemnation of it, but in extreme cases such as murder, these laws
may be unnecessary, since the person convicted would probably get
the maximum punishment anyway. By Rick Lyman. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   ANCIENT-SEX-SCANDAL-REVIEW (Undated) _ In a coincidence
confirming that sex in politics is truly ancient news, the Semitic
Museum of Harvard University is exhibiting cuneiform tablets from a
corruption-and-sex investigation from Mesopotamia circa 1400 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-U.S.-BANKS-REVIEW (Washington) _ There are striking
parallels between the United States in the late 1980s as it
struggled to address its savings &AMP; loan crisis and Japan in 1998 as
it faces a banking system near collapse. Those similarities offer
lessons about what and what not to do. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   SACRILEGE-REVIEW (Undated) _ The play ``Corpus Christi'' has
refueled debate over a purported double standard: is offending
Christians not as bad as offending other religious or ethnic
groups? But the deeper and more complicated issue is what is fair
and what goes over the line in dealing with religious themes. By
Peter Applebome.
</P>
<P>
   STARR-REVIEW (Washington) _ Democrats want to make Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr their chief witness at the House impeachment
hearings. A look at whether this would help or hurt their cause. By
Jill Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   BIG-NUMBERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The numbers: they keep getting

figures like a trillion have become less abstract and more real. By
Michael T. Kaufman. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-DEJAVU-REVIEW (New York) _ On the eve of the 11th
anniversary of the stock market crash, New York seems to be living
through 1987 all over again. There are some scary parallels between

ANALYSIS: MIDEAST TALKS BUILT ON MUTUAL DISTRUST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Israel)  (mk) 
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ The branches of the Wye River that embrace the
sprawling conference center where high-powered Israeli, Palestinian
and American delegations are cooped up for the weekend define their
challenge in elemental terms _ either figure out a way across now,
or tumble into muddy waters in six months' time.
</P>
<P>
   The leap does not seem so formidable in itself. What Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Palestinian leader, Yasser
Arafat, are being urged to do by the Americans is essentially to
agree to carry out long overdue obligations under the Oslo
agreement _ the Israelis, to cede another chunk of occupied
territory, and the Palestinians, to crack down on terror and hate.
</P>
<P>
   But a bitter 19-month freeze in the process has left each leader
acutely wary of the step. After all the rancor and international
criticism that the delay has created, Netanyahu must be able to
demonstrate to his critics that the gains in security justify the
loss of time and goodwill and the surrender of more territory.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Arafat must show an increasingly skeptical public
that he is not simply being made a chump by the Israelis and
Americans, that he is really delivering the promised land.
</P>
<P>
   And as they stand poised on the edge, each leader must overcome
his deep-seated suspicion that the other will just pretend to jump.
</P>
<P>
   In the elaborate secrecy surrounding the meetings, there has
been nothing so far to signal whether progress is being made. There
were idyllic reports on Friday that Arafat, wrapped in his
signature guerrilla outfit, ambled over to the Israeli compound and
sat down on the verandah for a chat with a tieless Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   But those familiar with what the two men really think of each
other exclude the chance that the tete-a-tete was evidence of a new
chumminess. Both are masters at political theater, and fully
conscious that such displays of casual contact are what the
Americans want. And if things did fall apart, each could then say,
``I tried.''
</P>
<P>
   If progress is not being made, however, it is not for lack of
horsepower at the Wye Plantation, the Aspen Institute conference
complex on Maryland's Eastern Shore where the negotiators have
gathered.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is scheduled to make his second personal
appearance at Wye Saturday, while Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and the director of the Central Intelligence Agency,
George Tenet, are full-time participants.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is being joined Saturday by his powerful new foreign
minister, Ariel Sharon, and Sunday by his defense minister, Yitzhak
Mordechai. The fourth member of the all-important ``kitchen
cabinet,'' Trade and Labor Minister Natan Sharansky, is there
already, insuring that if any deal is struck, it shall have passed
one major political hurdle already before it comes before the
Parliament on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That is critical for Netanyahu, because it is certain that
whatever he does, he will have to face a no-confidence vote from
legislators returning from a holiday break.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, given the fury of Israeli politics, Netanyahu
has worked hard to manage the impression of what he is doing at
Wye. When his spokesman, Aviv Bushinsky, slipped out to give
Israeli reporters a briefing, it was to assure them that being at
Wye on Saturday would not violate the Sabbath _ that the Israeli
delegation did not plan to share its Sabbath meal with the
Palestinians, that Sharansky was prepared to read the mandatory
blessings.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has likewise come to Wye with virtually his entire brain
trust, including all his major negotiators, and made sure from the
first day to demonstrate his fealty to the Americans and his
respect for their proposals.
</P>
<P>
   For all the accumulated hazards and hatreds, participants note
that several conditions make the Wye gathering more auspicious than
past attempts to get things moving.
</P>
<P>
   One is President Clinton, who comes to the talks with high
ratings and an understood threat that if this fails, he will not
try again. Unlike last January, the previous time Clinton tried to
cajole the Israelis into a deal, when the U.S. Senate and American
Jewish organizations assailed him for leaning on Netanyahu, and the
Monica Lewinsky scandal had just broken, the president seems to
have full backing from all sides this time.
</P>
<P>
   On the Israeli side, one potentially helpful development is the
promotion of Sharon to foreign minister and chief negotiator. The
veteran hawk is trusted by Israel's right-wing and religious
factions, and thus might defuse the most dangerous source of
opposition to a peace deal _ though, as Israelis were quick to
point out behind his back, he is just as likely to block any deal
he does not like. Netanyahu is also supported by polls that
indicate 82 percent of the Israeli public want an agreement at the
summit, and 57 percent support an additional withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, Arafat appears to be the weakest of the
three. He is sick and increasingly unpopular among the
Palestinians, and the latest Palestinian polls show that a majority
favor violence again. But in these talks he also carries one of the
few tangible aces _ the knowledge that if nothing happens at Wye,
he will proclaim a Palestinian state on May 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   That is the deadline set in the Oslo agreements for reaching a
final settlement. And Arafat has declared that if no agreement is
reached by then, he is justified in going it alone, just as Israel
unilaterally declared its independence in 1948. The indications are
that he would get full support from most of the world, and that
even the United States would not stand in his way.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   What exactly is meant by a unilaterally declared Palestinian
state, nobody knows. But neither Israel nor the United States, not
even Arafat, really want to find out, because it would plunge the
region into a totally new, potentially very dangerous realignment.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Netanyahu's preference would be to begin some process that
would put off the deadline, preferably without setting a new one.
At the least, the Israelis would demand concrete assurances that if
they agree to a further withdrawal, Arafat would let May 4 slide.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat has spent his entire adult life playing with a very
limited hand, and he will not release his solitary ace without some
very concrete assurances that he will get his state at some
specified time.
</P>
<P>
   The mutual distrust extends to every aspect of the talks. The
Israelis demand that their withdrawal be staged, and each slice of
land they cede be accompanied by concrete Palestinian steps against
terror and incitement. Arafat wants guarantees that if he takes
such steps, the Israelis will withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   The sense leading up to Wye was that so complex a deal, which
has eluded negotiators for 19 months, cannot be achieved within 72
hours. That sense has been encouraged by Israeli officials who have
tried to dampen expectations, telling all who will listen that it
is better to return with no agreement than another flawed one.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is certain that however things turn out, all will
claim success and victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each side will receive its pound of flesh,'' wrote one Israeli
commentator: ``Clinton will receive good television minutes, Arafat
will continue to accumulate points at the White House and in the
international arena, and Netanyahu will return home a victor. Only
Dennis Ross'' _ the indefatigable American envoy to the Middle East
_ ``will again pack his suitcases.''

   Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rates Again
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve unexpectedly cut interest rates by a quarter
of a percentage point, taking the unusual step of moving on his own
authority in between the central bank's regularly scheduled
policy-setting meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The move lifted the markets, which had grown increasingly
rattled by the spread of the financial crisis that began last year
in Asia. But it also suggested that the Fed is concerned that the
nation's long economic expansion could be endangered by the growing
reluctance of lenders and investors to provide businesses with
money.

   Two years after a pipe bomb exploded at Centennial Olympic Park
in Atlanta, federal authorities charged Eric Robert Rudolph with
the attack, which killed one woman and injured hundreds. Rudolph,
already wanted for his role in a fatal January bombing at an
abortion clinic in Birmingham, Ala., was also accused of two other
Atlanta bombings in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph has been the subject of a massive manhunt in the dense

   Uniting Faith and Reason
</P>
<P>
   In an encyclical marking his 20th anniversary as pope, John Paul
II made a spirited defense of clear, rational thought, criticizing
those who take shortcuts to life's answers or who rely too much on
blind faith. Never ``abandon the passion for ultimate truth,'' he
urged. Philosophers, ``be they Christian or not,'' should ``trust
in the power of human reason.''
</P>
<P>
   He was unambiguous, though, about where that reason should
ultimately lead: to ``the truth of Christ, the one definitive
answer to humanity's problems.'' And he did not address one of
humanity's most divisive issues: abortion.

   The FBI opened a national computer data base that holds
identifying information from the DNA of convicted felons. The new
system, which consists of smaller state-run data bases that are
linked by common test procedures and software, will enable DNA from
a crime scene to be compared with DNA from convicted felons in all
50 states.

   Prenatal AIDS Tests Sought

<P>
   Testing for the AIDS virus should be a routine part of every
pregnant woman's prenatal care, a panel of experts from the
Institute of Medicine recommended. Checking for HIV infection need
not be accompanied by extensive AIDS counseling, as now recommended
by federal officials, which some doctors find so burdensome that
they forgo offering tests. Treating infected women with anti-HIV
drugs cuts the risk of transmission to newborns by two-thirds.

   The program would cost $8 billion and take 20 years. But many

   U.N. Gangs Up on Embargo

<P>
   A year ago, in a United Nations General Assembly vote, 143
nations favored an end to the American embargo on Cuba. Only the
United States, Israel and Uzbekistan said nay. This year,
Uzbekistan defected _ and some abstaining nations came around _ in
a record 157-to-2 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's official line, as global support nears the
vanishing point, is that ``sanctions are an important foreign

``sanction-happy'' Congress has clung to the embargo ``for domestic
reasons.''

   The physics prize recognized three alumni of Bell Laboratories

airplane insulation that burns too easily and should be changed.
The agency said it would devise a new flammability test within six

   The Spoils of the Budget War
</P>
<P>
   Schoolteachers, immigrants and the Pentagon emerged as big
winners after Congress and President Clinton reached agreement on
the $1.7 trillion federal budget. Weighty issues aside, some
lawmakers were quietly enjoying their success in slipping into the
huge spending bill several favors to constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott had the duck-hunting season in
Mississippi and five other Southern states extended by 11 days,
over the objections of hunters up north. Rep. Mary Bono, R-Calif.,
got $5 million for a study of how best to clean up the polluted
Salton Sea in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark., had $100 million inserted to build a
52-mile interstate highway in southern Arkansas. California
lawmakers prevailed upon negotiators to include $8 million for a
new forest-management program in the Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone came away happy. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J,
failed to prolong a big drug maker's monopoly on the popular
allergy pill Claritin.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. James Walsh, R-N.Y., wanted to cut the cost of imported
Italian wool to garment makers by $10 million to help offset a
tariff that Canadian rivals do not have to pay. But all Walsh could
wangle was a promise that the Labor Department will study the
issue.

   The Unbearable Badness of Being
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, bad is good.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Museum of Bad Art, which is housed in a dank,
concrete basement next to the men's room of the community theater
in the Boston suburb of Dedham.
</P>
<P>
   A stroll through the museum's permanent collection tends to
bring expressions of dismay from many visitors, as they pass works
like ``Lucy in the Field With Flowers,'' a portrait of a rather
nasty-looking old woman set against a hideous yellow sky, or
``Sunday on the Pot With George,'' a pointillist vision of a heavy
man seated on a toilet.
</P>
<P>
   The ineffable badness of some of the works, in fact, makes them
all but indescribable.
</P>
<P>
   But the museum's founders say the point of all this badness is
that it's all right, and often even quite interesting, to fail;
that people who only sing in the shower, or paint on Sundays, are
also worth celebrating, simply for their love of making art.
</P>
<P>
   And for a place that celebrates failure, the five-year-old
museum is enjoying marked success. It has put out a book and a
CD-ROM, and its Web site, www.glyphs.com/moba, is well visited.
</P>
<P>
   Its artists are happy too, the founders say, and the submissions
continue to roll in because of the following win-win logic: if an
artist's work is accepted, he can say he has work hung in a museum;
and if it is rejected, he can boast that the world's top authority
on bad art has officially declared him ``not bad.''

KANELL AND BROWN SHARE AN UNCOMMON HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ At Giants Stadium Sunday, the starting
quarterback for the Giants and the backup quarterback across the
field for the Arizona Cardinals will share an uncommon history.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Kanell and Dave Brown have each been Giants starting
quarterbacks, and each comprehends the capricious nature of the
assignment. Each played well initially and drew praise; each then
fell on harder times and drew the bulk of the blame for defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's rocky period lasted nearly two and a half years. Kanell
has had just two successive bad games for the 2-4 Giants.
Nonetheless, he has heard the first serious criticism of his
professional career.
</P>
<P>
   Since Kanell replaced Brown in the starting lineup 12 months
ago, he has started 16 games, a full National Football League
season.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing Kanell's statistics in his 16 starts with Brown's
first 16 starts as a Giant in 1994-95 is revealing for how
similarly the two fared.
</P>
<P>
   Each won 9 games in those first 16 starts. Each gave up 17
interceptions. Their passing yardage was just 86 yards apart _
Brown with 2,691 yards, Kanell with 2,605.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to forget how competently Brown played in 1994, when
he was 9-6 as a starter. His quarterback rating over his first 16
games was higher than Kanell's (71.2 to 67.8), although neither of
those ratings would be considered good in a league where the
average rating is about 77 and the leading quarterbacks have
ratings higher than 100.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to note that the Giants are throwing more with
Kanell, who has attempted about five more passes per start than
Brown did. And Kanell has completed more touchdowns (18) than
interceptions, while Brown had just 12 touchdowns in his first 16
starts.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two glaring _ and illuminating _ differences in
their statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell has been sacked 32 times, and Brown was sacked 44 times.
The Giants' offensive line may have improved; more likely, it's
indicative of a change in offensive philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell isn't holding the football in the pocket as long as Brown
once did. Consider that Kanell's average gain per passing attempt
is 5.6 yards. Brown, playing for Dan Reeves, who favored long,
slow-developing pass routes rather than a lot of quick passes to
running backs, averaged 7 yards per pass attempt.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't necessarily equate to efficiency; indeed, Kanell's
recent woes have been amplified because so many of his passes have
been for short gains, something that could also be the byproduct of
the pressure Kanell has felt in the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's passing statistics _ and his record as a starter _
declined the longer he played. In the Giants organization, there's
no real concern yet that Kanell is facing a similar fate, but the
24-year-old Kanell is in the midst of the worst slump of his
football career.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two Giants games, losses to Tampa Bay and Atlanta,
Kanell has thrown three interceptions and just one touchdown.
Tellingly, he has been sacked six times. His completion percentage
has been just 46.9.
</P>
<P>
   He has looked unsettled in the pocket at times and has rushed
his passes, which destroys rhythm and accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has looked a little jumpy,'' Coach Jim Fassel said of
Kanell on Friday. ``But that's what you get with a young
quarterback. When you're not functioning, the burden shifts to the
quarterback, and sometimes the young guys aren't able to keep that
pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people have to remember, it's really just been the last
two games. That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, however, understands that the scrutiny of Kanell's
performance is mounting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I was here when they booed Phil Simms,'' said Fassel, a
Giants assistant coach in 1991-92. ``That's a guy who is a legend
around here now. People get upset, and when the team loses, all
they see is the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say he's the reason we lost. He's not the reason we
lost. There's a lot more to it than that. But I understand that
fans get frustrated. I want them to care. Our fans at home can help
us a lot with their enthusiasm. They can give a young quarterback a
lot of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Or they can help erode his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's inability to help the Giants have a winning season like
the one he experienced in his first year as a starter became an
albatross that Brown never overcame. Maligned and booed at home,
Brown was released by the Giants last winter and it was considered
by most a merciful gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, at the time, Kanell had a 7-2-1 record as a starting
quarterback. Why, he had never even lost consecutive games he
started, not in high school, college or the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   That streak was broken four weeks ago. Now Kanell can't help but
hear the grumbling about his play, though he tries to ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people see me, they're nice to me,'' he said last week.
``They're not going to say stuff to my face. But from what I've
heard, some people are talking it out. I don't let it get to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of the job of being a quarterback, especially in
this town. You have to be able to take the heat and enjoy the
attention when times are good.''
</P>
<P>
   He has experienced both sides, and at 9-6-1, Kanell's winning
percentage is unquestionably acceptable. But Sunday afternoon, when
Kanell and Brown meet on the field to talk before or after the
game, Brown will be able to tell his good friend _ if he hasn't
already _ that a good start does not insure long-term success.
</P>
<P>
   After leading the Giants to a 9-7 record in his first 16 starts,
Brown won just 14 of his next 37 starts for the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   That includes the game on Oct. 5, 1997, when Kanell relieved
Brown in the second quarter and rallied the Giants to victory over
the Dallas Cowboys. It was Brown's last start.

BILL BRADLEY TRUMPETS THE VIRTUES OF THE NBA IN HIS NEW BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one has guaranteed Michael Jordan's return, just as no one
can safely say when the season will start. If it's not young
knuckleheads failing to mature, it's old sages saying goodbye. And
all the while, these grown men who make their living off a YMCA
recreation cannot seem to divvy up $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good time to loathe this game.
</P>
<P>
   Or to wait for some curmudgeon who once played in satin shorts
and sideburns to come out with a book detailing the demise of the
National Basketball Association. What with labor disputes, player
insurrections and flat-out bad basketball, Bill Bradley had more
ammunition at his disposal than when he ran the floor with Willis
Reed and Walt Frazier.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in his fourth book, ``Values of the Game,'' the former New
York Knick and former U.S. senator does not fire away. At a time
when the league is canceling games and searching for an identity
after Larry, Magic and very soon Michael, one of its alumni is
actually trumpeting its virtues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to show that even in the midst of all these other
things going on, there are some things that last, some eternal
values in the game that are accessible to a father and mother who
want to teach the game to their children,'' Bradley said over lunch
recently at a Manhattan restaurant. ``Or for high school coaches
who are shaping people as much as they did 30 years ago, I wanted
to show the continuity that is there, while not whitewashing what
are the bad aspects of the current game.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley writes about learning more from people by playing a
3-on-3 game with them than he does talking with them for a week. He
uses photographs he selected and captions he wrote to portray the
game as a laboratory for shared human experience.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of drawing distinctions between eras, he tries to bridge
a gap between his generation of players and today's. There are
passages about the league's problems that hint at disenchantment,
but over the book's 158 pages, he celebrates the pro game much more
than he denigrates it.
</P>
<P>
   Why all this sappiness in the midst of NBA anarchy? That's
apparently what happens when you walk into an empty gym, pick up a
ball and start dropping in jump shots, as Bradley did one morning
two years ago at his local Y in Montclair, N.J. His time at
Stanford University as a visiting professor last year fostered that
feeling, as he got to know the coaches and players on the
Cardinal's Final Four men's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience reawakened something in me that had been
dormant for 20 years,'' he said. ``So I decided I wanted to write a
book about my love for the game. At the same time I wanted to try
and express it in a way that was different than `Life on the
Run,''' he added, referring to his book about 21 days on the road
as a professional athlete in 1974. ``I wanted to use basketball as
the way to talk about some deeper things and long-lasting values.''
</P>
<P>
   Given his political history, one might wonder if Bradley partly
used the book to deliver character-building messages, words that
could resonate with a public searching for a new Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether I was a candidate in politics or not, these are things
I believe,'' he said, scoffing at the notion. ``The book would've
been written whatever the circumstances. I had a couple of drafts
where I would draw lessons and apply them to politics. I thought,
no, no, no, that's not what this book is. This book is about values
of the game and life.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, in fact, mention that he would decide by the end of the
year whether to run for president in 2000. ``There are two
threshold questions,'' he said. ``Can you add appreciably to the
public welfare, given your skill, sense and experience? And second,
do I, my wife and family want to jump off a 50-story building with
no idea whether there is a net at the bottom? I'll answer those and
make an internal decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Values of the Game'' (published by the Artisan imprint
of Workman Publishing) never delves deep into troubling issues
surrounding professional basketball, Bradley does express genuine
concern for the sport in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible to drive fans away,'' he writes in a chapter
titled ``Respect.'' ``Gratuitous violence (Latrell Sprewell
assaulting his coach), high ticket prices ($1,350 courtside seats
at Madison Square Garden) and a perception that players care only
about the money (Kevin Garnett's rejection of a $100 million
contract as insufficient) quickly put barriers between the fans and
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But after every knock, Bradley soon returns to the redemptive
qualities of the sport, as if it means too much to him to scorn
completely. He makes the monotony of practice seem purposeful and
relationships formed on the court seem more valuable and genuine
than many made off it.
</P>
<P>
   In a time of labor strife in the National Basketball Association
and petulance and problems at all levels _ a time when there is
little reason to love the game _ it is good to know someone still
feels that way about basketball.
</P>

FOOTBALL NOTES AND NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIANTS MAY TURN TO CARDINALS' MOORE FOR HELP
</P>
<P>
   One possible answer to the Giants' offensive problems will be
playing at Giants Stadium Sunday. A Giants assistant coach said
last week his team would love to steal Rob Moore from the Cardinals
when the wide receiver becomes an unrestricted free agent at the
end of this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are interested in Moore because they lack a big-play
receiver. Moore has fought a hamstring injury for much of the
season, and Sunday's game is the first for which he will be
completely healthy. Last year he led the National Football League
in receiving yards (1,584), catches of at least 25 yards (20) and
first-down receptions (68). Moore is among the league's top five
wide receivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants may have a good crop of young receivers, led by Ike
Hilliard, and it is true that they desperately need a running back
and a tight end, but the team can draft players for those
positions. And with the salary cap increasing for next season, the
Giants will have the cap room to fit in Moore's salary.
</P>
<P>
   Moore recently turned 30, but being that old does not seem to be
a liability for top receivers. Jerry Rice of the 49ers had 391
catches for 6,575 yards from age 25 to 29, and 524 catches and
7,305 yards from age 30 to 34. Some of Moore's top seasons may be
ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was the Jets' No. 1 pick in the 1990 supplemental draft
and played with the team until 1994, before signing with Arizona as
a free agent. Moore, who attended Syracuse, still has a home on
Long Island. Sources say he wants to come back to New York, not
only because he likes the area but also because he wants to reunite
with Jim Fassel, the Cardinals' former offensive coordinator who is
the Giants' coach.
</P>
<P>
   Moore has also supposedly said he wants a more stable situation
than the one in Arizona. The offensive coordinator, Marc Trestman,
is Moore's fourth coordinator in four years, and Jake Plummer is
his fifth starting quarterback in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Re-signing Moore is Arizona's top priority. But if the Cardinals
do not sign him, no one should be surprised if he ends up back in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   PATRIOTS RUNNING TO GLORY
</P>
<P>
   It's still too early to judge which team made out better, the
Jets or the New England Patriots, when the Jets gave up five draft
picks to get Coach Bill Parcells and running back Curtis Martin.
Five years from now, the winner will probably be more clear. If the
Jets get to a Super Bowl and the Patriots do not, the draft picks
will have been worth it. If the Patriots do and the Jets don't,
then New England is the winner.
</P>
<P>
   It may be early, but there is a leader _ the Patriots are ahead,
by about a length. The two teams play Monday night in Foxboro,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   New England's front office has proved to be one of the best
evaluators of talent in football, and the Patriots' executives have
used the choices acquired from the Jets well: all five picks
received from the Parcells-Martin defection are still on the
Patriot roster.
</P>
<P>
   The crown jewel has to be running back Robert Edwards, a
first-round selection (18th over all) out of Georgia. The pick used
for Edwards was the one New England got from the Jets for Martin.
That meant that the Patriots took a huge gamble, giving up Martin's
1,266 yards a season for a rookie. The gamble paid off in a big
way. If the Patriots' owner, Robert Kraft, sees Parcells Monday, he
may thank him. Edwards has been so impressive, he is a contender
for rookie of the year (though receiver Randy Moss of the Minnesota
Vikings seems to be a lock).
</P>
<P>
   Edwards is the first rookie since the 1970 NFL-American Football
League merger to rush for a touchdown in each of his first five
games. One more touchdown run and Edwards will pass Alan Ameche
(1955) and Joe Cribbs (1980) for most consecutive games with a
rushing touchdown by a rookie. Last week, Edwards scored twice and
rushed for 104 yards against Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   And to think, Edwards has played running back for only a couple
of years. He went to Georgia as a defensive back, and was moved to
running back as an experiment. In his first game as a runner, he
scored five touchdowns. Experiment over.
</P>
<P>
   His running style is similar to Tony Dorsett's in that he can
combine power with speed in a wink. He is also a good receiver and
excels at beating a linebacker or strong safety playing
bump-and-run coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are 4-1 and they can thank Edwards. His presence
has eased the load of quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who has a rating of
96.9.
</P>
<P>
   Every time the Patriots' front office looks at Edwards, it
affirms the team's decision to let Martin go. In fact, a Patriots
assistant coach remarked with glee that Edwards has 379 yards
rushing, and Martin, who missed last week's Jets game against St.
Louis with a hamstring injury, has 368.
</P>
<P>
   NO CHARGE IN CHARGERS
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, Kevin Gilbride became the first coaching casualty
of the season, something that had been rumored for weeks. The
reason? Gilbride, several high-ranking Chargers executives said,
had lost the respect of his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of getting better, maybe we were stagnant, or maybe
even regressing,'' said Bobby Beathard, the team's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Several players complained privately to members of the front
office, voicing their disapproval of the team's direction. Those
players said practices were sloppy and there was little team
discipline. Safety Rodney Harrison said morale was terrible under
Gilbride, and a change was welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbride said in a statement he was shocked by the firing, but
he shouldn't be. The Chargers scored only 22 touchdowns in 22 games
under Gilbride, and the rookie quarterback Ryan Leaf had only one
touchdown pass and 15 turnovers. The fact Gilbride was going to
bench Leaf in favor of the journeyman Craig Whelihan also factored
into management's decision to dismiss him, Chargers executives
said.
</P>
<P>
   June Jones takes over as interim coach. Guess what? Leaf is
starting Sunday when the Chargers (2-4) play the Philadelphia
Eagles (1-5) in a game that host San Diego could win. Jones is no
dummy.

MARTINEZ HOPES BATCH OF BATS WILL BRING SLUMP RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JACK CURRY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A new shipment of bats arrived for Tino Martinez on
Friday, and he massaged the handles to make sure they were thin
enough, knocked on the barrels and listened for a certain sound and
swung them slowly again and again. Martinez was so excited about
the fresh bats, he reacted like a Little Leaguer who was wielding
an aluminum bat for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were saving the World Series trees until now, right?''
Martinez said to the representative from the bat company. ``These
are from World Series trees, aren't they?''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez could joke about the bats being specially designed for
the World Series because the Yankees began their quest for a second
title in the past three years when they play host to the San Diego
Padres in Game 1 at Yankee Stadium Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Major leaguer players who were watching on television could not
imitate David Letterman and joke about World Series wood. Even
though Martinez has struggled with numerous bats during the
post-season, he could joke because the Yankees are still alive for
the title. Martinez is still alive. For now, Martinez, the power
hitter who has mostly been missing in action, could joke around.
For now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always get a fresh start in the post-season because it's
game to game,'' said Martinez. ``If you win, you've got another
game the next day so you forget about the bad at-bats. It's easier
to do that in post-season because your next at-bat could be the
biggest at-bat of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, having Martinez at the plate for the biggest at-bat of
the season would be a pleasing sight to the Yankees. But not when
the calendar flips to October. Martinez has experienced another
frustrating post-season.
</P>
<P>
   He is 5 for 30 with 10 strikeouts, no homers and only 1 run
batted in for a hitting-starved team that has batted .229 while
still winning 7 of 9 post-season games because of superior
pitching. Can the Yankees continue to win if Martinez, their most
valuable run producer, is a sometime singles hitter?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just gotten through two good series,'' said Paul
O'Neill. ``The Yankees won those series. You don't focus on one
guy. You focus on winning. The whole team won.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Joe Torre talked about Martinez needing one
line-drive hit to get him in a groove, the 30-year-old first
baseman is in a career drought in the post-season. Since joining
the Yankees, Martinez is 20 for 107 (.187) with one homer and 4 RBI
in 29 post-season games. Those are puny statistics, especially for
a player who has driven in 381 runs in 455 regular season games
over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would guess that Tino would have a great series,'' O'Neill
said. ``Baseball has a way of evening things out. You have a bad
series, you come back and have a great series. In the season,
that's easier to do. In the post-season, it gets tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   It cannot get much tougher for Martinez, who was dropped from
fifth to sixth in the order during the American League Championship
Series against the Cleveland Indians and will remain in that spot
until further notice. Martinez has blamed his paucity of production
on impatience and on trying to do too much. He has sometimes
flailed at poor pitches during hitter's counts of 3-1 and 2-0,
instead of working the count, and he has admitted that his previous
failures in the post-season have caused him to pursue the obviously
unattainable five-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Martinez has already made some alterations, and he has
reached base 7 times in his last 10 plates appearances on a double,
a single, a hit-by-pitch and 4 walks.
</P>
<P>
   It is not enough to pacify George Steinbrenner, but it is
something for him to cling to. Until last night, anyway, when
Martinez had to face Kevin Brown, a nasty right-hander who had
retired him in 30 of 34 career at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was getting good pitches and missing them, then I'd say I
have a bad swing working,'' said Martinez. ``But I've been swinging
at bad pitches. Right now, I've just got to be patient and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will wait with him. They have to. In the 1996 World
Series, Torre started Cecil Fielder over Martinez at first in Games
3, 4 and 5. It was a difficult decision because Martinez had paced
the team in RBI while Fielder did not join the Yankees until July
31. But the Yankees grabbed all three games so it worked. Torre
does not have such an attractive replacement this season in Luis
Sojo. So the Yankees will stay with Martinez, for better or worse,
while he tries to stay positive and finally produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the World Series,'' said Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to go out there and have fun with it. Big games are
all big games. You want to go out there and enjoy that game and try
to do your best to win that game. You don't think that you might
lose that day.''

PATRIOTS SEEM TO HAVE REAL LEADER IN BLEDSOE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When New England trampled Kansas City by 40-10 last week, the
Patriots gained the bonus of an orderly setting for the undesirable
Jets Monday night. Although many in New England still admire Coach
Bill Parcells, that is how plenty of others there feel about
Parcells and his Jets. Undesirables. The Patriots would like to
smack both by a score of, oh, 80-10.
</P>
<P>
   New England is 4-1 and cruising, having won four straight. The
Jets are 2-3 and reeling, having lost by 20 points at St. Louis.
Now, Patriots Coach Pete Carroll, the former Jets coach, gets the
Jets on his turf. Parcells, the former Patriot coach, brings a
scarred and scratched Jets team to Foxboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   It is at quarterback, though, where the difference is most
glaring.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Testaverde moves from backup to starter as the Jets
continue to flip-flop at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe, however, starts his 49th consecutive game for the
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just the streak. It is his game.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe is putting it all together now. He is in his sixth
season and he looks like an actor who has rehearsed and rehearsed
and talked those lines through in front of the mirror and, finally,
on stage is delivering not only the perfect words but also the
texture and the pitch and the emotion. Bledsoe is throwing it long
and throwing it short and making wonderful decisions. He is showing
a new mobility, some truly fancy footwork for a guy who is 6 feet 5
inches tall, 233 pounds and heretofore was known to move more like
cement than water.
</P>
<P>
   And here is the killer _ Bledsoe is developing a killer
instinct. Parcells might not recognize the guy. This is where he
wanted Bledsoe to improve most, to take charge and not be a wimp,
and, so, Parcells as Patriots coach rode him and rode him some more
to try and bring the killer instinct to the surface. Seldom did it
happen. Instead, Bledsoe ended up nearly wanting to kill Parcells.
In imagination, of course. Of course. Right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it is happening now, the killer instinct, and Bledsoe will
display it against the Jets, against Parcells, for certain. Against
the Chiefs, he was merciless. When the Chiefs made a mistake, he
pounced on them. Jump offsides? I'll take that free play, Bledsoe
seemed to say, and Wham! A 40-yard strike, deep downfield. Come
after me with the blitz? Wham! I'll make you pay. Buy some time.
Find the open guy. On the blitz, there is always an open guy.
Bledsoe zeroing in.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always this way. He has passed for big yards before
but appeared to show a reluctance to truly lead. To provide killer
instinct. Last season New England lost in the playoffs, 7-6, at
Pittsburgh. Late in the game the Patriots gained the ball with
several chances for Bledsoe to drive for a winning field goal or
make a winning play. He and the Patriots could not do it. And on
the Patriots' final drive he simply dropped the ball and turned it
over. He is the franchise. He earns the Patriots top dollar. He has
to make a play in a 7-6 playoff game to win it, his detractors said
afterward. Some of his biggest supporters did, too.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Bledsoe, too, later felt that way.
</P>
<P>
   Here is why. After the Chiefs game, after the Patriots rookie
back Robert Edwards provided another dazzling performance, Bledsoe
was asked if he was surprised by Edwards. His answer was of course
not, that Edwards was a first-round draft choice and that was what
he was supposed to do. Takes one to know one _ the position, the
task, the responsibility of a big-time draft pick. Especially at
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards is from the University of Georgia and he is running
hard. He is filling the big shoes of Curtis Martin, now a Jet.
Edwards' running complements Beldsoe's passing. Ernie Zampese is
the Patriots' new offensive coordinator. Every defensive opponent
thinks he knows Zampese. But Zampese just keeps tinkering, bringing
his arsenal of knowledge to the forefront. He is giving Bledsoe a
calm and a perspective in tutoring that he has not quite had as a
pro. Not like this. Zampese is special.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll nurtures Bledsoe and so does the Patriots' personnel
chief, Bobby Grier, and certainly, too, does the owner, Robert
Kraft. But Bledsoe looks as if he is taking more care of Bledsoe.
Expanding his shoulders and carrying the burden but playing with a
freedom that suggests the burden is much lighter.
</P>
<P>
   He ranks fifth in the American Conference in passing (a 97.2
quarterback rating) and second in third-down passing (27 of 41,
64.2 percent and a 104.7 quarterback rating). The Patriots rank
first in passing offense in the A.F.C. Bledsoe needs 352 passing
yards vs. the Jets to reach 20,000 for his career. In his first
five seasons he passed for 18,348 yards. Only Dan Marino in league
history passed for more (19,422).
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Drew is playing right now, it is something to really
see,'' said Ty Law, the Patriots big-play cornerback. ``Drew is a
new man this year. He's ready. If he keeps playing like he has, we
are going to go a long way. When Drew is playing like this, I like
my chances with him more than with any quarterback in this
league.'' &QL;

YALE, CLINTON'S ALMA MATER, IS LITTLE MOVED BY IMPEACHMENT DRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ During the Vietnam War and the Watergate
crisis, the campus of Yale University, like many others, was
politically energized, if not radicalized. The university chaplain,
the Rev. William Sloane Coffin Jr., took a prominent role in
opposing the war, and many undergraduates viewed the resignation of
President Richard M. Nixon as a triumph over the forces of evil.
</P>
<P>
   No such passions grip the Yale campus today as President Clinton
faces an impeachment drama in which a number of Yale alumni are
playing central roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no sense here that we are witnessing a great
historical moment,'' said Nicole Itano of Boulder, Colo., 20,
managing editor of The Yale Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Hurowitz, 20, of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., the newspaper's
editorials editor, said that students were ``tired of this stuff
and tired of our leaders doing nothing to define the other
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, The Yale Daily News urged Clinton to resign ``to put
this incredible, indelible blemish of American history behind us
and restore the assumption of honesty and personal integrity in our
highest elected official.''
</P>
<P>
   That was during the tenure of the class of 1999, now seniors. A
new editorial board, composed of juniors, takes a different
position, arguing against what editor in chief Isaiah Wilner, 20,
of Seattle, called ``an open-ended congressional witch hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beltway has escaped from the rest of the country,'' Wilner
said. ``The Judiciary Committee needs to set a time limit and to
limit itself to the Starr report issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, were members of
the class of 1973 at Yale Law School. They had planned to take part
in a 25th reunion celebration next weekend and attend a luncheon
honoring Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who graduated from the
law school in 1964. But the trip was abruptly canceled last Friday.
A White House spokesman said the president wanted to be available
for Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's private lawyer in the Lewinsky case, David Kendall,
and a new White House coordinator of his political defense, Gregory
Craig, also went to the law school. Brett Kavanaugh, a main author
of the Starr report, has a bachelor's and a law degree from Yale.
</P>
<P>
   All that has had little impact on undergraduates' thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no particular affection on this campus for George
Bush, who was even more closely identified with Yale, and there is
no particular disaffection with President Clinton,'' said Dan
Sommers, 21, an economics and politics major from New York, who
nevertheless favors the president's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton did in private is his own business, Sommers said,
``but he involved almost everyone in the Cabinet in defending his
lies, and he has weakened the presidency so much that nothing
substantive has happened in Washington since January, at a time
when we badly need strong leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact at the law school has been far greater. Yale Law
Review editor Laura Ahn declined to discuss Clinton's situation,
and several professors spoke only on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a powerful sense of betrayal,'' a professor said.
There had been a surge of optimism and hope when the president took
office, but now he is seen by most people here and elsewhere as
just another pol.''
</P>
<P>
   Several teachers recalled the traditional cocktail party at the
law school on the opening day of classes in the fall of 1992. ``The
first-year students,'' one said, ``knew that Bill Clinton had stood
where they were standing only 20-odd years before, and they were
filled with idealism and ambition because he was running for
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Akhil Reed Amar said that what he called ``the hard-edged
view that nothing in the Starr report comes even close to an
impeachable offense'' made him ``a little nervous'' in view of the
possibility that Clinton may have committed perjury in grand jury
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Amar, a law school professor who is considered an expert on both
the Constitution and criminal procedure, said: ``I would argue that
even if the charges are true, and he is technically impeachable,
this would not be a sensible exercise of the awesome, disruptive
power of impeachment. In this I am affected by the fact that the
American people twice voted for Bill Clinton knowing to a
considerable certainty what his character is like.''
</P>
<P>
   His greatest fear, Amar continued, is a deeply partisan debate,
which would be bad, he said, ``for the process and the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Historian John Morton Blum, a professor emeritus, was equally
critical of Clinton and Congress, describing them as ``the worst
leadership combination this country has had since Calvin
Coolidge.'' Clinton, he said, has ``a lifelong record of
dissembling'' and ``lax principles about anything, public or
private.''
</P>
<P>
   Blum said he opposed resignation because it would move the
country too close to the British model, where a prime minister who
loses the confidence of the House of Commons must quit, and he
opposes impeachment because he does not believe that ``lies told to
conceal adultery'' are impeachable crimes. But he confessed to
seeing no way out, because he found ``a crippled presidency, which
is the third alternative, worse than the others.''
</P>
<P>
   A conversation with a group of graduate and undergraduate
students at Yale's Timothy Dwight College evoked little sense of
the moral outrage that dominated college campuses on other issues
at other times.
</P>
<P>
   Lyneise Williams, 33, an art history student from Cincinnati,
spoke of detecting ``a shifting set of values among political
activists, a harsh new morality among Republicans, journalists and
the religious right.''
</P>
<P>
   But a few shreds of doubt emerged about the wisdom of Clinton's
continuing in office. Andrew Gerber, 21, an English major from
Bethesda, Md., said that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's
tactics bothered him deeply. But he said he could not help
wondering, ``What does it say about the president's judgment that
he would do these things with Monica when he was already under
suspicion by a lot of people about extramarital affairs?''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Kirshner, 21, a history major from Chicago, said he thought
there was no avoiding a lengthy impeachment proceeding, and ``that
makes you wonder how Clinton can emerge as an effective leader.''
Still, only Sommers among the eight in the discussion group said he
thought Clinton should resign.

 By DAVID W. CHEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They have been together for five bitter decades, and
they will stay together, it seems, for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   As teen-agers in the 1940s, they became Nationalist soldiers in
China and followed Chiang Kai-shek to Taiwan. As middle-aged
bachelors in the 1960s and '70s, they fled to the United States,
angry that Taiwan did not have a pension system for veterans. As
graying immigrants with no immediate relatives within a hemisphere,
they toiled in menial jobs in Manhattan's Chinatown. And since
1989, William Wong, Chi-ching Tung, Tong-yu Yang and Hsi-shan Chang
have occupied the same half-bedroom in a dilapidated apartment on
the Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   It is a story that only Wong, now a rickety 66, can tell. The
ashes of the other three rest in a tea container and two cardboard
boxes atop a shoddy bookcase, next to Wong's bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too expensive to put them in a crematorium, a minimum of
$50 each month,'' said Wong, who began storing the remains of his
comrades after Yang died in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Together, these four men have come to symbolize the penury and
pathos saturating the lives of many of the 100 or so Nationalist
veterans in Chinatown, and thousands of others scattered throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the veterans in Chinatown stayed in Chinatown, unable
to speak English, afraid to venture beyond its borders. Loneliness
was pervasive, and the men often had only one another, and their
memories, as company.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after decades of hiding in the shadows of society's
margins, they are seeking recognition and help. In recent months, a
growing number of veterans in New York have demanded more
retirement benefits from Taiwan's government _ benefits that they
say could mean the difference between life and death. And to press
their case, they have staged demonstrations in Chinatown, appealed
to politicians and courted the Chinese-language news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has a sad story,'' said Charlin Chang, president of a
veterans' group called the ROC Veterans' Self-Support Association
of USA. ``Everyone. And we are all getting older.''
</P>
<P>
   As with anything broaching Taiwan politics or history, the
campaign has elicited polar reactions in New York and abroad.
Nationalist loyalists are among the veterans' staunchest defenders.
But some ethnic Taiwanese _ particularly those who view the
Nationalists as invading outsiders _ have little sympathy, and
wonder aloud at what point self-pity stops and self-reliance
begins.
</P>
<P>
   For the veterans, though, the goal is not just money. Deep in
the sunset of their lives, these men are also struggling to gain
respect for what they have been through, and understanding for how
they fell through life's cracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came for the American dream, but perhaps their luck was
not right,'' said Wallace Chow, a senior assistant at the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office, Taiwan's de facto consulate in New
York. ``It is sad, but maybe this is just a mistake in history.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The story of Wong and his comrades is typical of those who
drifted from China to Taiwan to New York's Chinatown. As young men
without much formal education, they joined the army or navy,
patriotic and adventurous. But after the Nationalist forces were
defeated by the Communists and fled to Taiwan, the men never
returned to China or their families.
</P>
<P>
   As the decades passed, they became increasingly disillusioned
with the soldier's life. Soldiers earned only a pittance and were
not supposed to marry; those who did forfeited their salary, food
rations and housing.
</P>
<P>
   Those who quit the military found civilian life just as
difficult. They did not have skills or family. So some veterans
decided to join commercial fleets, jump ship to New York and enter
the United States illegally, convinced, as Wong put it, that
``America was heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not.
</P>
<P>
   They had heard about great jobs and big houses, but instead they
found only backbreaking work at restaurants, sweatshops or
construction companies, in a neighborhood with a surplus of
bachelors. Most remained unmarried and socialized mainly with one
another, swapping stories about their misspent youth.
</P>
<P>
   A determined few worked with matchmaking services in China to
find wives. But many of those matches ended in divorce,
particularly after the wives discovered that their husbands were
poor.
</P>
<P>
   Few veterans moved out of Chinatown. Few picked up much English.
And over the years, they found themselves being passed by or
overwhelmed by the changing landscape. More families moved in,
modern buildings went up, and the flow of Chinese immigrants and
the dialect they spoke changed.
</P>
<P>
   These days, some veterans collect cans and bottles to survive.
Others, Chang of the veterans association says, take advantage of
free bus rides from Chinatown to Atlantic City that are sponsored
by the casinos. The casinos offer a free meal and $10 for the day,
which the veterans pocket instead of using it to gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the story of Tzu-cheng Chang. Chang, a 76-year-old
veteran and bachelor, had worked in a restaurant for more than 30
years before quitting four years ago because of asthma and
arthritis. He survived on food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Chang's barber in Chinatown noticed that the man had
not dropped by for a few weeks. Concerned, he phoned Chang. No one
answered. So on July 30, firefighters entered Chang's tiny
apartment on East 17th Street in Manhattan. There was a foul smell.
Chang had been dead for days.
</P>
<P>
   In September, more than 60 veterans, some in wheelchairs,
demonstrated in Chinatown to call attention to the plight of Chang,
Wong and others, and to clamor for changes to Taiwan's system.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1970, Taiwan offered its retiring soldiers only a
lump-sum discharge of about $10 for nonofficers, with shoes and a
blanket tossed in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country was poor,'' said Ma Kai Nan, director of the
overseas liaison department of Taiwan's Veterans Affairs
Commission, in a telephone interview from Taipei. ``Life was
difficult, and we couldn't offer the soldiers much.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Taiwan established a special fund for nonofficers,
disbursing the equivalent of about $350 per month per veteran. But
there was a catch: except for those who lived in mainland China,
overseas veterans had to return to Taiwan twice a year to claim the
money in person.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many veterans in the United States have not
received their money, because they are too infirm to travel and
because the cost of the trip would exceed the stipend. In addition,
some veterans are still in the United States illegally, and would
be unable to return if they left.
</P>
<P>
   So instead, the veterans want, among other things, to be able to
register at any unofficial consulate to claim their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been cheated and lied to from when we were 17 to now,''
said Wong. ``We have been patriotic, we have sweated, we have shed
our blood, but the Taiwan government has not given us anything.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, the campaign has largely swirled in the New York area,
partly because Chinatown holds the largest concentration of
veterans and partly because veterans elsewhere in the country live
too far from one another to organize effectively. A small number of
veterans, meanwhile, have managed to rebuild their lives, finding
spouses and better jobs, and are uninterested in participating.
</P>
<P>
   But there are hints that the campaign may be working. While the
U.S. government has no official position on the matter, several New
York politicians, including Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, have
vowed to help. And Taiwan's government plans to amend its policy,
requiring that the veterans return only once a year, said Ma of the
Veterans Affairs Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But whether this support is based on legitimate policy
considerations or just pity for a dwindling group of desperate men
remains a matter of opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Some people say that while the veterans' stories may be sad,
their lives have not been discernibly worse than those of millions
of Taiwanese who endured economic and political hardship. Moreover,
some veterans already qualify for government assistance in the
United States, so for them to receive more from Taiwan would look
like double dipping.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the veterans are viewed by some Taiwanese as relics
of another era _ dinosaurs from the authoritarian regime of Chiang
Kai-shek who are out of touch with modern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``People might think, `Why are we giving these old soldiers some
money?' '' said Tzu-shong Yang, a former president of the East
Coast chapter of the Democratic Progressive Party, Taiwan's main
opposition party. ``They have no ties to Taiwan, and there are
plenty of other people in Taiwan who are suffering even more.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly enough, if the veterans moved to Taiwan today,
they would be eligible for benefits that did not exist when they
left, including free housing and medical care. But most do not want
to return, afraid to go back to a country that was a backwater when
they left, and is now the world's 17th-largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   So they remain in the United States, many living in squalor.
</P>
<P>
   Wong, for instance, has lived in the same grimy two-bedroom
apartment on Essex Street for 30 years. Only the roommates have
changed. Four people now live in a crammed two-bedroom apartment of
about 400 square feet, paying $175 per person per month.
</P>
<P>
   The bathroom does not have a sink. The kitchen does, however,
and that is where all the roommates leave their toothbrushes, along
with the dirty dishes.
</P>
<P>
   A tattered white sheet dividing Wong's bedroom in half gives him
the only privacy from that of his latest roommates, whom he does
not count among his friends. Wong does not have a closet in his
half, and hangs his clothes on a coat hanger nailed to the wall.
There are no pictures on the cream-colored walls; the paint is
peeling.
</P>
<P>
   A bookcase, unsteady, holds the remains of his three colleagues.
The ashes of Yang, who died in 1989, are in a tea container, which
is wrapped by a Nationalist flag. Those of Chang, who died in 1990,
are in a cardboard box. And the ashes of Tung, who died in 1997,
are in a similar box, with a framed photograph of him taped to the
front.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss my friends,'' Wong said with a sigh, cradling the
containers. ``Some day, I'd like to be able to bury them with the
proper respect.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Wong shared a bedroom with Tung, a navy veteran from
Sichuan province. But after Tung died, Wong rented the other half
out to a man who grew up in Communist China. The two men do not get
along.
</P>
<P>
   Wong declined to identify the man. After all, the roommate does
not even know that he lives among the ashes of three men, because
Wong covers the containers whenever he is with strangers.

HIGHER HOPES IN BAGHDAD FOR ENDING U.N. EMBARGO 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ With Washington sapped by scandal and the U.N.
arms inspectors weakened by infighting, Iraqi officials are
expressing confidence that they are closer than ever to having some
sanctions against their country eased and that they can avert a
military strike even if they stonewall against inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until February, the United States felt free to threaten or
actually use power anytime we objected to intrusive inspections _
it was simple,'' a senior Iraqi official said, speaking on
condition he not be identified. ``Now it is clear they are
restricted to only two circumstances: if we threaten a neighbor or
if we resume the manufacture of weapons. There is no more carte
blanche.''
</P>
<P>
   Most diplomats from other countries agree, at least, that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein has come a long way in shifting the burden
of making the case for sanctions toward the United States and the
U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which is charged with
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and long-range
missile systems. Until that is done, the Security Council has said,
the sanctions will remain.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, for example, a group of scientists and experts are to
meet at the United Nations in New York examine whether Iraq loaded
some of its missiles with deadly nerve gas. The United States made
the charge. But Switzerland, which conducted independent tests of
the equipment, says it found no proof. France, whose scientists did
tests of their own, may, though tepidly, back the United States'
contention.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The week before last, one of the most senior U.N. officials,
Assistant Secretary General Denis Halliday, a 34-year veteran of
the United Nations who had administered the ``oil-for-food''
program meant to blunt some impact of the sanctions, resigned his
post in anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanctions are starving to death 6,000 Iraqi infants every
month, ignoring the human rights of ordinary Iraqis, and turning a
whole generation against the West,'' he said in an interview here.
``I no longer want to be part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Britain, while continuing to side with the United States,
has considerably toned down its criticism of Iraq. The week before
last, its chief delegate, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, said Iraq may have
made enough progress in eliminating some weapons to deserve a
hearing on whether some sanctions should be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have succeeded in splitting the unanimity of the
Security Council, questioning the motives of UNSCOM, and above all
bringing in the secretary general of the United Nations into the
decision-making process as a neutral party,'' a high-ranking Iraqi
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest confrontation with the United Nations, Iraq has
banned all inspections since Aug. 5, and Secretary General Kofi
Annan has suggested a ``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's effort to
eliminate its banned arms. Such a review would take place after
inspections are resumed, a decision Iraq has yet to make.
</P>
<P>
   But the acting U.S. representative at the United Nations, A.
Peter Burleigh, insisted that not much has changed. ``There is no
Security Council member, friend or foe of Iraq, expressing any
sympathy toward Baghdad as it continues to openly defy the will of
the international community and its obligations under council
resolutions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The inspections commission itself, however, has been put on the
defensive as one of its inspectors, Scott Ritter, a former U.S.
marine, quit in August, charging that both the United States and
Annan caved in to Iraq. Since then, he has drawn more fire on the
inspection regime by acknowledging in several interviews that while
working for the United Nations he received intelligence about Iraq
from Israeli government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   One senior Western diplomat at the United Nations, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said that UNSCOM chairman Richard Butler
``has lost of a lot of trust.'' And the damage done to the
commission from such revelations was underscored by Butler himself,
who reprimanded Ritter for divulging secrets of his work.
</P>
<P>
   And there was another blow to the sanctions regime the week
before last. The International Atomic Energy Agency, itself a U.N.
agency based in Vienna, reported to the Security Council that it
had no evidence that Iraq has ``nuclear weapons, or nuclear weapons
usable materials or the capability to produce such items.''
</P>
<P>
   The finding prompted Russia to renew its call for the Security
Council to close the ``nuclear file'' on Iraq and reward it by
lifting some of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the United States would surely use its veto on the
Security Council to prevent such an outcome. But Iraq officials
here made clear that they see a definite limit to how long the
United States can push the sanctions, and a nearly unlimited
possibility for eroding the consensus on keeping them in place. &QL;

ANALYSIS: AS CONGRESSIONAL SESSION ENDS, A QUESTION OF LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CONGRESS-RECORD) 
(bl) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The 105th Congress, which is to wrap up its final
legislative business this week, rejoiced a year ago over a landmark
bipartisan balanced-budget agreement. It provided the biggest tax
cut since the height of the Reagan years. But the big question now
is whether the 105th will be remembered instead for something else:
the bitter, protracted preoccupation with President Clinton's
personal life and his lies about it.
</P>
<P>
   And Congress is not through yet. This Congress is not officially
adjourning but merely fading away, subject to a recall before the
end of the year to decide whether to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be a memorable Congress, but not for its string of
legislative achievements,'' said Norman Ornstein, an expert on
Congress at the American Enterprise Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Ornstein sees the 105th Congress as framed by bookends,
beginning with a House vote on reprimanding Speaker Newt Gingrich
for ethics violations, and closing with a House vote to open an
impeachment inquiry into Clinton. It was punctuated in the middle
by a coup attempt against Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tells you a great deal about the mood of this Congress
and the tone of this Congress _ difficult, partisan and
acrimonious,'' Ornstein said.
</P>
<P>
   It also explains some of the fervor for the conservative agenda
pursued, off and on, by Gingrich. It was his conservative flank
that sought to overthrow him and the conservative flank he needed
to placate.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives were so unhappy earlier this year that some of
their leaders threatened to bolt from the Republican Party. To keep
them happy, Republican leaders brought numerous conservative social
causes up for votes _ abortion, school prayer, flag-burning,
displaying the Ten Commandments on public property.
</P>
<P>
   None of those issues made it into law, nor did economic-based
matters like school vouchers and relief from the marriage tax
penalty. If they had passed the Senate, President Clinton would
have vetoed them. Conservatives were restless, and then along came
the investigation into Clinton. Many analysts suggest that the
longtime visceral hatred of Clinton by conservatives, who had
failed to achieve any significant legislative goals, was the prime
force behind the drive to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no more important moral challenge facing the country
right now than holding Clinton accountable,'' said Bill Kristol,
editor of the conservative Weekly Standard. ``It's not displacement
for conservatives to focus on that. They regard his behavior and
his lying about it and his possibly getting away with it as
embodying almost everything that is wrong with America today.''
</P>
<P>
   But a New York Times/CBS News Poll the week before last
confirmed what Republicans had suspected: that their obsession with
impeachment had hurt their standing with the public. Approval
ratings of Congress the week before last slipped to 43 percent from
a high of 56 percent in September. Most voters could not name a
single thing this Congress had done. Those who could cited
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   For those not obsessed with the Monica Lewinsky scandal, there
was some hope. After Congress voted Oct. 8 to begin an inquiry into
impeachment of a president, for only the third time in history,
lawmakers found themselves with serious unfinished business,
including how to keep the government functioning into the next
fiscal year. They had not even passed a budget blueprint to guide
their spending.
</P>
<P>
   It was Clinton who stepped in to save Congress from itself, and
perhaps save himself as well. In a remarkable 11th-hour display of
his power and his political finesse, the president changed the
national conversation from Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House the
intern with whom he had an affair, to education.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress and the White House agreed on their final budget
for the coming fiscal year, both sides reveled in the money for new
teachers. And both Democrats and Republicans quickly took this
accomplishment home to show voters for the Nov. 3 midterm
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The truth was, they had little else in hand. Both parties lost
their signature issues this year. Republicans could not produce a
tax cut. Democrats could not produce what they call a patient's
bill of rights. Neither could they raise the minimum wage, force
tobacco companies to settle or overhaul the campaign finance
system.
</P>
<P>
   Without these banners to march under, both sides were happy to
boast of hiring new teachers and to dig into the much-delayed
budget for billions of dollars worth of home-state projects to
please voters. And on the final spending bill they attached
hundreds of policy items that did not have the sweep of, say,
changing the health-care system, but responded to one constituency
or another. These include requiring federal health plans to cover
contraceptives, making it easier for high-tech companies to bring
in highly skilled foreign workers, and restricting pornography on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in the era of little initiatives,'' said Marshall
Wittmann, director of congressional relations at the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative research group. ``What we have seen is
the product of divided government. They reach a murky middle
ground, and that's what this budget deal is and it's really the
story of the 105th. But who's to complain when you have peace and
prosperity?''
</P>
<P>
   Ross Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University, saw the
same outcome. ``Did anything they did rise to the level of wide
public recognition?'' he asked. ``I think not. So much attention
was focused on things that didn't pass _ campaign finance reform,
the tobacco bill _ that the modest accomplishments tended to be
drowned out.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the 105th Congress set in motion several policy
questions that could stretch into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in three decades, Congress is ending its
session with a surplus, in part due to the balanced-budget
agreement. This offers a whole new way of thinking as it shifts
from deficit-driven restraint to fresh fields for both parties.
</P>
<P>
   The most promising legacy of the 105th, its agreement not to
spend more than it took in, was short-lived. The bounty of an
anticipated $70 billion surplus this year was too tempting for
Congress and the White House. They tried abiding by their
pre-determined spending limits, then spent more, skimming off about
$20 billion and calling them ``emergencies'' so that they did not
have to offset them with cuts elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping the politicians' hands off a surplus is like throwing
Tootsie Rolls in front of a child and saying, `Don't touch!'''
Wittmann said. ``The deficit restraint is off, the guard-rails are
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, being able to anticipate a surplus for some years poses
new challenges to the parties. The big debate will be whether to
spend it or save it, whether to shore it up to bolster Social
Security or to cut taxes or pay off the debt. The surplus achieved
in this Congress will set the debate for years to come over what
the nation can do, in peacetime, when it has the will and the
wallet.

 THE 105th CONGRESS: A LOOK BACK AT A LEGISLATIVE TERM  
(Sidebar with CONGRESS-105th) 
(bl) 
 By MONICA BORKOWSKI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following is some of the major legislation that the 105th
Congress approved or failed to approve.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHAT CONGRESS DID: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BALANCED BUDGET &LR; : Approved legislation aimed at balancing
federal budget by 2002. The legislation extracted $115 billion in
savings over five years from Medicare and slowed the growth of
discretionary spending. It included a $24 billion program to
provide health care coverage for up to five million uninsured
children, to be financed by increasing federal tax on cigarettes by
15 cents a pack over five years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TAX CUT &LR; : Approved first federal tax cut since 1981, $95
billion over five years. Bill included cuts in taxes on capital
gains and estates, new tax credits for families with children and
tax credits for higher education.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION &LR; : Cleared legislation to modernize
the FDA and speed up process for approving prescription drugs and
medical devices.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MEDICARE &LR; : In Balanced Budget Act, made vast changes in
Medicare, offering new health insurance options to elderly,
broadening coverage of preventive services and creating financial
incentives for managed care plans to serve rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHEMICAL WEAPONS TREATY &LR; : Senate approved Chemical Weapons
Convention, which bans development, production, acquisition,
stockpiling, transfer and use of chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GINGRICH REPRIMAND &LR; : House voted to reprimand Speaker Newt
Gingrich and fine him $300,000 for bringing discredit on the House
by using tax-exempt money to promote Republican goals and giving
House ethics committee untrue information for its inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PAY RAISE &LR; : Approved a 2.3 percent cost-of-living pay increase
for members of Congress, the first increase in five years, adding
more than $3,000 to base pay of $133,000.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1998 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRANSPORTATION &LR; : Approved largest public works program in
nation's history _ more than $200 billion over next six years for
roads, bridges, buses, subways and ferries in virtually every
Congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE &LR; : Passed legislation overhauling the
IRS. Law gives new rights to taxpayers who get into serious
disputes with IRS, establishes outside board to oversee IRS
management and policies, and strengthens role of taxpayer advocate,
an internal ombudsman for complaints from individuals.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HIGHER EDUCATION ACT &LR; : Approved legislation that reduces
interest rate on federal college loans to lowest level in 17 years.
Bill expands Pell grants for college students, includes money for
improved teacher training and recruitment, and allows colleges to
notify parents when students are caught in drug and alcohol
violations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PUBLIC HOUSING &LR; : Amended 1937 law that established the
framework for public housing. New legislation revamps public
housing and gives local housing officials more authority.
</P>
<P>

Fund with new restrictions on its loans to foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FARM ASSISTANCE &LR; : Agreed to include $6 billion in emergency
farm aid as part of $60 billion agriculture spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TAX CUT &LR; : Approved $9.2 billion in tax cuts over 10 years.
Package renews several expiring business tax credits and provides
limited relief to farmers, self-employed people and some families.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATO EXPANSION &LR; : Senate voted to expand NATO to include Poland,
Hungary and Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IMPEACHMENT &LR; : House voted to begin full-scale, open-ended

<P>
   &UR; WHAT CONGRESS DIDN'T DO: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TOBACCO &LR; : Senate failed to cut off Republican filibuster of
legislation to regulate tobacco products. Bill would have raised
price of cigarettes $1.10 a pack over five years, cost tobacco
companies $516 billion over 25 years, given government new
authority to regulate tobacco advertising, and imposed penalties if
smoking by teen-agers did not decline.
</P>

that opponents call partial-birth abortion. House voted to override
veto, 296 to 132.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FAST-TRACK AUTHORITY &LR; : House failed to renew negotiating
authority that would allow President to negotiate trade agreements
that Congress could accept or reject but not amend.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EDUCATION SAVINGS ACCOUNTS &LR; : Passed legislation expanding a
program that would allow contributions of up to $2,000 a year to
special savings accounts for students in elementary and secondary
schools. Money would have to be used for expenses like tutoring,
computers and school tuition. President vetoed the bill on the
ground that it weakened public education.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAMPAIGN FINANCE &LR; : House approved bill that would ban
unlimited, unregulated donations to political parties and curb
issue-advocacy commercials by outside groups in the 60 days before
an election. Senate failed to break a Republican filibuster on
similar bill.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BANKRUPTCY &LR; : House passed bill to overhaul bankruptcy system
and make it more difficult for consumers to walk away from debts.
Bill died after Senate Democrats opposed it and White House
threatened a veto.

ACTING FOR U.S., SAUDIS ASKED TALIBAN TO DEPORT BIN LADEN  
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER and JAMES RISEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Urged on by the Clinton administration, Saudi
Arabia's top intelligence official met privately with the leader of
the Taliban in late September to try to persuade Afghanistan to
deport Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile suspected of masterminding
the August bombings of two American embassies in East Africa,
according to U.S. and Arab officials.
</P>
<P>
   Just weeks after the United States launched a cruise-missile
strike against bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan,
Prince Turki bin Faisal, chief of Saudi intelligence, sat down with
Mullah Mohammed Omar, leader of the Taliban's Supreme Council, and
asked him to end his protection for bin Laden and hand him over,
Arab officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, the Islamic movement that controls most of
Afghanistan, refused. Their recalcitrance in the face of Turki's
personal request finally prompted Saudi Arabia, one of the
Taliban's most important financial sponsors and allies, to
downgrade its diplomatic ties with the group.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say they are supporting diplomatic efforts to
persuade the Taliban to deport bin Laden. ``Achieving the expulsion
of bin Laden and bringing him to justice is something we are
actively pursuing,'' said a State Department official.
</P>
<P>
   In their effort to persuade Afghanistan to deport bin Laden,
State Department officials also have spoken to Taliban
representatives themselves and have sought the intercession of
Pakistan, the only other major ally of Afghanistan in the region.
</P>
<P>
   They have also, said an Arab official, talked to members of bin
Laden's family in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   If Afghanistan does turn over bin Laden to Saudi Arabia, it is
possible that bin Laden might be tried there, rather than in the
United States. If he were to be handed over to the Saudis and
brought back to Saudi Arabia, one Arab official said, he could face
swift execution.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they want him to face trial in the
United States. They say they asked the Saudis to urge the Taliban
only to deport bin Laden. Senior U.S. officials said they were not
negotiating with the Taliban, but simply repeating the message that
they should get rid of bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've certainly urged, in public and private, all those who
have influence with the Taliban, that it is our strong view bin
Laden should be expelled and brought to justice,'' a White House
spokesman said. ``We will certainly continue our multi-pronged
strategy of combating bin Laden's network.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said the new diplomatic effort
did not preclude further military action against bin Laden and his
terrorist network. Officials said the Aug. 20 cruise missile attack
was intended to break up the network and perhaps kill bin Laden.
Since then, the FBI and other law-enforcement and intelligence
agencies say they are continuing to work with other nations to
arrest as many of bin Laden's operatives as possible. Bin Laden
already faces criminal charges in the United States under a sealed
indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Pressing the Taliban is part of a broad effort to damage the bin
Laden network, officials say. ``Our tactics may have changed, but
our strategy of putting him out of action remains the same,'' said
a senior American official. ``This is another way of trying to deal
with the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics outside of government say it also suggests
ambivalence among administration officials over how best to deal
with the radical Islamic group that now controls most of
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a gap between our interests in Afghanistan and
the level of our attention to the need for a strategy,'' said
Zalmay Khalilzad, an Afghan expert at Rand Corp. ``A rogue state
could emerge there, so we either need to pay attention now, or
later.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi role in trying to extricate bin Laden from Afghanistan
has been a murky one, complicated by Islamic politics and the
longstanding alliance between the Saudis and the Taliban. But the
Saudi request to the Taliban for bin Laden represents a significant
shift.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the Saudis had made it clear that they did not want
bin Laden brought back to Saudi Arabia, for fear that he could be a
martyr figure to Saudi dissidents. More broadly, U.S. officials say
they have been frustrated by the Saudis' refusal to cooperate fully
on terrorism investigations in the past, especially in the case of
the 1996 bombing of the American military barracks at Khobar Towers
in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   But now, what administration officials say is the clear evidence
of his involvement in the East African bombings, as well as a
growing belief among Saudi officials that bin Laden poses a threat
to their government, seems to have prompted a change in their
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   And, while he is not currently under indictment for any crimes
in Saudi Arabia, Arab and U.S officials now say they have evidence
linking him to the 1995 car bombing of a military facility in
Riyadh in which American servicemen were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, who was stripped of his Saudi citizenship in 1994,
would face ``swift'' action if he were brought back to Saudi
Arabia, said one Arab official.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even bin Laden's wealthy Saudi family is cooperating with
the United States and Saudi Arabia on how to bring him to heel, the
Arab official said. The bin Laden family made a fortune in the
construction industry. ``U.S. officials, after Saudi Arabia blessed
it, have talked to members of the bin Laden family,'' the Arab
official said.
</P>
<P>
   After Taliban officials repeatedly said they would consider
turning over bin Laden if they were presented with evidence against
him, Arab officials familiar with the matter say that Prince Turki
presented evidence to the Taliban of bin Laden's involvement in
terrorism, but it made no difference. Evidence was also presented
by Bill Richardson, former chief delegate to the United Nations,
when he visited Afghanistan earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton administration officials, fearing that his return to
Saudi Arabia could lead to trouble for the Saudi regime, stress
they do not want the Saudis to have bin Laden brought back to their
country. And they note that the United States does not have an
extradition treaty with Saudi Arabia. The Clinton administration is
still determined to have bin Laden put on trial in the United
States, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a policy on whether we would accept bin Laden
being brought to justice in a third country, we haven't crossed
that bridge yet,'' one administration official said. ``But Saudi
Arabia would not be the place where we would want him to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, the Taliban's ambassador designate to the
United Nations, confirmed in an interview that his government's
discussions with Turki over bin Laden had been ``disappointing,''
but argued that Afghanistan's unwillingness to oust its ``guest''
would not damage long-term relations between Afghanistan and Saudi
Arabia. He added that his government would be willing to try bin
Laden in Islamic court in Afghanistan if there was ``solid''
evidence against him.

VOTES ARE LURE AS SAN ANTONIO ANGLES FOR REPUBLICAN CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Pa., N.M., N.Y.)  (jt) 
 By RICK LYMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ If the Republican National Committee's site
selection team picks San Antonio for the party's presidential
nominating convention in 2000, as the backers of the city's drive
predict, the nation will be treated to a love fest of diversity
aimed at drawing Hispanic-Americans into the Republican tent,
backers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``What San Antonio offers, mainly, is the sole political reason
for choosing any city to host the convention, a reason that no
other city has, to extend the hand of the Republican Party to the
Hispanic people of America,'' said Tom Loeffler, a lobbyist and
former San Antonio area congressman who is co-chairman of the local
host committee.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-member site selection committee finished its last visit
to San Antonio Friday, indeed its last visit to any of the five
cities that are finalists for the convention, after three days of
private meetings with local officials, inspections of 150 area
hotels and a thorough scouring of the downtown Alamodome, which
would be the convention site.
</P>
<P>
   The members will return to their homes to work for Republican
candidates in the November elections, then reconvene later in the
month or early in December to decide. Jan Larimer, the Wyoming
Republican who is head of the committee, said the group would
submit its decision to the Republican National Committee in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities in the running are Indianapolis, New Orleans, New
York and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely confident that the decision will be in favor
of San Antonio,'' said Red McCombs, the wealthy San Antonio car
dealer and owner of the Minnesota Vikings who is co-chairman of the
local host committee. ``I just base it on common sense. This is a
place known for freedom and free enterprise. That's what Texas is,
that was the only reason for Texas to exist.''
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio, with nearly one million people, is the largest city
in the United States to have a majority Hispanic population. It was
the runner-up for the Republican convention in 1996, but
insufficient hotel space and other factors nudged the Republicans
toward San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in much better shape today to host the Republican
National Convention than we were in 1996,'' said Nelson Wolff, a
former San Antonio mayor and member of the host committee. ``Plus,
we have the best political argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing Hispanic people into the party has been a dominant theme
in Texas Republican politics recently, and is one of the central
thrusts of Gov. George Bush's re-election campaign. Bush
strategists say they are aiming for 40 percent of the state's
Hispanic vote in November, which would be more than any other
Republican candidate for statewide office has ever received in
Texas. Bush received 25 percent of the Hispanic vote when first
elected governor in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio has also drawn the support of some leading Hispanic
Republicans, including former Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr.
from neighboring New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for wanting Hispanic people in the party are clear,
Loeffler said. By 2004, party strategists say Hispanic voters will
be numerous enough to make the difference in presidential
elections, and the Hispanic population is increasing fastest in
Texas, California and Florida, among the nation's most populous and
fastest-growing states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither party has extended the hand to Hispanics in the past
with utmost sincerity and follow-up,'' Loeffler said. ``Now, it's
time to reach out and perform. And merely having the convention in
San Antonio is a strong symbol of our outstretched hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Loeffler and many Republican strategists say there is a ripe
opportunity for the party to attract Hispanic voters because, they
say, the Democratic Party has not been attentive enough to the
voting bloc, which has been growing more prosperous and more
attuned to conservative political themes.
</P>
<P>
   Loeffler said: ``Values of family, church, the work ethic,
taking care of yourself instead of being taken care of, a very
strong patriotic feeling, those are the values of most
Hispanic-Americans, and the Republican Party is the party that
reflects those values. I am totally convinced that we are a city
which is in the correct place at the proper moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the four other finalist cities have their own
arguments to make. Having the convention in New York, with its
Republican mayor and Republican governor, would highlight the
party's inroads in Democratic strongholds. A Philadelphia setting
would offer the obvious Liberty Bell and Independence Hall
backdrops. New Orleans was already the site of a Republican
convention, in 1988. And Indianapolis, which many say is San
Antonio's strongest competitor, offers a solid, middle American
backdrop to talk about family values and a successful history of
privatization.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Larimer said the selection would not follow politics alone.
Convention sites, accommodations, transportation and the city's
financial package would weigh just as heavily, she said.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some suspicion, particularly in the Texas press,
that the move to have the convention in San Antonio is a means of
providing a cozy launching for the potential presidential campaign
of Bush, the current Republican front-runner in national polls.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, Ms. Larimer said. ``We have a lot of candidates for the
year 2000, and we don't know who the candidate will be,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The site selection process began at the Republican National
Committee's meeting in January, when the committee's members were
chosen. Bids were solicited from 25 cities that had been hosts of
previous conventions or had expressed interest in the 2000 event,
said Timothy Fitzpatrick, deputy press secretary for the party's
national committee.
</P>
<P>
   Nine cities submitted bids in April. Los Angeles later withdrew
its bid, and a first round of visits to the remaining eight cities
was held in June and early July, after which Minneapolis,
Charlotte, N.C., and Chicago were dropped. The committee has been
making second, more nuts-and-bolts visits to the five finalists
over the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   McCombs, who shares the view that a San Antonio convention would
help attract Hispanic voters to the party, said he had worked hard
and spent more than $100,000 of his own money on the effort for
another reason. ``In San Antonio, we still have an image problem,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite playing host to a world's fair in 1968, re-energizing
its downtown with the hugely popular Riverwalk development and
being the site of high-profile events like the National Collegiate
Athletic Association's Final Four basketball championship, the
ninth largest city in the United States is still strangely unknown
around the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think an event like this is as important to a Houston
or a New York as it is to a city like San Antonio,'' McCombs said.
``It's about jobs. Jobs, jobs, jobs. We need to focus attention on
the city around the whole world and convince companies to relocate
here or to expand. That's what an event like this can do.''

   SOUTH NORWALK, Conn. _ Laughter rippled from one railroad car to
the next, followed by waves of applause. These are sounds not
normally associated with the early morning commute. But this was
the 7:44 from New Haven to New York's Grand Central Terminal,
Travis Ford's train.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is the convivial conductor who dishes up weather reports,
baseball scores, inspirational pep talks and greetings in a dozen
languages to Metro-North passengers on the New Haven line. To
connoisseurs of commuting, Ford is a folk hero, a font of
graciousness in their otherwise rough-and-tumble day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes everybody smile,'' said Mike Imber, a consultant from
Westport. ``He gives passengers something in common. It's
refreshing to see somebody who has such a joy for what he does.''
</P>
<P>
   True to his word, Imber had made friends that very morning with
Michele Ross, Tom Root and Rolan Young, his seatmates in car No.
8554. Grumpy strangers when they boarded the train _ each bent over
laptop, cell phone, newspaper or sales report _ they were pals by
the time the train thundered into the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they heard Ford's five-day forecast (mostly sunny and
breezy with temperatures in the mid-60s), his predictions for the
World Series (Yankees in seven) and his buoyant charge to have a
good day. ``Sock it to them! Take no prisoners! Storm the fort!''
Ford urged, varying his command from car to car.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but step off this train with a spring in your
step,'' said Ms. Young, a lawyer. She began the ride convinced that
she would find Ford's jollity unbearable. But by the time the train
got to South Norwalk, she was a convert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder what coffee he drinks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford didn't miss a beat. ``Chock Full o' Nuts,'' he said, to the
roar of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   For regulars on this train, and on the 5:03 p.m. from Grand
Central, this month brings sad news. Next Sunday, with the end of
daylight saving time and the attendant changes in the schedule,
Ford will no longer be their conductor. Instead, his commuter runs
will be the 6:36 a.m. from New Haven and the 3:35 p.m. return.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could change commuting patterns,'' said Imber, as if
predicting movement in the Dow Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Many commuters have already endured the disappearance of Ford
from their route. Naima Quarles, for one, used to see him on the
8:19 from Pelham and said he ``took the edge off'' her morning.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Ms. Quarles found herself on a midday train, immersed
in a well-worn copy of The Daily Bible. Suddenly, Ford bounded into
the car. ``Ticket time!'' he cried. ``I'll take any kind of ticket
but a parking ticket.'' Ms. Quarles glowed.
</P>
<P>
   On the same train, Gilbert Ramirez hugged the conductor.
Ramirez, a commuter on a run that used to be Ford's, found himself
in New Rochelle for an appointment. He let one train go by and
waited for the next because he had heard that Ford might be on it.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, a New Haven native, worked in the maintenance department
of Metro-North for more than a decade before becoming a conductor a
dozen years ago. The pay was better, he said, but most of all he
loved the contact with customers.
</P>
<P>
   Word of his extemporaneous banter spread, and soon he was
profiled in a Connecticut magazine and interviewed on a late-night
talk show. Passengers with high-powered jobs tried to lure him into
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, approaching retirement, would rather have a shot
forecasting the weather for a local television station. ``I don't
want to take anybody's job,'' he said. ``But maybe I could sub for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a man who takes pleasure in a kind gesture. He poses for
snapshots with passengers. He compliments them on a pretty dress.
He scavenges New York City tabloids off the floor at Grand Central
and takes them to a Stamford ticket clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's morning passengers were plotting the other day how to
reward him with a World Series ticket. What if they each chipped in
$2? What if they wrote to George Steinbrenner? ``He has plenty of
tickets up in his sky box,'' Ms. Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   George? Are you listening?

   JEZERSKA MOUNTAINS, Yugoslavia _ As the arrival of significant
numbers of international monitors appeared weeks away, and the
withdrawal of Serbian forces remained very unclear, the tensions of
embattled Kosovo province seemed to be heading on Saturday for the
deep freeze of winter _ ready to reopen in spring.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomatic monitors here said they were unable to
confirm whether Serbian forces had actually left Kosovo on Friday.
There was still considerable skepticism about the potential
effectiveness of 2,000 unarmed monitors who are supposed to go to
the southern Serbian province under an agreement between the
Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic and the U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke to help with arms inspection and _ perhaps, eventually _
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees, who were uprooted from
their homes by Serbian tank and artillery offensives that ended two
weeks ago, remained outdoors. About 150,000 others were doubled up
in homes, schools and other makeshift shelters, according to
officials from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Fro the top of a dew-covered hill just steps from his plastic
tent, Florim Kadriaj peered down Saturday into Krusica, a village
that has been home to his ethnic-Albanian family for generations.
Some of his neighbors among the birch trees in the hills here,
worried by the cold and damp, have pulled up their shelters and
gone back to homes badly damaged during an assault by Serbian
forces three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Kadriaj, 21, whose 30-member extended family includes a
sister-in-law, Shukrije, who is eight months pregnant, says he
cannot take the risk. Their two-story home is on what he calls the
front line: within shooting range of a posse of Serbian police.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs have to move from Movljane for us to go back,''
Kadriaj said Saturday morning as women in the family washed their
hair in water from the creek and others prepared a fire for
cooking. ``If I'm alone I can run, but if it's 30 of us being
captured in the same house, it's different.'' The Kadriajs are
among refugees who remain trapped in the woods of Kosovo by Serbian
forces and, in some instances, by the Kosovo Liberation Army, the
rebels who are fighting for independence for the province's ethnic
Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the U.N. agency say the overall number of
refugees in the hills of Kosovo is steadily dwindling as autumn
nights get colder and the ground remains consistently damp.
</P>
<P>
   At Kisna Reka, northwest of here, a much larger group of 2,000
refugees remains outdoors, caught between a company of Yugoslav
Army soldiers on one ridge and armed men of the separatist
guerrillas who frequent the camp, an official of the U.N. refugee
agency, Margaret O'Keefe, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the original deadline set in the agreement between
Milosevic and Holbrooke, Yugoslav Army soldiers and the Serbian
police who were sent to Kosovo last March to fight the guerrillas
were to have already withdrawn. A new deadline, set Friday by NATO,
gives Milosevic until Oct. 27. On Friday there were signs that some
forces had withdrawn, U.S. officials said. But they said they could
not be specific about numbers, or kinds of troops.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A media center run by the Serbian government in Pristina, the
capital of Kosovo, alerted television crews late Friday afternoon
that a convoy of Serbian troops was pulling out from Stimlje, about
15 miles south of the capital. A television crew followed the
convoy of about 145 vehicles _ trucks, tanks and armored personnel
carriers _ but did so only until Pristina, leaving it unclear
whether the equipment had actually left the province.
</P>
<P>
   According to one estimate, each of the 2,000 monitors supposed
to come to Kosovo would cost about $100,000, making a total bill of
$200 million for the salaries, housing and logistics of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the skepticism about the new monitoring force is based
on the fact that 120 former military officers and diplomats were
supposed to join a team of diplomatic monitors in Kosovo in July.
The team never got beyond 50 members.
</P>
<P>
   At best, a Western diplomat in Belgrade says, about 500 or 600
monitors, who are being recruited by the 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, would appear in Kosovo in the
next two or three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   By then, colder weather will have begun to settle in and both
sides in the conflict will have hunkered down to await the spring,
when hostilities are expected to resume, diplomats said. And by
November, it will be too late for any large-scale reconstruction of
destroyed homes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Keefe, of the U.N. refugee agency, said that, according to
a very rough estimate, 150,000 ethnic-Albanian refugees remain
camped out in temporary shelter, 50,000 have returned to their
homes in recent weeks and another 50,000, who had fled across the
borders to Montenegro and Albania, are staying there.
</P>
<P>
   There is no large-scale return of people displaced by fighting
and no visible rebuilding of homes and farmhouses.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of villages remain destroyed and abandoned, the only
sign of life being livestock searching for feed.
</P>
<P>
   A partial survey, recently completed by diplomatic monitors
driving along main roads, included estimates that 16,000 houses had
been heavily damaged during the recent Serbian offensive.
</P>
<P>
   A proposal by the Serbian government to provide building
materials for reconstruction _ and at one point encouraged by the
Clinton administration _ never came to fruition. Even if it had,
Western diplomats said, refugee families whose homes had just been
blown away by Serbian forces were highly unlikely to accept
construction materials from the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   A well-to-do ethnic Albanian entrepreneur, Salih Bega, 35, who
owns a sawmill in Petrova that was totally burned by Serbian
forces, said he would not consider rebuilding his home or business
even though he had the financial wherewithal to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid to rebuild,'' said Bega, as he showed a visitor
burned transformers, buildings and the black ashes of valuable wood
logs that he had imported from the neighboring republic of
Montenegro, Serbia's lone remaining partner in Yugoslavia. His
business, known as Graniti, was burned by Serbian forces in August
and again in September. ``If I order five trucks to come from
Montenegro to deliver wood, the Serbs could come and burn it all
over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, Bega's business should be flourishing _ if
refugees were returning to their homes to rebuild. But, he said,
``People don't have bread to eat and I have to sell, not give, them
wood.''
</P>
<P>
   Up in the hills above Petrova, Kadriaj expressed similar
bewilderment about the situation even as the international
community has announced air surveillance of Serbian forces,
increased material help and the dispatch of monitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``These observers can come around only during the day. The Serbs
shoot at night too,'' he said. ``The police can come and kill me.
How can the monitors help with that?''
</P>
<P>
   The outsiders might help reduce immediate tensions. ``But
nothing will change in relations between Serbs and Albanians,'' he
said, suggesting that the battle between the two groups will rage
on beyond this winter.

ENDLESS RUMORS SWIRL AROUND GADHAFI 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRIPOLI, Libya _ If every rumor swirling around this seaport
capital is true, someone tries to assassinate the Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi _ oh, about every couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rumors, diplomats guess, must be fanciful, spun
either from the wishful thinking of those who would dearly love to
see an end to Gadhafi's 29-year reign or from the equally dark
designs of security forces adept in the art of disinformation.
</P>
<P>
   Real information in Libya is so scarce a commodity that the only
generally accepted truth about most internal security matters is
that no one really knows.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a recent barrage of claims and counterclaims about who
might have done what, and when, to a leader who is now hobbling on
crutches has included so fulsome a dose of the unusual that _ even
in a country with a reputation for the bizarre _ people are trying
hard to piece together just what might be going on.
</P>
<P>
   A tangle of clues includes a postponed trip, a broken leg,
reports of a roadside ambush, and the untimely death of a
provincial governor. But, as with videotape broadcast here last
month that purportedly shows a 1996 assassination attempt by a
British agent, no one is quite sure what, if anything, it adds up
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something seems to have happened this summer, but a lot of
fantasy has been mixed up with fact,'' a senior Western diplomat
here said with about as much authority as it is possible for any
foreign observer here to muster.
</P>
<P>
   The latest speculation about Gadhafi, ignited by travelers'
assertions in early June, was further fueled in late August when
the Libyan leader looked weak and wan and sat in a wheelchair in a
satellite television interview with CNN. Gadhafi explained in the
interview that he had broken his thigh in a sporting accident.
</P>
<P>
   But among Libya watchers, particularly those abroad, his
unhealthy appearance has revived unanswered questions about what
might have happened earlier in the summer, when a planned overland
trip to Egypt was abruptly canceled on the day he was to have
arrived, and when news agencies quoted travelers from Libya as
saying that his convoy had come under attack near the eastern
Libyan town of Benghazi.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Gadhafi, who led a military coup in 1969, is not
even Libya's head of state; he is known simply as the leader of the
revolution. But in practice, the 56-year-old colonel and a tight
circle of advisers continue to rule Libya with a heavy hand. And
because he has never designated a successor, and is regarded as a
pariah by the United States and Britain, real and reported accounts
of attempts to overthrow him have been watched in the West for
years with particular acuity.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews here, nearly a dozen Arab and Western diplomats
who have paid close attention to the case scoffed at the idea that
there was any connection between any injury to Gadhafi and whatever
might have happened this June. For a start, they said, Gadhafi
appeared in public in Tripoli several days after the reported
assassination attempt, in what seemed a deliberate attempt to
discount the rumors that he had been attacked.
</P>
<P>
   In one television appearance, he wore a short-sleeve shirt and
even pointed defiantly to his left arm, openly mocking those who
had been saying that it had been badly wounded in the supposed
attack on his motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   But on other questions, the diplomats, who under rules imposed
by their governments would speak only on condition of anonymity,
expressed sharply differing views. Some said they were all but
certain that some kind of attack had taken place; others said they
were all but certain that it had not.
</P>
<P>
   All said there was little doubt that Gadhafi had not incurred
any injury to his leg until about a month later, in early July,
when he unexpectedly was carried out on a stretcher to meet with a
visiting delegation.
</P>
<P>
   But most also discounted the story that he had been injured
while exercising; some suggested that there might have been another
assassination attempt, while most said they believed that the truth
had been far more mundane: that he had broken his thigh during a
slip in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a country in which the only official source of
information is the state-controlled news outlets, all acknowledged
that much remained unanswered about reported events this summer,
including the death of the governor of Benghazi, who by some
accounts was among those who tried to assassinate Gadhafi in June
and by others was one of those wounded in that reported attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks after the reported assassination, the governor was
reported in official Libyan newspapers to have been killed after
being struck in the forehead by a horse.
</P>
<P>
   Among other unresolved mysteries has been why Gadhafi abruptly
canceled his trip to Egypt scheduled for June 4. Explained by
Libyan officials as deference to President Hosni Mubarak's busy
schedule, the decision was greeted in Egypt with enough surprise
that Mubarak was reported on the same day to have telephoned
Gadhafi to inquire about his health.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that Gadhafi faces internal challenges is not new. One
biographer, George Tremlett, has written that there have been
dozens of coup attempts, and some of them, including a 1993 attempt
by soldiers from the Warfalla tribe, have resulted in publicly
announced executions.
</P>
<P>
   Among other clear indications of opposition to his rule, Western
diplomats and reports by the U.S. government have noted intensive
clashes in 1995 between Libyan security forces and members of
Islamic groups in eastern Libya, a 1996 prison riot that left
hundreds of people dead and a 1996 clash at a soccer stadium in
which a dispute over a referee's call against a team owned by one
of Gadafi's sons set off a riot in which people chanted
anti-Gadhafi slogans. In that latter incident, even official Libyan
news outlets reported that nine people had been killed and 30
injured. Other accounts, given credence in a recent State
Department report, have put the number of deaths as high as 50.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As for reports of actual assaults against Gadhafi, Arab and
Western diplomats in Tripoli say that many have been concocted by
the Libyan security services and then spread as a way of testing
public loyalty. But some who said they had begun to wonder whether
everything had been fabricated said they had been given pause by a
wrinkle that emerged last month, when a Libyan television broadcast
appeared to substantiate rumors that an assassination attempt
against Gadhafi had been made in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The images, broadcast by the London-based Arab satellite
television channel ANN during a live interview with Gadhafi from
Tripoli, showed the Libyan leader being greeted by crowds at a
people's rally in Wadi Achatt, in the southern province of Fezzan,
when a man threw what Gadhafi said was a hand grenade at him from
less than three yards away.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the grenade did not explode, but the images did
not show the grenade, nor did they show any indication of panic by
either Gadhafi or his bodyguards. But the broadcast quoted Gadhafi
as saying that the pictures substantiated recent assertions by a
former British intelligence officer, David Shayler, that the
British government had been aware of and had supported an attempt
to kill the Libyan leader that year.
</P>
<P>
   The British government has denied Shayler's accusations, and he
has been detained by the French police since early August at the
request of the British authorities. He is awaiting a ruling by a
Paris court, scheduled for Oct. 21, as to whether he should be
extradited to Britain to face charges under the Official Secrets
Act.
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case in Libya, though, the accounts conflict,
adding to the element of mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Shayler told the BBC that the attempt involved the planting of a
bomb under Gadhafi's motorcade in February 1996. He said the
attempt was carried out by Muslim extremists who put the bomb under
the wrong car, killing several bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   But not only is that scenario different from the one shown on
Libyan television, so is the apparent timing of the incidents,
Tripoli-based diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   They say that the incident shown on Libyan television appeared
to have taken place during an appearance by Gadhafi before a
people's rally in Wadi Achatt during the summer of 1996, several
months after the incident described by Shayler.

<P>
   University presidents still do not come close to basketball
players or venture capitalists when it comes to earnings, but a
growing number have compensation packages in the half-million
dollar range once thought of as the preserve of corporate
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Three university presidents _ at Rockefeller University,
Vanderbilt and the University of Pennsylvania _ received pay and
benefit packages greater than $500,000 in the 1996-97 school year,
according to a study by The Chronicle of Higher Education in this
week's issue.
</P>
<P>
   Ten more universities, including four in the New York area _
Columbia, New York University, Yale and Hofstra _ paid their
presidents between $400,000 and $500,000, and 33 more paid between
$300,000 and $400,000, The Chronicle said, making it the ``most
gilded'' year since it started reporting executive pay six years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-six top executives at private universities were paid more
than $300,000 in 1996-97, up from 38 the previous academic year.
</P>
<P>
   Other universities in the New York region whose total
presidential compensation exceeded $300,000 in 1996-97 included
Long Island University and Dowling College on Long Island,
Princeton University, and Ithaca College.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is striking how many are earning at that level,'' said
Scott Jaschik, the Chronicle's managing editor. ``It's been going
up even though a few of the biggies are gone,'' he added, referring
to Peter Diamandopoulos, the former president of Adelphi
University, and John Silber, the former president of Boston
University, whose compensation packages of more than $500,000 made
them the previous kings of the Chronicle's compensation survey and
the targets of faculty anger.
</P>
<P>
   It was the disclosure of Diamandopoulos' rich compensation _ in
1995-96 he received $523,636 in salary and deferred bonuses _ that
helped set in motion the New York State Board of Regents
investigation that removed him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential salaries have generally increased faster than
faculty salaries. Although some faculty members, particularly in
areas like business and medicine, have six-figure salaries, the
average salary and compensation for a full-time faculty member at a
private institution in 1996-97 was $74,132, according to the
American Association of University Professors.
</P>
<P>
   In general, university officials defended the pay packages,
citing the demands of the university president's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these people run $2 billion operations with 15,000
employees, that are really major corporations, though they are
nonprofit,'' said Morton Schapiro, an economist who studies higher
education and is a dean at the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Many officials also pointed to the signs of robust health of
their institutions _ rising student applications, hefty
fund-raising, strong research and successful faculty recruitment _
as signs of their chief executives' prowess.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Furlaud, the former chairman of the board of trustees at
Rockefeller University, said the university had been in ``bad
shape'' when it asked Dr. Torsten Wiesel, a Nobel laureate and
chairman of its faculty, to take over when David Baltimore resigned
as president in 1991. ``We were running a substantial deficit and
had a lot of problems,'' he said. ``He did so rather reluctantly,''
Furlaud added, ``but he did an absolutely spectacular job.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Rockefeller's board could not persuade Wiesel to accept
a raise during most of his tenure, Furlaud said, it finally pushed
him into taking a $50,000 raise (to $350,000) and a $133,333 bonus.
With other benefits, that raised his total compensation to
$546,966, making him No. 1 on the Chronicle's list. Dr. Wiesel
steps down as president next month.
</P>
<P>
   John Hall, chairman of the Vanderbilt board, told The Chronicle
that the university's reputation and endowment had bloomed under
Joe Wyatt's chancellorship. His $525,496 in compensation put him
second in the Chronicle survey.
</P>
<P>
   And P. Roy Vagelos, the chairman of the University of
Pennsylvania's trustees, said Judith Rodin, Penn's president, was
``one of the top five'' presidents in the country and had fully
earned her compensation, the Chronicle said. Her $514,878
compensation placed her third on the Chronicle list.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Lipton, chairman of the trustees at New York University,
said that Dr. L. Jay Oliva, NYU's president, was ``a principal
architect'' of the university's transformation from a ``regional
university to a prestigious national research institution.'' Oliva
received a salary of $428,469 and $23,174 in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is convinced that the high level of pay is
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Saul Cohen, a member of the New York Board of Regents and a
former president of Queens College, said he thought such salaries
were ``out of line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that a university president should have salaries
comparable to those in industry is fallacious,'' he said. ``What it
is reflecting is the professionalization of the university
presidency, which I think is inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tom Ingram, president of the Association of Governing Boards
of Universities and Colleges, said, ``There are top corporate
executives who compare what they do with their university
presidents and say they wouldn't trade jobs for a minute,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle said that only two presidents of private research
universities _ Norman Lamm of Yeshiva University and H. Patrick
Swygert of Howard University _ had total earnings of less than
$200,000 in the 1996-97 year.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle's survey of 475 private colleges and universities,
which was based on filings with the Internal Revenue Service, did
not include public universities, where pay is substantially lower
and where about 80 percent of all college students are enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   At the State University of New York, for example, which has 64
campuses and about 400,000 students, the chancellor's salary is
$250,000. At the City University of New York, with 200,000
students, the chancellor's salary is $178,523.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram, of the Association of Governing Boards, said he believed
that the leaders of most public universities were
``under-appreciated and under-compensated.''

REINER, HESTON, HUFFINGTON: UNLIKELY ALLIES ON CIGARETTE TAX 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DON TERRY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A lifelong Democrat, film director Rob Reiner does
not have a lot in common politically with people like millionaire
Michael Huffington, a Republican, or actor Charlton Heston, a
conservative icon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't agree on much, that's true,'' Reiner said the other
day in his office at The Culver Studios near here. ``But the one
thing we do agree on is helping young children.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The three men have put aside their differences to battle the
tobacco industry over a ballot initiative that would add 50 cents
in new taxes to the price of a pack of cigarettes, and use the
money to finance programs in early childhood development and
prenatal care. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For months, the men have been making appearances across the
state and, in recent days, radio and television commercials in
support of the initiative. If passed, it will rocket California to
No. 3 from No. 22 among states with the highest cigarette taxes in
the country, behind only Alaska and Hawaii. Currently the cigarette
tax is 37 cents a pack in California. The initiative would raise
the price by about 20 percent, to $3.05 a pack from $2.55. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some experts on smoking say that the additional tax will
discourage thousands of teen-agers from ever lighting up and will
encourage thousands more, including many adults, to quit. The tax
is also expected to generate an estimated $700 million to $750
million annually in revenue, which will be earmarked for early
childhood development, prenatal care and antismoking programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's an opportunity to make a major investment in young
children and to get kids to stop smoking,'' Reiner said, leaning
forward in his chair and waving his hands in the air like the
liberal and excitable son-in-law character that he played for years
on the ``All in the Family'' television show. ``How can anyone
oppose it?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is, with money. Lots and lots of money.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry has poured millions of dollars into the
fight against Proposition 10, also known as the ``Reiner
Initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers estimate that the tobacco industry might spend as
much $20 million, mostly for television advertisements attacking
the initiative as an unfair tax and as too bureaucratic. But Matt
Taggart, the spokesman for the ``No on 10'' campaign, which is
heavily financed by the tobacco industry, would not comment on the
exact amount. ``It's a significant media buy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reiner said his group would spend about $5 million for
television and radio advertisements, using the familiar faces and
voices of Heston, actor Martin Sheen and former Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Although the proposition has been ahead in the polls for weeks,
its support among respondents fell to 48 percent this month, from
56 percent in August, said Mark DiCamillo, director of the Field
Poll. The percentage of those opposed has not changed much, holding
at about 33 percent. More significantly, perhaps, the percentage of
voters in the undecided column has increased to 19 percent from 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burden is on the `yes' side to make the sale,'' DiCamillo
said. ``All the `no' side has to do is raise doubts.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters have 15 pages of endorsements from health groups,
labor unions and elected officials like the Democratic mayor of San
Francisco, Willie Brown, and the Republican mayor of Los Angeles,
Richard Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent editorial, The Los Angeles Times called the
initiative ``a gamble California can't afford not to take.'' The
editorial said: ``While Proposition 10 is far from perfect, it's
also a bold, worthwhile experiment _ an attempt to solve a genuine
social problem arriving at just the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the initiative say that they also support early
childhood development programs but that the increase is a
regressive tax that will fall hardest on the poor and on members of
minority groups. It is the argument that the tobacco industry used
in its campaign against a proposed national tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, The San Diego Union-Tribune blasted the measure in an
editorial: ``Proposition 10 is a ballot box taxation at its most
insidious.''
</P>
<P>
   The opponents also say that most of the money will not go to
programs directly related to the effects of smoking, and therefore
smokers should not have to foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that patriotism was the last refuge of
scoundrels,'' said Bill Campbell, a former Republican state senator
who opposes the initiative. ``Now children have become the last
refuge. Everybody ostensibly wants to do something to help
children.''
</P>
<P>
   But what Reiner and his allies are really doing, Campbell said,
is using a lofty goal that everyone supports to attack the tobacco
industry ``because it's easy pickings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People think that the tobacco companies are evil, therefore
the people who smoke are evil and they ought to be taxed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the proposition is poorly written, provides little
accountability and will create new layers of bureaucracy eager to
control the $700 million in new revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The proposition calls for the creation of a state commission and
58 county commissions to oversee and distribute the money. Money
will be divided among the counties based on the number of births a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Huffington, recruited to the Proposition 10 campaign by Reiner,
has been traveling to more conservative areas of the state to talk
about the merits of the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Although Huffington got involved in the campaign last February,
his commitment to the effort intensified a few weeks ago when he
learned that doctors had told his mother she had lung cancer. His
mother started smoking when she was a teen-ager and had smoked as
many as three packs a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of her lung was removed a couple of weeks ago,''
Huffington said. ``We're not sure we got it all.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Serbs shell small village soon after extends NATO deadline
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Bert Roughton Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VRAGOBIL, Yugoslavia _ On Friday as NATO extended its deadline
for Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic to comply with a
U.S.-brokered peace agreement, this small hill village was shelled
through the night, terrifying residents and damaging dozens of
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces in the area also did not appear to be making any
attempts to withdraw, even though Milosevic has agreed to reduce
the Serb military presence in Kosovo. Buses of soldiers and an
armored personnel carriers cruised down the road between Pristina
and Malisheva Saturday and uniformed soldiers occupied many
buildings along the road. Serb soldier were also seen spreading
leaves and branches over buried earthen bunkers to make them less
visible.
</P>
<P>
   The peace accord that was signed this week intended to make sure
the Yugoslav president pulls his forces out of the strife-torn
province. The Western powers earlier in the week had given
Milosevic until Saturday to comply of face military action. On
Friday, the deadline was extended another 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The shelling began at about 6 p.m. Friday and continued until 8
a.m. Saturday, said a number of Vragobil residents. One man, who
would only give his first name, Adam, said he counted more than 400
rounds fired during the night. Other residents reported hearing
about the same number of rounds. Perhaps because the village is
nearly empty, no one was injured or killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just after dinner, and I went out to the street, when I
heard this boom, boom, boom,'' said Adam, a man who appeared to be
in his late 50s, wearing a black beret. The shelling came in
clusters early and became sporadic during the night.
</P>
<P>
   When morning came the red tile roofs on many houses had shell
holes the size of soccer balls . Other rounds gouged out stones in
the thick masonry walls. In one house, where the residents were
apparently getting ready to go to sleep, rubble and plaster had
collapsed onto once neatly made beds.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what would make this impoverished village a
military target, even though there were gun-bearing members of the
Kosovo Liberation Army scattered in the nearby countryside Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The few civilians who remained in this tiny ethnic Albanian
farming town on Saturday blamed Serb soldiers, who occupy the
nearby town of Malisheva. Residents believe soldiers hidden on
neighboring hills fired 30 mm shells at the houses. The residents
also said they are under occasional attack from snipers.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, people in the town of Guribardhe also said
they heard sustained shelling from the direction of Malesheva
during the night. About 25,000 of the 45,000 people who live in and
around Guribardhe are refugees, many from Malisheva.
</P>
<P>
   In Malesheva itself on Saturday Serb soldiers in their dark
violet camouflage uniforms were lounging in bombed-out buildings,
their weapons resting on their laps. The town, once a stronghold of
Kosovo separatists, had been severely damaged by earlier fighting
and seemed devoid of any other human life.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians have been killed and an estimated
300,000 forced to flee their homes since Serb forces began fighting
Kosovo separatists. The Kosovo Liberation Army also has killed more
than 200 Serb policemen, Serb civilians and ethnic Albanians loyal
to Milosevic's government.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are
ethnic Albanians and most favor independence.
</P>
<P>
   The shelling and other such incidents only serve to reinforce
the fear among refugees that it is unsafe for them to return to
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   With winter just a few weeks off, humanitarian relief workers
are urging displaced people to return home, even if their houses
were severely damaged. ``These people need to get to their homes
soon and get some shelter,'' said Mick Lorentzen of the Kosovo

   KOSOVO-SHELLING _ VRAGOBIL, Yugoslavia _ On Friday as NATO
extended its deadline for Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic
to comply with a U.S.-brokered peace agreement, this small hill
village was shelled through the night, terrifying residents and
damaging dozens of homes. Serb forces in the area also did not
appear to be making any attempts to withdraw, even though Milosevic
has agreed to reduce the Serb military presence in Kosovo.

   ATTN EDs: Today marks 25 years since the Arab oil embargo of
1973, following the Yom Kippur War. Cox Newspapers foreign bureaus
and Washington will take a look at where the world goes from here
in terms of oil production and consumption, with an underlying
question: Could it happen again? The following are budget lines for
the package, which MOVED Mon., Oct. 12, in both the (i)
International and (k) Commentary categories for use in
Perspective/Opinion/Insight sections:
</P>
<P>
   OIL-EMBARGO _ WASHINGTON _ Whatever happened to fuel efficiency?
Today, it seems like every other vehicle on the road in the United
States is a gas-guzzling, four-wheel drive sport utility vehicle.
What, if anything is the government and/or auto industry doing to
conserve fuel? Whatever happened to the strategic oil reserve; and
all the dire predictions? We'll also wrap in what it was like when
the embargo first hit, looking at things like President Richard
Nixon's speech telling Americans that their lives would never be
the same. (Mollison, Cox News Service). MOVED
</P>
<P>
   OIL-MIDEAST _ KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait _ As times get a little
tighter in this oil-rich sheikhdom on the desert, they have even
considered raising the price of gasoline. The oil minister has
noted the irony. ``It looks odd and peculiar that, at a time when
many countries are cutting the prices at the gas stations, you're
increasing it in Kuwait. That's absurd,'' said Saud Nasir Al-Saud
Al-Sabah in a recent interview. ``I don't think this is something
that's acceptable to us now.'' It costs about 50 cents a gallon to
fill up the many large cars that are the preference here. While the
government is removing the subsidies that have kept the price low,
dropping world oil prices have protected Kuwaiti motorists from
seeing any increase at gas stations. Therein lies the problem.
(Kaplow, Cox News Service). MOVED
</P>
<P>
   OIL-LATAM _ MEXICO CITY _ After the Arab oil embargo, the United
States pledged to diversify the foreign sources of its oil
supplies. Over the years, more and more imports of foreign oil have
come from the Americas _ from Canada, Mexico, Venezuela and other
Western Hemisphere countries. The Western Hemisphere, in fact, now
accounts for well more than half of foreign oil imports. Mexico,
which nationalized its oil in 1938 and is now the world's fifth
largest producer, once sought to limit sales of oil to the U.S. to
under 50 percent of its exports out of fear of domination. Mexico
is also very dependent on its oil, in spite of attempts to
diversity its economy. So far this year, with falling oil prices,
Mexico has been forced to cut its budget three times.
(Emling/Ferriss, Cox News Service). MOVED
</P>
<P>
   OIL-RUSSIA _ MOSCOW _ Boomtowns in Russia? Despite its current
economic turmoil, Russia ranks among the world's most fertile
countries in proven reserves of oil and natural gas. Parts of the
former Soviet Union are flourishing as American and other Western
companies scramble to get in on prospecting that could help to lift
Russia out of its economic mess. Off Sakhalin Island in the
northern Pacific and in the Caspian Sea region on Russia's southern
fringe, billions of dollars are being spent on exploration and
drilling. Sizable American diplomatic and technical resources are
at play, too, in the effort to reach the oil in harsh climates and
a politically unstable region. (Holmes, Cox News Service). MOVED
</P>
<P>
   OIL-ASIA _ BEIJING _ A quarter-century after the last energy
crisis, the price of oil is once again resetting the balance of
power throughout the world -- starting in Asia. With the world
market gorged with cheap petroleum, oil-exporter Indonesia could no
longer support a high standard of living for its masses. The rupiah
collapsed and then the Suharto
</P>
<P>
   regime collapsed. Yet what felled Indonesia has helped ignite
China's explosive growth. Until 1997, China was a net oil exporter,
but now it needs more oil if it is to sustain its 8 percent a year
growth path. For now China continues to expand its economy, thanks
in part to the relatively cheap oil it imports from Saudi Arabia.
Another beneficiary is India, which like China lacks super-giant
oilfields to sustain its growth. (Kunstel/Albright, Cox News
Service). MOVED

   KOSOVO-RELIEF _ PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The massive relief effort
struggling to get back underway here is being delayed by red tape,
land mines, funding and the sheer scope of the struggle among 50
relief agencies climbing all over themselves for a piece of the
pie. They are being coordinated loosely by the United Nations,
which is in a predicament because its charter forbids it from
providing assistance to ``domestic refugees'' -- those who have not
crosed into another country. There are 550,000 Bosnian Serb and

   SPACETV _ What's the biggest story of the century? For veteran

Cronkite covered John Glenn's historic 1962 Mercury mission that
orbited the Earth and now he's come out of retirement to cover
Glenn's Challenger mission beginning Oct. 29. And once again,
television will be the vehicle that informs and inspires when it

   HOGS _ Thirty-five years ago, when the family of Brookville,
Ohio farmer Pete Dull was ready to sell their hogs, they put the
pigs in a trailer and drove to one of several Dayton
slaughterhouses. But then they closed. So the family began taking
the hogs to a packing plant in Troy. It closed, too. That forced
them to haul the animals to Hillshire Farm &AMP; Kahn's in Cincinnati,
a round trip of over 100 miles. Four years ago, that slaughterhouse
shut down as well. Today, Dull's hogs go to Kentucky and Indiana,
trips that cost him an extra $2.50 or so per hog (he raises about
10,000 a year). That would be bad enough in a robust market, but
pork prices this year are at their lowest level in five years.

   HIV-SUIT _ Paul Facchina isn't gay, but his face has been seen
in gay bars all over South Florida. He isn't dying of AIDS, either,
but he's afraid people might think he is. In 1994, Facchina, an
aspiring model, signed over the rights to his picture to Mutual
Benefits Corporation. Facchina says he understood the picture would
be used in ads for insurance policies. In fact, the ads showed up
in several magazines aimed at homosexual men which are given away
free in South Florida gay bars and often feature full male nudity.
Instead of regular insurance policies, the ads were for Viatical
Benefits Foundation, which buys the life-insurance policies of
serious ill AIDS patients for a reduced rate. Facchina says the
experience was so upsetting he suffered stomach trouble and ground
his teeth so badly he had to see a dentist. Now he's suing for
damages. Is being mistaken for a gay man by definition defamatory?
Do average people really believe that the people they see in ads
use the products - or have the diseases - with which they're
associated? We'll seek similar cases and try to speak with all
concerned, as well as the Lambda Legal Defense &AMP; Education Fund and
AIDS advocacy groups for their responses. (Hayes, Palm Beach POst).

 &HT;    Padres good but N.Y. better
 &HT;    By Tim Tucker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Already this month, they've become the first team in
baseball history to eliminate two 100-win teams in the same
postseason. Already, they've won six playoff games in which the
opposing starting pitcher owned a Cy Young Award. Already, they've
outhit the National League's best offense (Houston's) and
outpitched the NL's best pitching staff (Atlanta's).
</P>
<P>
   Now let's see how good these San Diego Padres really are.
</P>
<P>
   The World Series convenes tonight in the Bronx with the
improbable Padres, the NL's third best team during the regular
season but clearly its best this month, facing the New York
Yankees, who won more regular-season games (114) than any team in
American League history. The Yankees are, to say the least,
favored.
</P>
<P>
   But for all that you've heard about the Yankee juggernaut this
season, and for all that you hadn't heard about the Padres until
very recently, here is something that might surprise you over the
next nine days:
</P>
<P>
   These teams are a lot alike.
</P>
<P>
   Both have superb starting pitching, almost invincible closers,
lineups of patient and experienced hitters who rely more on contact
than power, good benches and solid defenses that _ unlike, say,
Atlanta's _ have not melted down in October. And for Game 1
starting pitchers, both teams have a guy with impeccable postseason
credentials and no-hit stuff: the Yankees' David Wells, who threw a
perfect game earlier this season, and the Padres' Kevin Brown, who
had a no-hitter last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have more speed, more millionaires, more history _ a
lot more history, this being their 35th World Series and San
Diego's second. But the Padres have things in their favor, too,
including the only sure-fire future Hall of Famer on the field,
Tony Gwynn, who has been waiting 14 years to get back to the
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care if no one thinks we're going to win,'' Gwynn
says, ``because we think we're going to win.'' Joe Torre, the
Yankees' manager, believes the Padres enter this World Series much
as his team entered its successful '96 Series against Atlanta _ as
a team widely expected to lose but plenty good enough to win.
</P>
<P>
   In this season that will forever be linked to the home run, it
is interesting, and quite revealing, that only one player on either
of these teams hit more than 30 homers: the Padres' Greg Vaughn,
who had 50. The Yankees have no one who hit more than 28, which
would have ranked fifth on the Braves' team. This Series should
feature baseball in its more subtle splendor. Pitching. Execution.
Defense. Strategy. Smarts.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees win, they will complete one of the most
remarkable seasons in the game's history and perhaps stamp
themselves as one of the best teams ever; if the Padres win, they
will complete one of the most remarkable month in the game's
history.
</P>
<P>
   Says here it'll be a long, low-scoring series, maybe seven
games. Says here the Yankees will prevail because, in the end, the
$16-million-or-so difference in payrolls gives them a few extra
weapons. Anyway, I'm quite sure the Padres, underdogs to Houston,
underdogs to Atlanta, wouldn't want people to start favoring them
now.

RIDING HIGH AS VOTE NEARS, ROWLAND OFFERS OPPONENT A JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MIKE ALLEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Lots of candidates promise more jobs if
elected, but Gov. John Rowland of Connecticut is going them one
better: he is promising one to his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting supreme confidence that he will be re-elected Nov. 3
and his continuing effort to boost his reputation for
bipartisanship, Rowland said he would welcome his Democratic
opponent, U.S. Rep. Barbara Kennelly, into his second
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a great deal of respect for Mrs. Kennelly,'' the
Republican governor said in comments released Saturday by an aide.
``She is very smart and capable, and some of the things that
happened in her campaign are not her fault _ there are a lot of
other external factors. I'd be willing to talk to her about any
field she'd be interested in working in.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly did not refuse. She said through her spokesman
that various people have tried to discuss future options with her,
but that she was thinking only about becoming governor. Asked if
Mrs. Kennelly would give Rowland a job, her campaign manager,
Jonathan Pelto, said, ``John Rowland would certainly have a voice
in any Kennelly administration, and a role if he chose one.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland first made the offer Friday, during a visit to The
Connecticut Post of Bridgeport. ``I'm very fond of her,'' he was
quoted as saying in Saturday's issue. Despite his lead of 30 to 44
points in various state polls, he cautioned, ``I don't want to be
presumptuous, and I don't want to be condescending in suggesting
that something's going to happen.'' As possible positions, he
mentioned her concern about child safety and her criticism of his
leadership of the state Department of Children and Families.
</P>
<P>
   The two once had a warm personal relationship. During the six
years they served together in the House of Representatives, they
often had dinner together and their staffs held joint birthday
parties. An aide to the governor recalled that when the two were
doing television commentaries for a presidential debate in Hartford
in 1996, they hugged and he called her ``Babs.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor often heralds his ability to work with Democratic
legislators, and a spokesman said he had appointed two Democrats as
commissioners and one as his chief legal counsel, who has since
resigned. Rowland also reappointed Mrs. Kennelly's sister, Louise
Bailey, to the University of Connecticut board of trustees, and did
not stop the Criminal Justice Commission from reappointing her
brother, John Bailey, as chief state's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship has deteriorated in recent days as Mrs.
Kennelly began jabbing at Rowland after months of trying to talk
mostly about her vision for the state. The governor, after holding
his tongue during their first debate, responded in kind during two
debates last week.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly's change in tone apparently is the result of pleas
by her advisers, who see little hope of picking up many undecided
voters but are eager to give loyal Democrats a reason to go to the
polls. Her current television advertisement is an attack on
Rowland's record for enforcing environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should not pay to pollute,'' Mrs. Kennelly says in the ad,
standing at water's edge, as workers behind her labor in
anti-contamination suits. ``We have laws on the books to preserve
our air and our water. They're not being enforced.'' The ad, which
also shows a gavel and a person in handcuffs, closes with the
words, ``When Barbara Kennelly is governor, polluters won't get off
the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, ever feistier in debates, has continued to run only
positive television commercials. Friday, he began a minutelong ad
that describes the improvement in the state's economy over the last
four years. ``But there's still more to do,'' he says, looking into
the camera. ``We can cut taxes further, rebuild our cities, and
create better jobs for the future. I'm asking for your vote so we
can keep building a better Connecticut together.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly's campaign, which had said that it planned to make
up its deficit in the polls by gaining a point a day, ran out of
time for that strategy Wednesday, when the University of
Connecticut released a poll showing her down by 40 percentage
points, with 20 days until the election.
</P>
<P>
   Of those polled, 62 percent said they preferred Rowland, 22
percent were for Mrs. Kennelly and 17 percent were undecided. The
poll consisted of interviews with 502 state residents from Oct. 6
to 11, and has a margin of sampling error of 5 percentage points.

<P>
   BOSTON _ Thousands of tourists go every year to the Trinity
Church in Copley Square for its renowned choir, Tiffany
stained-glass windows and 120-year-old spires.
</P>
<P>
   But Tyler Florence goes there because it is a cool place to
practice his ollies, grinds and flips.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler, 14, took the train from Narragansett, R.I., just to skate
with eight others on the church plaza one summer afternoon. The
smooth pavement is perfect for 360-degree kick-flips on his
skateboard. For jumps, the low, brown sandstone steps are almost
irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   It is a paradise for skateboarders, until a police officer tells
them to hit the road. ``We're just trying to skate and we just get
hassled,'' Tyler said.
</P>
<P>
   With millions of enthusiasts, skateboarding is one of the
fastest growing sports in America with its own clothing, language
and music. And unfortunately for municipalities concerned about
damage, it is a sport that uses the urban landscape as its playing
field. Wheelchair ramps, stone steps and metal railings are all
part of the ``natural terrain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not urban gangsters or terrorists who are hell-bent on
destroying significant and historic locations,'' said Jim
Fitzpatrick, executive director of the International Association of
Skateboard Companies. ``They utilize what's there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fran Richards, director of Transworld Skateboard magazine, said:
``Kids don't see the world in the same way that adults do. They see
a beautiful marble ledge as being a great thing to jump off.''
</P>
<P>
   For visitors to New England's historic areas, skateboarders are
the last thing they expect, and the first thing they find. They
congregate at Trinity Church and on the granite steps of the
nation's first Public Library across the way. They skate the
streets of historic Newport, R.I., and the granite steps of the
capital building in Montpelier, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   All of which has the police concerned for public safety,
curators worried about damage, and some residents just plain
annoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tourists see that and they say these kids can get away with
murder,'' said Kent Ford, a 61-year-old retiree who lives near the
Trinity Church and has complained repeatedly to the mayor about the
skateboarders. ``I'm sorry, that's not the way Boston should be
represented.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, cities cannot figure out where to put them.
Twenty years ago, commercial skateboard parks were opened. (In
1976, Fortune magazine endorsed skateboard parks as a best bet for
entrepreneurs.) But of the 200 parks built then, only 2 remain,
most closed due to the threat of injury lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't realize the cost, the liability,'' said Richards,
the magazine director. ``Insurers didn't know what to charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that boarding has been reborn as a street sport, some
cities, like Boston, are trying to corral their boarders by
building public skateboard parks, nonprofit areas where skaters can
practice. Boston has allocated $2.6 million for two parks. There
are about 300 public and quasi-public parks in the United States, a
number that will double by next summer, Fitzpatrick predicted.
</P>
<P>
   But for many towns, getting a skate park built is a study in
controversy. Skateboard supporters in Burlington, Vt., have lobbied
for a park there since 1989. Skateboarding downtown had become so
common that it was declared illegal in some areas, with violators
facing $50 fines and board confiscation. Yet despite the support of
the mayor and governor, the skate park measure was blocked by
residents citing noise and property value concerns. In the
meantime, a temporary park has been put up on an access road.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Burlington, Peter Clavelle, said he had thought
that choosing a location for a landfill was the most difficult
challenge facing a local government official. ``Now I believe that
siting a skate park is even more challenging,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick, who promotes parks across the country, likened
controlling skaters to ``attempting to organize earthworms,'' but
said they were a big part of the grass-roots effort to get the
parks built.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, two dozen young skaters staged a protest at the
Statehouse in Montpelier, Vt., clattering their wheels over the
steps and demanding that the city move more quickly on their
request for a park.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were definitely adamant that they were not going to leave
until they got some attention,'' said Kermit Spaulding, the
sergeant-at-arms for the Statehouse, who helped calm the rebels.
Despite the damage done to the 160-year-old steps, he said he
sympathized with them. The City Council has approved a park, but
needs the $15,000 to build it.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Trinity Church, few of the skaters planned to abandon
their downtown haunts, where tourists are a built-in audience, to
skate in a designated area.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to have a whole lot of people hanging around,'' said
Tyler Florence's brother, 17-year-old Nate.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the ladies like it,'' added his friend, Tyler Sparrow.

   The town of Farmington, Maine, took three years to build its
park, valued at about $35,000. It was the pet project of Steve
Shible the city's recreation director, who was so proud of the park
that he printed up hats with its name, The Dragon's Nest. But
vandalism and lack of use closed it within two years. Now it's a
children's park, a slab for toddlers on tricycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids that provided the original impetus, by the time this
thing opened most of those kids had changed from skateboarding to
cars and girls and everything else,'' Shible said. ``It's pretty
hard to make out on a skateboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Skateboard advocates argue that, through the exposure of MTV and
ESPN's X Games, individual-oriented sports like skateboarding
cannot be shrugged off as a fad anymore. They have evolved into a
staple of 90's recreation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a freedom of expression thing,'' said Sid Abruzzi, who
has owned a skateboard shop in Newport, R.I., since 1971, and is a
skateboarder. He said he ``doesn't have anyone saying `I'm sorry,
you didn't make the team.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Florence agreed: ``You can only play Little League for so
long. You get tired of the coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Skate park advocates look with hope to California, the mecca of
the sport, where a recently enacted law absolves cities from
liability by placing skateboarding in the same category of ``at
your own risk'' sports as surfing and spelunking.
</P>
<P>
   That would be fine for Tyler Sparrow, whose hometown park
requires skaters to wear protective pads. Sparrow, showing an elbow
sticky with blood and a two-inch lump on his head, does not think
pads are very cool. ``I slammed into a wall,'' he said, referring
to his lack of a helmet.
</P>
<P>
   John Clift, director of facilities at Trinity Church, has
nothing personal against the skateboarders. He just wishes the
black that edges the steps were the honest scuff off the shoes of
parishioners, not skateboard wax. ``These are not repairs that you
can sort of fix,'' he said. ``It's just permanent damage.''

   ALFACAR, Spain _ For the 100th anniversary of the birth of the
poet and playwright Federico Garcia Lorca this year, his relatives
helped plan dozens of conferences and concerts. Arguably Spain's
greatest literary figure this century, he was executed in the
Spanish Civil War by fascists loyal to Franco.
</P>
<P>
   But one project they did not propose has caused perhaps the
greatest stir: a soccer field a mere half-mile from where
historians say Garcia Lorca was shot dead in August 1936. His body
was never found, but the furor shows that the ghosts of civil wars
live long.
</P>
<P>
   Bulldozers have cleared the ground for the field in this village
of 4,500 people near Granada, carving into a hillside between
Federico Garcia Lorca Park, which commemorates his unmarked tomb,
and a ravine a mile away where some 4,000 leftist opponents of
Franco were killed and dumped in mass graves.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after months of unnoticed work, it seems the soccer field
may never be completed _ thanks to the intervention of the poet's
only surviving sibling, Isabel Garcia Lorca, 87.
</P>
<P>
   A diminutive but indomitable woman, she stepped into the fray
blasting the project as a ``monstrosity.'' She expressed surprise
that the $375,000 field was proposed by Socialist officials, whose
hallmark is to criticize the barbarities of Franco's long
right-wing dictatorship, which ended with his death in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem of sensitivity,'' Ms. Garcia Lorca told a
visitor in her Madrid apartment. ``It's as if they didn't have a
memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Federico, her older brother, was already internationally
acclaimed at age 38 when he was killed. His poems and plays about
his native Andalusia, in southern Spain, and his ``Poet in New
York,'' based on his stay in America in 1929, are widely studied at
universities.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred thousand visitors flock annually to the four
Lorca sites in metropolitan Granada, including the homes where he
was born or did much of his writing and the park commemorating his
death.
</P>
<P>
   But in Alfacar, the Socialist mayor, Juan Caballero, said the
soccer field had been meticulously planned with all the legal
permits and would be largely shielded from view by 3,000 trees and
shrubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, there's no impact,'' the mayor insisted, standing on the
2.5 acres of hard-packed dirt that is the largest patch of level
ground visible on the steep hills at an altitude of 3,300 feet.
``How did they distort something so much?''
</P>
<P>
   Alfacar's present soccer field is on mushy clay that frequently
floods. Experts said the soil a mile up the windy road near the
Lorca park was firmer, and officials deemed the site the cheapest
solution. The five local amateur soccer clubs would play games
there on most weekends and could even use it at night under the
planned floodlights.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics fear that gleeful shouts when goals are scored
would be heard at the park and the mass grave. They say the two
civil war sites should be treated with the respect of a cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The countryside is so big,'' Ms. Garcia Lorca said. ``Why does
it have to be there?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider it a veritable affront,'' Isabel Garcia Lorca wrote
this month to Manuel Chaves, the Socialist president of the
Andalusia regional government, which ceded the land for the soccer
field, granted the special permits for its construction, and
pledged a third of the financing.
</P>
<P>
   It was not long before Caballero received the first calls ever,
in his nine years as mayor, from the regional president's office,
summoning him to a meeting in Seville on Oct. 20. As the sunset
cast a brilliant glow on the planned field recently, Caballero, 53,
said he would continue to argue for his pet project, but he
conceded that he was worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're open to any solution,'' he said. ``Our universal poet is
great. Perhaps his fame will prevent this soccer field. If so, we
would accept that.''

EDITORIAL: THE MICROSOFT TRIAL BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Oct. 18:
</P>
<P>
   When the Justice Department filed its antitrust suit against
Microsoft last May, both sides were hoping for a quick resolution.
But with the trial set to begin Monday, those hopes are gone. The
case against Microsoft has broadened in scope, encompassing new
charges of predatory conduct against big-name rivals.
</P>
<P>
   If these allegations are proved, the courts may well be asked to
consider drastic remedies, including increased regulation or even a
breakup of Microsoft. Many experts worry that such steps could
stifle innovation and enterprise in the nation's most dynamic
business sector.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, and 20 state attorneys general joining
the suit, were right to worry about Microsoft using its monopoly
status to coerce other companies. It is not in the public interest
for any one company to have an Internet chokehold. But it is also
right for Justice to have to prove its case in court. No matter who
wins the arguments in the next couple months, no one doubts that
the case will end up in the United States Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the core of the case against Microsoft has
been that the company used illegal tactics to try to muscle
Netscape, the maker of a Web browser that is the main rival to
Microsoft's, out of the market.
</P>
<P>
   The focus originally was on Microsoft's decision to combine its
own Internet Explorer browser with its basic Windows software,
forcing anyone who used Windows to take the browser. The expanded
suit argues that Microsoft also used strong-arm tactics against
such other giants as Intel, Apple, IBM and America Online to force
them to use Microsoft products. These tactics, the government
charges, were based on a fear at Microsoft that Netscape's
Navigator browser and Sun Microsystem's Java programming language
might some day supplant Microsoft's dominance with its Windows
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The fireworks in the trial will come in two ways.
</P>
<P>
   First, the government plans to call witnesses from affected
companies, some of whom will be reluctant to testify against
Microsoft. Nevertheless, the government thinks it can get them to
make their complaints about Microsoft public.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there will be plenty of parsing of interoffice e-mails
and other exchanges that the government claims show that Microsoft
was eager to kill off Netscape. In response, Microsoft will argue
that such talk should be dismissed as locker-room bravado, not an
actual business strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's main argument is that incorporating its browser into
Windows was designed to improve the basic product. In June, in
fact, a federal appeals court accepted Microsoft's argument that it
has the right to incorporate any software into its system if doing
so offers advantages to consumers. But the court based its ruling
on an earlier consent decree, not on broad antitrust law. The
government has assembled persuasive evidence that Microsoft's
tactics violated prohibitions against using monopoly power in one
area to crush the competition in others.
</P>
<P>
   No one claims this has been an easy time for Microsoft. Besides
the antitrust suit, the company faces strong business competition
and a global recession that could restrict its phenomenal growth.
But as Microsoft looks to expand its reach into Internet commerce,
business software and software for consumer products like cars and
telephones, it is critical to insure unfettered competition.
</P>
<P>
   In weighing the evidence, the courts and the public should
recognize that the Justice Department is not trying to punish one
company for its success but to guarantee that success will be
possible for future innovators as well.

GOTTI'S `ORDINARY' BAIL BACKERS PUT PROPERTY AT RISK 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CHARLIE LeDUFF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a modest corner of the Marine Park section of
Brooklyn is a modest home where a modest couple string Christmas
lights in the winter and plant tomatoes in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   You couldn't find better people than Clement and Margaret
Rispoli, their neighbors say.
</P>
<P>
   The street is a picture of postwar Americana. The Rispoli house
is a brick two-story, valued at $185,000, attached to the
neighbor's house, a brick two-story, and so on down the block.
</P>
<P>
   The couple moved onto 31st Street in 1985, and they grew old
there. Mr. Rispoli, who recently had quadruple bypass surgery,
turned 74 last week. His wife suffers from diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're wonderful people,'' a friend next door said. ``They
don't discuss private matters. Whatever ties they may or may not
have, they're good people.''
</P>
<P>
   The ties the friend was mentioning are those to John A. Gotti,
the man the government contends is the heir to his imprisoned
father's throne atop the Gambino crime family.
</P>
<P>
   The Rispolis are among the 35 ``ordinary, common folk of means
and good reputation,'' as Gotti's lawyer, Bruce Cutler, describes
them, who have put up their homes and even a business as collateral
on a $10 million bond so that Gotti could go home to his wife and
children while awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   While most of Cutler's description seems to fit this collection
of property owners in Brooklyn and Queens, ``ordinary'' might be a
stretch. Mr. and Mrs. Rispoli, for instance, lost their son-in-law
in a gangland slaying in 1991. And the chairman of the company that
owns the only piece of commercial property involved in the bail
package was indicted _ and ultimately acquitted _ in a 1984 mob
killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to ask yourself, does an ordinary citizen commit
his home or livelihood to one of the most notorious names in
crime?'' said a senior law enforcement official from Queens who has
spent much of his career tracking the Gambino clan. ``Either they
owe a favor or expect a favor,'' said the official, who spoke on
the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rispolis moved to their Marine Park neighborhood, the
rumors followed. Neighbors knew they had some connection to the
Gottis by way of a son-in-law named ``Bob Borish or Barish'' or
something like that.
</P>
<P>
   His name, in fact, was Bartholomew Borriello; he was the
henchman of Joseph Gallo, the Colombo family chief, before he went
to work for the elder Gotti in 1985 as a chauffeur and bodyguard.
Borriello, known as Bobby, was married to the Rispolis' daughter,
Susan, and they had two children.
</P>
<P>
   Borriello was killed outside his Bensonhurst home on a cold
spring evening in 1991. He was shot twice in the head and six times
in the body, shattering a jar of tomato sauce he was carrying as he
fell to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3 Borriello was killed on orders of the Lucchese and
Genovese families in retaliation for the 1985 murder of Paul
Castellano, then the Gambino boss, by the elder Gotti, John J.,
according to what former Lucchese underboss Anthony Casso told
federal authorities in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of them are lily-white people, but you would think that
they have given enough,'' a former mob investigator with the Queens
district attorney's office said of the Rispolis and the others who
put up their homes for the younger Gotti. ``Junior's not going
anywhere. But why would this elderly couple put their house in hock
for a guy like this? They gave the father of their grandchildren,
but what did they get?''
</P>
<P>
   Inquiries at the doors of the Rispolis' and their daughter's
Brooklyn homes went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles from the Rispolis in the heart of Howard Beach,
Queens, lives Christina Agnostinelli, who by way of a cramped
signature offered up her $360,000 home as collateral and granted
her grandson, John Ruggiero, power of attorney.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly widow, and owner of the neat brick and shingle house
on 91st Street, Ms. Agnostinelli did not answer knocks on her door
last week. Her grandson, who had pulled up in a station wagon, said
she was at her vacation home in the Poconos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody that reached out to the family wanted to help,''
said Ruggiero, who investigators say is an associate of the younger
Gotti and son of the late Angelo Ruggiero, a reputed Gambino family
captain.
</P>
<P>
   Friends help friends, Ruggiero said. It's a matter of honor, and
that's what simple people do, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got nothing on him,'' Ruggiero said of Gotti. ``It's
guilt by association. He's Italian and they're trying to make him
out to be a meatball. They're trying to railroad him because of his
family.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his grandmother's association with the Gottis,
Ruggiero said: ``Nothing. She's an 82-year-old lady who stays home
and makes tomatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Running through the heart of Howard Beach is Cross Bay
Boulevard, a commercial strip of Italian restaurants, bait shops
and vegetable stands. There, on the corner of 158th Avenue, stands
the Ragtime Newsstand Dairy, an unassuming brick delicatessen that
also sells cigarettes and beauty aids. Its owners offered it up as
part of Gotti's bond. Court papers have its value appraised at $2.6
million, the largest contribution.
</P>
<P>
   One of the four owners, Joseph Russo, was at the shop last week.
A thin man dressed in blue jeans and a ball cap, Russo said he knew
the younger Gotti from way back, when he used to buy bubble gum at
his shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it because he should be home with his kids,'' Russo
said. ``That's what it's all about. I've got no problem putting my
business up.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had been approached by the Gottis or their lawyers
or whether he offered his business of his own accord, Russo said,
``I don't know who arranged it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those seen coming and going in the Ragtime over the last 15
years are a Who's Who of Gotti associates, the Queens County
investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the board of Ragtime is John Gurino. Gurino was
indicted in 1984 in a mob murder. At the time, prosecutors accused
Gurino of having ties to organized crime. The man he was accused of
shooting managed to croak Gurino's name before he died, according
to the government. But during the trial, Gurino's little-known
lawyer was able to question the validity of those dying words by
belittling the testimony of the dying man's girlfriend, the last
person to hear him speak.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gurino won an acquittal, and his lawyer, Cutler, won the respect
of the Gotti organization, which made him their top defense
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I've said, these people are very close to the Gottis as
lifelong friends and neighbors,'' Cutler said of Ragtime's
proprietors. ``They are decent people with no links to organized
crime and they have faith in John Gotti.''
</P>
<P>
   When the senior Gotti was finally convicted in 1992, John
Gurino, now 72, was charged with felony riot, accused of organizing
a 1,000-person rally at U.S. District Courtin Brooklyn, where Gotti
was tried. Seen chanting ``Let's Free John Gotti,'' Gurino
ultimately pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor. Gurino's cousin,
Anthony Gurino, is in prison for obstruction of justice in a
federal case revolving around a multimillion-dollar heroin ring
that involved John J. Gotti's brother Gene.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gurino's wife said he was unable to come to the door
of his home in Howard Beach because he was resting.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the homes offered as surety are in Howard Beach, a
close-knit, mostly Italian neighborhood, where young men routinely
ask strangers the nature of their business. Heavily developed after
World War II, it is a sequestered village on the north shore of
Jamaica Bay with block after tree-lined block of unremarkable
split-level brick and shingle homes with manicured lawns. It looks
more like Orange County than Queens County.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Gotti's benefactors from Howard Beach live in the same
subdivision in houses that are so similar that it is easy to
imagine them wandering at least once into the wrong home.
</P>
<P>
   In regard to Gotti's bond, they say little.
</P>
<P>
   Ciro and Rose Amoroso, whose son Anthony could be seen regularly
at the Wednesday night meetings at the younger Gotti's social club
in South Ozone Park, referred all inquires about their brick and
shingle home on 85th Street to Cutler, the lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Kaplan, who lives on 83rd Street, also put up her brick and
shingle duplex as collateral. Mrs. Kaplan's son Steven, 30, a
reputed member of Gotti's crew, was arrested along with Gotti in
1990 for hitting two men in a Long Island nightclub whose dates
found Gotti and Kaplan unattractive. The battered men later dropped
the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known John a long time, and he's a lovely boy,'' Mrs.
Kaplan said before closing the door.
</P>
<P>
   Inquiries at other homes in the subdivision yielded a few ``I
don't know,'' several ``Can't help you, bud'' and, in one case, two
snarling attack dogs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Gotti family home on 85th Street, where Junior spent his
childhood, questions were answered with a polite ``No, thank you.'
</P>
<P>
   Richard DiCasoli, who offered his two-story aluminum-sided house
in Ozone Park as collateral, did not want to talk. Organized crime
investigators said they had never heard of him, until now.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most valuable pieces put up as collateral is the Long
Island house owned by Gotti's sister, Victoria, a writer of
whodunits, and her husband, Carmine Agnello, who according to the
federal authorities became a ``made man,'' or official crime family
member, in 1992. He wanted to help but was not allowed to offer any
of his property as part of the bail package because government
prosecutors questioned the legitimacy of its financing. Victoria
Gotti, however, was allowed to sign over half the value of their
Old Westbury, N.Y., estate, or $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The friends and family wanted him home and have backed it
up,'' Agnello said by telephone from his Bronx-based business, the
New York Shredder Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much I can say. There's a trial, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Then before hanging up, Agnello asked a question of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``How'd you get my number?''

 &HT;    Lottery a hot topic in two campaigns
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANETT, Ala. _ At the Happy Stop convenience store, clerk Lynn
Ayers restocks the Marlboro supply hanging over the counter.
There's not a customer in sight as lunch time approaches. When
travelers eventually do stop for a tank of unleaded at 92.9 cents a
gallon, they invariably ask to buy a lottery ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them they can go three miles down the road if they want
to play,'' Ayers said.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road is Georgia, which has raised more than $2.7
billion for education with its 5-year-old lottery.
</P>
<P>
   The Happy Stop sits in lottery-free Alabama, where buying a $1,
state-sponsored chance to become a millionaire has been about as
welcome as the federal government and a losing football team.
</P>
<P>
   But in Alabama and South Carolina, where incumbent GOP governors
once were considered unreachable by Democrats, challengers have
used lottery proposals like rocket fuel. They ignite enthusiasm
with the promise that millions in revenue can be made without
raising taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Don Siegelman, Alabama's lieutenant governor, proposed a
Georgia-style lottery to fund college scholarships. Trailing in
some polls by double digits, Gov. Fob James has countered with his
own scholarship plan _ one that doesn't rely on a lottery.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, Jim Hodges, the Democratic challenger for
governor, also promotes a state lottery and suddenly has made his
race with GOP incumbent David Beasley closer than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're challenging a sitting governor, you have to do
something that elevates you and becomes a negative for your
opponent,'' said Charles Bullock, a political scientist at the
University of Georgia. ``The lottery is an outstanding tool for
doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Happy Stop, Ayers wants no part of a lottery. She used to
work in nearby LaGrange, Ga., and didn't like what she saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``People spent their last dollars on the lottery and let their
kids go hungry just so they could play their numbers,'' Ayers said.
She recounted tales of people spending a fraction of their food
stamps, then coming back to spend the change on Lotto tickets. ``I
stay where there is no lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Alabama has been hemmed in by lottery states Georgia,
Florida and Louisiana. Next door sits casino-crazy Mississippi.
Dollar by dollar, quarter by quarter, potential Alabama revenue
flows out of the state and becomes budget fodder for other
governments.
</P>
<P>
   The lottery tide may be turning, however. Recent newspaper polls
in Alabama and South Carolina showed nearly two-thirds of those
interviewed in each state would vote for a lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Georgia Lottery raised more than $1.72 billion _
up 56 percent over the $1.1 billion raised in 1994, the first
fiscal year for the game. In 1997, more than 136,000 Georgia
students received more than $179 million in HOPE scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   National rankings of quality of public education and quality of
life for children consistently have Alabama among the bottom three
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the parents who thought that college wasn't possible for
their son or daughter because the high cost is crippling, hope is
on the way,'' Siegelman said. ``To those who say it can't be done,
I say it can _ just look at Georgia.''

<P>
   James plays to his socially conservative base when he derides
Siegelman's lottery plan as a ``crap shoot'' and questions the
morality of funding education through gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lottery is nothing more than a tax _ and a deceitful tax _
on those who can't afford it,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   James was born in Lanett 64 years ago. His hometown is typical
of hamlets along the Georgia border from Alabama to North Carolina.
Residents make easy trips to the Peach State for quick dates with
Lady Luck. Five of the top 10 Georgia Lottery retailers are perched
near the Alabama border: two in West Point, two in Columbus and one
in Tallapoosa.
</P>
<P>
   A three-mile drive on U.S. 29 from the Happy Stop in Lanett
brings you to the Oil South No. 8 Texaco in West Point, Ga. The
Texaco is sixth on the Georgia Lottery's list of top retailers.
``We have people from Birmingham, Mobile, Montgomery, Lafayette.
They come from all over,'' said Texaco lottery clerk Cassandra
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is foundry worker Willie Heard, who drops in weekly
from Lanett. Heard makes his way past the shiny metal racks of Slim
Jims and Golden Flake Pork Crackles and the refrigerated quarts of
Coors and Schlitz Malt Liquor to get to the two manned Lotto
terminals in the back of the store.
</P>
<P>
   After Heard buys $15 in tickets _ amounting to $60 a month or
$720 a year _ he heads to a faded gray Caprice Classic in his gray
overalls and oil-stained hat. With two daughters at home, the
oldest 14, he would gladly vote for an Alabama lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't afford it but I play it in Georgia,'' said Heard.
Texaco's lottery lines are often eight or 10 deep. Heard said the
woman in front of him spent $70 on tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Heard said his family never has gone without necessities because
of his wagers. ``I want the money. I need the money,'' said Heard,
who won $500 six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Just west on U.S. 29 back in Lanett, the Texaco star is visible
through the plate glass windows of the Greene Super Drug store.
Thirty-year-old pharmacist Pamela Monk, a lifelong Lanett resident,
said she has contemplated moving to Georgia to increase the odds
that her 11-year-old son can earn a college scholarship. Her
friends have thought of moving, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not one of those rich towns. This is not Vestavia
Hills,'' said Monk, referring to a swanky section of Birmingham,
similar to Dunwoody in suburban Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Schools need help and no one wants to raise property taxes, so
why not start a lottery, Monk reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education needs to be the main thing,'' said Monk, a Baptist
who doesn't gamble but invites others to if it pays for schools.
``You've got people who wouldn't otherwise make charitable
donations to education but they might play the lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not James is re-elected, Monk is convinced the
lottery is bound for Alabama. ``Oh, it's coming,'' she said.
``You'll get new people in office. The lottery is coming here _ one
way or another.

   EL PASO, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, ahead by as much as 50
points in statewide polls in his bid for a second term, met his
Democratic challenger, Garry Mauro, for their first and only debate
Thursday night, and it did not take long for the talk to turn to
Bush's possible run for the presidency in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping on a question from one of the panelists about Bush's
presidential aspirations, Mauro, the state's land commissioner,
said the governor was ``running for a job that most Texans think is
a full-time job and I would like to see him let us know if he's
going to be a full-time governor.''
</P>
<P>
   As he has throughout the campaign, Bush said he had not made up
his mind about running for president in 2000 but he did have some
reservations about how such an intense race would affect his
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'll seek the presidency or not,'' Bush said,
counseling Texas voters to ``make that part of your consideration''
when voting for governor on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the consequences of not making up my mind,'' Bush
said. ``I don't think there would be all this speculation going on
if the people didn't think I was doing a good job as governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the oldest son of former President George Bush, has been
the front-runner for the Republican nomination for president in
many early polls, attracting increased national scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro originally sought a series of debates with Bush, who
eventually agreed to just one, which was scheduled for a Friday
night in the fall, when a significant number of Texas voters are at
high school football games.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the exchanges dealt with public education, which has
emerged in Texas as the hottest local issue, as it has elsewhere in
the country. Both promised tax cuts and raises for teachers, though
they differed on the details.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro asked the governor to use his influence to urge
Republicans to end impeachment proceedings against Clinton. Bush
should ``pass the word to Congress that Texans don't want the
circus anymore,'' Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush responded that he was happy ``to give the president his day
in court before I rush to judgment.''

NORMAN CLAPP, 83, LEADER IN RURAL ELECTRIFICATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Fla., N.Y.)  (bl) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Norman Moses Clapp, a government official from Wisconsin who led
the Rural Electrification Administration under Presidents Kennedy
and Johnson and who directed New York state's investigation of the
disastrous power blackout of July 1977, died Oct. 7 at his home in
Clearwater, Fla., where he was living in retirement. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Clapp, a native of Ellsworth, Wis., and a 1937 Phi Beta Kappa
graduate of Lawrence University, then Lawrence College, in
Appleton, Wis., spent more than 40 years in public life. He earned
his spurs as a staff assistant to Sen. Robert M. La Follette Jr.,
the Wisconsin Progressive who did battle for the electrification
administration and similar far-reaching New Deal measures.
</P>
<P>
   Clapp served the senator from 1935 to 1942, with time out as an
investigator and mediator for the Wisconsin Labor Relations Board
and its national equivalent in Washington. He stayed in the capital
as a financial expert on the Senate staff until 1944, when he
bought into and edited the first of two regional Wisconsin weekly
newspapers in which he had an ownership interest.
</P>
<P>
   A delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1956, he ran
for Congress that year and sold the papers in 1958 to run once more
full time. But his district was a Republican stronghold, and he
lost on his final try in 1960 despite a campaign appearance by Sen.
John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Once Kennedy was president, he chose Clapp to revive the
electrification administration and its low-cost loan programs to
combat rural poverty. Technological progress was making American
agriculture the envy of the world, but it also idled hundreds of
thousands of farmers and farm hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy approach, continued under Lyndon B. Johnson, tried
to give farmers a new livelihood by providing power stations and
transmission lines through rural cooperatives. For eight years,
Clapp conducted the program as it expanded to bring telephone
service to rural America, battling stiff opposition from private
utilities and their advocates in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Clapp returned to his home state to serve as a commissioner and
then chairman of the Wisconsin Public Service Commission. He was
vice president for energy in a New York consulting firm when the
blackout threw the New York City area into chaos on July 13, 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of stores were damaged or destroyed by looting and
vandalism, chiefly in Brooklyn and the Bronx, where many merchants
were without insurance. The breakdown and lack of preparedness led
to several investigations, and Gov. Hugh Carey appointed Clapp to
conduct the official inquiry for the state's Public Service
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting report, released in February 1978, found fault
with several agencies and power companies, including Consolidated
Edison Co., the surrounding utilities, the state power pool and the
Public Service Commission itself. The report cited poor planning,
design, maintenance and emergency procedures that, Con Edison
engineers testified, could cope with slowly developing problems but
were useless in an emergency of such magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   Clapp is survived by his wife of 62 years, Analoyce Elkington
Clapp; three sons, David A. of Bloomington, Minn., William E. of
Dresden, Germany, and Douglas E. of Alexandria, Va., and seven
grandchildren.

TV ADS, FAXES REPLACE KISSING BABIES IN N.Y. ATTORNEY GENERAL
RACE 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.Y., Calif.)  (bl) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judged by its blizzard of shrill press releases, the campaign
for New York state attorney general is an intense, hard-fought
contest, much like the one four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Republican incumbent Dennis Vacco denigrates his Democratic
opponent, Eliot Spitzer, as a soft-on-crime liberal and accuses
Spitzer's wealthy father, a developer, of violating real estate and
campaign financing laws. Spitzer, a former assistant district
attorney in Manhattan, accuses Vacco of turning his office into a
patronage mill, replacing competent lawyers with political hacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spitzer Breaks Law He Seeks to Enforce,'' cries one headline
on a recent news release from the Vacco campaign. ``Rochester Judge
Throws the Book at Dennis Vacco,'' screams another, from Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   But for all this campaign's rhetorical resemblance to a street
brawl, it has an eerie unreality to it, and in that way has become
a striking example of what is happening in American politics. With
Election Day little more than two weeks away, the candidates have
devoted little time to the mainstays of traditional electioneering,
whether speaking on the stump, wading into crowds, shaking hands or
kissing babies.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the campaign has amounted to a duel of faxed news
releases and television commercials _ and private fund-raisers to
pay for the costly air time.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, campaigns for all but the most local offices are
waged on television, and the race for attorney general in New York
is a classic of that genre. The phenomenon has been around awhile,
but grows more prevalent every year.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Vacco and his Democratic opponent, Karen
Burstein, spent more time campaigning the old-fashioned way. Ms.
Burstein rose early to greet commuters at subway stations. Vacco,
running for the first time, delivered a stump speech before small
audiences, rich with details about his Italian immigrant parents.
That year, the two candidates faced each other one month before the
elections in the first of two debates.
</P>
<P>
   But this year's race amounts to a ``virtual campaign,'' said
Steven Goldstein, Spitzer's spokesman, because the candidates have
had so little interaction with voters _ or with each other. ``The
campaign has not been a war of spoken words, but a war of faxed
words,'' he said. In recent days, most of the faxes have come from
his office.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Vacco's campaign, Michael Zabel, disputed
Goldstein's characterization of the race, saying the attorney
general had been campaigning steadily around the state, though not
necessarily every week. But he acknowledged that Vacco was running
a different campaign this time because of the demands of his job.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a few appearances at Columbus Day parades,
``meet-and-greet'' events with Italian-American police officers and
the announcement of a criminal case, most of Vacco's schedule last
week consisted of television interviews, meetings with editorial
boards of newspapers and private fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   A schedule prepared by the Spitzer campaign listed a few
appearances last week before political groups interspersed with
meetings with editorial boards, radio and television interviews and
a series of news conferences in New York and upstate.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the race is so distant from voters that it
reminds them of political campaigns in California, where candidates
for statewide office long ago gave up trying to press the flesh.
``This is a California campaign,'' said Mitchell Moss, director of
the Urban Research Center at New York University. ``In California,
the TV markets have always been more important than grass-roots
campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   After being pressed by Spitzer for several weeks, Vacco agreed
earlier this week to two debates, to be held Friday at the
Cablevision offices in Woodbury on Long Island and two day later,
next Sunday, on WABC-TV in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The race is close. A recent New York Times/CBS News poll found
that Vacco was favored by 38 percent of registered voters, and
Spitzer by 37 percent, with 23 percent undecided. Among voters
considered likely to vote, Vacco was ahead 43 percent to 41
percent. (The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 points.)
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say, the virtual campaign has become a
favored political strategy because television reaches so many more
people than street campaigning does. Another factor is voter
apathy. Goldstein also noted that in a year when the elections for
governor and senator cannot compete for news coverage with the
Yankees and the impeachment debate, it is almost impossible to stir
up interest in races like the campaign for attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   John Zogby, an independent pollster in Utica, said that
candidates understandably want to avoid public appearances when
interest among the public is so low. If a well-known figure like
Rep. Charles Schumer, the Democratic candidate for senator, draws
only small crowds, what can Spitzer expect?
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly wouldn't want a reporter following me around while
I'm meeting with six people,'' Zogby said. ``That could be deadly.
What's the headline there: `Spitzer Makes a Statement on World
Peace' or `Six People Showed Up'?''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that a candidate can reach more voters on
television than in person, said Bill Lynch, the vice chairman of
the national Democratic Party. But among some voters, people are
much more likely to go to the polls if they have seen the candidate
up close, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Particularly in the African-American community, they like that
kind of contact,'' Lynch said. ``The Latino community also likes to
touch their candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the analysts say, a challenger who had never run in a
general election before might eagerly court media attention using
the traditional strategy of meeting with voters and organizations.
``If they had no money,'' said Republican political strategist Jay
Severin, referring to the Spitzer campaign, ``they'd be walking on
their knees through cut glass to your office, asking you to spend a
month with them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Spitzer has enough personal and family wealth to get his
message across through an extensive advertising campaign without
filtering it through a journalist's lens, Severin said.
</P>
<P>
   For both candidates, that message seems to be primarily about
fighting street crime, which has traditionally been considered more
of a job for the state's district attorneys than for the attorney
general. Less emphasis has been put on the office's traditional
role in defending the state when it is sued, and enforcing its
environmental, consumer protection, civil rights, securities and
other laws.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco said he has redefined that role. ``Quite frankly, I think
that the people now see the attorney general's office as an office
that's much more relevant to their day-to-day lives,'' he said,
``whether it's our involvement in expanding the criminal justice
role of this office, from prosecuting cop killers to busting drug
gangs, but also being more aggressive in using our criminal justice
authority to go after scam artists in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   In Spitzer's view, however, the public has not been well
informed about what the attorney general does. ``These dueling
press releases with their screaming headlines do not lead to the
sort of debate that the public deserves,'' he said. ``Let's discuss
environmental policy and let's discuss civil rights, antitrust,
securities and ethics prosecutions.''

EDITORIAL: A NOBEL FOR PEACE-IN-PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Oct. 18:
</P>
<P>
   John Hume, a moderate Catholic politician from Northern Ireland,
has been working for peace there for three decades. David Trimble,
the pro-British Protestant who is now first minister of Northern
Ireland, is a more recent convert. Together they helped mold the
Good Friday Agreement that has brought the beginning of
reconciliation to Northern Ireland, and together they were justly
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But peace is by no means assured, and Trimble is right to hope
that the prize is not premature.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel committee pointedly and wrongly omitted Gerry Adams,
perhaps because of his tolerance for terrorism over the years. But
he had the courage and vision to turn Sinn Fein and the Irish
Republican Army away from violence, making the peace deal possible.
A host of others contributed to the accords, including British
Prime Minister Tony Blair; the British government's Northern
Ireland Secretary, Mo Mowlam; the Irish Republic's Prime Minister
Bertie Ahern; President Clinton, and former Sen. George Mitchell,
who led the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for Trimble's caution was evident the other day when
he and his deputy, Seamus Mallon, a Catholic and a member of Hume's
party, visited The New York Times. When the talk turned to
politics, the atmosphere suddenly turned chilly as Trimble and
Mallon skirmished over issues that are crucial to the functioning
of the region's new institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The most important dispute is over how to deal with the IRA's
refusal to give up its weapons. Trimble has said he wants to delay
naming his cabinet _ which would likely include Adams _ until the
IRA begins to destroy the weapons or to turn them over to
authorities. The peace agreement commits all the parties to total
disarmament, and to using all their influence to achieve it. But it
does not state that this must begin before anything else. The IRA,
however, has the obligation to begin. All other parties should
encourage it, by turning over their own weapons and implementing
measures that end Northern Ireland's traditional discrimination
against Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   There is reason for hope. Sinn Fein appointed Martin McGuinness,
its chief negotiator at the peace table, to new talks about
disarmament, a sign of seriousness. Trimble, who would not speak
directly to Adams during the negotiations, has now met with him
three times, alone.
</P>
<P>
   It takes nothing from the achievements of Northern Ireland's
leaders to note that they will continue to disagree as they tackle
the unglamorous tasks of making the Assembly work, setting up
cross-border political bodies and reforming the police and
bureaucracy. ``There's so much work to be done and it's so
mundane,'' Adams warned last week. But that is how peace is built.

 EDITORIAL OBSERVER: MY HONORABLE OPPONENT, THE AX-MURDERER ...  
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in 1828, when President John Quincy Adams was running for
re-election, supporters of Andrew Jackson felt compelled to find
some way to undermine the incumbent's reputation as a terrific
diplomat. They settled on spreading a story that Adams, who had
served as ambassador to Russia, had gotten on the czar's good side
by offering up his children's nanny as a royal mistress.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a very convincing story _ anyone who looks at Adams'
portrait will instantly perceive that this was no good-time
Charlie. But the president was called ``the Pimp of the Coalition''
throughout the campaign, and when Jackson won, he made the editor
who invented the slander a member of his kitchen cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of this story is that there are negative campaigns and
then there are really, really negative campaigns. This year's U.S.
Senate race in New York strikes some voters as pretty deep in the
mud. Rep. Charles Schumer has been calling Sen. Alfonse D'Amato a
liar on every channel in the state, and D'Amato has been telling
upstate voters that Schumer cares more about Mongolia than he does
about them.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend Schumer unleashed a new ad called ``Mother'' in
which the narrator starkly announces that ``D'Amato opposes
abortion rights even in cases of rape and incest, even if the
mother would die.''
</P>
<P>
   But on a scale of 1 to 10, this one hardly registers a 6. (A 10
would be the effort in 1856 to depict the Republican presidential
candidate as a cannibal.) The defining adjective for the
D'Amato-Schumer battle is actually not ``negative'' but ``close.''
Most polls show D'Amato and Schumer running neck-and-neck, a
condition that tends to bring out the vicious streak in any
candidate. Close and mean is better than a gentlemanly runaway any
day.

   New York Gov. George Pataki is miles ahead in the polls, and his
ads are so sunny they might be mistaken for margarine commercials.
His campaign consultants spent years training to be political Road
Warriors, and now they're stuck doing Walt Disney, rolling out one
production after another in which Pataki appears surrounded by
children and scenic vistas. If his lead gets any wider, he will
approach the camera with a puppy at his feet and the Bluebird of
Happiness circling overhead.
</P>
<P>
   The D'Amato-Schumer contest, meanwhile, is a sort of Steel Cage
Match of politics, in which the last guy standing wins. Schumer's
``too many lies'' campaign was fairly effective _ D'Amato's gray
ethical aura is his weakest spot. But the lying the ad referred to
was actually just D'Amato's habit of fluffing up his own reputation
and calling his opponents ``liberal.'' The hyper-cynical voting
public expects ``lie'' to means something like concealing a
criminal record or a couple of surplus wives.
</P>
<P>
   After casting about from one insult to another _ ``liberal''
didn't work, ``from Brooklyn'' was only so-so _ D'Amato fell back
on the classic ploy of adding up Schumer's missed votes. As in the
Andrew Jackson campaign, D'Amato's strategists wanted to undermine
their opponent's proudest boast, and Schumer is running on his
reputation as an effective legislator. The attack was trivial _ you
can skip quite a lot in Washington without missing anything. But it
was fair. Schumer missed the votes, and he has to accept the
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   None of this stuff would get a mention in the annals of low
moments in political history. It does not even rank very high this
year, when one Illinois gubernatorial candidate is basically
calling another a murderer, and in South Carolina, Sen. Ernest
Hollings just had to apologize for saying his opponent was ``a
(expletive deleted) skunk.''
</P>
<P>
   But with just two weeks to go until the election, New Yorkers
deserve something substantial, even if it is delivered in the
rhetorical equivalent of a screech. Schumer's new ads, while rough,
hit an important issue, since polls show most voters do not know
that D'Amato is a staunch opponent of abortion. But the
life-of-the-mother element is a bit of a stretch _ it is' based
mainly on D'Amato's 1983 vote for a constitutional amendment that
would put the abortion issue back under the control of the states.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's office did not return calls about the content of his
upcoming ads. (The senator has been avoiding me ever since the 1980
campaign, when I asked him to name the last five books he had
read.) But we are eagerly awaiting the next volley.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long time since New York has hosted an election in
which we did not know the name of the winner weeks before the first
absentee ballot hit the mails. It is worth hearing a lot of nasty
commercials to get a contest in which everyone can imagine that his
vote might really count.

19 YEARS AFTER MURDER, A CONFESSION TO THE CRIME 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ This time of year is difficult for the
family of Tracy Fresquez _ it marks the anniversary of both her
birth and her death.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Lori Owens woke up on Sept. 8, which would have been
the 38th birthday of Ms. Fresquez, her only sister, and, though
nine months pregnant, set off for the cemetery to visit her grave.
</P>
<P>
   About halfway there, Ms. Owens felt ill and turned back. After
midnight, she gave birth to a boy.
</P>
<P>
   That day, ``I thought about her a lot,'' said Ms. Owens, who was
16 when her 19-year-old sister was found strangled in her Shawnee,
Kan., apartment on Oct. 6, 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Her killer had never been found. But last month there was news:
A Virginia man had turned himself in to Kansas City authorities and
confessed to killing Ms. Fresquez.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Daniel Leroy Crocker, 38, a father of two, has been
charged with first-degree murder and is being held in the Johnson
County, Kan., jail in lieu of $100,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   Crocker had never been a suspect in the case. ``All we know is
that he's doing what is right now,'' said Crocker's wife,
Nicolette, in an interview from her home in Chantilly, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Crocker met her husband when they both lived in the Kansas
City area, and before they were married 11 years ago, he told her
about killing the woman, she said. The couple, who now have an
8-year-old girl and a 9-year-old boy, had kept the secret all these
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have something hidden in your heart, it's going to
keep coming to the surface,'' said Mrs. Crocker, who said her
husband's religious faith prompted him to come forward.
</P>
<P>
   Crocker, an active member of the Fairfax Assembly of God in
Virginia, had recently counseled a prison inmate through the Prison
Fellowship Ministries and decided to confide in the fellowship
pastor, the Rev. Al Lawrence, about the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, assistant pastor at Shiloh Baptist Church in
Alexandria, along with volunteer lawyers at the Fellowship
Ministries, helped Crocker surrender to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   A murder warrant was issued on Sept. 23, after Shawnee police
questioned Crocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those cases that nagged a lot of people
involved in it for a real long time,'' said Dave Burger, a
detective at the time. Ms. Fresquez apparently met her killer on
Oct. 5, 1979, at a convenience store and the two went to a party.
It is unclear whether they knew each other.
</P>
<P>
   Police have said that the two went to her second-floor apartment
and the assailant left but returned before midnight and slipped
inside. Burger, now a police captain in Lenexa, Kan., a neighboring
suburb, recalled questions of the case _ like the fingerprints on a
beer can found in Ms. Fresquez's bedroom that were never
identified.
</P>
<P>
   For years, investigators periodically checked the prints against
those of criminals across the country, and the case file grew to
about 2,000 pages. The authorities' key physical evidence is
expected to be the fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel a real strong obligation to the victim,'' Burger
said. ``This was a girl who, by all accounts, had a bright future
ahead of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fresquez had just graduated from high school the year before
and was working in the credit department at a Montgomery Ward when
she stopped by on the day she died to check on her mother.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of three children, the two girls and a boy, she had
spent a lot of time taking care of her mother, Judith, whose
multiple sclerosis was diagnosed when Tracy was 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife, she suffered so much,'' Louis Fresquez, the
children's father, said of Judith Fresquez's reaction to their
daughter's death. Mrs. Fresquez died in 1991 at 49.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Crocker's confession is forcing the Fresquez family to
relive painful memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emotions are too high for people to think about closure,''
Ms. Owens said. She, along with her older brother, Jay, 37, and
their father, 58, who all still live in the Kansas City area, are
troubled by the portrayal of Crocker as a hero because he confessed
to the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Fresquez, who works in a window-glass shop, said, ``It
took him 19 years to find this sudden belief in God.''
</P>
<P>
   Crocker, who quit his job as a warehouse manager, would be
sentenced under a 1979 Kansas law, which provides only one penalty
for first-degree murder: a life term with eligibility for parole
after 15 years. The current law requires a minimum 25 years in
prison. A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The Crockers' family and church have been supportive, both
emotionally and financially, Mrs. Crocker said. ``It's so good not
to be hiding anymore,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fresquez family must relive the killing, being
interviewed again as the murder case is reinvestigated.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Owens said, ``He took her life. The issues of what and how
and when _ they are just details. The issue is Tracy. There is no
reason good enough.''

FOR PADRES, GLORY OF '84 IS DISTANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruce Bochy was a seldom-used catcher, Tim Flannery a utility
infielder, Greg Booker a relief pitcher. They were not the stars of
the team, but they, along with Tony Gwynn, are the links to the
only other time the San Diego Padres played in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Bochy is the manager of the team that opened the World Series
against the Yankees on Saturday night, Flannery the third-base
coach, Booker the bullpen coach.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Show and Alan Wiggins also played for the 1984 Padres. They
were not at Yankee Stadium on Saturday night. Show, that team's
leading pitcher with 15 victories, died of a drug overdose in 1994.
Wiggins, who set club records that season with 70 stolen bases and
106 runs scored, died of AIDS in 1991, 40 months after he was
suspended from baseball for drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really wasn't good for those two fellows, but they did a
hell of a job helping us win,'' Dick Williams, the manager of the
1984 Padres, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The 1984 Padres won the National League West championship by 12
games, then edged the Chicago Cubs in a thrilling five-game pennant
playoff after losing the first two games. That they lost the World
Series to the Detroit Tigers in five games was almost an
afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turned on a city for the first time that had never been
there, never been through anything like that; it was
unbelievable,'' Rich ``Goose'' Gossage said, recalling his first
year in San Diego, where he learned there was life after the
Yankees. ``That season was exciting. The big thing was we were
happy to be in the World Series. Big deal if we won. I don't think
that intensity was there as a team. We were just happy to be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres got there by snatching late-inning victories against
the Cubs. In the ninth inning of Game 4, Steve Garvey hit a two-run
home run, and in the seventh inning of Game 5, Flannery hit a
ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carmelo Martinez was at second with one out,'' Flannery
related, ``and I hit a ground ball that went through Leon Durham's
legs. Carmelo scored the tying run. Then Wiggins hit a little chip
shot to left field and Tony drove us both in with a double to
right-center.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1984 season was Gwynn's first full season in the major
leagues and produced the first of his eight batting titles. He
played in the outfield with Kevin McReynolds and Martinez, also in
their first full seasons. Terry Kennedy was the catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey, a veteran and a star, was in his second season with the
Padres after leaving Los Angeles as a free agent. Wiggins, who had
been an outfielder, played second base for the first time. Garry
Templeton was the shortstop, and third baseman Graig Nettles was
acquired by the Padres in a trade with the Yankees four days before
the season opened.
</P>
<P>
   Show was in the starting rotation with Ed Whitson, who two
months after the World Series would join the Yankees as a free
agent, a move he would live to regret; Tim Lollar, who had
previously played for the Yankees; Dave Dravecky, who in 1991 would
lose his pitching arm to cancer; Mark Thurmond and Andy Hawkins.
The closer was Gossage, who joined the Padres as a free agent that
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go somewhere where I could make a difference,''
Gossage said. ``I felt San Diego was on the verge. Somebody in the
bullpen was all they needed. That and a third baseman, and then we
got Nettles.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Yankees Gossage and Nettles, Williams recalled, were
instrumental in the Padres' success not only on the field but also
in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the two big guys for us,'' he said, ``helping our
young kids, constantly talking to them, sitting around after games
having beers with them. If we hadn't had those two, we would've
been in a lot of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Flannery echoed Williams' assessment. ``Nettles and Goose
brought something that was really needed,'' he said. ``They brought
an attitude. They taught me a lot about how to deal with a lot of
situations on as well as off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Flannery also cited Garvey's contribution off the field.
``Garvey was the guy who did all the interviews,'' he said.
``Everyone else just played ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite. Some players became involved in other matters.
That was the year the John Birch Society, the politically
conservative organization, came to baseball, and it made its
presence known in the Padres' clubhouse. Show was its most active
proponent and was joined most notably by two other pitchers,
Dravecky and Thurmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``On an off day,'' Williams related, ``they had a booth at the
fairgrounds. Show had Dravecky and Thurmond go out with him. They
were passing out pamphlets. All hell broke loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams and the former players said the impact of the
controversy on the team was exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was played out in the media and everywhere else more so
than it was in the clubhouse,'' Booker said. ``You were dealing
with guys who were very well liked by all their teammates. If you
knew the guys involved in it, you knew what they stood for and it
wasn't a prejudice thing or anything like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally right now still don't know exactly what it is or
what it stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   Flannery said that Show was genuinely interested in the John
Birch idea, but questioned the seriousness of Dravecky and
Thurmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I could've signed them up for Amway if I wanted to,''
Flannery said. ``It just so happened they got signed up with
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it created no distraction but rather served as ``a good
laugh for all the guys.'' He remembered joking about it. ``I said I
showed up with binoculars and a book on birds thinking it was the
Audubon Society,'' Flannery said.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage agreed that the players didn't let the matter bother
them that year, but he believed it was one of the factors that
brought a quick end to the Padres' success after that season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the next year and the year after it kind of got to
everybody and had a negative effect on everybody,'' Gossage said.
``I think there was a wedge driven between the guys with religion
and the guys who were free spirits like myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we let too much off-the-field stuff bother us. It was
a combination of a lot of things, but it was a shame because we
were on the verge of dominating that division for a long time. It
was wide open, up for grabs, but we went downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   The slide didn't end until this year.

IOC ALARMED BY REPORTS OF DANGEROUS DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By PAUL GAINS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as researchers are closing in on a method to detect abuse
of the artificial hormone EPO among athletes, a dangerous new drug,
which is also believed to substantially increase endurance, has
aroused the active concern of the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Laurent Rivier, the head of the IOC-accredited
laboratory in Lausanne, Switzerland, the lab is prepared to test
blood samples for the presence of perfluorocarbon metabolites, or
PFC.
</P>
<P>
   The substance is, in effect, a synthetic blood, with enormous
oxygen-carrying capacity. But use of PFC can also be extremely
dangerous, particularly without medical supervision. Although there
is no reliable research on PFC abuse in humans, possible symptoms
involve a perilous thickening of the blood.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of PFC use among athletes first filtered back to Lausanne
last February from the Winter Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan, where
cross-country skiers and speed skaters were allegedly using the
drug. In May, the International Cycling Union issued a warning to
its national federations about riders' using PFC emulsions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard that some cyclists are now using it in Switzerland,''
said Dr. Martial Saugy, an associate director of the Lausanne
laboratory. ``I think in the cyclists' world, they know it can be
very dangerous. It's not the same story as EPO.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandrine Martelli, a spokeswoman for the International Cycling
Union, or UCI, said last week: ``It is a delicate subject and
difficult to speak about. There have been many rumors, but little
is known. Usually there is no smoke without fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Cycling hardly needs another scandal after the debacle of this
year's Tour de France, in which the world's top team, Festina, was
disqualified for systematic doping. And last week, the Italian
police raided that country's cycling federation headquarters as
well as the Italian Olympic Committee's offices and its laboratory
as part of its investigation into drugs in sport. Police
confiscated pharmaceutical products and documents, including drug
tests going back as far as 1985.
</P>
<P>
   And cycling is not alone. Thursday, Carlo Tranquilli, one of the
Italian soccer federation's official doctors, said he was resigning
amid continuing doping allegations in that sport.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, reports of PFC use have extended beyond cyclists to
include even canoeists and thoroughbred race horses.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michel Audran, a professor of pharmacology and biophysics at
Montpellier University in France, is conducting research into EPO
and PFC detection. He has said he believes that some cyclists used
the substance at the Tour de France along with the more widely
known EPO and human growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty cyclists, all members of the three teams from whom drugs
were confiscated in the Tour, were ordered to give blood samples
for testing. One of them showed small traces of PFCs, according to
a laboratory employee who insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Audran said the possible use of PFCs had come to his attention
earlier, in May, during a stage of the Tour of Romandie in
Switzerland, when the Swiss cyclist Mauro Gianetti, unconscious and
in danger, was taken to a hospital in the little town of Montigny.
Doctors there were unable to diagnose the stricken rider's
condition, and within hours, Gianetti was transported by ambulance
to the university hospital in Lausanne, almost 40 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   According to a doctor in the Lausanne hospital who spoke on
condition of anonymity, the emergency room doctors suspected some
kind of infection and ordered the appropriate tests. Gianetti was
in intensive care for 10 days; all the tests came back negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``His symptoms were difficulty breathing, muscle pain,
gastroenteritis and what we call intravascular coagulation,'' the
doctor said. ``It was a very dangerous problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Two doctors from the Lausanne hospital suspected that Gianetti
had been given PFCs without his knowledge and reported their
suspicions, said Nicolas Cruchet, a judge in Lausanne. Cruchet
launched an official investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his home two weeks ago in Tessin, high in the Swiss
Alps, Gianetti laughed off the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I was very ill with an infection, but I didn't inject
myself with anything,'' he said. ``They thought that somebody had
given me something that was bad for my health. The investigation is
not against me. It is against somebody who could have given me
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Gianetti said he was in top condition, and he represented his
country at last week's World Cycling championships in Maastricht,
the Netherlands. He finished 35th, in a pack 14 minutes 46 minutes
behind the winner. Two years ago, he won a silver medal at the
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Although PFCs are not officially on the market, there is active
research into the products for legitimate medical use. Several
companies in the United States are developing PFCs in answer to the
chronic blood shortage. This problem, together with the inherent
risk of infection through blood transfusions, has fueled research
for an artificial blood. Oxycyte is one such PFC product that is
expected to enter clinical trials next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the product is oxygenated with 100 percent oxygen, then you
will have the effect of carrying oxygen to the muscle tissues at
five times the rate of hemoglobin,'' said Bob Nicora, president of
Synthetic Blood Institute based in Kettering, Ohio. ``Oxycyte is
the kind of product that there probably could be some sort of
underground sports use. There's no way to control that.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the IOC has reacted cautiously to the rumors of PFC
use. ``The International Olympic Committee is concerned by any kind
of practice which may be harmful to the athletes' health and also
which may be against the idea of fair competition,'' Patrick
Schamasch, the IOC's medical director, said last week in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``These drugs are not even licensed for use in medical practice.
We must first try to investigate for the moment and try to collect
some samples and gather information,'' he said. ``For sure at our
next meeting of the IOC medical doping subcommission, we will speak
of it. That meeting is in December.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique, a lab in
Pointe Claire, Quebec, Dr. Christiane Ayotte expects to receive
samples of PFCs soon. She and her staff will run the samples
through a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer, the most advanced
doping control technology available.
</P>
<P>
   Normally Ayotte or her staff ingest ``mystery drugs'' themselves
_ always in small quantities _ to identify the various metabolites
in the urine. This gives a basis for future detection. Not this
time, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not inject ourselves with this stuff,'' Ayotte said.
``No way. I am too frightened of this.''

CREATING HOUSING WITHOUT U.S. SUBSIDIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Md., Colo.)  (bl) 
 By HARRIET KING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   MILL CREEK, Wash. _ With the Seattle job market strong and the
housing market tight, the Housing Authority in next-door Snohomish
County has moved away from its traditional role and become a
builder, on a break-even basis, of for-sale housing for
moderate-income working families. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fifty manufactured houses on a five-acre site called Thomas
Place will be sold this fall to first-time buyers whose households
earn from $25,000 to $60,000 a year. Median income for a family of
four in the county is $59,000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The average price of new houses constructed in the county by
private builders in the '90s is $193,960, an indication that
younger buyers are for the most part forced out of the market.
Three-bedroom houses in Thomas Place sell for $63,800,
four-bedrooms for $79,750. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Housing Authority's mission had mainly been to
produce and maintain low-income rental housing with the help of
government subsides. The agency owns more than 1,200 units of low-
and moderate-income housing and offers rent subsidies in 1,900
additional units.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But with the disappearance of federal money to build new low-
and moderate-income housing, local governments have asked housing
agencies to create home-ownership programs for working people in
need of housing, said Robert Davis, executive director of the
Snohomish County Housing Authority. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are well organized, solvent and have the construction and
financing expertise to do this,'' Davis said. ``We are not taking
anything away from the other services we provide.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Housing Authority is not alone among other such agencies
searching for ways to produce housing without federal subsidies.
``Because the federal government has stopped funding new affordable
housing, local agencies are finding other ways to meet their
needs,'' said Richard Y. Nelson Jr., executive director of the
National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Springs, Colo., Housing Authority will complete
construction in six weeks of 20 town houses that it is financing.
``We're ready to sign contracts with six first-time buyers and we
are screening 100 applications to buy the remaining 14 homes,''
says Richard Sullivan, executive director of the authority.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Qualified buyers are families earning 60 to 80 percent of the
city's median income. The 80 percent figure is $36,650.
</P>
<P>
   Mortgages are financed through the Colorado Housing Finance
Authority, which requires just a $1,000 down payment on a house.
Two 30-year mortgages are offered to qualified buyers to cover the
cost of a house _ one for 75 percent of the cost at 5.4 percent by
the finance agency, the other for 25 percent of the cost at 1.5
percent by the Colorado Springs Housing authority.
</P>
<P>
   A two-bedroom, 1,500-square-foot house costs $98,000 and a
2,000-square-foot, three-bedroom house $104,000, compared to the
market range of $115,000 to $125,000. A homeowners' association
will hold the land. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Montgomery County, Md., a densely built suburban county
adjacent to Washington, D.C., developers are granted greater
density in exchange for setting aside 15 percent of the housing
units in a project for moderate-income families at below-market
rents or sale prices. The Housing Authority then buys a third of
the units in that 15 percent to rent as subsidized housing.
</P>
<P>
   At Thomas Place, close to Mill Creek and about 20 minutes north
of downtown Seattle on Interstate 5, there were more than 250
applications to buy the dwellings within days after models opened
in mid-August. The energy-efficient models, ranging in size from
1,080 to 1,400 square feet, had two-car carports or garages, high
vaulted ceilings, French doors, wood exterior siding, oak cabinets
in the kitchen and an oval tub in the master-bedroom suite. ``This
interest exceeds our wildest expectation,'' said Ann Schroeder
Osterberg, the Housing Authority's director of corporate planning.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers need a $2,500 down payment, for which the Housing
Authority provides assistance to its lowest-income buyers at 2
percent interest and the Washington Manufactured Housing
Association will give five new owners whose income is 50 percent or
less of the median grants up to $2,500 each.
</P>
<P>
   To build as many dwellings as possible, the houses fill most of
the lots, which range in size from 2,800 to 5,300 square feet, with
only five-foot spaces between the houses and ``postage stamp''
backyards.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the rundown Thomas Lake Mobile Home Park
occupied a corner of the property. Occupants were in danger of
losing their housing because septic and water systems were failing.
The Housing Authority acquired the land and brought in emergency
services. The trailer park will be phased out as occupants move,
and nine of the 50 units will be built there.
</P>
<P>
   The Housing Authority will continue to own the property and is
charging a monthly land lease of $295 for the lots ranging in size
from 2,800 square feet to 5,300 square feet. The money will be
returned to Thomas Place to pay for water and sewers, garbage
pickup, roads, street lights, landscaping and a resident manager's
salary.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A home buyer's total monthly costs will be between $700 to $900,
including the monthly land lease, compared to an average of $900
and up to rent a three-bedroom unit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Place will cost the Housing Authority about $5 million
when developed. Some $1.1 million from the Washington State Housing
Trust Fund, which offers grants and loans to public and nonprofit
agencies to develop low-income housing, and the federal Community
Development Block Grant will go toward buying the property for
$360,000 and renovating the trailer park and infrastructure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seafirst Bank, a Bank of America subsidiary, provided a line of
credit to finance infrastructure. The Housing Authority issued $1
million in bonds to repay this loan. In addition, it issued $2.9
million in revenue bonds and sold them to private investors.
</P>
<P>
   This created the pool for mortgages that the Housing Authority
provides at 7.012 percent fixed interest for 30 years, a rate
comparable to that charged for traditional ``stick-built'' housing.
Buyers must have stable employment and not be saddled with
excessive debt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The new owners will have an easy 20-minute commute south into
Seattle, Bellevue and Redmond, home of companies such as Microsoft,
or to Everett to the north where Boeing operates a jet assembly
plant.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Snohomish housing agency had previously constructed on
various sites about a dozen houses that it sold to residents
earning about 80 percent of the county's median income. But, said
Ms. Schroeder Osterberg, ``we concluded this was the expensive way
to go.'' Manufactured homes cost about one third less ``and
provided us with a more affordable product.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Thomas Place homes built by Moduline Industries of Chehalis,
Wash., bear little resemblance to the wide, metal-sided,
interior-paneled homes of the past, says Joan Brown, executive
director of the Washington Manufactured Housing Association. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had major advances, the industry has stepped up to the
energy issue and when a manufacturer says to Maytag `I need 10,000
dishwashers,' the company can cut a pretty good price,'' said Mrs.
Brown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that ``based on the incredible success'' of Thomas
Place, providing two-story manufactured homes for working people
will be his next step ``so we can get the best property density.''
But, he added, ``it is a couple of years away, the land use process
takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   Across Puget Sound from Seattle, the Kitsap County Consolidated
Housing Authority plans to build several hundred manufactured
homes, mostly on land it owns near Bremerton that is platted for
250 houses. It will retain land ownership so home buyers can avoid
the expense of property taxes.

6,000 IN HEAD OF THE CHARLES REGATTA 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By NORMAN HILDES-HEIM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 34th annual Head of the Charles regatta, the autumn rowing
festival in Boston with an entry of close to 6,000 North American
and international collegiate, club and veteran rowers, began
competition Saturday over a three-mile stretch of the Charles
River.
</P>
<P>
   Originally patterned after the English-style races in which
crews compete against the clock rather than in side-by-side racing,
the Head of the Charles has evolved its own American flavor, equal
parts competition and rowing reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of former competitive rowers joined with current
participants and parents, all sporting the colors of their favorite
crews, to cheer on their teams as they raced upstream.
</P>
<P>
   The cheering should reach a crescendo for Sunday's final of the
men's championship eight, when the U.S. national team, racing for
the first time since winning the gold medal at the world rowing
championships in Cologne, Germany, last month, seeks to defend its
Head of the Charles title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've mixed up the boat,'' said Mike Teti, the men's national
team coach. ``Wolf Moser, who captained Harvard last year, will
stroke because Harvard starts right behind us. That should give
Wolf a real incentive.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Ahrens, who stroked the U.S. eight to a gold medal in the
1997 world championships and then repeated that performance this
year in Cologne to achieve the first back-to-back world eight-oar
titles in U.S. rowing history, will be in the two seat Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris is a special guy in a very unassuming way, and is
supportive of everyone,'' said Teti, who first coached Ahrens as a
Princeton freshman before moving on two years ago to become the
National Team coach, bringing Ahrens along and installing him in
the stroke seat of the eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have tried to do on the National Team is create the
same atmosphere as the oarsmen had in college,'' Teti said. ``No
rower in America ever picked up an oar for the first time and said,
`I want to be in the Olympics.' They picked it up because it looked
like fun. Other coaches might say my approach is a bit immature,
but I'm no intellectual and believe rowing should be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Teti, the second oldest of 10 siblings, started rowing in the
spring of his junior year at Monsignor Bonner High School near
Philadelphia ``as a good way to stay in shape for football.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time his senior year rolled around, football was
forgotten. Teti has been rowing ever since, as a student at St.
Joseph's University in Philadelphia and as a member of the U.S.
National Team from 1977 until 1993. He has won numerous medals,
including a gold as the bowman in the 1987 world championship
eight. That same year Teti was chosen National Team oarsman of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, in his first year coaching the National Team,
the United States regained the eight-oar title, and then retained
it this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Kaehler, 34, the two-man in this year's eight who will sit
out the race Saturday to give other squad members a chance to
compete, knows Teti both as a former teammate and now as his coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean this unkindly, but it's nice to have an American
coaching us,'' said Kaehler, alluding to the previous National Team
coaches who were from Europe. ``It's special having Mike.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kaehler will get a chance to watch Teti race with his reunioning
1988 Seoul Olympic eight racing in the same event as his world
champion teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I know who will win that one,'' said Teti. In the
spirit of the Head of the Charles, Kaehler will have two favorites
to cheer on.

<P>
   LOWER ZAMBEZI PARK, Zambia _ Five tons of bull elephant stood
its ground, immovable as bedrock, eyeballing us and our 20-foot
boat, which seemed to be shrinking by the second as we drifted
closer to shore. Jonathan Pyper, our guide, kept one hand on the
throttle, alternating worried glances at both the idling outboard
and the huge beast now less than 100 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go ahead,'' he said quietly to Scott Swanson, who stood ready
on the bow clutching a heavy baitcasting rod. Swanson nodded and
pitched a gold spoon toward the grassy shoreline. Too late. The
bull instantly threw up its trunk and snorted loudly, a clear
warning that we were dangerously close to invading that most sacred
domain: an elephant's personal space. Pyper punched the throttle
forward and off we went, gladly conceding that section of the lower
Zambezi River to those who call it home.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson and I had come to the Kayila Lodge in Zambia seeking
tigerfish, a fearsome predator with the streamlined body of a
bonefish and the teeth of a piranha. Up to that point, I had never
seen one, except for an illustration of a particularly
deranged-looking specimen in ``McClane's Fishing Encyclopedia.''
</P>
<P>
   For me, casting among hippos and crocodiles along this famous
African river felt like the adventure of a lifetime. Swanson, on
the other hand, who works for Quest Global Angling Adventures, a
travel agency for anglers, considered it all in a day's work. After
we spent the afternoon fruitlessly casting for tigerfish, he left
the next morning to sample Mozambique's near-virgin sportfishing.
``It's a tough job,'' he said smiling, before being whisked off in
one of the lodge's boats for the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Which left Pyper and me with the task of boating a tigerfish, no
small order since the season was still weeks away from its October
peak. We decided to stay in camp, fishing from the lodge's dock in
a large eddy where several 10-pounders were hooked a few days
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   With two hippos rumbling away on the far shore, I worked a heavy
spinner, letting it sink deep in the slow current. Pyper stuck to a
local favorite _ a bait rig sweetened with a piece of cut
tigerfish.
</P>
<P>
   Right away Pyper felt a pickup. He tensed, studying the rod, but
soon realized by the repeated light taps that a small tiger had his
bait. ``A boy on a man's errand,'' he said in his British colonial
accent, lifting the rig away from the juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   We fished into the afternoon with no action. Pyper kept me
entertained with tales of ``tigahs'' splintering plugs in a single
chomp and his recent near misses with lions and poisonous snakes.
From the beginning, he struck me as the classic African bush guide,
looking the part in his full safari garb, as if he had just
swaggered off the set of a John Huston movie. Between stories, he
would point out soaring African fish eagles or herds of grazing
impala or troops of baboons lounging along the bank.
</P>
<P>
   My spinner stopped dead. I set the hook and immediately saw a
bright silver fish of about four pounds clear the water 30 feet
away and throw my lure. I had just hooked my first tigerfish, if
only for a second. Pyper seemed unfazed and suggested that I use
something with a single hook instead of a treble, which he assured
me a tiger could easily crush in its jaws. I opted instead for my
flyrod, thinking that a big streamer might get past a tiger's
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   But this was Africa, where huge beasts can take center stage in
a heartbeat. Just as I readied to cast, an immense bull elephant
lumbered out of the brush behind us and strolled into camp,
followed by another, then a third and finally a fourth. Right away
Pyper recognized the big bull as Two-V, a camp regular named for
the V-shaped notches on each ear. We watched motionless as the
group passed 50 feet from where we stood, thankfully ignoring us.
The large marula tree ripe with berries standing in the camp's
center was not so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   The elephants surrounded the big tree. Then Two-V took charge.
He wrapped his trunk around one of the larger limbs and shook _
hard _ sending thousands of berries cascading down like hail, along
with various leaves and not-so-small branches. All four elephants
then went about picking up the berries with their trunks and
passing them to their mouths, looking as casual as old men eating
pretzels in a bar.
</P>
<P>
   Pyper sighed. ``Old Two-V is really getting to be a bore,'' he
said, fighting back a smile. (He would later confess how much he
admired the camp's visiting ``ellies.'')
</P>
<P>
   The scene bordered on the ridiculous: 4 elephants _ 20 tons
worth _ lounging, periodically shaking the tree to send down a
salvo of berries, my long-forgotten flyrod abandoned on the dock,
with Pyper and me utterly fascinated. I would not catch a tigerfish
on this trip. But at that point, as Africa roared around me, I
could not have cared less. &QL;

SCHUMER AND D'AMATO LOOK FOR AN EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato charged across upstate New York on
Saturday, mocking Rep. Charles Schumer as ``The Phantom'' for
missing votes in Congress this year. Schumer campaigned by marking
the six-year anniversary of D'Amato's pledge, later abandoned, not
to run again if voters rewarded him with a third term.
</P>
<P>
   With identical props _ a videotape player and a television
monitor _ to display their latest attack advertisements, D'Amato
and Schumer used a crisp and pleasant fall Saturday to offer the
scathing assessments of each other that have come to define their
campaign for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato said Schumer was a derelict legislator who had neglected
his congressional duties by skipping votes this year. Schumer said
D'Amato was untrustworthy, offering as evidence the promise the
senator made in the heat of the 1992 campaign to retire from
politics if voters sent him to Washington for a final term in
which, D'Amato said then, he would not be guided by re-election
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges came as the candidates tried to make the most out
of the dwindling number of weekends left before Election Day, each
trying to seize the offensive as they headed into the last two
weeks of a contest that both campaigns view as excruciatingly
close.
</P>
<P>
   Their choice of campaign stops Saturday indicated where D'Amato
and Schumer see their strengths. D'Amato campaigned in five upstate
cities, bouncing around in a private plane before returning home to
New York. Schumer campaigned in Manhattan and Albany.
</P>
<P>
   It was D'Amato's second swing upstate in a week, and it
suggested the importance that the Republican senator had attached
to a strong showing in a part of the state where Republicans have
historically done well. Saturday was also, for D'Amato, a day of
familiar attacks: for the 17th day in a row, he assailed Schumer
for missing votes in Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has a 77 percent attendance record in Congress this
year, missing slightly more than 100 votes, mostly on procedural
matters or on bills that passed by overwhelming margins. His
lifetime attendance record during his 18 years in Congress is just
under 93 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To make his point, D'Amato described his own efforts to bring
aid to upstate New York after it was devastated by winter storms
this year. Speaking at an airport terminal in Rochester to about
100 supporters, D'Amato noted that Schumer was absent when the bill
first came up in the House.
</P>
<P>
   And D'Amato noted that although Schumer was present when the
bill came up for a final vote, he voted against it. ``We're better
off if The Phantom hadn't shown up,'' D'Amato said, ``because The
Phantom voted against aid to the North Country.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has said he opposed the measure, as did most other
Democrats, because he viewed it as a partisan bill that financed
the emergency assistance with deep cuts in housing funds.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, Schumer took advantage of one of D'Amato's most
famous 1992 campaign moments _ his pledge to retire from politics _
with the help of a 59-by-47-inch blowup of the Oct. 18, 1992, front
page of The Daily News. ``D'Amato Stunner: My Last Run,'' the
headline said. His audience of supporters burst out laughing when
the placard was unveiled.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman from Brooklyn has repeatedly described D'Amato
as untrustworthy _ the tag line on a new Schumer advertisement that
features the Daily News headline is ``Too many lies for too long''
_ and he asserted that this particular broken promise was evidence
of that.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer noted that D'Amato said in 1992 that he was making the
pledge because he wanted to spend six years in the Senate without
people asserting that his behavior was motivated by re-election
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know what he did right after he got elected?'' Schumer
said. ``He became chairman of the national Senate Republican
Campaign Committee, the most blatantly political position you can
hold. Then, shortly after that, he embarked on his partisan and
political inquisition of the first family.''
</P>
<P>
   In Rochester, D'Amato, whose itinerary also included stops in
Buffalo, Syracuse, Binghamton and Plattsburgh, responded to Schumer
by repeating the explanation he gave when he first signaled,
shortly after Election Day 1992, that this was one campaign promise
that might not be kept.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato said that in light of his victory, and with some rest,
he reconsidered his position and decided that he would like to
continue his career in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato was traveling in what his aides considered friendly
territory Saturday, and at the arranged rallies in airport
terminals, he was greeted by chants of ``Six more years.'' Even so,
the senator found himself scrapping with a reporter at one upstate
news conference over the nature of his attacks on Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may find that personally embarrassing,'' said D'Amato,
referring to Schumer's reaction to attacks on his attendance
record. ``But don't you think that it's reasonable or fair to pull
that out? I ask you, in all intellectual honesty _ forget the fact
that you don't like me.''
</P>
<P>
   When the reporter challenged that assertion, D'Amato responded
acidly, ``It's dripping through.''

NEW YORK'S EMBATTLED SEX SHOPS FIND SURVIVAL TACTIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID ROHDE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three months after a spate of highly publicized
padlockings heralded the arrival of the Giuliani administration's
crackdown on this city's sex shop industry, a string of legal
victories by adult-business owners has turned what looked like a
speedy rout into a war of attrition.
</P>
<P>
   Since the crackdown began in late July, 59 of the 144 strip
clubs and adult video stores affected by a new zoning law have
closed or shifted to nonadult entertainment, city officials say.
But state judges have continued to uphold a legal strategy that for
now is allowing many of the shops and clubs to stay open under the
new law.
</P>
<P>
   To the frustration of their opponents, adult video stores and
some strip clubs that limit pornography sales and nude dancing to
less than 40 percent of their floor space are continuing to be
declared ``nonadult'' by state judges, which enables them to remain
open.
</P>
<P>
   But how long the businesses can withstand their plunging profit
margins and soaring legal expenses remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Herald Price Fahringer, the lawyer representing the majority of
the 144 sex shops affected by the new law, said the two Harmony
Theaters in Manhattan that were closed in the first round of
padlockings wanted to adjust to meet the 40 percent standard and
reopen.
</P>
<P>
   But he accused the Giuliani administration of systematically
denying the businesses the building permits they need to
reconfigure. Fahringer said he would file a lawsuit in federal
court in Manhattan within the next two weeks accusing the city of
unfairly blocking building permits and harassing the sex shops
through repeated health and fire code inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a memo that was circulated in the Buildings Department
that they were to put a stop to the issuing of building permits for
adult clubs,'' Fahringer said. ``I think that shows the city is
interested in simply closing these business, not getting them to
conform with the law.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last month in Queens, Judge Alan LeVine ordered the reopening of
a strip club padlocked under the new law, ruling that the city had
unfairly delayed issuing a building permit. The law bars any
business that devotes a ``substantial portion'' of its floor space
or merchandise to adult entertainment from operating in residential
areas or within 500 feet of a school, a house of worship or another
sex shop.
</P>
<P>
   Over the objections of lawyers for the city, LeVine ruled that
Goldfingers, at 92-77 Queens Boulevard in Rego Park, could reopen
with only curtains cordoning off the 40 percent ``adult'' section
of the bar, court officials said. The judge had ordered the club to
build permanent walls but said that as long as the city refused to
issue the building permit, the club could reopen with only
curtains.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Fishner, who is Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's criminal justice
coordinator, said health and fire inspectors were visiting the
strip clubs, but said the clubs had not been made targets. ``We're
treating them as we treat all other businesses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Fishner said one Manhattan strip club, Dangerous Curves, at
127 E. 47th St., was padlocked two weeks ago after it failed to
correct a violation discovered during a Health Department
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that in the last six weeks, the city has issued
criminal summonses at 11 sex shops that it says violate the new
zoning law. The summonses, unlike the lengthy nuisance abatement
court actions the city is using to padlock the clubs, can only
result in fines.
</P>
<P>
   Fahringer cited the summonses as an example of the unusual
tactics the Giuliani administration was using, and pointed out that
zoning violations were usually resolved with administrative
hearings, not padlock orders and summonses.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the crackdown has succeeded in closing 39 adult
businesses and changed the tone of New York's once-growing sex shop
industry. Many adult video stores have torn down their more overt
signs and constructed adult back rooms that make up less than 40
percent of their floor space.
</P>
<P>
   Strip clubs have been hit much harder, and many have had to
dismiss dancers. Still-employed dancers complain that their
earnings plummeted when they began dancing with bikinis on to avoid
having their clubs considered ``adult.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a Sept. 23 ruling, Judge Steven Fisher of Queens
presented what could prove to be salvation for the strip clubs.
Causing angry protests from local residents, Fisher allowed
Wiggles, a strip club at 96-24 Queens Boulevard, Rego Park, to
reopen after it restricted nude dancing to a room that made up less
than 40 percent of its floor space. That was the first ruling to
apply the 40 percent standard to strip clubs.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, Judge Arthur Lonschein in Queens ruled that the
formerly all-adult Fair Theater in East Elmhurst, Queens, could
remain open because it was now showing adult films on less than 40
percent of its screens. The rulings all come in the wake an August
ruling by Judge Stephen Crane of Manhattan that the 40 percent
standard was valid.
</P>
<P>
   Crane's ruling was a major setback for the Giuliani
administration and allowed Show World, a Times square sex shop that
was one of the chief targets of the crackdown, to remain open.
</P>
<P>
   But Fishner pointed to other rulings in the city's favor, and
warned that the city may appeal rulings it disagrees with. And
watered-down sex shops, he predicted, will not prove to be
economically viable.

   AN IDEOLOGICAL SECRET? THAT IS THE QUESTION
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's 2nd Congressional District has long been in
Democratic hands, centered as it is on the university town of
Boulder, northwest of Denver. But when the seat opened up this year
with the retirement of Rep. David Skaggs and Republicans nominated
former Mayor Bob Greenlee, the conventional political wisdom was
that Democrats could no longer take their lock on the district for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   Greenlee did not become mayor of Boulder by espousing hard-right
Republican conservatism. He talked fiscal conservatism and social
moderation, including the right of a woman to have an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   He still says he is a fiscal conservative and a social moderate,
and it appears many voters believe him. By most estimates, he and
his Democratic opponent, state Rep. Mark Udall, are in a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   But Udall, son of Morris Udall, the former Arizona congressman
and presidential candidate, is buying none of it. He contends that
Greenlee is a secret right-winger who is in ideological synch with
the Heritage Foundation, the Washington-based organization whose
analysts tend to take an unadulterated view of conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenlee claims to be a moderate,'' Udall said Friday. ``Yet
the central document of his campaign is taken directly from a
right-wing think tank.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Udall, Greenlee not only took the Foundation's
ideas when he drew up his campaign manifesto but lifted many of
them ``word for word'' from the foundation's documents without
giving them credit. Udall then offered two dozen examples, pairing
a paragraph he said came from a foundation document with a
paragraph from a Greenlee campaign booklet.
</P>
<P>
   Typical was this pairing of paragraphs discussing school choice
programs, an education financing approach that Greenlee supports
and Udall opposes:
</P>
<P>
   The Greenlee booklet says, ``Whether in the form of school
vouchers, opportunity scholarships, education tax credits or
education savings accounts, school choice programs offer families
the means to send their children to any local school of their
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation document says, ``Whether in the form of school
vouchers or scholarships, education tax credits and deductions or
education savings accounts, school choice programs offer families
the means to send their children to the school of their choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Udall concluded, ``Greenlee knows he should have acknowledged
how much of this was taken word-for-word from the Heritage
Foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenlee's campaign manager, Sean Murphy, acknowledged that the
foundation was ``a good resource for us.'' But he denied Udall's
charge that Greenlee had been underhanded with both the foundation
and voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Greenlee does not fit neatly into any ideological boxes,''
he said. ``He is in direct conflict with some Heritage Foundation
positions.''

   ANTI-TAX CAMPAIGN DELAYED, NOT DEFEATED
</P>
<P>
   Up in the northwest corner of Arkansas earlier this year, some
affluent landowners, many empty-nest retirees, grew weary of paying
the state's property tax, the main source of money for public
schools. So they passed around a petition that called for
abolishing the levy and replacing it with an increase in the sales
tax.
</P>
<P>
   They found plenty of support, much of it from well beyond
northwest Arkansas. And shortly they had enough signatures to put
their proposition to a statewide vote this fall.
</P>
<P>
   They also had the hottest political issue in Arkansas in 1998,
one whose antecedents could be traced to Proposition 13, the
citizens initiative of two decades back that capped the property
tax in California.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas proposal, because of its basic pocketbook appeal,
has dominated campaign debate like no other cause or race.
</P>
<P>
   Its supporters have argued that it would provide Arkansas
residents with long-overdue relief from a tax that has been raised
over the years to the point of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure _ including most top state officials
and dozens of educators, police chiefs and mayors _ have countered
that it would be a disaster for the Arkansas school system and
ultimately would force the state back into the poverty it has
struggled so hard to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   But as of last week, when polls showed the proposition headed
for passage, such arguments were moot. On Thursday the Arkansas
Supreme Court struck the proposition from the ballot, saying its
supporters had used improper procedures, including forgery, to
gather signatures.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the petition drive, Oscar Stilley, a Fort Smith
lawyer, denied any wrongdoing and vowed to start a new petition
drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're back in 2000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   AN ANNOUNCEMENT: CANDIDATE HAS BABY
</P>
<P>
   Jane Swift, the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor in
Massachusetts, gave birth on Friday in Boston to a 7-pound 6-ounce
girl, Elizabeth Ruth Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Swift made political headlines and sparked debates about
parenting in the workplace when she announced last spring that she
was a candidate for both public office and motherhood. Though women
are no longer a rarity in political office, it is still rare to
find a pregnant woman running for office or holding office.
</P>
<P>
   Some social conservatives argued last spring after Ms. Swift's
announcement that a woman's place is in the home, not the
workplace, especially when it comes to having and rearing a child.
Social libertarians countered that today's woman can, and should,
have it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were split on whether a pregnant candidate was a
political disaster ``growing larger by the day,'' as one put it, or
``a political advertiser's dream come true,'' as another said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, Ms. Swift, 33, a former state senator who is
married to Charles Hunt, a construction contractor, easily won
nomination in last month's Republican primary. And in a campaign in
which parenting in the workplace appears not to be an issue, polls
indicate that she and her running mate, Acting Gov. Paul Cellucci,
hold a slight lead over their Democratic opponents, Attorney
General Scott Harshbarger and state Sen. Warren Tolman.
</P>
<P>
   One thing more: Mother and baby are doing fine.

   A cold front from the central Great Lakes to eastern Texas will
be accompanied by a band of clouds and areas of showers as it moves
east during the day. Periods of rain and a few thunderstorms with
gusty winds are expected across the northern Great Lakes Sunday
morning as a potent jet stream disturbance moves overhead. In the
wake of the front, chilly breezes from the north will deliver drier
air. Nevertheless, low clouds and a few sprinkles will linger over
the northern Mississippi Valley. The northern and central Plains
will be seasonably cool with ample sunshine in most areas.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Eastern states will become unseasonably warm. After
a cool dawn from the Appalachians to the Atlantic Seaboard,
increasing winds from the southwest will promote rapidly rising
temperatures. Wind gusts over 25 miles an hour will be common from
the eastern Ohio Valley to New England. Clouds will increase Sunday
afternoon west of the Appalachians as the cold front approaches
from the Middle West. A few showers will spread into the eastern
parts of the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes during the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Moist breezes from the east will be lifted over a cold front
resulting in locally heavy rain and some flash flooding over parts
of southern and eastern Texas. Otherwise, the southern Plains will
be mainly dry and cool.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, a weak front will bring broken clouds and showers
to the northern Rockies. Meanwhile, offshore winds will favor
abundant sunshine along most of the West Coast. The interior West
will be cool and sunny.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Descent Into Winter
</P>
<P>
   Winter comes quickly in Alaska. Daytime temperatures in
Fairbanks in early October average in the lower 40s. By October 31,
typical temperatures will be in the lower 20s with nighttime lows
near five degrees. The lengthening nights, which allow the ground
to efficiently lose energy, are an incubator for frigid air masses
that will grip the 49th state in the months ahead. Fairbanks loses
an average of seven minutes of possible sunlight for each day in
October. The month begins with the sun above the horizon for over
11 hours and ends with only seven hours and 54 minutes of light.

<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who ruled Chile
as a despot for 17 years, has been arrested in London after Spain
asked that he be extradited for the presumed murders of hundreds of
Chilean and Spanish citizens, the British authorities announced
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Chilean government immediately demanded his release, arguing
that he has diplomatic immunity since he sits in the Chilean
Senate. But so far the British and Spanish authorities have
shrugged off the protests, setting up what promises to be a legal
struggle that could have wide implications for the prosecution of
alleged human rights violators under international law.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, who is 82 and who stepped down as commander in chief
of the Chilean military five months ago, was arrested by the
British police on Friday night, little more than a week after he
arrived in London for surgery on a herniated disc.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant said the general was wanted for questioning for
``crimes of genocide and terrorism that includes murder.'' British
authorities refused to say where Pinochet is being held; nor did
they set a date for when he would be questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since he led a violent coup to overthrow Salvador Allende
Gossens, the elected Socialist president in 1973, Pinochet has been
a political icon throughout Latin America, representing the
excesses of a long period of military rule and U.S. support for
right-wing strongmen who opposed Communism.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 3,000 Chileans were shot in the streets or
``disappeared'' during his rule, and a senior member of his regime
was imprisoned under U.S. pressure for the murder of former Foreign
Minister Orlando Letelier in Washington in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet cast a long and wide shadow in economic affairs as
well, launching a privatized social security system and other free
market policies that set examples that are still models from
Argentina to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Under a Constitution that he guided to enactment, Pinochet was
able to become a senator for life upon his retirement from the
military, a position that afforded him continued political
influence and immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of disappeared people and political opponents have
filed several lawsuits in Chile seeking to take away his immunity,
but they are given little chance of success.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Chileans are deeply divided in their opinion of the
Pinochet legacy, with approximately a third of the country viewing
him as a hero, another third viewing him as a villain and the rest
voicing ambiguous opinions to pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Spanish judicial official said Saturday that Judge
Baltasar Garzon issued the international arrest warrant against
Pinochet on Friday after Interpol warned that the former dictator
was about to be released from the hospital and would probably leave
London.
</P>
<P>
   A British Foreign Office spokesman, who declined to be
identified by name, said the general's arrest was ``a judicial
matter, one for the police and the magistrates.'' But he said ``one
point that does fall to us, he does not have diplomatic immunity in
this country.'' The spokesman declined any further comment.
</P>
<P>
   An official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Pinochet
had been arrested ``at the direct, specific request of the Spanish
authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Spanish lawyers said the request for Pinochet's extradition had
been sent to Scotland Yard through Interpol. The request was based
on the European Convention on Terrorism, which requires members to
help one another in matters related to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The initial warrant is based on a single case of the kidnapping
and disappearance in 1976 of a Chilean leftist leader, Edgaro
Henriquez, 35.

   The Spanish judicial official said that Garzon is planning on
Monday to send to British authorities the names of 78 other people
of various nationalities who were also kidnapped in Chile and taken
to Argentina where they disappeared between 1976 and 1983. He will
also seek the general's extradition to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon has also demanded the extradition of various former
Argentina junta rulers, but Argentina has refused to abide by
warrants. The focus of his investigation is the so-called Condor
Plan, in which the military juntas of various Latin American
countries allegedly collaborated to eliminate their enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Both President Eduardo Frei of Chile and President Eduardo Menem
of Argentina have resisted the Spanish legal motions, arguing that
they infringe on their nations' sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International, the human rights group long critical of
Pinochet, earlier this week urged the British government to assist
the Spanish judges in their prosecution of the former dictator. In
a statement, the group said, ``This would be a clear manifestation
of the British government's commitment to human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights and international law experts expressed
enthusiastic support Saturday for the British arrest, and said it
could have wide implications.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts noted that since the Nuremberg trials after World
War II, all countries theoretically have been obliged to take
responsibility for crimes against humanity, thereby denying safe
haven to promoters of international crimes like genocide. However,
suspected war criminals, once granted amnesties in their own
countries, have usually been safe from prosecution when they
traveled abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Garces, a Spanish lawyer representing 4,000 victims of the
Pinochet regime, said the case against the general was based on
international legal principles that there is no immunity for those
responsible for crimes against humanity, even if they served as
heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Orentlicher, a law professor and director of the War
Crimes Research Office at American University in Washington, said
the British and Spanish actions put ``teeth into the legal
principle'' that abusers of human rights are international
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central point of all of this is that crimes against
humanity transcend the concerns of the countries where the abuses
are committed,'' she said. ``In theory, there should be no safe
haven for world class criminals, but the central problem has been
the enforcement of the law depends on the mobilization of the
world's consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Chile said on Saturday that it would file a formal protest.
``What we must do is make clear that Mr. Pinochet is a senator who
travels with a diplomatic passport,'' said Mario Artaza, Chile's
ambassador to London, in a radio interview Saturday. Artaza added
that Pinochet would not be able testify any time soon because he
was recuperating from painful surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Chilean officials who served in the Pinochet government have so
far been left virtually untouched for their alleged crimes because
the armed forces still command broad political influence.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Argentina, several military officials served
prison sentences in the 1980s, but they were released under amnesty
laws enacted in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   However, retired Gen. Jorge Videla, who led one of the Argentine
juntas that ruled while Pinochet was in power in Chile, is
currently under house arrest as a judge investigates his alleged
role in kidnapping newborn children of political prisoners so they
might be adopted by military families.

BIG UNION ACCUSED OF INADEQUATE CHECKS ON FINANCIAL WRONGDOING 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As prosecutors investigate allegations that millions
of dollars were stolen from the city's largest union of municipal
workers, months of disclosures paint a picture of rampant
corruption, in which money flowed freely and there was a startling
lack of financial controls.
</P>
<P>
   Top union officials, including Stanley Hill, the politically
powerful director of District Council 37, the umbrella group
representing 120,000 city workers, acknowledge that they exerted
little financial oversight of the council's 56 locals, even in the
face of clear excesses. The district council and its parent union
even point fingers at each other for failing to provide financial
oversight of the wayward locals.
</P>
<P>
   One local paid $92,000 for a Christmas party and often paid a
caterer more than $10,000 for food for union meetings that fewer
than 100 people attended. At the local representing City
University's clerical workers, members have demanded an
investigation into the disappearance of $192,000.
</P>
<P>
   And the president of the council's largest local received
$685,000 for fraudulent overtime expenses, according to a union
judicial panel, after he claimed to have worked 35 hours of
overtime every week for four years. Hill approved those overtime
payments even though that local was already more than $5 million in
debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be a Monday morning quarterback,'' Hill said
in an interview. ``There were communications with my treasurer in
terms of making sure the local's board had approved this.''
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau has subpoenaed all
56 locals as he investigates unusual and inflated payments _ all
part of an inquiry into accusations of embezzlement and kickbacks
from caterers, lawyers, travel agents and others doing business
with the union.
</P>
<P>
   The spiraling allegations are a bitter setback to District
Council 37, once considered the nation's pre-eminent public sector
union, and to Hill, one of the city's most visible labor leaders
and a close ally of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The scandal not only
hurts the union's reputation and bargaining clout, but also
tarnishes Hill, whom many members have criticized as being too cozy
with the mayor. Hill accepted a two-year pay freeze for union
members and has done little to protest the expansion of workfare.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating a wave of indictments this fall, many union members
predict that the parent union, the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees, will soon put the whole district
council into trusteeship and push out Hill in an effort to clean
house.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the spiraling scandal, many union members are
asking pointed questions about Hill's effectiveness as council
leader and about how he could have let corruption gain such a
foothold in his once-revered union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often people have looked at their leadership position not
as an opportunity to serve, but as kind of a right to plunder,''
said Charles Ensley, president of the local representing 16,000
social service workers. ``I don't see how any of us can completely
absolve the district council of all responsibility _ it happened
during their watch.''
</P>
<P>
   The council Hill heads is an awkward structure in which the
presidents of the locals largely run their own affairs, although
the district council handles collective bargaining for all the
locals. Almost all of the locals' and council's money comes from
union dues the city collects when it pays its employees.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who took office 12 years ago, angrily rebuffs criticism
that he was delinquent in policing the locals' finances. The
district council has no power to audit the locals, he asserted,
saying that the locals should have done a better job running their
affairs and that the parent union had the real responsibility for
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   He said the locals' presidents, who jealously guard their power
and prerogatives, usually kept the district council out of the loop
about their financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A local president can go out there and authorize ABC and
Stanley Hill may not be aware of it,'' Hill said. ``How can the
local's auditor let it go? That's a good question.''
</P>
<P>
   The district council's controller, Alvin Warshaviak, put the
situation more starkly: ``We never, ever reviewed their books. We
never had anything to do with any of their expenditures.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation is not so simple, however, because many locals
were in debt and often asked the district council for loans, with
council officials often knowing how the loans would be spent.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the parent union contend that Hill and his
treasurer should have been the principal backstops to prevent
financial wrongdoing in the locals. ``Constitutionally, the
district council has relatively little authority in the auditing
area, but we count on them to alert us to problems in local
unions,'' said Larry Weinberg, general counsel for the parent
union. ``They can learn not by auditing the books, but by what they
observe in patterns of expenditures.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the parent union did not have the time or manpower to
audit its 3,600 locals nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's predecessor, Victor Gotbaum, took a more hands-on
approach in his 22 years running the council, saying that he often
had his treasurer inspect the locals' books. Gotbaum said he
occasionally pushed out officials after discovering that they had
pocketed union money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be technically true that we didn't have the power to
examine their books,'' Gotbaum said. ``But if we felt something was
wrong, we'd just look at the books or we'd call in the
international union. We had no trouble doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In other words, where there was a will, there was a way to
provide oversight. But with Hill steadfastly deferring to the
autonomy of locals, financial oversight fell through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Labor experts point to other reasons for the problems. Under
federal law, the government monitors public-sector unions far less
than private-sector ones. In addition, many union leaders know
little about financial management and are tempted by the huge sums
they handle.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed by the scandal, Hill and the parent union have raced
to adopt stricter financial rules. They now acknowledge that there
was not enough oversight and that many locals failed to provide
basic financial information to their members to help them detect
improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, the parent union, which has 1.3 million
members nationally, will be required to do annual audits of the 60
locals that have more than 2,000 members. In addition, all large
locals will have to file quarterly financial reports.
</P>
<P>
   As for the district council, its new rules not only give its
treasurer clear power to inspect the locals' finances, but also
require the locals to adhere to a new ethical code and to file
annual financial reports with the council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the new guidelines, we are 100 percent sure these things
won't happen again,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   The first hints of financial wrongdoing emerged last February
when the parent union put Local 372 into trusteeship because that
local, which represents 25,000 cafeteria aides and crossing guards,
was $10 million in debt and had not paid $500,000 in rent owed to
the district council. Most locals have their offices in the
council's headquarters, near City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In June, an internal union panel expelled Charles Hughes, the
local's president, finding that he had wrongly taken huge sums,
including $329,000 for personal credit card bills and $685,000 for
fraudulent overtime. Hughes says that he worked 35 hours of
overtime a week from 1994 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   These revelations disgraced a popular leader and political
heavyweight. Hughes was close to Giuliani and had appeared in a
campaign commercial for him last year. The members of his local,
most of them part-time, average about $10,000 yearly.
</P>
<P>
   With Hughes' local deeply in debt, he had an aide send a note to
the district council's treasurer, Robert Myers, asking the council
to pay him $685,000 in overtime claims. Myers wrote a series of
checks totaling that amount, counting them as additional debt that
Hughes' local owed the council.
</P>
<P>
   Myers paid the overtime not long after Hill and Myers had warned
Hughes to get his local's finances in order. They even persuaded
him to agree to monthly spending limits, but that agreement did not
stop the locals' deficit from soaring to $10 million last year from
$5.4 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   This episode enraged many union members. Internal critics say
Hill should have read Hughes the riot act years earlier about his
mushrooming deficit. And they questioned how Hughes and Myers could
have paid the $685,000 to Hughes when a union judicial panel later
found that the overtime requests were transparently fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   Hill defended the checks paid to Hughes, noting that the local's
executive board had approved the payments.
</P>
<P>
   Many members say Hill is too nice and has a hard time cracking
down on miscreants. To others, he is a chicken assigned to guard
the foxes. His role is to oversee leaders who play an instrumental
role in electing him, making it uncomfortable for him to ask tough
questions about their finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stanley Hill I think has integrity, but he's in a situation
where he doesn't have control,'' said James Miller, an expert on
public employee unions at the Cornell University School of
Industrial and Labor Relations. ``He is dependent on these people
for his position. There are really no checks and balances there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hill insists that he cracks down when necessary, noting that
in January he asked the parent union to place Hughes' local in
trusteeship. And he said he does not take electoral considerations
into account in deciding whether to punish union officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to representing this council, I am not a nice
guy,'' he said. ``Being a nice guy doesn't mean that you're not
tough. When there's a violation, we respond to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Shargel, Hughes' lawyer, said his client ``has been one
of the city's most effective and competent labor leaders.
Obviously, these allegations are disturbing. But it would be wrong
for people to rush to judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rosenthal, the new president of the motor vehicle
operators' local, asserted that Hill was less than aggressive in
pursuing accusations of wrongdoing. In a meeting last year,
Rosenthal and several dozen other union members complained to Hill
about what they saw as evidence of kickbacks and overspending. They
pointed out that before Rosenthal took office, $92,000 was spent on
the 1995 Christmas party and $11,000 was spent on 250 turkeys for
members at Christmas. They paid $44 each for turkeys that normally
cost about half that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we didn't feel Stanley was moving fast enough, the
members brought this information to the district attorney,''
Rosenthal said. But Hill said he had ordered an investigation and
an audit, adding that in his view it was unfortunate that the
local's members had gone to the district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics say that if Hill had adopted a tough,
anti-corruption approach early on, the district council would not
be facing a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the top, there's an incredible attitude of looking the
other way, of not questioning anything that anybody does,'' said
Arthur Schwartz, the lawyer for the motor vehicle operators' local.

VOTERS STILL SITTING ON FENCE IN D'AMATO-SCHUMER CONTEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also moved in ``a'' news file.)

<P>
   The contest between Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and Rep. Charles
Schumer remains close, according to five polls of New York state
voters conducted this month, while Gov. George Pataki continues to
lead his Democratic challenger, Peter Vallone, by a large margin.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate race, the differences between the two candidates
range from D'Amato at eight percentage points ahead to six points
behind. But the gap between the candidates is within each poll's
margin of sampling error, making the race a statistical tie.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent poll, conducted by The Daily News and WABC-TV,
is the only survey to show D'Amato ahead, leading by eight points.
The poll of 364 likely voters has a margin of sampling error of
plus or minus six percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   There is only a one-point difference between the candidates for
Senate in the polls conducted by Quinnipiac College, with 583
likely voters, and by Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research, with
803 likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer leads by four points in the New York Times/CBS News Poll
of 559 likely voters, and by five points in the poll of 502 likely
voters conducted by Manhattanville College. These polls have
margins of sampling error of plus or minus four points.
</P>
<P>
   The polls show Pataki's lead over Vallone ranging from 27 points
to 30 points. B. Thomas Golisano, the Independence Party candidate,
and Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, the Liberal Party nominee, are
both far behind in all the polls, getting 4 percent to 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in polls can be attributed to many things, including
question wording and order. The timing of the surveys can also
cause variations. The Daily News/WABC-TV poll was conducted about a
week after The Times/CBS News Poll was completed.
</P>
<P>
   The results of these polls are based on likely voters, whom
organizations define differently. For example, in the poll
conducted by Mason-Dixon, registered voters who said they would
definitely vote in November and have regularly voted in statewide
elections are considered likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   In the Daily News/WABC-TV poll, likely voters are those
registered voters who said they were following the election
closely, would definitely vote this year, and voted in 1992, when
D'Amato last ran for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Sampling error could also account for differences in the margins
of some polls. For example, with a sampling error of four points,
the 46 percent for Schumer in the Manhattanville poll could be as
high as 50 percent or as low as 42 percent; based on that poll, he
could be ahead by 13 points or behind by 3 points. &QL;

 By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For just an hour Saturday, Sammy Sosa the baseball
star took a back seat to Sammy Sosa the humanitarian, as Gov.
George Pataki and Jackie Robinson's widow, Rachel, saluted him as
the first recipient of the Jackie Robinson Empire State Freedom
Medal.
</P>
<P>
   The bronze medal was given to Sosa, the Dominican-born slugger
for the Chicago Cubs, in a ceremony at St. Clare's Hospital and
Health Center in Manhattan in recognition of his efforts to aid the
victims of Hurricane Georges. Later, Sosa attended a parade in his
honor up the Canyon of Heroes along lower Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Sammy represents that Jack also represented is someone
who is concerned and committed to change,'' Mrs. Robinson said. ``A
person who does everything he does with humility. He sets a very
high standard for this award.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Robinson and Pataki established the Jackie Robinson award
in 1997 at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.
It is to be awarded annually.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken, seemingly camera-shy Sosa appeared overwhelmed
by the honor. ``Every day,'' he said, ``I say to myself, `Thank
you, God, for giving me so much opportunity to give back to not
only my people and my country but to the American people.' It's
been unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa said he planned to return to the Dominican Republic early
next week to see for himself what Hurricane Georges did to his
country. Through the Sammy Sosa Relief Fund, he said he intends to
build a school and hospital near his hometown of San Pedro de
Macoris.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise gesture, Sosa gave Pataki the bat he used to hit
his 59th home run. Sosa hit 66 home runs this year; only Mark
McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals, who hit 70, has hit more in a
single season. Sosa and McGwire broke Roger Maris' longstanding
record of 61.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to give you the No. 62,'' Sosa told the governor,
``but I can't because it is in the Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as some of Sosa's entourage reminded him that he was
running late for an appearance at a hospital in the Bronx, he still
made time to visit some patients at St. Clare's. His visit to the
hospital was arranged by Ramon Tallaj, a childhood friend who is a
doctor there.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa also signed a few autographs. Nine-year-old Matthew Doherty
was among the lucky few to get one, one of only a half-dozen
children allowed into St. Clare's crammed lobby. Dozens of people
thronged the hospital's entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew persuaded his mom to let him skip his usual Saturday
morning soccer practice, just for a chance to see Sosa up close and
to ask him to sign a baseball that had already been autographed by
Mrs. Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is historic,'' Matthew said, holding up his new treasure.
``I probably have the only baseball in America signed by Sammy and
Rachel Robinson.''

 &HT;    Bush is leaving no base untouched
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASEE, Fla. _ His famous brother already won a big
election, and is doing so well he's now touted as a possible
presidential contender. Their famous father already held that job.
</P>
<P>
   Now Jeb Bush hopes to carry on the family torch by finally
laying claim to the Florida governorship.
</P>
<P>
   With a political pedigree going back three generations, he's
wasting no time on entry-level offices. He wants to start at the
top in Florida _ and some are already whispering that his
ambitions, too, may not stop at the state line.
</P>
<P>
   But first John Ellis Bush, a Republican and a 45-year-old
millionaire from Miami, son of former President George Bush and
brother of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, must win an election.
</P>
<P>
   That's something he's never done.
</P>
<P>
   He's run only once _ in 1994, when he came achingly close to
toppling one of the most popular politicians in modern Florida
history, ``Walkin' '' Lawton Chiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was devastated when he lost that race,'' said Lance
deHaven-Smith, who works at the Florida Institute of Government, a
public policy think tank at Florida State University.``I think
there's some rivalry there with his brother. I think he learned
from his mistakes. This time he's doing everything he can, leaving
no base untouched.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Bush led incumbent Chiles by several percentage points
in the polls going into the final weeks of the campaign. Then
Chiles closed the gap, giving a folksy performance in several
televised debates. Bush lost by 60,000 votes out of 3.5 million
cast, the closest election in modern Florida history.
</P>
<P>
   Now he faces Buddy MacKay, a longtime congressman and Chiles'
lieutenant governor for the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
   This time Bush is leading by 17 points in the polls, and,
barring some last-minute meltdown, he and his brother George _ who
is heavily favored to win a second term in Texas will become the
first brother governors since the Rockefellers _ Winthrop in
Arkansas and Nelson in New York _ in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Bush has completely retooled his image since his
1994 loss. Then, Bush made no attempt to hide his deep social
conservatism, picking an outspoken born-again Christian legislator
as his running mate and raising his opposition to abortion as a
campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Bush largely ignored black voters, who have
traditionally voted Democratic in Florida. This time, he has
actively courted blacks, telling them he will reach out to their
communities. He helped found a charter school in a poor, mostly
black Miami neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   He has also downplayed his conservative principles, not
side-stepping the abortion issue but not raising it, either. And
his running mate is a middle-of-the-road, no-nonsense rising
Republican star named Frank Brogan, who has already won a statewide
election as Florida education commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, MacKay, 65, has stumbled with a campaign that has yet
to catch fire. He has been hurt badly by an embarrassing rift
created when Democratic leaders passed over a popular black
legislator for a top leadership post.
</P>
<P>
   High-profile Democrats have deserted MacKay in droves, including
the state agriculture commissioner, dozens of county sheriffs and
several key legislators. ``It's been Buddy-come-lately,'' said
Susan MacManus, a political scientist at the University of South
Florida in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay has tried to focus on Bush's support for school vouchers
that would let parents send their kids to private schools with
public money, calling it a ``recipe for disaster'' for minorities
and the poor. He has hammered at Bush's lack of experience and
several questionable business deals.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has ignored the attacks. If he wins, Bush will follow in
the footsteps of his brother, father and grandfather, Sen. Prescott
Bush of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in Texas, Jeb Bush moved to Miami in the late 1970s,
where a prominent real estate firm quickly offered him a
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first of what McKay calls Bush's ``silver-spoon
deals.'' Bush was part of a firm that sold water pumps to Nigeria
in a deal that eventually left the U.S. government, which lent
Nigeria money for the pumps, holding the bag. Bush denies any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also served as a director of Ideon, a Jacksonville credit
card services company that went bankrupt after lavish spending by
executives. Bush says he didn't have an active hand in running the
company.
</P>
<P>
   His only government service came in the late 1980s, when he
served as Florida's commerce secretary for 18 months. But that lack
of experience doesn't seem to bother most Floridians. Having
already elected the South's first Republican-majority Legislature
this century, they may give the GOP the governor's chair, too,
erasing another mark that has stood since Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are very serious about this election,'' said
deHaven-Smith. ``It would really be a watershed.

 &HT;    Sharon ``The Bulldozer'' takes enigmatic place at peace talks
 &HT;    By Larry Kaplow
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The ``Blldozer'' rolls into the delicate peace
talks at Maryland's Wye Plantation today.
</P>
<P>
   He is new Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, one of the last
of the founding fathers in Israeli politics and the wild card in
the talks.
</P>
<P>
   At 70 years old, the former general embodies the best and worst
of his country's turbulent history, from bravery and brilliance to
aggression and recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon is a hefty, part-time farmer, idolized by many in Israel
while he is often reviled around the world. Palestinians call him a
``war criminal'' for two massacres in which he played a part.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks ago, from a lesser cabinet post, he was warning Israelis
that the peace plan under debate would endanger the country's
security. He was a rival to fellow right winger, and boss, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   But, nine days ago, Netanyahu made him foreign minister,
possibly to pre-empt a Sharon-led opposition. Now Sharon heads to
the peace talks to discuss the same plan he used to oppose.
</P>
<P>
   There, he will likely face Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, the
``terrorist'' Sharon has vowed never to join in a handshake.
</P>
<P>
   What is likely to happen when the two men meet is anybody's
guess just as there is debate about what Sharon wants as foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to have his fingerprints on the history of Israel,''
said Arye Naor, who worked for former Prime Minister Menachem Begin
when Sharon was a cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is clearly right-wing, but he is one of the world's great
pragmatists,'' Israeli political scientist David Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon arrives at Wye late, sometime late Saturday or early
today. Some say he wants to distance himself from the results and
others say he simply did not want to miss a 25th anniversary
celebration of the Yom Kippur War, one of his finest moments.
</P>
<P>
   At the talks, President Bill Clinton is pushing a short-term
plan that could restart the faltering Oslo peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Some see Sharon's appointment as a sign that Netanyahu wants an
agreement but fears losing his right wing support. Pull in Sharon,
the theory goes, and the right wing will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Left-wing Israelis worry Sharon will block any more concessions
after this weekend, leaving the process dangerously incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper poll Friday showed that 48 percent of Israelis
support, and 36 percent oppose, the appointment of this
controversial foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis often refer to Sharon as a ``Bulldozer'' for his
single-mindedness in removing obstacles. He also has a record of
expanding Jewish settlement in occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Israel's independence underground when he was 17 years
old. Accused of insubordination in 1956, he became a hero in the
1967 Six Day War and the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
</P>
<P>
   In an about-face that makes today's right-wing settlers nervous,
Sharon oversaw the controversial uprooting of a Jewish settlement
in the Sinai Desert after the 1978 Camp David treaty with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   But his daring has led to tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon's 1950s commando forces pioneered Israel's vaunted style
of unconventional warfare. But they also massacred 69 men, women
and children in a raid on a Jordanian village.
</P>
<P>
   His downfall came as defense minister, overseeing the 1982
invasion of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Though he promised limited fighting against PLO bases, the
invasion became a quagmire. More than 17,000 Lebanese were killed
and many Israelis accuse Sharon of deceiving them about the extent
of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   World condemnation reigned down on Israel after Sharon allowed
pro-Israel, Lebanese militias into two Beruit Palestinian refugee
camps. The militia carried out a two-day massacre of more than 700
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon was forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Former Israeli politician Michael Bar-Zohar, who fought
alongside Sharon, writes in his memoir, ``Facing a Cruel Mirror,''
``I know that if ever the army of Israel goes to war again, I'd ask
to fight under Sharon. But only under Sharon in uniform. This
excellent soldier is a poor statesman . . . and holds the dangerous
belief that he can change any political situation with military
might.''

TRIAD GROUP RE-EMERGES AS GOP ALLY IN SELECTED CONGRESSIONAL
RACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With elections just days away, an organization that
influenced the 1996 Kansas congressional campaigns has re-emerged
to boost the candidacies of several dozen Republicans in close
races throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   The techniques of Triad Management Services, a GOP consulting
firm that collects cash from secret donors and distributes it
through little-known political action committees, was spotlighted
last year by Democrats on a Senate committee investigating campaign
financing.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the Republican-led Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee found no wrongdoing by Triad. But a campaign finance
reform proposal now bottled up in Congress calls for disclosure of
funding sources behind so-called independent advertising _
commercials not paid for or coordinated by a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Vince Snowbarger, who benefited from Triad support in 1996,
shows up on Triad documents listing Republican candidates in
competitive House and Senate contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first I've heard of this,'' said Kevin Yowell,
Snowbarger's campaign manager. ``I'm surprised Triad would have us
on any sort of list. I'd still be surprised if Triad does anything
in this district. I hope they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowbarger's camp has given The Kansas City Star a copy of a
letter dated July 16 requesting that Triad not get involved in his
race this year.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Malenick, Triad president, said Friday that she never
got such a letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to tell Triad to stay out, not that he can tell me
what to do,'' she said. Donors ``make their own decisions who they
write checks to,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Triad documents highlight 60 House races and six Senate
contests. Snowbarger's 3rd District race is not among 36 House
contests on Triad's top or second-tier lists of Republicans
challenging Democratic incumbents or running for open seats.
Snowbarger is listed among 24 GOP incumbents in tight races.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Todd Tiahrt, a Kansas Republican, also is on that list,
although his race is not considered close.
</P>
<P>
   Snowbarger, a freshman in a close re-election battle with
Democrat Dennis Moore, got help in the closing days of his 1996
race in the form of about $300,000 worth of ads and other
assistance from Triad-affiliated groups.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Triad spent about $1 million in Kansas in the 1996
election, including $410,000 that aided Sen. Sam Brownback. The
Triad connection to Kansas candidates was first reported by The
Star, which disclosed that Brownback's in-laws, John and Ruth
Stauffer of Topeka, donated $37,500 to eight political action
committees selected by Triad.
</P>
<P>
   Within days those committees contributed $36,000 to Brownback,
who was running against Republican Sheila Frahm in the GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee
complained that the group used questionable techniques to enable
wealthy donors to skirt campaign laws.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the panel's Republican majority, which focused on
election cash raised by President Clinton and Democrats, especially
from Asian supporters, concluded that Triad broke no laws.
Brownback, who is not on Triad lists this year, was a member of
that committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department reportedly is reviewing the Democrats'
minority report. Triad attorney Mark Braden said he was unaware
that such an investigation was under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The official committee position was that we didn't do anything
wrong,'' Braden said.
</P>
<P>
   While individuals' contributions to candidates are limited to
$2,000 per election by federal law, donations to nonprofit groups
can be as much as $5,000 per year, Braden said. And donors to
nonprofit organizations do not have to be identified as do those
who contribute directly to a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Malenick said Triad worked for its clients by identifying
Republican candidates in competitive contests.
</P>
<P>
   Triad is affiliated with two nonprofit groups, Citizens for the
Republic Education Fund and Citizens for Reform. In 1996 it
broadcast $3 million worth of pro-Republican issue ads in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But even at this late date, Malenick said, Triad ``has not
developed any issue advertising plans for this election,'' in
Kansas or elsewhere. She said that did not mean it wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Both political parties are closely watching the race between
Snowbarger and Moore. Although Moore was slightly ahead in fund
raising, both sides had collected about $700,000 through September.
</P>
<P>
   In his July 16 letter to Triad, Snowbarger asked that the group
refrain from independent expenditures on his behalf. He said that
while the group's efforts to elect conservative members of Congress
were greatly appreciated, some ads had created ``confusion in the
minds of voters as to who was saying what....''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that the voters of the district hear from the
candidates themselves rather than from outside organizations, no
matter how helpful and well-intentioned the ads may be,''
Snowbarger wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Yowell said Moore was asked to also disavow expenditures by
independent groups. Through June 30, labor had given nearly
$105,000 to Moore, according to campaign expense reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we know why,'' Yowell said of Moore's reasons for not
agreeing to their request.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Esposito, Moore's campaign manager, said money contributed
by unions was not the same as that which came by way of Triad.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the AFL-CIO runs an independent expenditure, they put
their name on it and they disclose their donors,'' he said. ``That
is the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Esposito also said he was skeptical about Snowbarger's plea that
Triad stay out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect Triad to spend massive amounts of secret and
unregulated money on negative television and radio commercials in
next two weeks,'' he said.

 &HT;    Serbs shell small village soon after extends NATO deadline
 &HT;    EDs: ADDS approximate location of village, statement from Serb
police
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Bert Roughton Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VRAGOBIL, Yugoslavia _ On Friday as NATO extended its deadline
for Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic to comply with a
U.S.-brokered peace agreement, this small hill village 25 miles
southwest of Pristina was shelled through the night, terrifying
residents and damaging dozens of homes.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces in the area also did not appear to be making any
attempts to withdraw, even though Milosevic has agreed to reduce
the Serb military presence in Kosovo. Buses of soldiers and armored
personnel carriers cruised down the road between Pristina and
Malisheva on Saturday and uniformed soldiers occupied many
buildings along the road. Serb soldiers were also seen spreading
leaves and branches over buried earthen bunkers to make them less
visible.
</P>
<P>
   The peace accord that was signed this week intended to make sure
the Yugoslav president pull his forces out of the strife-torn
province. The Western powers earlier in the week had given
Milosevic until Saturday to comply or face military action. On
Friday, the deadline was extended another 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The shelling began at about 6 p.m. Friday and continued until 8
a.m. Saturday, said a number of Vragobil residents. One man, who
would only give his first name, Adam, said he counted more than 400
rounds fired during the night. Other residents reported hearing
about the same number of rounds. Perhaps because the village is
nearly empty, no one was injured or killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just after dinner, and I went out to the street, when I
heard this boom, boom, boom,'' said Adam, a man who appeared to be
in his late 50s. The shelling came in clusters early and became
sporadic during the night.
</P>
<P>
   When morning came, the red tile roofs on many houses had shell
holes the size of soccer balls. Other rounds gouged out stones in
the thick masonry walls. In one house, where the residents were
apparently getting ready to go to sleep, rubble and plaster had
collapsed onto once neatly made beds.
</P>
<P>
   Serb officials would not confirm or deny reports of shelling at
Vragobil. In a statement, Serb authorities in Pristina said
</P>
<P>
   there had been several attacks Friday against police by heavily
armed Kosovo separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Police reported an attack by separatists against a police
checkpoint near the village using mortars, grenade launchers and
automatic weapons between 6 and 7 p.m. Friday. Police said they did
not return fire.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what would make this impoverished village a
military target, even though there were gun-bearing members of the
Kosovo Liberation Army scattered in the nearby countryside Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The few civilians who remained in this tiny ethnic Albanian
farming town on Saturday blamed Serb soldiers, who occupy the
nearby town of Malisheva. Residents believe soldiers hidden on
neighboring hills fired 30 mm shells at the houses. The residents
also said they are under occasional attack from snipers.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, people in the town of Guribardhe also said
they heard sustained shelling from the direction of Malesheva
during the night. About 25,000 of the 45,000 people who live in and
around Guribardhe are refugees, many from Malisheva.
</P>
<P>
   In Malesheva on Saturday, Serb soldiers in their dark violet
camouflage uniforms were lounging in bombed-out buildings, their
weapons resting on their laps. The town, once a stronghold of
Kosovo separatists, had been severely damaged by earlier fighting
and seemed devoid of any other human life.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians have been killed and an estimated
300,000 forced to flee their homes since Serb forces began fighting
Kosovo separatists. The Kosovo Liberation Army also has killed more
than 200 Serb policemen, Serb civilians and ethnic Albanians loyal
to Milosevic's government.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are
ethnic Albanians and most favor independence.
</P>
<P>
   The shelling and other such incidents only serve to reinforce
the fear among refugees that it is unsafe for them to return to
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   With winter just a few weeks off, humanitarian relief workers
are urging displaced people to return home, even if their houses
were severely damaged. ``These people need to get to their homes
soon and get some shelter,'' said Mick Lorentzen of the Kosovo
office of the World Food Program. Lorentzen joined United Nations
High Commissioner on Refugees security officials who visited
Vragobil to inspect the damage. ``I can tell you that this doesn't
help.

BANKAMERICA'S EARNINGS SHOCK MAY POSE SETBACK TO BANKING INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: The most significant long-term effect of BankAmerica's
nasty October earnings surprise may be the damage it does to
industry hopes for financial-reform legislation in the next
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers already were smarting from this year's failure to win
congressional approval of legislation that would have allowed
banks, insurance companies and securities firms to merge. This
setback, however, had little to do with political misgivings about
liberalizing the financial marketplace. Rather it resulted from
opposition by a couple of senators objecting to provisions that
would have expanded the Community Reinvestment Act's scope.
</P>
<P>
   Now along comes the BankAmerica debacle to renew fears of
buccaneer banking practices that have provided ammo for opponents
of banking liberalization since the Great Depression's wave of bank
closings.
</P>
<P>
   The BankAmerica shock was its announcement of a nearly 80
percent plunge in third-quarter earnings, resulting largely from
damage generated by volatile global markets. The biggest frights
were a $372 million write-down of a loan to a little-known
investment firm and a $250 million write-down in the value of a
mortgage-servicing portfolio that hadn't been hedged against
declining interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In another unseemly turn of events, BankAmerica found itself
forced to take over a $20 billion bond portfolio from the
investment firm in a rescue observers assume is necessary to
protect a remaining loan balance of about $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   What made this shock even more dramatic was its nearness to the
finalization of BankAmerica's $43 billion merger with NationsBank.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the eclectic nature of the earnings hits, said The
Financial Times, ``reveals serious risk management failures.'' It
also lamented that the calamity becomes ``further evidence (of)
banks' reckless behavior in the bull market.''
</P>
<P>
   This assessment puts the spotlight on how BankAmerica's problems
may pose a new barrier to banking modernization efforts. Hugh
McColl Jr., erstwhile NationsBank chief who heads the new
BankAmerica, is known as a canny banker and extraordinary
dealmaker. Nevertheless, as The Times noted, he failed to ``smell a
rat'' during the transaction's due diligence phase.
</P>
<P>
   How then, reform opponents might argue, can liberalized
post-reform safeguards be trusted to work when the most savvy
industry players were so easily duped while operating in today's
more restrictive environment?
</P>
<P>
   Good question, and as germane now as when the '90s dawned and
the financial industry was emerging from nearly a decade of
widespread bank and savings and loan failures. The debate then
focused on the moral hazard of insuring the deposits of
institutions involved in inordinately risky financial dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Banks still enjoy the same old deposit protection, but since
then nothing has been done to separate the industry's traditionally
conservative role of taking deposits and making loans from its more
freewheeling operations. While it's true the financial marketplace
needs liberation from outmoded Depression-era constraints, it's
just as true that government, under taxpayer aegis, shouldn't be
required to cover high-risk bets made outside of banking's
garden-variety banking functions.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good opportunity to refocus debate on the need to
complement greater regulatory freedom with less government
protection for the industry.

MAN CHARGED IN SEXUAL ATTACK ON 2 FELLOW PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 57-year-old patient at a city hospital on Roosevelt
Island was arrested Friday night and accused of sexually molesting
two catatonic women in their beds.
</P>
<P>
   A nurse at the Coler-Goldwater Memorial Hospital walked into a
room where the women were shortly before 8 p.m. and found a man who
was apparently sexually abusing them, police said. She then called
hospital security, who detained the suspect, William Green, until
officers from the 114th Precinct arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Officer George Jensen, a spokesman for the Police Department,
said the suspect and the two women, an 83-year-old and a
45-year-old, were all patients in the hospital's long-term care
program. ``It is for people who cannot take care of themselves,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Lehman, an administrator at the hospital, refused to
discuss the incident. A hospital official speaking on the condition
of anonymity said Green was usually confined to a wheelchair. Jane
Zimmerman, a spokeswoman for the city's Health and Hospital Corp.,
said cases of abuse like the one alleged are infrequent in city
hospital facilities, particularly in those like Coler-Goldwater,
which is a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more likely to happen in an acute-care hospital because
of the high volume of people coming in and out, but even there this
would be a rare occurrence,'' she said. ``There is no trend here;
this is an isolated incident.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, a man waiting for a CAT scan at St. Vincent's Hospital
and Medical Center in Manhattan was charged with attempting to rape
an 87-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   A nurse walked into the woman's room as the suspect was
disrobing her, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A month earlier, a woman in a coma was raped by another patient
at Brookdale Hospital and Medical Center, according to police. This
attack was witnessed by a nurse, they said.
</P>
<P>
   In cases involving hospitals that accept Medicaid patients, the
state attorney general's office has sometimes investigated such
incidents. In a highly publicized case in Rochester two years ago,
a 32-year-old comatose woman became pregnant after she was raped at
the Westfall Health Care Center. A former nurse's aide, who had
been fired after being charged with sexually abusing another
physically disabled patient, was later charged in the woman's rape.

 &HT;    Ohio mulls how to manage `megafarms'
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ At the Guggenbiller egg farm just east of Ohio 49
in southern Mercer County, the emerald grass is neatly trimmed,
four tree swings gently sway in the breeze and a boxer named Cindy
greets visitors with a menacing bark.
</P>
<P>
   The only hint that there are 243,000 hens laying 216,000 chicken
eggs each day is the three 450-foot-long sheet metal buildings just
behind the farm house. There are no sign of flies. No smell. No
noise. And no throngs of workers _ four family members run the
entire operation.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the dimly lit hen houses, nine chickens cluck and bob
inside each of the 2-by-2 cages, stacked on shelves in rows that
run longer than a football field. Don Guggenbiller uses an electric
cart to ride up and down the rows, checking on the chickens daily.
</P>
<P>
   Disease control is a concern. Visitors wear plastic bags over
their shoes, white coveralls and hair nets inside the bird houses
to avoid tracking viruses from other farms.
</P>
<P>
   Guggenbiller, his brother and their wives work from 5:30 a.m. to
2:30 p.m. with an automated system that collects the eggs and packs
them into crates. Semi-trucks come six times a week to haul the
eggs away. Feeding and watering is automated and the chicken manure
drops into pits below the cages. Area farmers buy the manure for
fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   This is family farming, with a big business twist. Large-scale
livestock operations are a trend in farming across the nation as
many family farmers expand to survive and to take advantage of
economies of scale. But such huge livestock operations have
attracted criticism. They can pose environmental problems and
people moving to rural areas often don't like the smell and flies
that come with the animal manure.
</P>
<P>
   The Guggenbiller brothers contract with Cooper Farms, which
provides the feed and buys the eggs from the Guggenbillers. Cooper
Farms raises 1.5 million turkeys and 50,000 hogs on about 250
farms, mostly in Darke and Mercer counties. It also produces eggs
through contract farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Farms with more than 750 dairy cattle, 1,000 beef cattle, 2,500
hogs, 100,000 chickens or 550,000 turkeys are regulated by the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency. A manure management plan must be
approved by Ohio EPA before these ``megafarms'' can expand.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio has 107 such megafarms regulated by the Ohio EPA, up from
about 70 two years ago. Darke County is home to 31 of them while
Mercer County has 26.
</P>
<P>
   Such operations have become controversial because of the
potential environmental consequences: flies, rodents, smell and
manure runoff into groundwater sources.
</P>
<P>
   And nearby residents often don't like the idea of living next to
a giant livestock farm, agriculture specialists said. That's
becoming a bigger issue as suburban sprawl gobbles up farmland _
Ohio loses an estimated 100,000 acres of farmland a year _ and more
suburbanites take up residence next to these expanding farming
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper Farms general manager Neil Diller said with suburban
sprawl, it comes down to a conflict between people who want to make
a living in the country and people who want to live in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In Darke County, three men recently filed a lawsuit seeking to
stop a hog farm expansion before it even starts. They are asking
the court to consider it a class-action suit and either stop the
construction or order damages of more than $10 million. The suit
alleges that manure runoff could contaminate drinking water
sources, the smell could be offensive and the expansion could drive
down property values.
</P>
<P>
   One of the state's largest chicken operations _ Buckeye Egg _
has drawn the most criticism. Manure discharges and fly
infestations resulted in $228,000 in fines from Ohio EPA _ one
$115,000 fine in 1983 and a $113,000 fine in 1997, Ohio EPA
officials said. (The EPA has issued only two other fines _ totaling
$30,000 _ since it began regulating large-scale farms in the
1970s.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Buckeye Egg . . . they decided they were going to do whatever
they wanted for awhile there,'' Diller said. ``We are the
benefactors to their bad management because people are worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Diller said an operation the size of Buckeye Egg can be
intimidating. ``No doubt about it. Especially if you've never seen
livestock before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Buckeye Egg President Andy Hansen said charges of
mismanagement are false. ``We are one of the best managed
facilities in the world,'' he said. Large-scale operations face
more regulation and public scrutiny so they are better run than
smaller farms, Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Buckeye Egg was not responsible for the violations
that led to the 1983 fine because the company took over the egg
farm involved after the fine was imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Buckeye Egg has 14.3 million chickens in Ohio and plans to add
another 15.4 million once it gets Ohio EPA approval, said EPA
agriculture specialist Mark Wilson. Buckeye Egg's farms are in
Licking County and the tri-county area 50 miles northwest of
Columbus. Ohio is the nation's largest egg producer, in large part
because of Buckeye Egg.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians are taking notice. U.S. Senate candidate Mary Boyle
called for a moratorium on ``factory farm'' expansions in Ohio.
North Carolina, Oklahoma and Mississippi have enacted moratoriums
and Colorado residents will vote in November on whether to limit
the size of hog farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there is inadequate regulation of factory farms.
That's partly why they are growing so fast,'' Boyle said on a
campaign stop in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle's opponent, Gov. George Voinovich, has called for
legislation requiring megafarms to have insect- and rodent-control
plans, giving the Ohio EPA director the ability to consider a
farmer's track record during the permitting process, require
hydrological testing if a new farm will use a significant amount of
water and establish a licensing program for those who manage large
amounts of manure.
</P>
<P>
   The state legislature is also considering bills related to
megafarms, similar to Voinovich's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting to be a very big issue. It's amazing because two
or three years ago, we didn't even talk about this issue. Now, at
just about every House and Senate agricultural committee meeting
the word megafarm is brought up. It's probably at the top of the
agenda as far as agriculture goes as an issue,'' said Kit Fogle,
Ohio Farmers Union legislative director.
</P>
<P>
   At the local level, Darke County Commissioner Richard Graeff
said local health departments should have some control over
megafarms. ``It's all in the hands of the EPA. It's just kind of
difficult to control. So many things are taken out of the control
of the commissioners,'' Graeff said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio EPA issues permits to large-scale livestock operations
after holding public hearings and reviewing manure storage and
disposal plans. EPA officials conduct periodic follow-up
inspections, respond to complaints and require record keeping for
how many tons of manure were spread where and under what
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But even Diller said the EPA probably does not have enough
resources to keep on top of megafarming issues after permits are
issued.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio EPA agriculture specialist Wilson said, ``We feel we have a
pretty effective regulatory program. We think we are regulating
this industry. That is not to say there can't be improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   Requiring certified livestock managers for farms with more than
1,000 animal units may be a good idea, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Farmers Union would like to see concentrated operations
the size of Buckeye Egg categorized and regulated as agriculture
factories, Fogle said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Livestock Coalition, however, maintains that existing
regulations are adequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we look at the environmental compliance records of Ohio's
livestock and poultry farmers, it is good to excellent,'' said
David White, executive director of Ohio Livestock Coalition and
commodity relations director for the Ohio Farm Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   White points out that the livestock and poultry industry
contributes more than $7.2 billion to Ohio's economy and generates
38,500 jobs. Farmers share the public's concern for water quality
and have been voluntarily using new strategies for manure
management, the coalition says.
</P>
<P>
   White said ``megafarm'' is an offensive term coined by opponents
of expansions. Coalition members prefer ``consumer-friendly farm''
or ``large-scale livestock operation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not only the trend,'' Buckeye Egg's Hansen said of
megafarms. ``They are necessary to feed the people of the world.

MOURNING 3 `CHERUBS' KILLED BY AMBULANCE

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There were silent tears when friends rose to read
homespun recollections of the sweetness and merriment of three
children who had died. There were sniffles and whispered prayers
when the minister exhorted the mourners to have faith in God.
</P>
<P>
   But when six burly men in tuxedos and white gloves solemnly
pushed carts carrying the small white coffins up the carpeted aisle
of the Greenwood Baptist Church in Brooklyn on Saturday, people
began to wail and sob, filling the vaulted room with the echoes of
pain.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths two weeks ago of Damilola, Olusegun and Akintunde
Morak _ ages 7, 5 and 3, respectively _ touched a broad circle that
extended beyond the Nigerian immigrant neighborhood on Coney Island
where the siblings lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are three little angels,'' said Arait Bakare, a family
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``These children _ sinless, harmless, loving children _ are in
the hands of Jesus,'' said Pastor Emmanuel Omotoso of the Deeper
Life Bible Church in the Bronx. Angela Igwe, the children's mother,
is the pastor's goddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The Morak children died when a private ambulance sped through a
red light and into their mother's car at an intersection in
Brooklyn late on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Igwe crawled from her crumpled car, screaming and pleading
for help as her children were dying. She remains in Kings County
Hospital recovering from her injuries. Friends said she came for a
brief time to the wake for the children on Friday before returning
to her hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   Her only surviving child, 9-year-old Ibornka, was also hurt in
the crash. Looking dazed and frightened and wearing a neck brace,
the skinny little girl attended the funeral of her brothers and
sister at the side of her father, Timmy Morak. Morak, a nursing
home attendant who lived apart from his family, kept Ibornka
tightly clasped to his side throughout the service.
</P>
<P>
   The ambulance driver, Anne Lamberson, was arrested at the scene.
On Friday, she was charged with 11 counts of manslaughter,
criminally negligent homicide, assault and reckless endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the circumstances, the message of the funeral service
was not anger, but acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   A friend read a letter from Ms. Igwe about her struggle to find
peace by adopting the best qualities of each of her children into
herself _ Damilola's humor, Olusegun's thoughtfulness, Akintunde's
quiet pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this way, their little hearts will go on through mine,''
the mother wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Igwe, in her written reflections, revealed that she has a
heart-shaped tattoo on her back with the names and birth dates of
each of her children inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would always ask me, `Mummy, how come you have our names
on your back?' I would answer, `Because you are all special and I
love you very much and there is no other way I know to express how
I feel about you to the world,''' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Igwe's co-workers eulogized the children, who had spent
their last day playing in the beauty salon where their mother
works. ``Little cherubs,'' one woman called them, ``spreading
love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even imagine what the pain must be like,'' said
Margaret Jones, one of Ms. Igwe's friends from the salon. ``She'll
get through it with prayer, a lot of prayer. But she's very, very
strong and she'll get through it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Morak family has received an outpouring of financial
support. Four white stretch limousines were on hand to ferry the
immediate family. The children's coffins were heaped with elaborate
flower arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``A whole lot of people helped us with all this _ the general
public, the schools, the funeral home,'' said Ms. Bakare, the
family friend who acted as spokeswoman and handled the logistics of
keeping track of the crowds of reporters, police officers and
funeral home workers outside the church.
</P>
<P>
   The service also drew several elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's three of our kids,'' said Adele Cohen, the state
Assemblywoman who represents Ms. Igwe's neighborhood. ``I just hope
from this tragedy we can turn it around and get something good.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the indictment of the ambulance driver on Friday,
Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes said an investigation
indicated that she did not follow state laws regarding emergency
vehicles, which allow drivers to go through red lights and stop
signs but only after first slowing down to insure the safety of
other cars and pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lamberson, an employee of Transcare Ambulance, had been
dispatched to Midwood about an hour before the fatal crash. During
that interval, investigators said, witnesses reported seeing the
ambulance traveling at more than 50 mph in residential areas, going
against traffic and making what the district attorney called
``unsafe U-turns.''

 ELIZABETH GILKESON, 95, CHILDREN'S SCHOOL FOUNDER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Elizabeth Chapman Gilkeson, an educator associated
with the Bank Street College of Education for more than four
decades and the founding director of its School for Children, died
on Oct. 7 at her home in lower Manhattan. She was 95.
</P>
<P>
   As a senior faculty member of Bank Street College, Mrs. Gilkeson
helped develop many of the programs that define the institution,
now on West 112th Street in Morningside Heights. She joined the
staff in 1955 as head of the children's program division; though
she officially retired in the 1970s, she remained active in the
college's affairs, including its seminars on professional
development.
</P>
<P>
   The predecessor to the School for Children had its modest start
in 1919, three years after Bank Street College opened as the Bureau
of Educational Experiments. Under Mrs. Gilkeson's guidance, what
began as an interdisciplinary program with nine toddlers took shape
as an innovative learning environment in which young children were
encouraged to interact with teachers, parents, their urban
surroundings and one another.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gilkeson, whose father served as schools superintendent in
Glen Cove and Corning, N.Y., was born in Bethel, Maine. She
graduated from Vassar College in 1924 and, 10 years later, became a
founder of the progressive Poughkeepsie Day School on the Vassar
campus. She also was a member of the Vassar child study faculty
through 1949.
</P>
<P>
   She earned a master's degree at Columbia Teachers College in
1942, studied child and adult development at the Carolyn Zachary
Institute in the late 1940s and pursued doctoral studies at
Columbia in the early 1950s. At that time she was director of
guidance at the New Lincoln School in New York City and an adviser
and instructor at Bank Street.
</P>
<P>
   After joining the full-time staff, she expanded the School for
Children beyond the nursery years to include pupils through the
eighth grade, developed programs for children and parents and
founded the Polly Miller Child Center in Marble Hill.
</P>
<P>
   She supervised psychiatric residents from Albert Einstein
Medical School at the School for Children, developed the
multidisciplinary 42nd Street Early Childhood Center for children
and their parents, and directed a national Head Start project as
well as Bank Street's participation in the Federal Office of
Education's National Follow Through Programs.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gilkeson, whose husband and son pre-deceased her, is
survived by five grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.

 JOHN O. VAN KOERT, 86, DESIGNER AND PROMOTER OF DANISH MODERN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John O. Van Koert, a prominent New York designer who
helped promote the fascination with Danish modern furnishings in
the 1950s, died last Sunday in Santa Fe, N.M. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, said a friend, Edith Siroto.
</P>
<P>
   Van Koert designed silverware and furniture that helped to
introduce modernist shapes. Born in Manitoba, Canada, he later
moved to Milwaukee, where he studied at the University of Wisconsin
to be a painter and sculptor and taught design in the art
department. After World War II, he settled in New York as a jewelry
designer for Harry Winston and branched out into industrial design.
</P>
<P>
   His flatware designs in silver for Towle were well known in the
'50s. One of them, ``Contour,'' a sleek Miro-like design, was
chosen to represent modernism in ``Knife, Fork and Spoon,'' a 1951
traveling exhibition on the history of eating implements organized
by the Walter Art Center of Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, he was exhibition director of ``Design in
Scandinavia,'' a show that traveled for three years, to venues
including the Brooklyn Museum of Art; it helped introduce
Scandinavian modern design to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Van Koert's furniture designs for Drexel, a North Carolina
manufacturer, were presented in model rooms in department stores
like Abraham &AMP; Straus, Macy's and Bloomingdale's..
</P>
<P>
   Van Koert was an early advocate of the built-in furniture
popular in the 1950s with modernist architects and designers.
Predicting a time when people would treat furniture like kitchen
cabinetry, he said in an interview in 1958: ``We shouldn't have to
move our furniture when we move. After all, you can't get
sentimentally attached to a $200 chair.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, he started working for Serried Ltd., a North Carolina
furniture manufacturer, where he designed traditional home
furnishings for 20 years. Van Koert, who left no survivors, moved
to Santa Fe in 1993.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A lifelong Democrat, film director Rob Reiner does
not have a lot in common politically with people like millionaire
Michael Huffington, a Republican, or actor Charlton Heston, a
conservative icon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't agree on much, that's true,'' Reiner said the other
day in his office at The Culver Studios near here. ``But the one
thing we do agree on is helping young children.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The three men have put aside their differences to battle the
tobacco industry over a ballot initiative that would add 50 cents
in new taxes to the price of a pack of cigarettes, and use the
money to finance programs in early childhood development and
prenatal care. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For months, the men have been making appearances across the
state and, in recent days, radio and television commercials in
support of the initiative. If passed, it will rocket California to
No. 3 from No. 22 among states with the highest cigarette taxes in
the country, behind only Alaska and Hawaii. Currently the cigarette
tax is 37 cents a pack in California. The initiative would raise
the price by about 20 percent, to $3.05 a pack from $2.55. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some experts on smoking say that the additional tax will
discourage thousands of teen-agers from ever lighting up and will
encourage thousands more, including many adults, to quit. The tax
is also expected to generate an estimated $700 million to $750
million annually in revenue, which will be earmarked for early
childhood development, prenatal care and antismoking programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's an opportunity to make a major investment in young
children and to get kids to stop smoking,'' Reiner said, leaning
forward in his chair and waving his hands in the air like the
liberal and excitable son-in-law character that he played for years
on the ``All in the Family'' television show. ``How can anyone
oppose it?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is, with money. Lots and lots of money.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry has poured millions of dollars into the
fight against Proposition 10, also known as the ``Reiner
Initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers estimate that the tobacco industry might spend as
much $20 million, mostly for television advertisements attacking
the initiative as an unfair tax and as too bureaucratic. But Matt
Taggart, the spokesman for the ``No on 10'' campaign, which is
heavily financed by the tobacco industry, would not comment on the
exact amount. ``It's a significant media buy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reiner said his group would spend about $5 million for
television and radio advertisements, using the familiar faces and
voices of Heston, actor Martin Sheen and former Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Although the proposition has been ahead in the polls for weeks,
its support among respondents fell to 48 percent this month, from
56 percent in August, said Mark DiCamillo, director of the Field
Poll. The percentage of those opposed has not changed much, holding
at about 33 percent. More significantly, perhaps, the percentage of
voters in the undecided column has increased to 19 percent from 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burden is on the `yes' side to make the sale,'' DiCamillo
said. ``All the `no' side has to do is raise doubts.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters have 15 pages of endorsements from health groups,
labor unions and elected officials like the Democratic mayor of San
Francisco, Willie Brown, and the Republican mayor of Los Angeles,
Richard Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent editorial, The Los Angeles Times called the
initiative ``a gamble California can't afford not to take.'' The
editorial said: ``While Proposition 10 is far from perfect, it's
also a bold, worthwhile experiment _ an attempt to solve a genuine
social problem arriving at just the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the initiative say that they also support early
childhood development programs but that the increase is a
regressive tax that will fall hardest on the poor and on members of
minority groups. It is the argument that the tobacco industry used
in its campaign against a proposed national tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, The San Diego Union-Tribune blasted the measure in an
editorial: ``Proposition 10 is a ballot box taxation at its most
insidious.''
</P>
<P>
   The opponents also say that most of the money will not go to
programs directly related to the effects of smoking, and therefore
smokers should not have to foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that patriotism was the last refuge of
scoundrels,'' said Bill Campbell, a former Republican state senator
who opposes the initiative. ``Now children have become the last
refuge. Everybody ostensibly wants to do something to help
children.''
</P>
<P>
   But what Reiner and his allies are really doing, Campbell said,
is using a lofty goal that everyone supports to attack the tobacco
industry ``because it's easy pickings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People think that the tobacco companies are evil, therefore
the people who smoke are evil and they ought to be taxed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the proposition is poorly written, provides little
accountability and will create new layers of bureaucracy eager to
control the $700 million in new revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The proposition calls for the creation of a state commission and
58 county commissions to oversee and distribute the money. Money
will be divided among the counties based on the number of births a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Huffington, recruited to the Proposition 10 campaign by Reiner,
has been traveling to more conservative areas of the state to talk
about the merits of the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Although Huffington got involved in the campaign last February,
his commitment to the effort intensified a few weeks ago when he
learned that doctors had told his mother she had lung cancer. His
mother started smoking when she was a teen-ager and had smoked as
many as three packs a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of her lung was removed a couple of weeks ago,''
Huffington said. ``We're not sure we got it all.'' &QL;

 REAL ESTATE: NEW JERSEY COUNTY IS FACING A VOTE ON AN OPEN-SPACE
TAX 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RACHELLE GARBARINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruce Marek grows more than 100 different kinds of organic
vegetables on a patch of farmland along Old Hook Road in Emerson
Township in Bergen County, which with 851,344 residents is the most
populated of New Jersey's 21 counties.
</P>
<P>
   Marek, who is 46, lives in an 18th-century house on the 6.5-acre
farm that his family purchased as a weekend retreat in 1925 and has
farmed for nearly four decades. It is a tradition Marek said he
would like to continue, though he says that it is becoming more
difficult in so heavily developed a county as Bergen, where
commercial and housing projects continue to gobble up the little
remaining open space.
</P>
<P>
   Just west of Marek's Old Hook Farm, an assisted-living complex
for the elderly is rising on 3.8 acres of former watershed land
used to protect the nearby reservoir that holds the area's water
supply. Other examples of development bumping up against open space
can be found throughout the county, where just 4 percent of its
152,768 acres are undeveloped.
</P>
<P>
   That such examples as Marek's farm still exist ``underscores the
need to keep what we have left in some kind of natural state,''
said Lori Charkey, co-director of Save the Watershed Action
Network, or SWAN, a nonprofit conservation group. ``While some
people may throw up their hands and say it's too late, many others
are crying out they have had enough,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the county hopes to step up its efforts to save some of its
remaining land, including farms like Marek's, partly by asking
residents _ in a referendum next month _ to pay a little more in
property taxes for preservation purposes. The move reflects a
growing trend of counties and towns taxing themselves to acquire
and conserve open space.
</P>
<P>
   In Bergen County, the move toward a preservation tax was started
18 months ago by the New Jersey Conservation Foundation, a
nonprofit group in Far Hills that brought together
environmentalists, civic leaders, citizens and county officials to
discuss such a measure. This led to a vote last summer by Bergen's
Board of Freeholders to hold a referendum in November on whether
the county should establish a five-year dedicated open-space trust
fund.
</P>
<P>
   The fund would provide $8 million a year, or a total of $40
million, and would be financed equally by bonds and a conservation
tax on residents' homes _ one half of a cent on each $100 of
assessed property value. Owners of homes with the county's median
sales price of $237,308 would pay $11 a year in conservation taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The money would go not only toward acquiring open space, either
directly or through the purchase of development rights, but also
toward maintaining and upgrading parks, ballfields and playgrounds
in the county, which state figures estimate is 1,200 acres short of
meeting its recreation needs. At present, the county is negotiating
for the purchase of 1,162 acres of open space.
</P>
<P>
   They would be added to the 2,316 acres the county has preserved
over the last decade by acquiring large tracts most threatened by
development. A task force created by County Executive William
Schuber last year identified 44 sites, totaling an additional 1,000
acres, in need of preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have taken care of a lot, but there are limits to the money
so we could not purchase everything,'' Schuber said. The trust will
``give us another tool and a greater fund of money to buy what is
still out there as well as afford us the opportunity, for the first
time, to partner with municipalities'' to further stretch funds, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to retain the county's suburban character and not
to become the sixth borough of Manhattan.'' he said. ``It's a
quality of life issue.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the state Legislature gave municipalities and counties
the legal authority to raise taxes for open space and many have
done so in recent years as development pressures have increased.
During the 1990s, Bergen County's population, following two decades
of decline, increased by 25,954, according to the Department of
Planning, to its current size as elderly homeowners who moved out
were replaced by young families.
</P>
<P>
   If residents of Bergen County approve the open-space tax on Nov.
3 it would join 13 other counties in the state, as well as 53
municipalities, where residents have accepted open-space taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward open-space taxes shows no sign of abating. Next
month in addition to Bergen County two other counties _ Essex, as
well as Camden in a second attempt _ will also ask residents to
take on such a tax, as will 29 other municipalities including four
in Bergen County. Some municipalities and counties with taxes
already in place _ ranging from 1 to 5 cents on each $100 of
assessed property values _ are also going back to voters to
increase the amount of their tax.
</P>
<P>
   The state itself in November will also ask residents to support
New Jersey's largest conservation effort _ spending $1 billion over
the next decade to preserve 1 million acres of undeveloped land.
The state is seeking voter approval to amend the state Constitution
so that it can dedicate up to $98 million a year in state sales-tax
revenues over the next 30 years to buy the million acres and retire
bonds. If approved the referendum would also give the state the
authority to issue an additional $1 billion in bonds for
preservation purposes.
</P>
<P>
   There are no statewide statistics available on the total amount
of money raised or the amount of land preserved through the tax.
</P>
<P>
   But a partial report done in 1997 by the state's Department of
Environmental Protection showed that the nine counties and 29
municipalities surveyed had collected $105.7 million and preserved
16,800 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are challenges to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``People by their very nature are anti-tax, so it takes an
education process to show them that with their own buying authority
they can be masters of their own destiny,'' said John Klevins,
senior project manager at the Morristown office of the Trust for
Public Land, a nonprofit land conservation organization.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that preservation has proved to be a prudent fiscal
alternative to the higher tax increases usually required for
additional services like roads and schools that development brings.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates also say having a conservation tax is an added benefit
when competing for state funds under the state's 37-year-old Green
Acres program, which has been the main source of funds to state,
county and local government agencies for preserving open space.
Since its creation, the program has raised $1.39 billion in nine
voter-approved bond issues to preserve 922,000 acres of open space,
including farmland.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago it began offering 2 percent loans and matching
grants _ representing 75 percent and 25 percent, respectively, of
the state award _ to counties and towns that have an open space
master plan and conservation tax in place.
</P>
<P>
   In Bergen County, the New Jersey Conservation Foundation worked
with open-space advocates ``to bring the issue of preservation to
the forefront, and to show that a stable source of funding would
provide an efficient process'' for preserving land, said Dennis
Miranda, the foundation's urban parks project manager. To that end
34 of the 70 towns in the county passed resolutions in support of a
trust fund, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still some county officials needed to be convinced that taxing
current residents and embracing a pay-as-you-go approach was more
beneficial than issuing bonds and spreading payments over future
generations, which had been the county's traditional method of
raising funds.
</P>
<P>
   The other issue was how to structure the trust to be equitable
to all residents in the county, where most of the undeveloped land
exists in its northern half and little open space remains in its
southern half, said Richard H. Kelly, a county freeholder and
chairman of its open space committee.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise, he said is that of the $40 million provided
under the trust half the money will be raised from the issuing
bonds, the other half from a conservation tax, which was cut to
one-half of one cent from 1 cent per $100 of assessed property
value. In addition, the county will retain 75 percent of the funds
raised to acquire land and preserve farmland and historic sites as
well as to improve recreation facilities. The remaining 25 percent
of the funds will go to municipalities to improve recreational
facilities. There is also a provision calling for the trust fund
and tax to sunset in five years.
</P>
<P>
   As for Marek, he said he had no interest ``right now'' in
selling his Emerson farm. But if the referendum passes, he said, he
would consider selling the development rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be one way to protect the equity in the farm and
guarantee that the land would be farmed forever,'' Marek said.

 SAILOR LOOKS FOR HOME-WATER ADVANTAGE IN BERMUDA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having grown up in Bermuda, Paula Lewin has learned the
idiosyncrasies of wind along her island-nation's waterfront sailing
arena at Hamilton Harbor. With buildings on one side, and a hill on
the other, the breeze gets fluky. But when it comes to yacht
racing, the irregularity can pay off in a favorable lift that bodes
well for the sailor smart enough to see it coming.
</P>
<P>
   That tidbit of local knowledge is apt to work nicely for Lewin,
an unseeded competitor in this year's $60,000 Gold Cup. The
match-racing regatta is celebrating its 50th anniversary, and the
occasion has brought together some of the best match-race sailors
in the world. Among the eight seeded skippers are Peter Gilmour of
Australia, ranked No. 1 worldwide; Chris Law of England, No. 2;
Peter Holmberg of the U.S. Virgin Islands, No. 3; and from New
Zealand, Gavin Brady, No. 4, and Russell Coutts, No. 6.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of a lineup, a relative amateur such as Lewin
might seem out of place. But the event tries to mix up competitors,
just to make things interesting. ``I'm not intimidated by it,''
Lewin said in a recent telephone interview. ``I'm ready to step up
to the challenge, and I hope to win. When you get to a higher
level, you can't get frustrated about the people you're sailing
against.''
</P>
<P>
   Four-person teams will be competing in identical International
One Design sloops. The 33-foot yachts, which are heavier and less
agile than modern grand prix boats, have been used for the Gold Cup
since 1951.
</P>
<P>
   As skipper for the only all-women's crew in a field of 24 teams,
Lewin has more pressure than most. She's no slouch, however, having
reached No. 19 on the world rankings, the highest ever for a woman.
But men's teams with more racing experience will be sweating it out
among the 16 teams at the unseeded level, too.
</P>
<P>
   Take Paul Cayard, a veteran America's Cup skipper and recent
winner of the Whitbread Round the World Race. ``I've got it in my
mind that starting out in the unseeded group will give me the extra
practice that I need,'' Cayard said last week by telephone from San
Francisco. ``But the unseeded round doesn't look particularly easy
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Another unseeded team to deal with will surely be the boat
sailed by Glen Foster of New York. A retired stock exchange
specialist, the 68-year-old Foster has sailed all his life. He has
competed at the world-class level in 6-meter yachts, and regularly
sails a 29-foot Dragon in international regattas.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gold Cup, which Foster last sailed in 1953, he has
surrounded himself with a 30-something crew that includes three top
U.S. sailors: Ron Rosenberg, Morgan Larson and Kevin Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have enough confidence,'' Foster said. ``The others
could outmaneuver us, but then, we may outmaneuver them.''
</P>
<P>
   The round-robin series for unseeded skippers is scheduled to
begin Sunday. The top eight teams will then proceed to preliminary
racing against the eight seeded skippers beginning Tuesday. The
semifinals and finals are scheduled for next weekend .
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just hoping for medium air and nothing too hairy,'' Lewin
said. ``These boats are physically challenging because they're so
heavy. I'm used to lighter boats, like the J/22 and J/24, that turn
more quickly. But it will be really good sailing. And if we win, it
would be terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   MAKING WAVES
</P>
<P>
   A long-awaited low pressure system provided the 147-foot ketch
Mari-Cha III with the right conditions last Thursday to begin its
attempt at breaking the trans-Atlantic sailing record for
monohulls. The carbon fiber yacht set sail from Ambrose Light off
Sandy Hook, N.J. at 5:09 a.m., New York time, for its 3,000-mile
crossing. The boat, owned by Robert Miller of England, is out to
beat a west-to-east sailing time of nine days 22 hours set last
July by Christophe Auguin of France in his 60-foot sloop, Geodis.
... A dying northerly breeze and light, shifting winds marked the
last day of racing last weekend in the J/44 North American
Championship on Long Island Sound. Winner of the three-day regatta
was Mabuhay II , a J/44 owned by Dr. Eduardo Salvati of New York.
Eleven of the 44-foot sailboats raced from Saturday through
Monday. &QL;

 KATHLEEN LUKENS, 67, A MOTHER FOREMOST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kathleen Lukens, a more or less ordinary woman whose life had
such an ordinary focus on her children it is a wonder how much
people made of what she saw as routine maternal devotion, died on
Tuesday at her home in Tappan, N.Y. She was 67 and had been
executive director of Camp Venture, a Rockland County service
organization for the developmentally disabled that she founded in
1969.
</P>
<P>
   Her family said the cause was cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A 1952 Barnard College graduate who taught a year at a private
girls' school and worked another year as a police reporter and
feature writer for The Bergen Evening Record before marrying and
settling into a suburban routine, Mrs. Lukens, who was born in
Philadelphia and grew up in northern New Jersey, was typical of a
generation of women who put their families before careers.
</P>
<P>
   As a standard PTA mom cum after-school chauffeur with the usual
array of committee meetings and volunteer work, Mrs. Lukens, a
labor organizer's daughter who was also active in the anti-nuclear
and civil rights movements, did pretty much what any suburban
mother of her era did. And if her refrigerator to-do list was a bit
longer than most, she did, after all, have five children with
varying needs to take care of.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there was anything so taxing about that. As the
children came along, Mrs. Lukens simply dealt with their needs as a
matter of routine, feeding them, keeping them clean, nursing them
through the standard childhood illnesses and sending them off in
turn to school and summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   It was a routine that varied only in the details. When her
fourth son, David, turned out to be autistic, for example, and she
discovered there were no camps in Rockland County for children with
such developmental disabilities, Mrs. Lukens, who had previously
helped start a nursery school for her three older sons, simply did
the obvious thing: She started a camp for David.
</P>
<P>
   She called it Camp Venture, and if at first it was more venture
than camp, when it comes to taking care of children, one thing
tends to lead to another, and almost before Mrs. Lukens knew it,
David had grown up and she had built Camp Venture into a sprawling
multiservice organization with an $18 million, largely
Medicaid-financed, annual budget that now operates 15 supervised
group homes, four day-service centers and other programs that serve
about 1,000 Rockland County adults and children with an array of
developmental disorders, including autism, Down's syndrome and
cerebral palsy.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Mrs. Lukens, who told David's story in a 1989
novella, ``Song of David,'' had some help, including loving
assistance from her husband, Dr. John H. Lukens, a clinical
psychologist; from David's four siblings, including his little
sister; and from other parents, some of whom actually picked up and
moved to Rockland County so they could join Mrs. Lukens' enterprise
and their children could benefit from Camp Venture.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it was easy. At a time when the mentally retarded and
those with other developmental disabilities were routinely
warehoused in indifferent state institutions like the notorious
Letchworth Village, to win the required government financing for
supervised group homes Mrs. Lukens had to become a public advocate,
buttonholing politicians and organizing campaigns for reform.
</P>
<P>
   If the notion that disabled adults could function to varying
degrees and have satisfying, rewarding lives under appropriate
supervision in small group homes struck many as outlandish, Mrs.
Lukens was especially effective in getting a mother's viewpoint
across.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, for example, was so impressed with her
eloquent appeals that he asked her to become a speechwriter. In
their turns, Gov. Mario Cuomo declared her New York State 1984
woman of the year and named her to his advisory council on mental
retardation and developmental disabilities and Gov. George Pataki
named her to the state Provider Council in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Mrs. Lukens had received so many honors and heard so
much effusive praise from so many educators, civic leaders and
politicians it was a wonder she had any time for her nine
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, perhaps, four of Mrs. Lukens' children grew up
to go into some form of social work: her oldest son, Mark, is a
minister in East Rockaway, N.Y.; Jonathan of Carmel, N.Y., and her
daughter, Margaret Byrne, of Orangeburg, N.Y., are clinical social
workers; and Daniel, of Congers, N.Y., is his mother's successor as
executive director of Camp Venture.
</P>
<P>
   As for David, now 36, he has what his family describes as a
happy life, living at a Camp Venture group home in New City and
participating in activities at a Camp Venture day-services center,
all thanks to the efforts of a more or less ordinary woman who saw
her maternal duty as making sure all of her children got all of the
care they needed.

 &HT;    Refugee relief tied up in web of red tape, danger, sheer numbers
 &HT;    By Bert Roughton Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GURIBARDHE, Yugoslavia _ Late Saturday morning, the rumbling of
large vehicles just over the grassy hills caused a knot in Ahmed
Gashi's stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Five months ago, Gashi, 32, fled with his wife, three children
and 88-year-old grandmother as the Serb military advanced on their
village.
</P>
<P>
   Fear drove them away then, and fear keeps them away.
</P>
<P>
   At first the family wandered in the open, eating what little
they had carried with them.
</P>
<P>
   In time, they found a vacant block house with a solid red-tile
roof strategically perched on a hillside. From the front porch,
they and another family, also displaced by the fighting, could scan
the valley.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed safe enough, but after a night listening to the sounds
of shelling a few miles away, on Saturday Gashi awoke edgy anyway.
</P>
<P>
   And now there was the rumble of heavy trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he could make out a white Land Cruiser with a flag rising
from its hood. It was followed by a convoy of eight trucks. His
heart rose. The blue-and-white flag bore the emblem of the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain to you what I felt to see this,'' Gashi later
told visitors at the house. ``Those trucks are the only hope for
our children to continue. It is how they hang on.''
</P>
<P>
   With winter coming on, it is a sight he may not see again for
some time.
</P>
<P>
   Interrupted for a few days by the mounting Kosovo crisis,
humanitarian aid trucks again are venturing out from Pristina, the
embattled province's capital.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, convoys organized by the U.N. refugee agency left
the Mother Teresa Warehouse outside Pristina in a dense early
morning fog and headed for two areas where refugees had
congregated. The trucks carried tons of food, clothing and shelter
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, aid planners in Pristina meet to consider more than a
dozen potential sites each in dire need before selecting what they
they think pick one or two.
</P>
<P>
   They are in a race against time. Aid workers must make as many
deliveries as possible in the next few weeks before winter comes.
</P>
<P>
   When the snows fall, the condition of the Kosovo refugees
_particularly the children _ will become dramatically worse, just
as access to them becomes even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   It is a complex and frustrating undertaking plagued by
uncertainty, poor roads, bad weather, land mines, red tape and
tensions that have accompanied the boom of humanitarian aid groups
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you feel like there are so many brushfires, and
we've just got this one fire brigade,'' said Francis Teoh, a new
deputy in the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest challenge is getting a handle on how many
needy people are out there and where to find them.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows with certainty how many people have been displaced
by the war. Estimates range from 250,000 to more than 450,000, and
the number seems to change all the time. Teoh is suspicious of the
numbers because displaced people move around so much. Sometimes
monitors don't see them where they hide, and other times they count
them twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest thing,'' Teoh said. ``We must have better
numbers to be able to develop effective plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty creates a logistical nightmare. ``You'll get a
report that on one day there are 5,000 people in a place and by the
time you get there, there won't be anybody,'' said Mick Lorentzen,
the director for the World Food Program office here. ``It's hard to
chase a moving target with bags of flour.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's convoy, for example, equipped to aid 13,000 people,
learned on it arrival that there were actually 25,000 displaced
people in the vicinity.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the 20,000 residents of nearby villages, who have
helped the refugees, have now depleted their own already meager
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the locals have now joined the rolls of the needy.
``The conditions for both groups now are the same,'' said Bahti
Thaqi, the Mother Teresa Society coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, displaced people in Kosovo are not
defined by most groups as refugees because they have not crossed a
national border. This creates a problem for organizations such as
the various United Nations relief agencies and Care International,
who focus primarily on refugees.
</P>
<P>
   To cope with these technicalities, the agencies have agreed to
structure their aid in a way to care for as many of the people
affected by the war as possible, Lorentzen said. ``They're all in
need, so we figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to this the explosion of humanitarian aid groups in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, a half-dozen foreign humanitarian aid groups had
offices here. Now there are more than 30, with each seeking to
develop their own programs.
</P>
<P>
   While no one argues that the need is immense, the flood of
agencies _ some of them relatively inexperienced _ poses
significant issues with coordination and logistics. ``So many
people are, here and more and more are coming in,'' Teoh said. ``We
may have to close the door.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, the organizations are snapping up offices and
installing fax machines, phone lines and computers. They are
staffing up on talented locals, for whom there sometimes is tough
competition.
</P>
<P>
   As it is with human nature, the familiar battles of egos and
politics sometimes color discussions intended to find solutions for
people in profound need for even the basic needs of life. ``It's a
bit disgusting perhaps, but it's a reality,'' said Stephen Pratt,
the Yugoslavia director for CARE International. ``When you're an
aid organization, you have to be dynamic or die.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the organizations so far have been able to work out their
differences, aid workers say. The aid convoys, the single largest
act of cooperation, somehow manage to depart on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Once outside Pristina, Saturday's convoy entered the region
where much of the fighting has been. Almost all villages were
deserted, the fields untended and many of the buildings destroyed.
Dogs and livestock wandered the landscape, free after months
without human supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, there were Serb soldiers, who apparently have
taken up residence in some of the evacuated buildings, particularly
gas stations, presumably because they have stores of motor fuel. On
the black market, gasoline is being sold for about $15 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   After passing through Malisehva, the convoy left the paved road
and struck out on a narrow jarring path of rock and dirt that
snakes over the hills. In the distance are the snow capped Dinaric
Alps, the jagged mountain range that rises between Kosso and
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Even though most of the shooting has stopped, security remains
an issue for these unarmed convoys. In addition to the sometimes
less than cordial attitude of Serbian police and soldiers, aid
workers worry about traveling through country that at times seems
lawless.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, anti-tank mines have been found buried in roads
like the one the convoy is taking to Guribardhe. Maps showing the
mined roads are updated and circulated frequently among the aid
agencies. Even so, it is a threat that is never far from anyone's
thoughts on these roads.
</P>
<P>
   The suffering at the end of the road is hard for even veteran
aid workers to take. A woman with Care International shed tears as
she spoke to a weeping woman staying with her family in a cramped,
fly infested house across a muddy yard from a dank, smelly barn in
Guribardie.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Sahadete Morina, is with her daughter-in-law and five
grandchildren. Morina has not seen her son, Nevzat, since soon
after they fled their town of Klina Cvrk last summer.
</P>
<P>
   One day, when the family was living in the woods after escaping,
her son was walking, holding the hands of his daughters, 6 and 4,
Morina said, a 2-year-old grandchild on her hip. ``The soldiers got
him, pulled him from his children,'' she said, also telling the
story with her hands.
</P>
<P>
   The two girls stood at her side, listening without emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen him since,'' she said, the tears returning. ``I
think they must have killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with their bitter memories, the refugees face a hard
future.
</P>
<P>
   For the children, it is particularly dire, aid workers say. Many
of the children who flocked around the aid workers Saturday had
runny noses and fevers. Many still wear the sandals they were
wearing when they left home last summer. Their mothers said many
had diarrhea and poor access to good drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   The 74 refugees living in a schoolhouse nearby get their water
from a muddy well they have dug in the playground. They have been
living for months on the crude bread they make from the flour,
sugar and vegetable oil that arrives when the convoys come. They
also get some rice, pasta and beans.
</P>
<P>
   Meat for most is something between a vague memory and distant
longing. Refugees tended to laugh Saturday when asked when they
last had any meat.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere there were small children and babies. A woman at the
school proudly produced a 6-week-old baby she says she delivered in
the woods before finding this shelter. ``Look how beautiful,'' she
said as she presented the bundled infant to a visitor. But two
women and their babies also have died in childbirth at the school,
which has only the infrequent attention of a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Life for babies is hard and promises to get even harder when the
extreme cold arrives. While diarrhea is common, diapers are rare.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of what the winter will bring aid workers want
desperately for the refugees to return to their homes, where they
might stand a better than fighting chance with the weather.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to gaining at least somewhat better shelter, aid
workers are eager for some stability and predictability. Only then
can they develop plans for the winter that make good sense, they
say.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the fear that drove them from their homes seems to have
subsided little. And each night when they hear the shellings and
gunfire echoing over the hills, they become less inclined to leave
whatever shelter they have found to strike out toward home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will go home only when all the police have left our
villages,'' said Idriz Shabani, whose family is sharing a small
room in a dark, house-filled house, with two other families. ``Only
then will there be any safety for us. Until then, we'll stay and do
what we can.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jan Sasson's divorce was so nasty and so prolonged that when it
was finally over, he was, in a sense, homeless _ in an affluent
sort of way. He had an apartment, after the property was divided
up, but it was rented out and he needed the income.
</P>
<P>
   He had no job, because his investment in a chicken-restaurant
franchise had gone bad and had diverted him from his
once-prosperous jewelry business. He had just gone through an
operation to replace a hip. So at the end, exhausted and
shell-shocked, he was taken in by his lawyer's assistant, who let
him stay with her for a few months until he could find a job and
start over.
</P>
<P>
   Now his downtown loft on Broome Street near the Bowery is so
chic, so decidedly hip, with its exposed brick walls, leather
couches and huge restaurant-style stove, that it is impossible not
to wonder: Is this really the home of a man who recently had
nothing, who rented a room in an apartment on the Bowery?
</P>
<P>
   But his possessions _ the table bought for $10 from a homeless
man who was wheeling it down the street, the mirror that belonged
to his grandmother in the Bronx, the bureau he used as a child on
Long Island _ tell the tale of someone who has spent little to
furnish his place.
</P>
<P>
   He renovated it _ as well as the space below that he rents out _
using credit cards and the proceeds from selling the apartment he
had kept. But mostly, he did it by having an idea, and with it, he
has rebuilt his life. At least, his material life.
</P>
<P>
   Sasson, the son of a watchmaker, grew up on Long Island and went
into the diamond business as a young man because it seemed like a
logical thing to do. But on the side, he always played around with
real estate, because he loved architecture and had a feeling for
the possibilities inherent in space. Eventually he owned a few
places on Long Island and two co-ops in a loft building on Bleecker
Street.
</P>
<P>
   After divorcing his first wife, he met a woman, a part-time
model, in a bar, he said. They married and had a son. But in 1994,
after only four years, they broke up, and his comfortable, affluent
life unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   When the divorce was final, and he was living in his lawyer's
assistant's apartment, he began planning his new life.
</P>
<P>
   Because he had a real estate license, he was able in 1997 to get
a job with Citi Habitats, a rental brokerage company that wanted to
expand into sales. He started their sales division, which he still
runs, and he began making a steady income again. He found an ad for
a room to rent in an apartment on the Bowery for $600 a month in a
photographer's loft shared by four people. It wasn't a great place
to visit with his son, but he stayed for four months because he
could pay the rent.
</P>
<P>
   And the location was fateful, not far from the building where he
had had his jewelry business, in a neighborhood he considers ripe
for development, at the eastern edge of SoHo and the western edge
of the East Village.
</P>
<P>
   He began knocking on doors, trying to find space he might
renovate and then rent out, convinced that people who were paying
thousands of dollars a month for large lofts in SoHo would do the
same in a neighborhood some call BoHo, for Bowery below Houston.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the buildings, he said, are owned by people who run the
retail stores below, in some cases third-generation owners whose
families had originally lived on the Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them, he said, do not want to sell their buildings
because they would face enormous capital-gains taxes, or maybe
because they believe the buildings will appreciate far more in the
next few years.
</P>
<P>
   He met the owner of a building on Broome Street near the Bowery,
a building with a retail business on the ground floor but empty
boarded-up space on the two floors above. The owner took him
upstairs. There were no floors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to walk on the joists,'' he said. The ceiling had been
dropped, so it was only seven-and-a-half-feet high. ``I was jumping
out of my skin,'' he said. ``I was so excited to see this.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people would have taken a look at the dark, cavelike space
and walked away. But he figured that if someone opened it up and
put in the right finishes, it could rival any SoHo loft.
</P>
<P>
   He reached an agreement to rent both floors for 15 years, hoping
he could rent out the 2,500-square-foot lower loft for a price that
would cover most of his costs so he could live nearly rent free in
the 1,300 square feet upstairs. The landlord provided new floors,
fixed the crumbling walls and put in plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   Sasson renovated the apartments with the kinds of finishes and
appliances typical of high-end downtown lofts, but in some cases he
used materials that give a similar look but cost less. The counters
in his kitchen, for instance, look like green slate from a distance
but are really laminate.
</P>
<P>
   And he paid attention to the details that people care about,
because they provide character, and people pay for character.
</P>
<P>
   He told the landlord that he wanted brick and not sheetrock on
the walls _ and that it should be old brick, so the place would not
look as if it had just been built.
</P>
<P>
   He salvaged what he could, too, finding an old etched-glass door
in the basement that he stripped and used as the door to a pantry.
He rented out the loft downstairs for $5,600 a month to three men
who work on Wall Street, and in early September he moved into his
new loft, leaving an apartment he had been renting from a friend.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Now he is negotiating with other owners of buildings near the
Bowery, hoping to lease more space that he will renovate and rent.
He likes the neighborhood and the architecture; he walks up and
down the streets imagining what the buildings could be if they were
cleaned up, fixed up.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, these streets were part of Chinatown. But many
of the Asian-American tenants have been leaving. Not all, though _
next door to his building is a kimchi factory that gives a distinct
smell to the hallways of his building, but not to the apartments.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood has few services _ ``You can't buy a quart of
milk or a newspaper,'' he said _ but once a ``destination''
restaurant arrives, a place like Balthazar, he is sure the other
retailers will follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The architecture is here, and that's where it all starts,'' he
said, pointing to a building on the Bowery he said was ``as nice as
anything in SoHo.''
</P>
<P>
   He is proud of himself, too, for persevering, he said, and these
days for having a regular relationship with his son, which was
interrupted by the conflict over the divorce.
</P>
<P>
   And financially? ``I'm about where I was 12 years ago,'' he
said. ``I guess that's progress.''

to comply with a U.S.-brokered peace agreement, this small hill
village was shelled through the night, terrifying residents and
damaging dozens of homes. Serb forces in the area also did not

has agreed to reduce the Serb military presence in Kosovo.

   INTERNATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   ATTN EDs: Today marks 25 years since the Arab oil embargo of
1973, following the Yom Kippur War. Cox Newspapers foreign bureaus
and Washington will take a look at where the world goes from here
in terms of oil production and consumption, with an underlying
question: Could it happen again? The following are budget lines for
the package, which MOVED Mon., Oct. 12, in both the (i)
International and (k) Commentary categories for use in
Perspective/Opinion/Insight sections:
</P>
<P>
   OIL-EMBARGO _ WASHINGTON _ What ever happened to fuel
efficiency? Today, it seems like every other vehicle on the road in
the United States is a gas-guzzling, four-wheel drive sport utility
vehicle. What, if anything is the government and/or auto industry
doing to conserve fuel? What ever happened to the strategic oil
reserve; and all the dire predictions? We'll also wrap in what it
was like when the embargo first hit, looking at things like
President Richard Nixon's speech telling Americans that their lives
would never be the same. (Mollison, Cox News Service). MOVED
</P>
<P>
   OIL-MIDEAST _ KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait _ As times get a little
tighter in this oil-rich sheikhdom on the desert, they have even
considered raising the price of gasoline. The oil minister has
noted the irony. ``It looks odd and peculiar that, at a time when
many countries are cutting the prices at the gas stations, you're
increasing it in Kuwait. That's absurd,'' said Saud Nasir Al-Saud
Al-Sabah in a recent interview. ``I don't think this is something
that's acceptable to us now.'' It costs about 50 cents a gallon to
fill up the many large cars that are the preference here. While the
government is removing the subsidies that have kept the price low,
dropping world oil prices have protected Kuwaiti motorists from
seeing any increase at gas stations. Therein lies the problem.
(Kaplow, Cox News Service). MOVED
</P>
<P>
   OIL-LATAM _ MEXICO CITY _ After the Arab oil embargo, the United
States pledged to diversify the foreign sources of its oil
supplies. Over the years, more and more imports of foreign oil have
come from the Americas _ from Canada, Mexico, Venezuela and other
Western Hemisphere countries. The Western Hemisphere, in fact, now
accounts for more than half of foreign oil imports. Mexico, which
nationalized its oil in 1938 and is now the world's fifth largest
producer, once sought to limit sales of oil to the United States to
under 50 percent of its exports out of fear of domination. Mexico
is also very dependent on its oil, in spite of attempts to
diversity its economy. So far this year, with falling oil prices,
Mexico has been forced to cut its budget three times.
(Emling/Ferriss, Cox News Service). MOVED
</P>
<P>
   OIL-RUSSIA _ MOSCOW _ Boomtowns in Russia? Despite its current
economic turmoil, Russia ranks among the world's most fertile
countries in proven reserves of oil and natural gas. Parts of the
former Soviet Union are flourishing as American and other Western
companies scramble to get in on prospecting that could help to lift
Russia out of its economic mess. Off Sakhalin Island in the
northern Pacific and in the Caspian Sea region on Russia's southern
fringe, billions of dollars are being spent on exploration and
drilling. Sizable American diplomatic and technical resources are
at play, too, in the effort to reach the oil in harsh climates and
a politically unstable region. (Holmes, Cox News Service). MOVED
</P>
<P>
   OIL-ASIA _ BEIJING _ A quarter-century after the last energy
crisis, the price of oil is once again resetting the balance of
power throughout the world _ starting in Asia. With the world
market gorged with cheap petroleum, oil-exporter Indonesia could no
longer support a high standard of living for its masses. The rupiah
collapsed and then the Suharto regime collapsed. Yet what felled
Indonesia has helped ignite China's explosive growth. Until 1997,
China was a net oil exporter, but now it needs more oil if it is to
sustain its 8 percent a year growth path. For now, China continues
to expand its economy, thanks in part to the relatively cheap oil
it imports from Saudi Arabia. Another beneficiary is India, which
like China lacks super-giant oilfields to sustain its growth.

<P>
   KOSOVO-RELIEF _ PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The massive relief effort
struggling to get back underway here is being delayed by red tape,
land mines, funding and the sheer scope of the struggle among 50
relief agencies climbing all over themselves for a piece of the
pie. They are being coordinated loosely by the United Nations,
which is in a predicament because its charter forbids it from
providing assistance to ``domestic refugees'' _ those who have not
crossed into another country. There are 550,000 Bosnian Serb and
Croat refugees already here _ some of been here four years _ and
they also pose a problem. (Roughton, Cox News Service). MOVED
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-SHARON _ JERUSALEM _ Israel's newly appointed foreign
minister Ariel Sharon arrives in Washington on Saturday to join the
Mideast summit between Israeli and Palestinian leaders. But what
effect will all the baggage that the controversial former military
commander brings with him have on the summit talks? A newsy profile
of Sharon. (Kaplow, Cox News Service). MOVED

voters are leaning and what the gambling debate has done to the
campaigns. (Manuel, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED
</P>
<P>
   GOVS-BROTHERS _ Last year, Republicans took over both houses of
the Florida legislature. This year, it looks like they'll win the
governor's chair. Jeb Bush is leading Democratic Lt. Gov. Buddy
MacKaye. If brother George W. Bush wins Texas, Jeb would be part of
the first governor brothers pair in U.S. history. (MWilliams,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED
</P>
<P>
   SPACETV _ What's the biggest story of the century? For veteran
newsman Walter Cronkite there's only one answer: space exploration.
Cronkite covered John Glenn's historic 1962 Mercury mission that
orbited the Earth and now he's come out of retirement to cover
Glenn's Challenger mission beginning Oct. 29. And once again,
television will be the vehicle that informs and inspires when it
comes to travel beyond the hemisphere. Will also look at the
changes in viewer interest and television technology. (Holloway,

   HOGS _ Thirty-five years ago, when the family of Brookville,
Ohio, farmer Pete Dull was ready to sell their hogs, they put the
pigs in a trailer and drove to one of several Dayton
slaughterhouses. But then they closed. So the family began taking
the hogs to a packing plant in Troy. It closed, too. That forced
them to haul the animals to Hillshire Farm &AMP; Kahn's in Cincinnati,
a round trip of over 100 miles. Four years ago, that slaughterhouse
shut down as well. Today, Dull's hogs go to Kentucky and Indiana,
trips that cost him an extra $2.50 or so per hog (he raises about
10,000 a year). That would be bad enough in a robust market, but
pork prices this year are at their lowest level in five years.

KNOW THIS: CHAN CHANGES COWBOYS FOR BETTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it was Jimmy and Jerry, egos overflowed at Valley Ranch.
The thermostat was permanently set on chilly.
</P>
<P>
   When it was Gunsmoke and Jerry, there was a San Francisco-like
environment at Valley Ranch. No, not the 49ers. Thick fog.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Chan Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Give it a few years and we all will know how it worked out, but
the early returns do show some dramatic changes at the Valley Ranch
bunker.
</P>
<P>
   With football being the focus once again, that puts the Cowboys
back into the Jimmy era. But without the I-I-I-me-me-me contest
between coach and owner.
</P>
<P>
   And with Gailey proving himself qualified to conduct football
business, when was the last time you heard Jerry hint around about
wanting to coach the Cowboys?
</P>
<P>
   With The Smokester on the scene, Jones could say it and be taken
halfway serious. Which was an embarrassment to both.
</P>
<P>
   With Gailey, Jones doesn't even think it, which happens when the
owner respects his coach as a coach instead of trying to cover up
for a friend and drinking buddy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long haul, the Cowboys will have success or failure
based on Gailey, the football man. But thus far, the human side has
been intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   It was Troy Aikman, on the last day of training camp in Wichita
Falls, who said:
</P>
<P>
   ``The players are going to respect him and like him, but none us
are really going to know him. Chan is not here to be our friend.
Everyone, including me, is kept at an arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will all know what he's thinking, good or bad. But we
aren't going to know everything. No one should ever become
overconfident about where they personally stand with Chan. As a
player, you might be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is the coaching ``edge.'' Tom Landry had it,
Jimmy had it ... but in a totally different way. Now here's Gailey,
different from both, but probably closer to Landry.
</P>
<P>
   Except there's the other side of Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in the Carolina game, the Cowboys had offensive
confusion at the end of the first half. What resulted was bad clock
management and bad decisions. Afterward, Gailey, with a smile,
said, ``I blame the offensive coordinator. He really screwed up.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, would be Chan Gailey, the head coach's
offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   But Gailey volunteered an additional chapter to the story, one
that most head coaches in the NFL probably wouldn't. Except here's
a case where ego is held in check.
</P>
<P>
   Told that press box second-guessing was extreme due to the end
of the first-half confusion, Gailey replied, ``I'm sure it was, but
that doesn't brother me. Besides, it couldn't have been as bad as
what I got at home. My wife unloaded on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey explained that with wife Laurie, they had stopped by the
post-game coaches' reception at Texas Stadium, then departed for a
Sunday evening church service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was kind of pleasant _ we had won the game and
all,'' he said. ``But when we got home, Laurie says, `We need to
talk about your two-minute offense. You've got to do something
about that. It was pitiful.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't too pleased about it myself, but she got all over
me,'' continued Gailey, laughing. ``Laurie is not only the greatest
wife, she's also got a good football mind. Don't ever sit around
her at a game _ she'll tell you what she's thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, there was that time when Gailey was coaching in
college at Troy State _ in fact, it was his Troy State team that
won the small college national championship. During the season,
there was a tense game with Mississippi College.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had gotten the lead late, then got the ball back, and
really had the running game going,'' said Gailey. ``The clock was
moving, but I decided to get cute _ I called for a pass. I figured
I'd nail it down right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Except his quarterback was hit, fumbled, and the other team
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to hold on, but our defense saved us, and we won the
game,'' said Gailey. ``In the last few seconds, I'm standing there
on the sidelines all relieved and feeling pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I hear this, `Chan ... Chan.' Laurie had left the stands,
come down to the fence, and she says, `That was the dumbest call
I've ever seen.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Later, we're talking, and I said, `Laurie, you can't say that
in front of the players and the fans.' Her answer was, `Well, I was
just telling you what they were also thinking.'''
</P>
<P>
   So if there's some questionable play-calling in Chicago today,
Gailey said he doesn't have to read about it Monday morning: ``I
will already have heard everything when I get back home Sunday
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, things have changed at Valley Ranch.

For Aiello, a Padres-Yankees matchup has caused an inner struggle
about whom he is going to root for: the team that is part of his

Nationalist veterans from Taiwan carrying flags and a mock coffin
in memory of a comrade, as part of a demonstration in Manhattan's
Chinatown against Taiwan's government, demanding more retirement
benefits. To date, the campaign has largely swirled in the New York
area, partly because Chinatown holds the largest concentration of
veterans from Taiwan, and partly because veterans elsewhere in the
country live too far from one another to organize effectively. (Vic

William Wong, 66, in his Chinatown apartment, cannot afford to
inter the ashes of three Nationalist comrades from Taiwan, in boxes
at left. After decades of hiding in the shadows of society's
margins, the Nationalist veterans, many of whom live in New York,
are seeking recognition and have demanded more retirement benefits
from Taiwan's government. ``I miss my friends. Some day, I'd like
to be able to bury them with the proper respect,'' says Wong. (Ruby

The New York Yankees shortstop, Derek Jeter, ever loose, gives only
the fleetest of thoughts to his moments of failure on the field or
at the plate. Jeter, whose childhood dream was to play shortstop
for the Yankees, was a regular in his rookie season of 1996 and was
part of a team that won the World Series; two years later, at age
24, Jeter is already one of the best players on a club that may be
called the best ever. (Chang W. Lee/New York Times Photo)

10-17 -- Alan Aiello, a 28-year San Diego resident from Brooklyn,
N.Y., has a difficult choice to make for this year's World Series.
For Aiello, a Padres-Yankees matchup has caused an inner struggle
about whom he is going to root for: the team that is part of his
soul, or the team of underdogs that has grabbed most of the hearts
in San Diego. ``I have decided only one thing,'' he says. ``My
tailor is going to take half of my Yankees hat and half of my
Padres hat and sew them together.'' (Robert Burroughs/New York

their otherwise rough-and-tumble day. Ford dishes up daily weather
reports, baseball scores, inspirational pep talks and greetings in
a dozen languages to passengers. ``He makes everybody smile,'' says
Mike Imber, a passenger from Westport. It's refreshing to see
somebody who has such a joy for what he does.'' (Thomas

an initiative to add a 50-cent tax to cigarettes in California.

Wisconsin Works, also known as W-2, which accounts for 87 percent

REAL ESTATE: THE VORNADO TORNADO SLOWS DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Steven Roth, chairman of Vornado Realty Trust, hit
New York's office market like a whirlwind last year, buying Bernard
Mendik's portfolio of 4 million square feet of Manhattan properties
for $650 million as Mendik Co. was preparing to become the city's
first real estate investment trust.
</P>
<P>
   The deal came as a surprise, because Vornado was best known as
the operator of suburban shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
   But having decided to move into the Manhattan office market,
Roth went on a tear, spending an additional $1.7 billion to acquire
such properties as the building known as One Penn Plaza, which
occupies most of the block bounded by 33rd and 34th Streets and
Seventh and Eighth Avenues.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Vornado bought all or the large majority of the
ownership positions in 20 buildings in the city including most of
the buildings on both sides of Seventh Avenue between 31st and 34th
Streets. The company has said it plans to transform the area into
the urban equivalent of an entertainment-oriented shopping mall,
with Macy's at 34th Street and Penn Station-Madison Square Garden
complex serving as anchors.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, Roth has been less active. Since announcing an
agreement to acquire the 1 million-square-foot building at 770
Broadway at Eighth Street and a smaller structure in June, little
news has flowed from Vornado's headquarters in Saddle Brook, N.J.
Last week, the company did announce that Mendik, who had been
co-chairman of Vornado, had resigned to pursue private interests
and said that it had acquired some property from Mendik's partners
for $104 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some real estate executives have speculated that the steep
decline in the price of Vornado's stock (the name comes from a fan
company taken over by Roth's predecessor as a tax shelter) have
made it impossible for the company to issue operating partnership
units, which eventually convert into common stock, to pay for
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Vornado's stock, which reached almost $50 a share earlier this
year, has been trading recently in the vicinity of $30 a share.
Most REIT industry shares have, of course, taken a pounding in the
stock market in recent months. The argument is that if a REIT meets
an owner's price with the devalued stock, it will be perceived to
have overpaid if the stock price rises to what the REIT managers
consider a ``normal'' level.
</P>
<P>
   Roth does not appear much in public. Indeed, he proclaims in
Vornado's annual report that ``we will continue our policy of
almost never talking to the press.''
</P>
<P>
   But Roth did appear at a recent state-of-the-market meeting
organized by Insignia/ESG, the current corporate form of the old
Edward S. Gordon Co.
</P>
<P>
   At that meeting, Roth conceded that his company's acquisition
pace had slowed considerably in recent months. But he said that the
ability to pay was not an issue because the company had over $1
billion available to finance purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, he said, is that owners' expectation of what their
properties are worth have become overly inflated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have just gone through a period of participating at
auctions held by institutions,'' he said, ``and we have been coming
in third and fourth. The pricing is wrong. That is why we have not
bought a building in six or seven months.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the big numbers involved in the company's entry to
the Manhattan office market, he said, Vornado's cost basis for its
buildings is $175 a square foot in a market where new construction
costs from $400 to $450 a square foot. Noting that many of the
properties were occupied by tenants with rents below the current
market rate, he said that the company would be supplied with
increasing cash as the leases expired and rents moved up toward
market levels. ``We have $30 space in a $40 market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the rents roll over, he said, they will add $130 million a
year to Vornado's cash flow over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Roth said the suspicion that some aggressive buyers overpaid for
property was reflected in the capital markets. In the early 1980s,
he said, interest rates were high, but lenders were willing to
finance all of an acquisition. ``You could borrow 105 percent of a
piece of real estate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that rates had generally declined from that period until
now, but that lenders were willing to finance only a smaller part
of a deal. ``The rates are low, but you can't borrow more than 60
percent of the cost of an asset,'' Roth said. ``My theory is that
the lenders suspect that the value of the buildings will go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth described the debt markets as being ``in chaos,''
apparently referring to the market for commercial mortgage-backed
securities, where as much as $20 billion in loans has piled up
awaiting sale. He said the lack of debt financing would choke off a
lot of new building.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he told the group of real estate brokers and
executives, in a time of economic uncertainty caused largely by
events in Asia and other overseas markets, ``for the first time
real estate's not the bad guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have a stunningly reasonable amount of debt,'' he
said, ``and there are almost no defaults in real estate.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, the recession was preceded by a wave of real
estate development, particularly in Manhattan. As a result, many
developers could not fill their properties with tenants at rental
rates anticipated in their financial projections. Some defaulted,
losing the buildings to lenders, who absorbed losses when they were
sold.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, tough times can also provide buying opportunities,
Roth noted. That's what he did in 1980, gaining control of Vornado
and its valuable real estate, as the Two Guys retail chain the
company was then operating faded. He repeated the trick later in
the decade, taking control of Alexander's Inc. and its real estate
as the retail operations became unprofitable.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although Vornado has extensive exposure to the retail market,
with 59 shopping centers with 12.4 million square feet of space as
of the end of last year, Roth said he ``lost faith in retail as an
investment in the mid-1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The retail market is saturated and the retailers are mature
and non-differentiated,'' he told the real estate group. ``They are
all selling the same products. Retail is going to get murdered in
the next recession.''
</P>
<P>
   Although best known for its shopping centers and, more recently,
for its incursion into Manhattan, Vornado is a broadly diversified
company. Roth said he seeks to invest in ``fortress'' or
``franchise'' properties whose very size or unique position in an
industry protects them from competition.
</P>
<P>
   One example, he said, is the company's 60 percent interest in
Americold Logistics, which operates 80 refrigerated warehouses,
with 394 million cubic feet of space. The company accounts for 25
percent of the refrigerated public warehouse space in the country
and Roth said anyone buying a frozen turkey in this area was
getting a bird that probably spent some time in one of those
warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Another is the Merchandise Mart in Chicago, a
5.4-million-square-foot building that Vornado bought in April for
$630 million. Roth said the facility was the major trade show
building for the furniture industry and that 65 percent of all the
contracts for office furniture are signed there annually.
</P>
<P>
   Roth may have something similar in mind for the fortress he has
assembled along Seventh Avenue in the Penn Station area. The
properties, which include the 1,700-room Hotel Pennsylvania, had
largely been individually owned. Roth had remarked in a previous
interview that ``there is a lot you can do when ownership is
concentrated in one strong hand.''
</P>
<P>
   He told the real estate group that he expected the trend toward
public ownership of real estate to continue, but at a slower rate
than that of the last few years because of the dip in REIT stock
prices and unavailability of public capital. Because REITs are
required to pay out 95 percent of their income to shareholders in
dividends, they have little in the way of retained earnings and
must return to public markets to finance growth.
</P>
<P>
   Roth said that real estate companies considering adopting the
REIT structure would just have to accept the fact that stock prices
fluctuate in unpredictable ways. ``Our stock dived six months ago
when the business was never better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that there was at least one way in which running a
public company was not that much different from the
family-controlled real estate companies, which are a hallmark of
New York real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public companies have to deal with analysts and family
companies have to deal with cousins,'' Roth said. ``And they are
both pains.''

CLINTON JOINS TALKS BETWEEN NETANYAHU, ARAFAT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUEENSTOWN, Md. _ President Clinton flew to a secluded Maryland
conference center Saturday in an attempt to salvage Mideast peace
talks and preserve one of the few major foreign policy successes of
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Skipping his 25th reunion at Yale Law School, Clinton joined
most of his national security team here as Israelis and
Palestinians continued to bicker about antiterrorist measures.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential scholars and Middle East specialists said that the
four-day summit is a risky move for Clinton because the chances of
failure are great and even a successful agreement between Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat is likely to be small. Any accord that is reached could be
endangered by a new violence in the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
   With congressional elections just 2 1/2 weeks away and
impeachment hearings looming, ``It's important that Clinton not be
seen as out of the loop, that he shows he is working for peace in
the Mideast, not relaxing at Hyannisport or Jackson Hole or
Hollywood,'' said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential and diplomatic
historian at the University of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had put Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright in
charge of the day-to-day mediation at this conference, which is
supposed to conclude Sunday night. But the president canceled a
campaign appearance in St. Louis Friday night to be on hand and
decided to visit the conference center Saturday in order to goad
both sides into making concessions. Clinton might join the talks
again Sunday, and the White House said another round of
negotiations might be added tomorrow if there is no resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than any other foreign policy undertaking Clinton has
made, this one is a test of his leadership,'' said Wayne Owens, a
former Democratic congressman from Utah and former member of the
House Foreign Affairs Committee. ``These talks are especially
significant because of the current cloud over Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House hopes that the Israelis will agree to give up 13
percent more of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinians'
agreement to pursue terrorists more vigorously. But unlike many
high-profile international conferences, this time the outcome has
not been agreed to in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has happened yet at the talks that is going to make
this easy on Clinton,'' said Stephen Cohen, vice chairman of the
Center for Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation. ``He's
definitely showing that he's still president.''
</P>
<P>
   If these talks are important to Clinton, they are equally
important to Albright. She has tried to avoid the fate of her
predecessor, Warren M. Christopher, who immersed himself in the
morass of Middle East politics.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a year ago, Albright said she would not ``tread
water'' while waiting for progress in the peace process. In another
attempt to prod the Israelis to withdraw from more West Bank
territory, Albright threatened in May to reveal details of the
negotiations that Netanyahu had wanted to keep secret. But the
White House prevented follow-through on that threat.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Albright's tough image has been tarnished as
diplomatic muddling followed her tough talk about Iraqi dictator
Saddam Hussein and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's major achievements overseas have been in forging a
peace accord in Ireland, halting the carnage in the Balkans, easing
a dictator from Haiti, dismantling ``loose nukes,'' and making
free-trade pacts.
</P>
<P>
   But massacres in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province have cast a pall
over the Balkans peace deal while Haiti has returned to its former
poverty and corruption despite tens of millions of dollars of aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's essential that Bill Clinton try to build on his modest
foreign policy successes over the last six years,'' Brinkley said.
``Trade policies and nuclear disarmament are not what presidents
are remembered for. War or peacemaking are what people remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after noon, Clinton arrived in his Marine helicopter at
the 1,000 acre former ranch on the banks of the Wye River near the
Maryland shore. The president had a light lunch with Albright and
other US participants at the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton held an 80-minute meeting with Arafat in a library, and
the two then took a five-minute walk with Arafat through the
retreat, which used to belong to the president of Steuben Glass
company. Continuing to seek support from Middle East leaders,
Clinton called Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak from a secure phone
at the operations center the White House set up on the grounds of
the conference center.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of the autumn day, Clinton sat outdoors and
talked with Netanyahu. The White House made clear their
conversation was ``informal,'' because observant Jews are not
supposed to work on the Sabbath, which ended at sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists were kept 20 miles away, at a community college,
where they were given only bare-bones details of the president's
schedule. White House spokesman Joseph Lockhart characterized the
third day of talks as ``constructive'' and said Clinton will join
Sunday ``if he feels he can play a constructive role.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to prevent the kind of battle of rhetoric common at
Mideast talks, the White House has demanded silence from the
spokesmen of Arafat and Netanyahu.

<P>
   Curiously, the merchandising push _ now amounting to 35
licensees with 100 items _ comes more than a year after the
original movie left multiplexes. It grossed a respectable $54
million domestically with almost no merchandising behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole `Austin Powers' concept really caught fire when it
hit video earlier this year,'' Imhoff said. ``The home video sold
almost 2 million units. Mike Myers agreed to do the sequel, and now
we've got retailers coming to us saying, `We want this.' Our
merchandising program is an anomaly by starting almost a year
before the movie's out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Silver, editor of the Toy Book newsletter, said some
``Austin Powers'' merchandise may click with an older audience.
``It's not a home-run property, but it could do quite well for
secondary, niche licenses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects are still murky for the licensing property of other
competing summer releases, although action figures, vehicles and
accessories are expected to go along with ``The Wild Wild West,''
``Tarzan'' and Disney's ``Inspector Gadget.''
</P>
<P>
   ``West'' will carry the built-in marketing apparatus of the
200-outlet Warner Studio store chain, while the latter two will
have the impressive backing of the Disney Store operation, with
well over 700 locations by next summer.
</P>
<P>
   With ``The Wild Wild West,'' Warner has one of the world's most
marketable stars in Will Smith and a potentially strong movie
concept that blends the Old West with futuristic machines. Warner
executives have said ``West'' items will be aimed toward boys, with
an emphasis on the kind of gadgetry seen in the late-'60s TV
series.
</P>
<P>
   As for Disney, its well-oiled marketing machine will undoubtedly
make major pushes for the animated ``Tarzan'' and the live-action
``Inspector Gadget'' with partners McDonald's and Mattel. Disney
Chairman Michael Eisner has already said ``Tarzan'' has potential
similar to that of ``The Lion King,'' which generated an estimated
$1 billion in merchandise sales.
</P>
<P>
   Scher rates prospects for ``The Wild Wild West'' as ``good'' and
``Tarzan'' as ``exceptional,'' noting Disney's last animated film,
``Mulan,'' performed above expectations in theaters and stores this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for 1999 are welcome news for makers of toys, video
games, T-shirts, posters and key chains after seeing
less-than-blockbuster sales from last summer's two largest movie
merchandise campaigns, for ``Godzilla'' and ``Small Soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver noted that neither was a complete flop, given standard
royalty rates of 10 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Godzilla' wasn't that bad,'' he said. ``It sold $90 million
of wholesale merchandise, partly because Sony followed the movie
with a children's TV show. Their royalty is a nice piece of change;
it's just not what everyone was hoping for.''
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Small Soldiers,'' the perception that it was too
violent for children and Burger King's decision to scale back its
campaign as a result of the PG-13 rating hurt its merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Small Soldiers' had all the makings of a huge line,'' Silver
said. ``Before the movie was released, it was sizzling, but the
tons of press about the violence just killed it. If it had been
less violent, it would have been a huge hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, any property can click if it hits at the right time,
which is why the wheels of commerce cranking out toys and
collectibles never stop turning. The potential is huge: Spending on
and by children tripled during the 1990s; children under 6 have
become a potent force for properties like the Teletubbies, Barney
and Winnie the Pooh; and the average 10-year-old's weekly allowance
rose from $7.90 a week in 1991 to $13.93 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every four or five years, you have a whole new group of kids
come into the market,'' Scher noted. &QL;

NEXT SUMMER MOVIE SEASON TO BE POWERFUL FORCE IN TOY MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- As toy merchants scramble to stock up for the
holiday season, frantic over whether they'll have a hit like 1984's
Cabbage Patch Kids or 1994's Power Rangers, they can take comfort
in one vital fact: The Force is with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace'' will storm into the world's
theaters next May, giving the toy business and movie merchandisers
a lock on a solid summer. Hundreds of new versions of one of the
most tried-and-true product lines, which has already generated $2
billion in revenues, will line store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe the summer of 1999 will be among the richest
periods ever for the lucrative licensing/merchandising world,
thanks mostly to George Lucas' careful management of the
merchandising of Luke Skywalker, Obi-wan Kenobi and the ``Star
Wars'' franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Other licensed toys could do well this summer, analysts say,
including the merchandise tied to Walt Disney Co.'s ``Tarzan'' and
``The Wild Wild West'' from Warner Bros. But it's the new ``Star
Wars'' that has everyone talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something tells me George Lucas wants this story to connect
with the public,'' said Kevin Skislock, principal with Laguna
Research Partners. ``I think it will. He's a great storyteller, and
it's going to be very compelling to find out what happened in the
period before `Star Wars.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, more than six months before its opening, ``Phantom
Menace'' fever is heating up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say that the release of the next film is likely
to be the biggest event the motion-picture industry has ever
seen,'' said John Taylor, an analyst with Arcadia Investment Corp.
``So the entire business _ retailers and licensees _ are biting
their nails waiting. It's just getting started.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said retailers believe that 75 percent of the action
figures they sell next year will be related to ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that it will be the dominant property,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro will be the primary beneficiary of that popularity. The
toy company has held the top ``Star Wars'' licenses for two decades
and recently consolidated that status by buying Galoob Toys, which
has held a license from Lucasfilm since 1992 for miniature vehicles
and action figures less than 2 inches tall.
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say others can't succeed despite the ``Star
Wars'' juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts point out that not every consumer will want to buy
``Star Wars'' memorabilia and that summer is the critical period
for launching new properties that can spin off into sequels, TV
shows, toys and videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, it's going to be a very big year for licensing,''
said Gene Scher, a partner at Los Angeles-based consultant November
Lazar Scher. `` `Phantom Menace' will pull everybody up. The
industry has needed a real big winner for a while, and as a result,
things are going to pick up for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Scher noted that when the first updated ``Batman'' became a
surprise blockbuster in theaters and retail stores in 1989, its
momentum carried along other licensing/merchandising programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there's something exciting out there, other things get
the heat and everyone benefits,'' he said. ``I would expect that
the heat for the new `Star Wars' is going to help `Star Trek,'
which continues to sell well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot sold to adults. When you see $2,000 `Star Trek'
collectibles, you know those aren't being sold to 5-year-olds.''
</P>
<P>
   New Line Cinema, well-regarded for its ability to market offbeat
films, is already selling merchandise for its ``Phantom Menace''
challenger, ``Austin Powers II: The Spy Who Shagged Me.''
</P>
<P>
   It has started selling goofy ``Austin Powers'' items, based on
Mike Myers' stuck-in-the-'60s spoof of British secret agents.
Halloween costumes of Austin Powers, sidekick Vanessa Kensington,
nemesis Dr. Evil and the Fembots hit stores several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ``Austin Powers'' sequel, with Heather Graham as
CIA agent Felicity Shagwell, won't hit theaters until June 11, New
Line will start a major push long before with scores of oddball
items. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   --The ``Shaguar'' toy car, based on Austin Powers' 1967 Jaguar
XKE.
</P>
<P>
   --A plush toy based on Dr. Evil's hairless cat, Mr. Bigglesworth
(``the world's first hairless plush toy,'' a New Line executive
notes).
</P>
<P>
   --Martini and shot glasses.
</P>
<P>
   --Refrigerator magnets and greeting cards with lines from the
1997 movie like ``Very shagadelic!'' and ``Oh, behave!''
</P>
<P>
   --An Austin Powers cardboard stand-up spouting lines like
``Yeah, baby, yeah!''
</P>
<P>
   --Silly Slammers, ball-size plastic replicas of the heads of
characters that also speak lines from the movie when thrown against
a surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to do things a little differently from `Star
Wars,' with a certain irreverence,'' said David Imhoff, New Line's
executive vice president of worldwide licensing and merchandising.
``We're aiming for a slightly older audience that's going to find
these things funny. But there will never be so much that people
feel they're being bombarded.''

Checkmate.
</P>
<P>
   That's what NBA owners might hope for as the league-imposed
lockout drags on toward Nov. 15, which is when the first paychecks
are due the players.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides _ the players' union and the owners _ await the
ruling from John Feerick, dean of the Fordham University Law
School, on whether NBA teams must pay the guaranteed contracts to
approximately 220 players during the lockout. Feerick's decision,
which is expected Monday, will be a huge bargaining chip for the
winners.
</P>
<P>
   Should the union prevail, the owners no doubt will consider
making the players work for their money. But should the owners win,
they could hold the union hostage until the reality of the
financial crunch sets in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he (Feerick) rules in favor of the owners,'' said
Washington forward Tracy Murray, ``it's going to kill the (morale
and position of the) players.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is probably what the owners hope for.
</P>
<P>
   Checkmate.
</P>
<P>
   Or, more to the point, paycheckmate.
</P>
<P>
   The owners gambled by canceling not only the preseason, but the
first two weeks of the regular season as well. The lost games
represent a ticket-revenue loss of well over $50 million to the
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tells me that they mean business and they're scared to
death of some of the contracts that have been signed in the last
couple of years,'' said Chicago's Steve Kerr, the Bulls' union
representative. ``So they're willing to play serious hard ball to
force us into a bad deal where down the line they will more than
make up for the $50 million they're blowing off.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating financial hardship, union executive director Billy
Hunter has been working on a mechanism to provide financial support
to players if they are forced to miss paychecks. According to a
union spokesman, they have a $10 million war chest and some $25
million due them from licensing payments and bank credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've set up lines of credit with two major banks to make
money available, especially for our free-agent players, in
November,'' Hunter said. ``We've also been promised financial
support from the other unions in pro baseball, football and hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been making the rounds since last season urging players
to save money because we knew there'd be a good chance the owners
would lock us out again. The response from the players has been
positive. They believe in what we're trying to do and they fully
support leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Johnson, the Rockets' player representative, is one of
many players who worked for the veteran's minimum last season and
does not have a guaranteed contract for this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to put food on the table, we've got to make money,''
Johnson said. ``If we don't win it (the ruling,) our backs are
against the wall. We're in the process of trying to establish a
line of credit to help guys. There are 100 some odd guys that
played at the minimum salary, and a lot of guys count on that
check.''

GALAXY CONTEMPLATES FIRE DAMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ As Major League Soccer's third season kicked off seven
months ago, Danny Villanueva, the Los Angeles Galaxy's president
and general manager, spoke about what would constitute success for
his club in the coming season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MLS championship is at the Rose Bowl, and we want to be
there,'' he said. ``Anything less than that would be failure.''
</P>
<P>
   When MLS Cup '98 kicks off next Sunday afternoon, the Galaxy's
only role will be as spectators, but in the wake of their
elimination from the championship race, he was forced to rethink
his position.
</P>
<P>
   After a campaign in which L.A. set MLS records for wins (24),
points (68) and goals (85), scored at least five times in eight
games, notched seven shutouts and allowed just one goal 13 times,
opened the season with nine successive victories and dominated
every opponent but two the Chicago Fire, who advanced to the title
game with Friday night's 2-1 shootout victory at Soldier Field, and
their likely foe, D.C. United Villanueva had to redefine success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing can wipe away the torrid, record-setting pace that we
gave this year,'' he said. ``I'm very proud of this team. They
essentially rewrote most of the records in this league. That's what
makes being eliminated so difficult to take. When you have perhaps
the best sustained effort in this league's short history, any way
of being eliminated shootout or otherwise is difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a phenomenal year for the Galaxy, who embodied Coach
Octavio Zambrano's dynamic attacking sensibilities, playing MLS's
most attractive soccer while also leading the league in defense:
</P>
<P>
   They overcame the loss of captain Dan Calichman, their spiritual
leader, to a broken leg in May, with second-year defender Steve
Jolley emerging as a force in his presence as L.A. ran away with
their second Western Conference regular-season title in three
years.
</P>
<P>
   They got an MVP-caliber season from Cobi Jones, who finished
second in the league scoring race with 51 points (18 goals, 13
assists) despite missing eight games while on World Cup duty, and
had two others among the top seven scorers No. 3 Welton, with 45
points (17, 11), and No. 7 Mauricio Cienfuegos, with 42 (13, 16).
Three others reached double digits in assists: Martin Machon (14),
Carlos Hermosillo (12) and Clint Mathis (10).
</P>
<P>
   They played superb defense, with veteran Robin Fraser anchoring
a unit that surrendered just 44 goals despite Jolley's inexperience
and a platoon system at work at both outside positions.
</P>
<P>
   And they saw the emergence of nearly a half-dozen future stars,
including Jolley, second-year goalkeeper Kevin Hartman
(league-leading 22 wins, second-best 1.38 goals-against average)
and rookies Mathis and Joe Franchino.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could never be a failure when the team accomplishes the
things we accomplished this season,'' Zambrano said after Friday's
loss. ``I'm proud of the guys, and I can't be proud of something
that's a failure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy overcame adversity Calichman's injury; the continued
troubles of Eduardo Hurtado, who in April was shipped off to New
York/New Jersey; the early impact of Hermosillo's addition in June
on the attack, in which Welton's production almost ceased but what
they provided was excellence. With Cienfuegos directing a fluid
attack that could strike from any place at any time, they destroyed
nearly every team in the league at least once, with only two-time
champion D.C. United and the defensive-minded Fire able to avoid
falling under their spell.
</P>
<P>
   None of that was any consolation following their loss Friday
night. They had endured disappointing finishes in their first two
seasons, watching a 2-0 lead disappear in the final minutes of an
overtime loss to D.C. in the '96 final, then getting swept by an
inferior Dallas Burn side in the first round of the '97 playoffs,
and weren't prepared for another early demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything short of winning the championship this year was going
to be a disappointment,'' said Fraser, the Galaxy's captain in
Calichman's absence. We've already been to a championship game,
we've been ahead in the final game, we've lost a good-sized lead in
the final game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may sound like we had lofty aspirations, but I think we did
well enough throughout the season that we had the right to have
these goals. Does it make this season a failure? Who's to judge?
Anything short of winning is unsatisfactory.''

LOS ANGELES: being bombarded.'
<TEXT>
<P>
   Curiously, the merchandising push _ now amounting to 35
licensees with 100 items _ comes more than a year after the
original movie left multiplexes. It grossed a respectable $54
million domestically with almost no merchandising behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole `Austin Powers' concept really caught fire when it
hit video earlier this year,'' Imhoff said. ``The home video sold
almost 2 million units. Mike Myers agreed to do the sequel, and now
we've got retailers coming to us saying, `We want this.' Our
merchandising program is an anomaly by starting almost a year
before the movie's out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Silver, editor of the Toy Book newsletter, said some
``Austin Powers'' merchandise may click with an older audience.
``It's not a home-run property, but it could do quite well for
secondary, niche licenses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects are still murky for the licensing property of other
competing summer releases, although action figures, vehicles and
accessories are expected to go along with ``The Wild Wild West,''
``Tarzan'' and Disney's ``Inspector Gadget.''
</P>
<P>
   ``West'' will carry the built-in marketing apparatus of the
200-outlet Warner Studio store chain, while the latter two will
have the impressive backing of the Disney Store operation, with
well over 700 locations by next summer.
</P>
<P>
   With ``The Wild Wild West,'' Warner has one of the world's most
marketable stars in Will Smith and a potentially strong movie
concept that blends the Old West with futuristic machines. Warner
executives have said ``West'' items will be aimed toward boys, with
an emphasis on the kind of gadgetry seen in the late-'60s TV
series.
</P>
<P>
   As for Disney, its well-oiled marketing machine will undoubtedly
make major pushes for the animated ``Tarzan'' and the live-action
``Inspector Gadget'' with partners McDonald's and Mattel. Disney
Chairman Michael Eisner has already said ``Tarzan'' has potential
similar to that of ``The Lion King,'' which generated an estimated
$1 billion in merchandise sales.
</P>
<P>
   Scher rates prospects for ``The Wild Wild West'' as ``good'' and
``Tarzan'' as ``exceptional,'' noting Disney's last animated film,
``Mulan,'' performed above expectations in theaters and stores this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for 1999 are welcome news for makers of toys, video
games, T-shirts, posters and key chains after seeing
less-than-blockbuster sales from last summer's two largest movie
merchandise campaigns, for ``Godzilla'' and ``Small Soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver noted that neither was a complete flop, given standard
royalty rates of 10 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Godzilla' wasn't that bad,'' he said. ``It sold $90 million
of wholesale merchandise, partly because Sony followed the movie
with a children's TV show. Their royalty is a nice piece of change;
it's just not what everyone was hoping for.''
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Small Soldiers,'' the perception that it was too
violent for children and Burger King's decision to scale back its
campaign as a result of the PG-13 rating hurt its merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Small Soldiers' had all the makings of a huge line,'' Silver
said. ``Before the movie was released, it was sizzling, but the
tons of press about the violence just killed it. If it had been
less violent, it would have been a huge hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, any property can click if it hits at the right time,
which is why the wheels of commerce cranking out toys and
collectibles never stop turning. The potential is huge: Spending on
and by children tripled during the 1990s; children under 6 have
become a potent force for properties like the Teletubbies, Barney
and Winnie the Pooh; and the average 10-year-old's weekly allowance
rose from $7.90 a week in 1991 to $13.93 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every four or five years, you have a whole new group of kids
come into the market,'' Scher noted. &QL;

PENN STATE CUTS OFF PURDUE AT THE PASS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RON DICKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. _ Penn State did not do anything fancy to
stop Purdue's Drew Brees and his band of receivers Saturday. Sticky
man-to-man coverage and a persistent rush were all the Nittany
Lions needed. With occasional bursts from its offense, Penn State
rolled over the Boilermakers, 31-13, before 97,034 at Beaver
Stadium. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brees was 39 of 57 attempts for 361 yards and 1 touchdown _ a
far cry from the 494- and 522-yard efforts of the previous two
weeks. He was intercepted once. Penn State is 5-1 over all and 2-1
in the Big Ten, and Purdue is 3-4, 1-2. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions (No. 12 Associated Press and No. 24 in the New
York Times computer ranking) played with five or six defensive
backs at times, but their mission was simple: Stop the run and
limit the damage Brees could inflict with his short slings while
punishing him on longer-developing plays. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The strategy worked as Purdue rushed for minus-12 yards, and
Brees did not have a completion over 19 yards. The punishment was
provided by defensive end Courtney Brown, who sacked Brees 3 times
for a loss of 28 yards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions' offense, while still the weak link, had its
moments. The freshman tailback Eric McCoo ran for 163 yards on 18
carries and caught a touchdown pass. Fullback Aaron Harris showed
improvement in his comeback from a torn anterior cruciate ligament,
plowing for two touchdowns. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Kevin Thompson completed 15 of 24 for 196 yards and
a touchdown. But he also missed receivers sprung from the
Boilermakers' confused secondary, and he threw two interceptions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCoo, of Red Bank, N.J., was the pleasant surprise. Cordell
Mitchell looked uninspired in the first quarter, so Penn State
Coach Joe Paterno inserted McCoo, who began paying immediate
dividends with 5- to 8-yard runs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCoo set up the game-icing touchdown with a 77-yard scamper
late in the third quarter. Purdue had crept within 21-13 on Brees'
12-yard touchdown pass to Gabe Cox. On the next possession, McCoo
escaped off-tackle, putting Penn State at the Purdue 15. Harris put
the contest away with a 9-yard reception, a 4-yard run and a 1-yard
plunge for the touchdown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Penn State stymied Brees from the start. With the Boilermakers
rotating receivers as if they were changing hockey lines, the
Nittany Lions would simply add or subtract a defensive back. Brad
Scioli sacked Brees on a third-and-long to stop the Boilermakers'
first drive, but Purdue got the ball right back when the Penn
State's Bruce Branch fumbled on the punt return after being rammed
in the stomach by Eric Haddad. Rocco Figgio recovered at the Penn
State 39, and the Boilermakers settled for a 32-yard field goal by
Travis Dorsch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions responded by marching 96 yards for a touchdown
_ with considerable help from Purdue. A face-mask penalty on third
down, a pass interference and an offside in another third-down
situation, pushed the Lions to the Purdue 1. Kevin Thompson surged
into the end zone behind center Eric Cole to help put Penn State
ahead by 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions earned the next score on their own. Mixing short
passes by Thompson and 7 rushes of 49 yards by McCoo, Penn State
covered 80 yards in 11 plays. McCoo capped his handiwork by
plucking a Thompson screen pass at his shins and racing 12 yards
for the touchdown. The Lions led by 14-3 with 8 minutes 35 seconds
left in the first half.

PANTHERS NEED MORE THAN MORAL VICTORIES

<P>
   Good choir boys don't necessarily make good football players.
</P>
<P>
   Good football players don't necessarily make good choir boys.
</P>
<P>
   So how come it took the Carolina Panthers so long to understand
that the fact that their Ericsson Stadium headquarters in
Charlotte, N.C., sits at the right hand of Billy Graham (Parkway),
doesn't mean they do?
</P>
<P>
   Says one prominent ex-NFL coach, backing my thesis that
Carolina's holier-than-thou approach to building a football
organization was destined for failure: ``You look at their
first-round picks over the years and you think, `Maybe they should
have concentrated more on just football.'''
</P>
<P>
   But to a public starved for athletes as role models, it all
sounded so good. From the game-day rules of the stadium (no
smoking, no celebratory removing of shirts, no nothing) to the
re-inventing-the-wheel approach to football purity, the Panthers
sincerely seemed to think they had all the answers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when the moral Panthers defeated the ``felons'' from
Dallas in a playoff game, the victory was offered as proof that God
was on Carolina's side.
</P>
<P>
   But since then have come disasters of almost Biblical
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Kerry Collins, a franchise lynch pin, is a
psychological disaster who parties too hard, has caused racial
division in the locker room and who lost the respect of his
teammates long before last week's infamous ``My heart's not in it''
announcement. The Panthers don't win home games. There have been
attitude problems. There have been drug and alcohol problems.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Carolina has experienced exactly the same sort of
behavioral difficulties that plague any company employing 50 or so
millionaires in their early 20s.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is still buzzing about Deion Sanders, and isn't it odd,
given the general public's disapproval of Deion's flamboyant ways,
that it took more than just his quietly unparalleled shutting down
a third of the field to get him noticed?
</P>
<P>
   People keep saying that what the Cowboys cornerback accomplished
Sept. 21 in New York was a once-in-a-lifetime thing. But actually,
it's merely the latest episode in a pro football career that will
hopefully be properly honored five years after it's over with a
hall of fame induction. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   Against the Giants, Deion became the first NFL player since 1954
(Jack Christiansen, Lions) to return a punt and an interception for
touchdowns in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders is the first player since the 1970 merger to
triple-threat his way to an interception, punt return and
50-yard-plus reception in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has eight interceptions returned for touchdowns, second
all-time, and has 19 career touchdowns, the most in history for a
non-offensive player.
</P>
<P>
   Conclusion: Voters would have to invent a reason to not make
this guy a first-ballot Hall-of-Famer right around 2006 or so.
</P>
<P>
   Give the management of the New Orleans Saints credit for being

   After a 3-0 start, coach Mike Ditka's Saints are a loss to
Atlanta today away from slipping to .500.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka has his eyes on NFC West foe San Francisco. ``Until we
beat the 49ers,'' he says, ``we can't say we're making progress.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Bill Kuharich has his eyes on the rest of the
NFL. ``We realize,'' he says, ``we're a lot like 20 or 22 teams,
not one of the elite.''
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans is at Atlanta today, and oddly, underscoring
Kuharich's view, it's the only game of the weekend featuring two
teams with winning records.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a rubber match for old Cowboys cronies Mike Ditka and
Dan Reeves, who are 6-6 in head-to-head matchups.

   ``I talk to both of them quite a bit,'' says their mentor, Tom
Landry. ``But I stay out of it this week.''
NUMBERS GAME
1.2 _ Vinny Testaverde is saying all the right things about doing
whatever quarterback job _ backup, starter, whatever _ Jets coach
Bill Parcells demands. But don't kid yourself: Vinny is happy he's
starting today against New England, if only because if he plays 45
percent of the Jets snaps, he receives a $1.2 million bonus.

   Quarterback Drew Bledsoe has the same agent (Leigh Steinberg),
same college (Washington State) and same physical attributes as
quarterback Ryan Leaf. And the Patriots star has some advice for
the Chargers' maybe-future star. ``If he's going to go through the
emotional swings that he seems to be going through now and for his
whole career,'' Bledsoe says, ``he's going to have a heart
attack.''

   There are two Los Angeles groups and one Houston group preparing
expansion presentations for NFL owners at a meeting scheduled for
Oct. 27 in Kansas City, Mo. With Cleveland entering the league next
year as the NFL's 31st team, a 32nd team would provide eventual
scheduling balance. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue says a franchise
could be awarded by March. Houston businessman Bob McNair is behind
the Texas bid; NBA star Shaquille O'Neal might be a part of the
Hollywood group, led by Mike Ovitz, that is battling for control of
a Southern California franchise.
AFC BUZZ
</P>
<P>
   Something for Oakland Raiders fans to feel good about: Maybe the
problems in Philadelphia suggest Oakland has a keeper in coach Jon
Gruden, who supervised these same Eagles on offense last year and
had them ranked fifth in the NFL. Something for Raiders fans to
feel bad about: Since when is Gruden old enough to drink or drive?
... Buffalo quarterback Doug Flutie, today making his first NFL
start in nine years, swears he's not kidding: When the NFL discards
him (again), he'll go back to the CFL (again). ... Brace
yourselves, Jets fans: Your next three games are Patriots, Falcons,
Chiefs, with a combined 12-4 record. ... Pittsburgh's running back
of record today is Richard Huntley, but I predict Jerome Bettis
(knee) will be tough to keep on the bench once the game starts. ...
Second-year back Antowain Smith (130 yards in last week's victory
against Indianapolis) is a bright spot in Buffalo. And in this era
of selfish jocks, it's notable who Smith thinks deserves some
credit. Says Smith: ``Most guys wouldn't have taken me under their
wing like Thurman did. I really respect him for what he's done for
me.'' Yes, Thurman Thomas has become a teacher. ``This is my 11th
year,'' Thomas says, ``and I was a starter for 10 years. It's been
very easy for me to help him. I recognize talent, and Antowain has
talent.'' ... A big day for San Diego's Natrone Means? The Eagles
have allowed three backs to gain 100 yards _ in first halves. ...
How to measure bad coaching: Cincinnati is 3-7 after bye weeks. How
to remember that sometimes numbers prove nothing: All three of
those victories came against the supposedly well-coached Steelers.
... The Jaguars have won 21 of their past 26 games and 17 of their
past 19 home games. ... Ravens running back Errict Rhett hasn't
been allowed in the lineup. Scouts say it has everything to do with
his inability to handle their blitz pickups. ... Ex-Bills coach
Marv Levy is getting the Vince Lombardi Symbol of Courage Award for
his public fight against prostate cancer. ... Not that Colts GM
Bill Polian doesn't have the magic touch, but his three teams over
the years _ Buffalo, Carolina and Indy _ are 3-13.
NFC BUZZ
</P>
<P>
   If I'm a player, I don't especially want Kerry Collins as my
quarterback right now. But if I'm a GM in New Orleans, rolling the
dice on a 26-year-old who, two years ago was touted as being a Troy
Aikman Junior? In a second. It's why Jeff George keeps getting
hired, why Rick Mirer just got a nice new contract in Green Bay.
These guys are too tough to find to throw them on the scrap heap at
26. ... Jerry Rice needs one catch today against Indianapolis to
tie Art Monk's NFL record of consecutive games with a reception at
183. ... The Buccaneers got their bye week at the right time for
quarterback Trent Dilfer, who has quietly been playing for a month
with a slightly separated shoulder. ... Folks in Green Bay are
whispering that runner Dorsey Levens might not make it back at all
this season. ... Scouts say Minnesota's linebacking has been so
good with Dwayne Rudd and Ed McDaniel starring that ex-Cowboys
player Dixon Edwards is only the third best of the bunch. ... I
guess nobody is belittling the Vikings for building an unbeaten
record against patsies anymore, eh? ... Giants tight end Alfred
Pupuna, a native of the island of Tonga, says his touchdown
celebration includes him pretending to rip the top off a coconut
and drinking its milk. ``A kava,'' corrects Pupuna. ... Until the
49ers signed him recently, punter Reggie Roby was running a gourmet
cookie business in Cherry Hills, N.J. ... Quarterback Brad Johnson
might return from injury next week, and the Vikings insist he'll
regain his job no matter how brilliant Randall Cunningham continues
to be. ... Bill Clinton's second most famous former intern? Saints
tackle Willie Roaf, who served as a seventh-grade page in the
Arkansas State Capitol under then-Governor Clinton. ``Yeah, what
President Clinton did was wrong,'' says Roaf. ``But it's been known
for years that he chased skirts.'' ... An 8-8 team winning a
division? It could happen in the NFC East this year, and it's
happened before. Twice. The 1978 Vikings and the 1985 Browns were
.500 champions. ... Speaking of which: ``People had written us
off,'' Lomas Brown says of a time when the Cardinals were 0-2 and
had been outscored 71-24. ``But in this league, things can change
in a hurry. It can still turn back in an ugly way, but right now,
we're riding a high horse.'' Arizona is 3-3. Still, in the NFC
East, it's more like kicking a dead horse. ... With three, Emmitt
Smith already has one more 100-yard rushing days this season than
he had in '97. ... Green Bay's Brett Favre threw 16 interceptions
all of last season. He's thrown nine in the past three games.

COWBOYS DISCOVER NEW LINE OF SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith's resurgence has made national headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Garrett's play in place of injured quarterback Troy Aikman
has been inspiring. And cornerback/wide receiver/punt returner
Deion Sanders has simply had a prime-time season.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Cowboys (4-2) prepare for today's matchup with the
Bears (1-5) at Chicago's Soldier Field, team owner Jerry Jones has
not been fooled by gaudy statistics, end-zone dances and glamour
positions.
</P>
<P>
   He said the difference this season has been the improved play of
the offensive line, which has given up only seven sacks and has
powered the offense to 367.7 yards per game, fourth in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, our offensive line is as responsible for our
record as anything else,'' Jones said. ``That's where we had the
most glaring problems heading into the season. Where we've ended up
singing the blues around here is when we haven't been able to move
the football. We are moving the football because of the offensive
line.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys haven't been singing the blues through six games in
1998 largely because of the work put in by Jones in the off-season.
After 1997's 6-10 debacle, Jones the offensive line the team's top
priority.
</P>
<P>
   Ravaged by injuries and inexperience, the line woes were
considered the root of the team's problems last year, when the
Cowboys surrendered a seven-year high 39 sacks and the offense
finished 20th in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The two certainties on the line were Pro Bowl right tackle Erik
Williams and Pro Bowl guard Larry Allen, who moved to left tackle.
Guard Everett McIver came from Miami via free agency to replace
Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Aging veteran guard Nate Newton (6-foot-3, 318-pounds) lost more
than 50 pounds and came into the season in the best shape of his
career. The Cowboys drafted behemoth Flozell Adams (6-7, 335), who
has since replaced the injured McIver.
</P>
<P>
   Add the experience gained by center Clay Shiver, now in his
second-year as a full-time starter, and the result is a deeper,
younger and more talented group.
</P>
<P>
   Bears coach Dave Wannstedt sees the difference. He expects the
Cowboys to pound at his defense with Smith, the NFC's leading
rusher with 529 yards. The Bears rank 25th in the league against
the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their offensive line is playing about as well as it's played
the past three years,'' Wannstedt said. ``Emmitt looks like he has
a lot more confidence \Rthat\S his guys are going to block
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Shiver and Newton also credit the improved play to Cowboys coach
Chan Gailey's new offense. Shiver (6-3, 294) struggled in the power
blocking schemes the Cowboys used last year. He said Gailey's
offense is based on zone blocking, which is more suitable to his
athletic skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``My confidence and comfort level is better and I'm able to get
out and run more to use my athletic ability,'' said Shiver.
</P>
<P>
   Newton said Gailey's unpredictable and creative schemes also
help with pass protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense helps us by having different drops for the
quarterback and moving him around to different positions,'' Newton
said. ``We never have the quarterback sitting in one spot so the
defense can't key in on us. It gives us the advantage of doing
different things to the defensive linemen.''
</P>
<P>
   Newton, a 13-year veteran, tried to downplay the performance of
the offensive line, which is starting to draw some comparisons to
the dominant Cowboys lines of a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't done anything yet,'' Newton said. ``We got to win
four or five or six games in a row. That's when you can gauge an
offensive line.''

KINGS' LUCK MAKES ROBINSON GROWL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Kings defeated Boston in their home
opener on a Luc Robitaille overtime goal Friday night, but after
the game coach Larry Robinson did not look appropriately happy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he'd almost have preferred a well-played loss to the
somewhat lucky victory the Kings had gotten, a win they'd gotten
despite being outplayed for most of the final 30 minutes of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   So on Saturday morning, Robinson briefly addressed the issue
with his team, telling his players that some of them needed to work
harder.
</P>
<P>
   And while he didn't name names, he did say that he was pleased
for the most part with his defensemen, and couldn't complain much
about the line of Robitaille, Yanic Perreault and Josh Green, which
has produced all six goals for the Kings (2-1) in the first three
games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   That would seem to leave the trio of Jozef Stumpel, Glen Murray
and Vladimir Tsyplakov as chief culprits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to center guys out,'' said Robinson, whose team
plays host to the Colorado Avalanche (0-4) at 5 this afternoon.
``People that aren't working hard and aren't playing well should
know without being told. So you address it in generality. You know
what they say: If the shoe fits, wear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Stumpel, Murray and Tsyplakov produced 68 goals and
191 points and finished 1-2-3 on the team in scoring. But through
three games this year, they have yet to score a goal, and only
Tsyplakov has so much as an assist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no excuses for why we're not scoring,'' Murray said.
``Well, there is one: We're not working hard enough, plain and
simple.... We might be pressing a little bit and thinking too much
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson responded, ``Pressing? I wish they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said he'd like to see a greater defensive commitment,
which would be followed by more chances offensively. He'd like to
see more of his forwards getting scoring chances around the net. He
said only three players _ Green, Robitaille and Sandy Moger _ had
chances from the key scoring areas in Friday's victory.
</P>
<P>
   And he said the Stumpel line has gotten into the bad habit of
staying on the ice too long during many of its shifts, sometimes
for twice as long as they should.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few times they got caught a minute and a half, a minute 20
seconds,'' Robinson said. ``They just kill themselves. You can't
stay on the ice. I don't care who you are. To stay out that long,
your legs just build up with lactic acid and the next thing you
know you can't move, and you just ruin yourself for your next
shift.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray said: ``We've got to cut our shifts down. Maybe we've
been staying out there a little too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: Robinson said he may make slight alterations to his
forward lines. One possibility would be to have Green play with
Stumpel and Murray, and to have Tsyplakov play with Robitaille and
Perreault. ``I'm not afraid to move my lines around,'' Robinson
said. ``But then I could start with them and 10 minutes into the
game move them back.''... After tonight's game, the Kings hit the
road for a five-game Eastern swing beginning Wednesday at Florida.
Robinson said he was uncertain whether the two Kings who have yet
to appear this season _ defenseman Garry Galley and forward Roman
Vopat _ would play tonight, but he said if they don't, they will
play on the trip.

things that add up each day: burning dinners, hunting for parking
spaces, running late, dealing with rude neighbors. And lot of the
strain comes from the very same people who enrich our lives _
friends, relatives, children, co-workers and spouses. Called the

COLORADO HAND TECH FIRST LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ Texas Tech's perfect start to the 1998 football
season ended with an imperfect thud yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The 22nd-ranked Red Raiders buried themselves in a flurry of
first-quarter turnovers and ill-timed penalties. No. 19 Colorado
never let them resurface, striking for just enough big plays to
carve out a 19-17 victory at Folsom Field.
</P>
<P>
   Tech (6-1, 3-1) lost despite a 443-290 edge in total offense,
ending the school's fastest start in 22 years and dropping the Red
Raiders out of first place in the Big 12 South Division. Colorado
(6-1, 3-1) remains one half-game behind pacesetters Kansas State
(6-0, 3-0) and Missouri (5-1, 3-0) in the North Division.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffaloes did little offensively. Colorado failed to cross
the line of scrimmage on 37 of 69 offensive plays. During the
course of building a 13-10 halftime lead, 28 of the Buffaloes'
first 31 snaps netted a combined 20 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The other three plays proved huge, however. A 59-yard pass from
quarterback Mike Moschetti to Marcus Stiggers followed a Tech
fumble and led to a field goal. A 22-yard scramble by Moschetti
provided the impetus for a 36-yard touchdown march, set up by a
Tech interception. A 21-yard scamper by Damion Barton allowed
Colorado to turn a botched quick kick from the Tech end zone into a
19-yard field goal by Jeremy Aldrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did all the things you're not supposed to do if you're
going to beat a good football team,'' said Tech coach Spike Dykes,
whose team lost the turnover battle, 3-1, and gave Colorado three
pivotal first downs with personal-foul or pass-interference
penalties. ``This game was supposed to determine if we were
contenders or pretenders. I guess we're pretenders. We've had our
one-night stand in the Top 25.''
</P>
<P>
   That will be determined today by poll voters. But the Red
Raiders did not enhance their chances to extend their stay in the
national rankings by squandering a solid defensive performance.
</P>
<P>
   The offense rolled for 273 yards in the first half but managed
just 10 points because of three first-quarter turnovers in Colorado
territory. Matt Tittle threw an interception into triple coverage
at the Buffaloes' 1-yard line. Jonathan Hawkins lost a fumble at
the Colorado 24. Rob Peters' pass was tipped twice and intercepted
at the Colorado 44 and returned 20 yards to set up the Buffs' first
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one we let slip through our fingers,'' Peters said.
``We had our chances but didn't do what we needed to do to win. It
makes you sick.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado defense stiffened after halftime, forcing Tech to
punt on four consecutive possessions before the Red Raiders moved
80 yards in the final two minutes for Peters' 1-yard touchdown
sneak with 26 seconds remaining. Darrin Chiaverini's onside-kick
recovery sealed the victory for the Buffaloes, who gave themselves
a 19-10 cushion by moving 91 yards to set up Aldrich's fourth field
goal with 2:50 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   During the drive, Colorado converted two third-and-10 situations
and consumed 8:37 of the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think anyone could do that to our defense,'' Dykes
said. ``That drive really took the wind out of our sails.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge will be bouncing back for Saturday's meeting in
College Station against No. 10 Texas A&AMP;M, a contest that could
decide the South Division title.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hurts, but we're not going to roll over and die,'' said
defensive end Montae Reagor, who had nine tackles and two sacks.
``The only way we were going to win the South was to beat A&AMP;M, so
that hasn't changed.''
</P>
<P>
   But the perfect record has disappeared. Tech will learn later
today if its Top 25 ranking will disappear along with it. Extra
points Tech receiver Donnie Hart (seven catches, 97 yards) failed
to catch a touchdown pass for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Dykes, on his decision to try a quick kick that Peters booted
only 27 yards, leading to a Colorado field goal: ``It sounded good
at the time, but we obviously hadn't worked on it enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech had five plays of 20 yards or more, a season high against
the Colorado defense.

JONATHAN POSTEL IS DEAD AT 55; HELPED START AND RUN INTERNET  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jonathan B. Postel, who played a pivotal role in creating and
administering the Internet, died of complications after undergoing
heart surgery on Friday in St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, his
brother Thomas Postel said Saturday. He was 55 and lived in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Postel, a computer scientist at the Information Sciences
Institute, a branch of the University of Southern California in
Marina del Rey, Calif., was a creator of the Internet's address
system. For 30 years, he handled the administrative end of Internet
addresses under the auspices of the Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority, or IANA, a federally financed entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon's greatest achievement was operating IANA,'' said Stephen
Crocker, a colleague of Postel's. ``It is a very central piece of
the infrastructure. As mundane and as simple as it seemed, he set
policies that made it very easy for the network to grow. He
minimized bureaucratic delay and at the same time kept silly and
nonsensical things to a minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   Postel began his work on computer networking in the late 1960s,
while a graduate student at the University of California at Los
Angeles. He was one of a small group of computer scientists who
created the Arpanet, the precursor to the Internet. At UCLA in
1969, Postel assisted in the installation of the Arpanet's first
communications switch, which routes network traffic.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 30 years, Postel also served as editor of the Request
for Comments series, or RFCs, technical notes that began with the
earliest days of the Arpanet and continued into the Internet.
Though intended to be informal, RFCs often laid the foundation for
technical standards governing the Internet's operation. Nearly
2,500 RFCs have been produced.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the effort to hand administration of the Internet
over to an international private corporation, this month Postel
delivered to the government a proposal to transform the IANA into a
nonprofit corporation, with broad representation from the
commercial and academic sectors.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed organization has been incorporated and has an
interim board of directors. Pending final approval from the
Department of Commerce, the new entity is prepared to take up its
responsibility, said Vinton Cerf, chairman of the Internet Society,
a professional membership society to which Postel also belonged.
</P>
<P>
   Postel was known for his steadiness, as well as for the
influence he wielded with colleagues at meetings of professional
organizations. During heated technical debates, once Postel weighed
in, the matter was soon resolved.
</P>
<P>
   As testament to Postel's control over the highest levels of the
Internet, in conducting a test of the Internet's reliability this
year, he rerouted the Internet's directory service to alternate
locations. Although there was no disruption of the Internet's
operation, the incident attracted widespread attention. Postel said
he was conducting an experiment to demonstrate the network's backup
capability.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the action, Crocker said, ``I think he was exercising
his legitimate responsibility to make sure the network worked as
advertised.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, Postel graduated from UCLA, where he also obtained a
master's degree in engineering in 1968 and a doctorate in computer
science in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Internet Society, where he served as a
trustee, Postel was a member of the Association for Computing
Machinery.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his brother Thomas, of Sherman Oaks, Calif.,
Postel is survived by his his companion, Susan Gould, also of Los
Angeles; mother, Lois Postel, of Sherman Oaks; another brother,
Russell Postel, of Sebastopol, Calif.; and a sister, Margie
Bradshaw, of Paisley, Scotland.

Padres owner Moores puts winning, `family' ahead of finances
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ John Moores, Houstonian and owner of the San Diego
Padres, arrived a few hours early at Yankee Stadium for Saturday's
opener of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   John Moores, baseball fan, tagged along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually I'm a fan-owner, rather than the other way around,''
Moores politely corrected.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the former Bellaire and University Houston alumnus,
software-magnate/philanthropist turned West Coast baseball owner
has plenty to cheer about with his Padres making just the second
trip to the World Series in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   And Moores is soaking up every moment.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon as the Padres went through workouts, Moores
and club president-CEO Larry Lucchino walked around the
center-field area at Yankee Stadium, admiring the monuments
honoring some of New York's baseball legends.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, he arrived for only his second in-person World
Series game _ wearing a brown leather jacket, Padres polo shirt and
baseball cap _ taking time to mingle with players, fans and
reporters on the field during pre-game workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been kind of paralyzed,'' Moores said. ``I really haven't
left the hotel because I almost can't think about anything else. We
came out here for batting practice (Friday) and went out to the
legends area. I got out there and was a little choked up. That's
like going through a sacred ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife (Becky) and I have just gotten absolutely consumed by
all this. Buying the Padres was the smartest and luckiest thing
I've ever done in my life. I'd do it again in a heart beat.''
</P>
<P>
   In an era when the business side of sports is so visible, Moores
is a throwback, a man revered by his players and front-office
staff.
</P>
<P>
   To get an idea of what the people around him mean, Moores
chartered a jet and brought about 150 employees to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Making it to Atlanta for the National League Championship Series
was a big deal, Moores thought. But the Big Apple? For the World
Series? Against the storied New York Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   Moores, who saved the Padres from ruin when he purchased the
club in December 1994, still hasn't fully grasped the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had this feeling in my life,'' Moores said after
the Padres wrapped up the NLCS in Atlanta. ``For me to be a part of
this is mind-boggling. I never thought something this grand could
happen. It's too good a story to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody had told the story before the season, everybody
would have died laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Padres finished last in the NL West. They were
10 games below .500.
</P>
<P>
   This year, San Diego claimed a second division title in three
years, won a club-record 98 games and then played the role of giant
killer with playoff-series victories over the 102-win Astros and
106-win Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's laughing anymore.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Padres' rise to the top of the NL even more
special for Moores is how they have accomplished it. While the
Yankees have the second-largest payroll in baseball, San Diego is
13th and plays in one of the smaller markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He represents the big market,'' Moores said, referring to
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the guys that have to recycle the aluminum cans to make
ends meet. We're like country cousins. We're a little nervous being
in the big city. I've never seen so many cars before. This is a
fairy tale for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason it's almost too good to be true is because it's the
best baseball year of my life, of anybody's life, as far as I can
tell. There's been a renaissance of interest in baseball. This
season certainly illustrates that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story has a fairy-tale quality about it because we're such
a small market. We are the mother of all small markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Moores, whose heart first belonged to the Astros when he grew up
with Nolan Ryan and Terry Puhl as his favorite players, fulfilled a
lifelong dream in 1994 when he bought the struggling Padres, who
had alienated fans with unpopular, salary-slashing trades.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately upon his arrival, he OK'd a 12-player trade
with the Astros that brought third baseman Ken Caminiti and
outfielder Steve Finely to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Moores also was instrumental in the trade with the Florida
Marlins that landed ace righthander Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have the best owner in baseball,'' manager Bruce
Bochy said. ``When he acquired our ballclub, he allowed us to
acquire the type of players that would not just make us competitive
but contenders, and I think all the credit goes to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty lucky to have an owner like John Moores.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres finished 70-74 _ third in the NL West _ in 1995, his
first year of ownership, but it was then that Moores was hooked. He
liked what he saw and the Padres lived up to expectations the
following year with their first division championship since they
advanced to the World Series in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   There is renewed interest in baseball in San Diego after the
Padres drew 2.5 million fans this season. And the future is bright,
if voters OK a pending ballot initiative that would mean a new
facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought about getting to the World Series,'' said
Moores, who until last year had never attended a World Series game.
``Only after the first year did it dawn on me that we potentially
had the talent to get there. We had a pretty good season in 1996
and the (St. Louis) Cardinals beat us in three straight games in
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew from the start this year we had a chance to do
something special. Baseball is such a funny game and such a long
season. You don't know what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   For business purposes, the Padres' success would make an owner's
eyes _ and wallet _ light up. For John Moores, baseball fan, seeing
his family win seems almost more important.
</P>
<P>
   That's what separates him from other owners in baseball, and
maybe all of sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always joke around saying we are a family,'' the Padres'
Jim Leyritz said. ``John Moores takes that to heart. That is one of
the biggest things I have seen since I have been here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really takes his ballclub _ granted I own you guys, this is
my team _ but at the same time he makes everything perfect for your
family. He really cares about every individual.''

Texas' Muoneke vows to exceed all expectations
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
AUSTIN _ Starting over.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday night, just after midnight, never-been dribbled,
yet-to-be-shot basketballs were rolled out onto the court at the
Frank Erwin Center.
</P>
<P>
   Every year there is a first day of practice, providing the
basketball season its official beginning. For the University of
Texas men's basketball program, that first organized workout
signified more than the beginning of a season, it was the beginning
of an era.
</P>
<P>
   The Rick Barnes era.
</P>
<P>
   But for junior Nnadubem ``Gabe'' Muoneke, the first dribble and
jump shot at the season's initial practice meant more; more than
the official start to the season or the program's ushering in of a
new era under a new coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Midnight Mania practice for Muoneke is the day his college
career started over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about playing,'' Muoneke said. ``In the previous
two years, I was hopeful, but I didn't have high expectations. Now
I've made it 100 percent clear to myself that what happens to me is
up to what God has planned for me and what I do with it. I'm
thankful for the opportunity to play this year. That's all I need
is an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me that people don't imagine me doing well.
I guess it'll be a big surprise when I do. It's the same with the
team' we're not expected to do well, so we'll have to surprise
people as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke has had his moments in two college seasons, but he has
had a nondescript career. He was in the starting lineup for most of
his freshman year, shooting 53.6 percent from the floor and
averaging nearly six points in 15 minutes of playing time per game.
</P>
<P>
   Last season he was expected to shine, but though he started 30
of 31 games, he was unhappy. His scoring average rose to 10.4
points per game, but his shooting accuracy dropped to 43.1 percent
and he never found his normally solid stroke from 3-point range
(26.2 percent).
</P>
<P>
   For Muoneke, recognized as one of the state's top recruits when
he left Cypress Falls after leading the Greater Houston area in
scoring and rebounding his senior year, the subpar play was
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the Texas High School Coaches Association All-Star
Game Most Valuable Player views the arrival of Barnes to replace
Tom Penders as his chance to start over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come to Texas to be a mediocre player, I didn't come
here with a mediocre status,'' Muoneke said. ``Coach Barnes is
expecting me to do well. He basically said, if I don't do well,
it's my fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him it was important for me to give glory to God and he
told me, `To give glory to God, you have to take what you're
blessed with and work harder with it, not be satisfied that you
have it.' He didn't give me an option, I have to work hard every
day and play hard every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Few question Muoneke's talent or his desire. At 6-7 and a solid
250 pounds, he is a difficult defensive assignment _ too big for
smaller players to handle and too quick for bigger players to keep
up with.
</P>
<P>
   And to call him competitive would be an understatement. An
emotional fire burns within Muoneke whether he is playing before a
packed house at the Drum or a pickup game.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want to do is win,'' Muoneke said. ``People may be used
to 18-20 wins a season, but I don't like that. I don't think fans
at Texas should be satisfied with 18 wins and the Sweet 16. Why?
Why can't we beat everybody else?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you accept mediocrity and you think I'm crazy because I
don't, then fine, I'm crazy. But I have no desire to go out there
and play 30 games, win 18 and be happy. I don't like losing. If
losing doesn't bother you, why do you play?''
</P>
<P>
   The new atmosphere might have increased Muoneke's enthusiasm for
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got me excited because he's so excited about getting
going,'' Barnes said. ``Gabe's got great potential. He's proven to
me that he wants to be a worker and he wants to learn everything he
can about the game. I think he really wants to be a student of the
game. I think he's really committed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing I want to see Gabe do is be consistent. I
want him to know he's bringing it every day and every night.
Certainly we're going to need him to be a real presence for us on
the boards. I want to see him be a complete player.''
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke points to a productive basketball summer, something he
didn't have last year when he spent much of the time visiting
relatives in Nigeria, as helping him improve his play, especially
his midrange game.
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke says he and the Longhorns will be ready when the season
tips off, thanks to the effort of strength and conditioning coach
Todd Wright, another new staff member.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in better basketball shape than we were in the past,''
Muoneke said. ``Last year we could go for a long time, but not hard
for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Conditioning will be important for the Longhorns, who have only
eight scholarship athletes and return just four players _ Muoneke,
Kris Clack, Chris Mihm and DeJuan Vasquez _ who saw significant
playing time last season.
</P>
<P>
   And that 14-17 season was filled with turmoil and ended with
several player transfers and a coach's departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that is the past,'' Muoneke said, ``Right now everything
starts over.''

NBA players try to make ends meet
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Checkmate.
</P>
<P>
   That's what NBA owners might hope for as the league-imposed
lockout drags on toward Nov. 15, which is when the first paychecks
are due the players.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides _ the players' union and the owners _ await the
ruling from John Feerick, dean of the Fordham University Law
School, on whether NBA teams must pay the guaranteed contracts to
approximately 220 players during the lockout. Feerick's decision,
which is expected Monday, will be a huge bargaining chip for the
winners.
</P>
<P>
   Should the union prevail, the owners no doubt will consider
making the players work for their money. But should the owners win,
they could hold the union hostage until the reality of the
financial crunch sets in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he (Feerick) rules in favor of the owners,'' said
Washington forward Tracy Murray, ``it's going to kill the (morale
and position of the) players.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is probably what the owners hope for.
</P>
<P>
   Checkmate.
</P>
<P>
   Or, more to the point, paycheckmate.
</P>
<P>
   The owners gambled by canceling not only the preseason, but the
first two weeks of the regular season as well. The lost games
represent a ticket-revenue loss of well over $50 million to the
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tells me that they mean business and they're scared to
death of some of the contracts that have been signed in the last
couple of years,'' said Chicago's Steve Kerr, the Bulls' union
representative. ``So they're willing to play serious hard ball to
force us into a bad deal where down the line they will more than
make up for the $50 million they're blowing off.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating financial hardship, union executive director Billy
Hunter has been working on a mechanism to provide financial support
to players if they are forced to miss paychecks. According to a
union spokesman, they have a $10 million war chest and some $25
million due them from licensing payments and bank credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've set up lines of credit with two major banks to make
money available, especially for our free-agent players, in
November,'' Hunter said. ``We've also been promised financial
support from the other unions in pro baseball, football and hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been making the rounds since last season urging players
to save money because we knew there'd be a good chance the owners
would lock us out again. The response from the players has been
positive. They believe in what we're trying to do and they fully
support leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Johnson, the Rockets' player representative, is one of
many players who worked for the veteran's minimum last season and
does not have a guaranteed contract for this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to put food on the table, we've got to make money,''
Johnson said. ``If we don't win it (the ruling,) our backs are
against the wall. We're in the process of trying to establish a
line of credit to help guys. There are 100 some odd guys that
played at the minimum salary, and a lot of guys count on that
check.''

 &HT;    Money matters for Pittsburgh Penguins
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz

<TEXT>

   East Conference
</P>
<P>
   Money Matter$
</P>
<P>
   Things have started to settle down a bit for the Pittsburgh
Penguins, who now have declared bankruptcy as often (twice) as
they've won the Stanley Cup. The team is close to finalizing
agreements with former star Mario Lemieux (who is overdue $28.6
million in deferred salary) and Fox Sports Pittsburgh (which is
renegotiating broadcast rights). Majority owner Roger Marino also
lent the team $2.5 million (at eight percent interest) so the Pens
could make Thursday's $200,000 payroll, and in the words of Jaromir
Jagr, ``I'm happy about that.'' But the Penguins, who have lost
$37.5 million in the last two years, are hardly woe-free. The
latest legal entanglements: (1) Mayor Tom Murphy has opened an
investigation into whether the Penguins owe Allegheny County
$900,000 in ``amusement taxes,'' causing the team to issue a
statement, ``Heavy-handed tactics such as these aren't going to
keep the Penguins viable in Pittsburgh''; (2) and on that veiled
threat to move the team, the county has filed a lawsuit saying
Marino has shopped the team in recent months to four cities _
Houston, Las Vegas, Kansas City and Oklahoma City. The Penguins
also have made no headway in their attempt to reduce their rent by
$4 million a year at the Civic Arena. In related news, the team won
its first two games.

   Speaking of public-relations woes, it can't please league
officials in New York that the area's three teams all are having
problems. The Rangers, Islanders and New Jersey Devils were a
combined 1-7 one week into the season. The Rangers, outscored 13-3
in their first three losses, have seen general manager Neil Smith
make all the wrong moves. Madison Square Garden the other day
chanted, ``Let's Go Yankees.'' Things are worse on Long Island,
where star forward Ziggy Palffy remains unsigned and in his native
Slovakia and the Isles drew only 11,457 for their home opener. The
fans who showed up chanted, ``Bring back Spano,'' a reference to
John Spano, who attempted to buy the team but later was convicted
of fraud charges. The Islanders won the Stanley Cup four times in
the 1980s but have failed to make the playoffs the last four years.
``I spent 20 years there when it was as good as it gets,'' said
former GM Bill Torrey. ``I hate to see this happen.'' The Devils
don't have the off-ice problems. They're just struggling with
first-year coach Robbie Ftorek, who is trying to open up a team
that has been accustomed to a defense style under Jacques Lemaire.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly ...
</P>
<P>
   Boston goalie Byron Dafoe gave up only three goals on 94 shots
in the first three games of the season, with two shutouts. He faced
34 shots in a 3-0 win over Colorado. ... The Bruins are upset with
schedule makers for subjecting them to a seven-game road trip after
two home games to open the season. ... Buffalo forward Miroslav
Satan did not have a normal signing when he came to terms on the
eve of the season opener at Dallas. He was pulled off the plane by
coach Lindy Ruff on the tarmac because he had forgotten to sign his
contract. The deal was closed in an airport office. ``First time
I've done that,'' said GM Darcy Regier. ... Carolina coach Paul
Maurice benched starting goalie Trevor Kidd (six goals in 15 shots)
and replaced him with Arturs Irbe, which helped the Hurricanes gain
a 2-2 tie with Dallas Thursday. Too bad nobody noticed. Carolina
drew only 5,351 in Greensboro after selling only 8,195 tickets for
the home opener.

 &HT;    Is all he can do enough?
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Several years ago, a successful insurance salesman
from Waycross wrote a motivational book entitled, ``All You Can Do
Is All You Can Do but All You Can Do Is Enough.'' The superfluous
cover didn't dissuade the buying public. Even Norman Vincent Peale
gushed: ``This book really motivated me!''
</P>
<P>
   Now the question: Can Art Williams inspire left wingers and
goalies as well as he did Peale and term-life clients? The
Georgia-bred multimillionaire, who only five months ago purchased
the Tampa Bay Lightning, caused the first tremor of the young
season when he fired the Esposito brothers _ GM Phil and assistant
GM Tony _ only two games into the season.
</P>
<P>
   Williams admits, ``The timing was horrible.'' Against his better
judgment, he had given Phil Esposito a year to fix one of the
league's saddest franchises. Two months into his ownership, he knew
it was a mistake. Esposito, who founded the franchise and paved the
way for the NHL's mass expansion in the Sun Belt, feuded with coach
Jacques Demers over personnel decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about it for three months,'' Williams said. ``A lot
of times you make a decision, then you talk yourself out of it.
Finally, I just woke up one morning and said, 'That's it.' When you
see something not working, you've got to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of things to do. The Lightning has been
every bit the nightmare for the NHL as the Clippers have been for
the NBA. On the ice, the franchise had one playoff appearance in
six years and finished a league-worst 17-55-10 last season. Off the
ice, absentee ownership in Japan ran the team into the ground with
budget constraints. The team lost more than $10 million last season
and alienated fans.
</P>
<P>
   Average attendance has dropped every year since 1994, when it
peaked at 20,986. Last year, the Lightning drew 13,886; this year's
home opener, 11,753. That's 3,000 less than last season's opener
drew, but Williams said, ``They gave away 5,000 tickets. I won't be
dishonest.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams estimates the Lightning will lose $10 million to $15
million this season, but his checkbook will survive. He started the
A.L. Williams Company in Norcross in 1977, and 12 years later had
sold $300 billion in life insurance. He sold the company to
Primerica in 1989 in a deal that reportedly earns him up to $35
million annually for 20 years. He is wealthy enough to have donated
over $70 million to Jerry Falwell's Liberty University.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is more adept at football, having played quarterback at
Cairo High School, attended Mississippi State on a scholarship and
coached at Kendrick, Appling County and Thomasville. He attempted
to buy the Tampa Bay Buccaneers a few years ago but was outbid. He
admits to being a novice at hockey, having seen one Atlanta Flames
game and a Lightning game just before the purchase, but it isn't
difficult to analyze the home team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a total disaster here,'' Williams said. ``It was a
last-place hockey team and a bankrupt organization. We've got a
giant sales job here. But it's exactly what I was looking for. I
wouldn't have bought the team unless I had something to do. I
wanted something to turn around.''
</P>
<P>
   He already has expanded the coaching and scouting staffs and
plans to be aggressive in free agency. He said, ``I plan to be here
for the long haul. I told the commissioner (Gary Bettman) I'll be
here for 20 years.''

 &HT;    League rule changes fail to increase scores
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So much for a scoring boom.
</P>
<P>
   The rule changes that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman hoped would
increase goal production in the league haven't had the desired
effect. In fact, scoring is down.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it's early, and players still are getting accustomed to
the larger areas behind the net and smaller goal crease. But
through the first six days of competition, only 134 goals were
scored in 30 games, an average of 4.47 per game. That's down from
last year's average 5.8, which was the league's lowest in 32
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, 30 games had yielded eight shutouts. Of the four
games Wednesday, two were shutouts, including the second of the
year by Boston's Byron Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   Moving out the goal lines two feet from the end boards was
intended to create more skating and passing room behind the net,
where Wayne Gretzky reinvented the game. But even Gretzky said, ``I
just don't think two feet changes the spectrum of the game a whole
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Thrashers update
</P>
<P>
   So you want the luxurious life of an NHL general manager? This
was Don Waddell's itinerary last week for his first major scouting
trip as the Thrashers' architect.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday: Travel to Windsor, Ontario, for a junior-league game.
</P>
<P>
   Friday: Detroit, for Red Wings' title banner unveiling and game
against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday: Plymouth, Mich., for another juniors game.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday (afternoon): Calgary at Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday (night): Back to Plymouth, Mich., for a juniors game.
</P>
<P>
   Total: five games in four days.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell will catch a few more NHL games over the next two weeks,
then leave for Austria on Nov. 2 for a juniors World Championship
qualification tournament, during which he will see nine games in
three days.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing will beat that trip to the juniors World Championship.
It runs Dec. 26 to Jan. 4. The site: Winnipeg.
</P>
<P>
   The understatement from Thrashers assistant GM Les Jackson:
``It'll be cold.''
</P>
<P>
   STORM CLOUDS
</P>
<P>
   There was early panic in Raleigh when the Carolina Hurricanes
blew a 4-1 lead in the opener, were tied by Tampa Bay 4-4, then
lost to expansion Nashville 3-2. Dating back to the franchise's
original home in Hartford, the team has gone six straight seasons
without making the playoffs _ not an easy feat in the
playoff-friendly NHL. Six years is the longest active playoff
drought and ranks fifth on the all-time list. Following are the 10
longest:
</P>
<P>
   Team _ Start _ End _ Seasons
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey _ 1979-80 _ 1987-88 _ 9
</P>
<P>
   Washington _ 1975-76 _ 1982-83 _ 8
</P>
<P>
   Boston _ 1960-61 _ 1967-68 _ 8
</P>
<P>
   Detroit _ 1971-72 _ 1977-78 _ 7
</P>
<P>
   Carolina _ 1993-94 _ (Active) _ 6
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh _ 1983-84 _ 1988-89 _ 6
</P>
<P>
   Chicago _ 1947-48 _ 1952-53 _ 6
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia _ 1990-91 _ 1994-95 _ 5
</P>
<P>
   Colorado _ 1988-89 _ 1992-93 _ 5
</P>
<P>
   N.Y. Rangers _ 1951-52 _ 1955-56 _ 5
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey was the Colorado Rockies until 1982-83
</P>
<P>
   Carolina was the Hartford Whalers until 1997-98
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's non-playoff years came as the Quebec Nordiques.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS UP
</P>
<P>
   New NHL director of operations (read: sheriff) Colin Campbell
promised to crack down on intentional hits to the head this year,
and so far he's keeping his word. Colorado winger Keith Jones was
suspended two games and fined $1,000 for checking Buffalo's Curtis
Brown in the head Monday. Jones drew a roughing penalty in the
game, though Brown was not injured.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Penguins owners Roger Marino and Howard Baldwin are not
inaccurate in their assessment that the 37-year-old Civic Arena
(a.k.a., The Igloo) makes it difficult to generate revenue. But
they were the ones who accepted a deal for $12.9 million in
renovations in exchange for extending their lease to 2007. So who
has sympathy now that they're screaming for a new arena?
</P>
<P>
   HOCKEY ABCs
</P>
<P>
   Many feel one of the top forward lines in the league this year
will be Dallas' trio of Mike Modano, Brett Hull and Jere Lehtinen.
A line consists of a center, a right winger and a left winger. Each
team generally dresses four lines, with one (usually the fourth)
generally known as ``the checking line'' because of its defensive
skills. Top scoring lines in history often have had nicknames, like
the French Connection (Buffalo's Gilbert Perreault, Richard Martin,
Rene Robert), the MPH Line (Chicago's Pit Martin, Jim Pappin, Bobby
Hull) and Production Line (Gordie Howe, Ted Lindsey, Sid Abel).

 &HT;    Avalance losing games; game schedule for Japan nixed
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Western Conference
</P>
<P>
   Look out below
</P>
<P>
   Now, Colorado's nickname really is appropriate. The Avalanche,
only three seasons removed from the Stanley Cup, dropped their
fourth straight game at Phoenix, 5-2, after leading 2-0. And it's
not a good sign when a first year coach (Bob Hartley) already is
blaming ``bad bounces.'' Colorado GM Pierra Lacroix is not about to
admit that parting with coach Marc Crawford and hiring Hartley was
a mistake. But there are signs that he is getting ready to shake
things up. Scouts from at least six teams attended a game against
Boston, fueling speculation Lacroix is ready to deal. It's clear
that team chemistry, which created problems for Crawford, remains a
problem for Hartley, who may or may not be qualified to pull things
together. The Avalance remains one of the league's most talented
teams (Patrick Roy, Peter Forsberg, Joe Sakic, et. al.) but that
has meant as little this year as it did last, when the team was
bounced in the first round of the playoffs. ``When (Phoenix) scored
their second goal, it was like, 'Here we go again,''' said Adam
Foote. ``When things are sour, things are sour. But this is
ridiculous.'' The biggest problem? The Avalanche is 1-for-22 on the
power play.

   If there was any doubt that the NHL is shelving its two-year
Tokyo experiment, they were laid to rest this week. League
officials confirmed there will be no regular-season games in Japan
next season and said the next international experience probably
will be an exhibition or two in Europe in the 1999-2000 season. The
two games between San Jose and Calgary drew crowds of only 8,500 at
the Yoyogi Sports Center, perhaps because tickets were as high as
$180. Players and coaches complained about the jet lag and
inconvenience _ even the Flames, and they gained a win and a tie in
the two games. Sharks center Bernie Nicholls was the most vocal
critic, saying, ``To me, it's another stupid thing (commissioner
Gary) Bettman has come up with.'' Bettman, in fact, didn't even
make the trip, instead sending vice president Steve Solomon. Sharks
coach Darryl Sutter offered one alternative to games in Tokyo: ``It
wouldn't be a bad idea if both teams went to Hawaii, split the
games and laid on the beach and told the league we went to Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly ...
</P>
<P>
   Nashville's 12,000 season-ticket holders include Garth Brooks,
Amy Grant, Reba McEntire, Vince Gill, Lorrie Morgan and Deanna
Carter. Quoth coach Barry Trotz: ``We're going to be the best in
the league in something. We're deep in anthem singers.'' ... Ottawa
management let the players spend a week-long retreat in Banff,
Alberta, leading up to the season opener. Maybe that's why the
Senators opened the year with wins over Colorado and Phoenix _ the
first 2-0 start in franchise history. ... Flames No. 1 draft pick
Rico Fata signed his first NHL contract when the team was in Tokyo.
``I'm going to be the answer to a trivia question,'' he said. ...
Anaheim's loss to Washington dropped the Ducks to 0-6 in season
openers. ... The Blackhawks asked Sammy Sosa to drop the ceremonial
first puck at the United Center. ``But I can't skate,'' he said.
The Blackhawks cleared up the misunderstanding. ... Economic
fallout: The Edmonton Oilers couldn't afford to re-sign free-agent
goalie Curtis Joseph (who signed with Toronto for four years and
$24 million) so they replaced him with Bob Essensa, who will make
$450,000 this year, the NHL's lowest-paid starting goalie. ...
Vancouver general manager Brian Burke insists he will trade holdout
forward Pavel Bure but continues to turn down offers.

 &HT;    Free agents may offer needed aid for Braves
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the Braves want to get better, the free-agent
market this winter will offer some interesting choices.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the club desperately needs some help in the
outfield, and both Brian Jordan and Bernie Williams are available.
</P>
<P>
   Williams might be too expensive, and the Braves already have a
good center fielder in Andruw Jones. But Jordan would make a lot of
sense.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who played for the Falcons, lives in Atlanta in the
offseason and has told some of his St. Louis teammates privately
that he would like to play for the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts love the way Jordan plays the game, but injuries,
specifically his bad back, have been a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Another player who could help the Braves is versatile B.J.
Surhoff. While Surhoff, a college teammate of Walt Weiss, is not a
star, he consistently hits 20 homers and drives in 80 runs a season
and can play several positions.
</P>
<P>
   At second base, the Braves could go after Roberto Alomar, who
will be very expensive, and some baseball people think his career
is on a downward turn. In addition, umpires as a group continue to
remember the spitting incident from two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors continue that the Braves will make a play for Milwaukee's
Fernando Vina, who could be a perfect fit as a leadoff hitter. The
Brewers would love to have Ryan Klesko.
</P>
<P>
   But the most intriguing free agent out there for the Braves is
probably Kevin Brown. Even with its starting-pitching riches, the
Braves remember that Brown was he main force stopping Atlanta from
going to the World Series the last two seasons. Brown's home is in
Macon.
</P>
<P>
   How could the Braves fit in Brown? Well, they probably would
have to deal one of their top three starting pitchers. The problem
is that Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz all can block
trades because they have been in the majors for 10 years. But don't
be surprised if Braves general manager John Schuerholz at least
calls Brown's agent, Scott Boras.
</P>
<P>
   In the bullpen, not much is on the market, meaning the Braves
probably would have to make deals to improve there.
</P>
<P>
   Not so Chipper
</P>
<P>
   Not much was heard from Braves third baseman Chipper Jones in
the League Championship Series. The reason is that manager Bobby
Cox told Jones to shut up, and the player typically the most
interviewed didn't even come out of the training room after games
when reporters were around. Cox was upset with some of the things
Jones had said that made it into the Gotham tabloids about the city
of New York. But that censorship by Cox might be an example of one
of the Braves' problems. They have been described as a club that
shows little emotion, and Jones and Tom Glavine are breaths of
fresh air, usually not holding back when things are not going well.
After Cox shut Jones up, the third baseman had a terrible series.
</P>
<P>
   In the '90s
</P>
<P>
   This decade the Braves have been the winningest team, with a
record 822-570, followed by the Yankees who are 753-638. But if the
Yankees win the World Series, they would have two world titles to
Atlanta's one and put themselves in position to take away the
Braves' label of ``Team of 90s.'' Still, Yankees manager Joe Torre
has a lot of respect for the Braves. ``It's tough to get all the
way to the World Series,'' Torre said, ``so I respect what Atlanta
does every year. The Braves are picked every spring to get there,
and every October they are playing with an opportunity to win the
World Series. That is really something.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the horn
</P>
<P>
   The oldest living major-leaguer is 107-year-old Chester Hoff,
who played for the New York Yankees when they were called the
Highlanders. Hoff lives in Daytona Beach and pitched in just 23
major-league games, with a 2-4 record and a 2.49 ERA. ... Word is
that Braves first baseman Andres Galarraga will play winter ball in
his native Venezuela. ... The Mets are expected to make
soon-to-be-free-agent Mike Piazza a seven-year, $98 million deal.
... Word out of Baltimore is that Braves assistant general manager
Dean Taylor continues to be in the running for the Orioles' GM job.
... The Cardinals want to deal for Reds shortstop Barry Larkin. ...
Look for pitching-needy Cleveland to make a hard run at Brown.
</P>

 &HT;    Only one way to tell story of Ga. Tech comeback
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This is not a story that will write itself, if there
ever was one. There are so many ways to tell this one, but it has
to have a beginning, and an ending. It began with Homecoming
folderol, lovely autumn day, browning turf, sun sparkling bright,
but Georgia Tech had a tough foe to hoe. Coaches who cherish their
job don't usually schedule one like Virginia for Homecoming, No. 7
in the poll and unbeaten.
</P>
<P>
   They're still dancing down on the field at Bobby Dodd Stadium,
harkening back to the days when it was Grant Field and football was
in full flower. The band is blasting forth, anybody who can find a
partner is dancing. Goalposts are down at one end, now the other,
and a cheer goes up from the crowd gathered round, like a mob in
the French Revolution, and they go marching off with the crossbar,
triumphant in their glee. It has been announced that the Saturday
Catholic mass will be delayed until the end of the game. Priorities
are in order.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it all came down on the shoulders of a 5-foot,
7-inch sophomore named Todd Braverman, a walk-on from Ft.
Lauderdale. ''He etched his name in Virginia lore against
Clemson,'' it reads in a press release, when he kicked a field goal
that won the game in the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   That was at home in Charlottesville. This was in downtown
Atlanta, in the pressurized zone of the accursed enemy.
Twenty-seven seconds showed on the scoreboard. Georgia Tech led,
41-38, after a comeback that would make Napoleon look like a piker.
A field goal from 54 yards would tie it. Overtime. Tech called
time-out, the old ''freeze'' maneuver, and Braverman walked about
all by himself.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the whistle, the snap, the kick. It was short, no
matter how much, but short, and the world of Georgia Tech erupted.
It was a moment that would freeze in the minds of all who had eyes
and ears, and heart. It was all heart, for if you look at the
statistics, Virginia beat the blazes out of Georgia Tech. But as
George Welsh, the wizened Virginia coach said, ''when you give 14
points to your opponnt, they will generate their own offense.''
</P>
<P>
   When last seen, he had concluded the obligatory handshake with
George O'Leary and was walking slowly, glumly toward the Wardlaw
Building, sanctuary of visiting teams, surrounded by blue uniforms,
like a prisoner being led to his execution. It had been a day to
remember and forget.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia had come crashing out on the field, scored two
touchdowns within 30 seconds in the first quarter, and it was not
looking good for the home side. Even worse in the early third
quarter, when Thomas Jones, a hard-to-tackle running back from Big
Stone Gap, Va., tore loose on a plain off-tackle play and didn't
stop until he had covered the 65 yards between him and the end
zone. He's a ball-carrier as fine as you want to see. The score
became 38-17, out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   Then came one of those gifts. Nate Stimson, a defensive lineman
from West Palm Beach, tackled a fugitive Aaron Brooks, the
quarterback, he fumbled, Delaunta Cameron, from Arlington, Va.,
picked up the ball and huffed and puffed 34 yards for a touchdown.
The comeback was on. Virginia never scored again, and when Joe
Hamilton hit Dez White on a crossing pattern for 54 yards and a
touchdown, and the Tech quarterback dived in for a two-point
conversion, the final score was written.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same, as irony would have it, as the great confict in
Charlottesville in 1990, when Georgia Tech trespassed on Virginia's
lawn.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers were enjoying their only tenure as No. 1 in the
USA, but Scott Sisson kicked a field goal at the end that put away
such dreams. Georgia Tech was on its way to a national championship
at the time, but you know that story.

 &HT;    Yellow Jackets come from behind to sting Virginia
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   That's what No. 25 Georgia Tech pulled off in the Saturday
evening twilight in coming back from three touchdowns behind to
knock off No. 7 Virginia 41-38 in front of a giddy sold-out crowd
of 46,018 at Bobby Dodd Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Braverman's 54-yard field goal attempt came up short with
21 seconds left to leave the scoreboard locked at 41-38, the same
score Tech used to dash Virginia's national championship hopes in
1990. Tech keeps open its own ACC title hopes, its most realistic
shot since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets (5-1, 4-0 ACC) host FSU this Saturday with
the ACC title there for the taking.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by as many as 21 points throughout the game, the Yellow
Jackets kept finding reasons to live. In the first half it was a
69-yard touchdown pass from Joe Hamilton to Dez White and a 54-yard
punt return by Charlie Rogers. In the second-half it was Delaunta
Cameron's 34-yard fumble return for a touchdown, an NCAA record
fifth fumble return for a touchdown this season. That one set off a
roll of 23 unanswered points.
</P>
<P>
   Tech closed a 38-17 Virginia lead to 38-33 with 8:13 remaining
on a 35-yard pass from Joe Hamilton to Dez White.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets then stopped Thomas Jones on third and
inches, the ACC's leading rusher who had 209 of Virginia's 273
rushing yards to that point, when Jesse Tarplin and Justin
Robertson converged on the back. That set up a 46-yard touchdown
pass from Hamilton to White again, on third and 7 on a quick strike
which White turned into a touchdown by flying by defenders across
the field and into the right corner of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   A two-point conversion run by Hamilton gave Tech a 41-38 lead
with 4:40 left.
</P>
<P>
   Tech's defense, which had been bullied for the first three
quarters found a way to stop Virginia in the last 4:40. Twice
Virginia quarterback Aaron Brooks converted first downs on 9-yard
runs. But on second and 10 from Tech's 24, defensive end Nate
Stimson got in his face and forced him to try to unload a pass. He
was called for intentional grounding and Virginia had to go to
Braverman on fourth and 23 with 27 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia's defense couldn't get a grasp on the Tech offense like
it's had against the rest of its opponents this season, but used
three turnovers including an uncharacteristic pair of Joe Hamilton
interceptions, to helps its offense to 21 points and the lead for
all but the last 4:40.
</P>
<P>
   If Tech's defense thought the Boston College loss was
embarrassing, try allowing 31 points and 371 yards in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jones, the ACC's leading rusher with a 107-yard average,
had 118 yards on Tech in the first half. He was averaging 7.4 yards
every time he carried. His backup Antoine Womack averaged 7.3 yards
a touch and had 51 yards of his own in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia had taken a pair of turnovers on Tech's first two
possessions and turned them into touchdowns to set the stage for a
game of catch-up for the Yellow Jackets. The first came following a
Hamilton interception by Antwan Harris at the Tech 42. From there
the Cavaliers used eight running plays and a 2-yard run by Jones
for the 7-0 jumpstart.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Virginia was in the end zone again. After
Anthony Poindexter forced an Ed Wilder fumble, Brooks hit Terrence
Wilkins on a crossing route for a 28-yard touchdown and a 14-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia took its biggest lead 21-3 on an 86-yard drive
highlighted by a 29-yard completion to the wide open fullback
Anthony Southern and some more hard running by Jones and Womack.
Keeping those guys in mind, Tech's defense blew a goal-line play,
allowing quarterback Brooks to walk into the end zone around the
right end.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later Hamilton hit Dez White, who juked cornerback
Dwayne Stukes downfield and scored a 69-yard touchdown to cut
Virginia's lead to 21-10. The Tech fans celebrated loud but not
long as they noticed Hamilton writhing in pain back downfield due
to a punishing hit he took from linebacker Byron Thweatt and
another Virginia defender from the backside. He would leave the
game with a sprained knee.
</P>
<P>
   With Hamilton in the locker room getting his knee wrapped Tech's
defense ''held'' for the first time all day, forcing a Todd
Braverman 45-yard field goal. The Yellow Jackets then held again,
this time for real. And Charlie Rogers jumped on the opening in the
game and up the middle on Virginia's punt return team. A burst and
a couple moves later Rogers was gone for a 54-yard touchdown and
Tech was back in it, 24-17.
</P>
<P>
   But Virginia snatched back the momentum on the very next play
from scrimmage. Brooks found receiver Kevin Coffey down the right
sideline with his defender Jamara Clark a good 5 yards to his side.
He completed the pass for what became a 68-yard gain before Jason
Bostic chased him down from the other side. Four runs later
Southern was in the end zone standing up and untouched to give
Virginia a 31-17 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Hamilton back in, Tech's offense didn't get much. A
pair of Clark interceptions is all that prevented the Cavalier
offense from more. By the end of the first half, it was those two
touchdowns Virginia got in the first eight minutes that separated
Virginia from Tech 31-17.

 &HT;    Eagles pay homage to their past by returning to summit
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATESBORO, Ga. _ Saturday was as beautiful as any good ol' day
Georgia Southern has ever lived. Four national championship flags
grew large in the cool breeze. A fine mob marched from tailgates to
Paulson Stadium benches, spilling over onto the grassy banks at
every corner of the field. The unbeaten Eagles were riding the
football thermals again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great weather, great crowd, two great football teams. What
else would you want to do in Statesboro?'' said Paul Johnson, the
round-faced wind beneath Georgia Southern's wings. Not a card he
could play during eight years assistant coaching at Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Southern is a pocket power again. Ranked No. 2 in
Division I-AA entering the day, the Eagles piled on third-ranked
Appalachian State 37-24. Thursday, top-ranked McNeese State
suffered its first loss. Logic demanded that the winner here would
move into the penthouse vacancy with the next poll.
</P>
<P>
   In case you might be wondering Georgia Southern's ultimate
motives: ``We want to put up our own (championship) banner on the
pole,'' said quarterback Greg Hill, from whom all offense flows.
This day, the option attack chose to gain 494 yards and go over 30
points for the 10th straight time at home.
</P>
<P>
   This was one of those big ``since'' games.
</P>
<P>
   First time since the start of the 1991 season that the Eagles
will have earned the No. 1 ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest crowd _ a throaty 20,353 _ since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   First victory over Appalachian State since '94, after suffering
three straight defeats.
</P>
<P>
   First Georgia Southern runner since ever to go over 100 yards
seven straight games. Redshirt freshman Adrian Peterson didn't stop
Saturday until he reached 216 yards and two touchdowns. He's at
1,193 yards for a season that is but seven games old.
</P>
<P>
   The renaissance in Statesboro is based on the ability to move
the football relentlessly. The Eagles may not claim any great
defensive honors, save cornerback Earthwind Moreland's secure place
on every All-Name team. Their job is to get off the field as
quickly as possible so that a dangerous, many-pronged offense can
take the stage. The tone was perfectly set Saturday when with their
first possession, the Eagles went 64 yards in 15 plays for the
first in a series of touchdowns. ``Let's put it this way,'' said
guard Mark Williams, ``if we do what we're supposed to, we can't be
stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how Georgia Southern would return to the days when a
campus ditch gained the name Beautiful Eagle Creek, and it was
worshipped like the Ganges. The school in the pines is ready to
write some new fables.
</P>
<P>
   Watching it all amid the umbrellas in an end zone patio area
were a couple solitary figures, both important symbols to Georgia
Southern. One an American eagle, the other Erk Russell, the former
head-butting, Uncle-Fester-on-Creatine coach who started all this.
As to which was balder, it was impossible to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, whose coaching odyssey has taken him from Statesboro to
Honolulu and back, leads this revival. Until he arrived last season
on the heels of a 4-7 1996, Paulson Stadium attendance had been in
slow, steady decline since the start of the decade. It is now
spiking upwards again. An old feeling is familiar again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to go toward the future, but you don't want to fight
the past,'' said Johnson, an assistant here under Russell in the
mid-'80s. ``There are several of us on staff who know how it felt,
and we want the players to know what it was like.'' This fine
afternoon, Johnson's bunch stepped smartly backward to the future.

 &HT;    It's Falcons vs. Saints _ with meaning
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There will be a little more on the line this afternoon
in the Georgia Dome than the locals are accustomed to, and if the
Atlanta Falcons beat the New Orleans Saints for the seventh
straight time, there will be even more pressure. A new kind of
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons (4-1) are tied with the 49ers for first place in the
NFC West, and the Saints (3-2) are one game back. The Falcons have
won 10 of their last 13 games, and are beginning to get national
media exposure. Not only that, but people are talking about coach
Dan Reeves' squad as one with serious playoff aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   There's a very good chance the Falcons will sell 60,000 tickets
or more, giving them their biggest crowd since 1996, when they sold
58,760 for a game against the Steelers. The San Francisco game had
the most tickets sold last year with 53,378.
</P>
<P>
   Given all the fuss lately, and the Falcons' six-game winning
streak against this division rival, one can't help but wonder about
the danger of overconfidence among the home team.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it, said second-year tight end O.J. Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might happen. Look at San Francisco up in Buffalo a
couple weeks ago (an upset win by the Bills).'' he said. ``But I
don't think we're at that stage yet. Maybe if we were 11-1. All
this is new for this team, new for this organization. I don't think
it's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the Saints are ranked last in the NFL in total
defense, giving up 378.6 yards per game, and 281.4 passing yards
per game. That's also worst in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   But Reeves is convinced the Falcons need to be concerned about
the Saints' blitzing defense (17 sacks), and he's well aware that
New Orleans has a plus-nine turnover ratio, tied for second-best in
the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The fact Saints coach Mike Ditka has made a move at quarterback,
naming two-time former Falcon Billy Joe Tolliver the starter over
Danny Wuerffel, almost doesn't matter to Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than San Francisco, they're the best team we've
played,'' he said. ``They're extremely active on defense, and
they've struggled at quarterback and still won three games.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditka made the move partly because he fears the Falcons' pass
rush, which has 13 sacks in the last 14 quarters after starting
with just one in the first six quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want a little more mobility against a good
pass-rushing team,'' Ditka said. ``Danny had trouble with them last
year (Atlanta had 16 sacks in two games against the Saints in 1997,
including 10 in the first meeting when Wuerffel started). Danny
holds the ball a little longer than Billy Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditka is returning to the site of one of his career low points.
He was so despondent after a 20-3 loss in Atlanta last year that he
talked about quitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all go through those little things in life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not very rational after that game in Atlanta last year.
I went through a period where I was questioning myself more than
anything.''

DEFINING FAMED CHOREOGRAPHER-DIRECTOR BOB FOSSE NO EASY STEP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Fill in the blank: Bob Fosse's choreography is
known for being extremely ...
</P>
<P>
   Dark? Erotic? Humorous? Theatrical?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, to all of the above. But what about classy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'm so glad you said that,'' Gwen Verdon exclaims. ``Most
people don't spot that; they just see sex and eroticism and
sensuality and bumps and grinds. He had great elegance.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed he did -- not that Fosse had anything against bumping and
grinding, either.
</P>
<P>
   It was his unique way of fusing dissimilar traits -- sensuality
with sophistication, sardonicism with joy, funkiness with wit --
that Verdon and several other longtime collaborators are seeking to
commemorate with ``Fosse: A Celebration in Song and Dance.'' The
Broadway-bound musical, which includes numbers from ``Cabaret,''
``The Pajama Game,'' ``Chicago,'' ``Pippin'' and ``Damn Yankees,''
among others, opens Wednesday at the Ahmanson Theatre, where it
will play through Dec. 6 en route to its Jan. 14 Broadway premiere.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, ``Fosse'' is a kind of family reunion, uniting
members of the late choreographer-director's extended (and densely
intertwined) personal and professional lives.
</P>
<P>
   Verdon, Fosse's third wife, was perhaps his pre-eminent
interpreter, winning Tony Awards for ``Can-Can,'' ``Damn Yankees,''
``New Girl in Town'' and ``Redhead.'' She's listed as the new
show's artistic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Reinking, who co-conceived ``Fosse'' along with Richard
Maltby Jr. and Chet Walker, was one of Fosse's greatest proteges
and his close companion of many years. She's sharing choreographic
duties with Walker, who first approached Fosse with the idea of a
revue based on his work in 1986, a year before Fosse died at age
60.
</P>
<P>
   For once, the phrase ``labor of love'' seems more than just a
cliche here. Even when communicating by phone, it's impossible to
miss the immense affection those who knew Fosse best still feel
toward this complex, demanding and singular American artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonderful time in my life, and it's very gratifying
to see that he entrusted me with so much belief in me,'' Reinking
says of her years spent working with Fosse on shows such as
``Dancin' '' and the 1979 feature film ``All That Jazz,'' the
thinly disguised biopic that Fosse directed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a remarkable gift and one that I've always been
grateful for, and it's also wonderful to be doing this again and to
have the chance to experience it again,'' Reinking adds.
</P>
<P>
   Surely the most striking behind-the-scenes tribute is that
Reinking, 47, and Verdon, 73, have worked together to honor a man
whose love they once shared. (Though Verdon and Fosse eventually
separated, they never divorced and stayed close friends as well as
creative partners.)
</P>
<P>
   ``To see them now -- they have such respect for each other,''
says ``Fosse'' cast member Valarie Pettiford. ``They love each
other, and it's a beautiful thing. And it's because of their love
of Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortuitously, ``Fosse'' is arriving at a moment when its
inspiration's stock is higher than ever. A wildly successful
revival of the noir-ish musical ``Chicago'' is touring the country.
``Cabaret,'' another show Fosse choreographed, also enjoyed a
successful Broadway revival starring Natasha Richardson last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most significantly, Fosse's sultry, insinuating
choreographic style, and the often cynical material that attracted
him, seem suddenly in step with the times. Much as Paddy
Chayefsky's ``Network'' looks even more prescient now than it did
in 1976, the mordant, post-Watergate satire of ``Chicago'' now
serves as a bracing, ice-water antidote to the politics of
Monicagate.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be a mistake, the show's creators say, to
overemphasize any one aspect of Fosse's work. The man who admired
Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill's moral starkness also helped stitch
together Sid Caesar's brilliant, quick-change clowning in the Neil
Simon musical ``Little Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He not only liked heavy-duty stories but he also liked light
stories like `Damn Yankees,' '' says Reinking. ``He employed a
broad spectrum of feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Verdon says that, in addition to such choreographers as Agnes de
Mille, Jack Cole and George Balanchine, her husband was greatly
influenced by the stylized movements and archetypal characters of
medieval commedia dell'arte, as well as by such great burlesque
comedians as Burt Lahr and W.C. Fields. Fosse himself had started
out performing in burlesque theaters as a Chicago youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still remember W.C. Fields walking behind Mae West and
just missing the train of her dress,'' Verdon says. ``There was an
economy and elegance about humor; it was not just four-letter words
and making fun of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, Fosse maintained an edge of playfulness,
both on stage and off, Verdon says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob used to dance in supermarkets, because he loved all that
(piped-in) music,'' she says. ``He'd take a cart and go dancing
down the aisle. Our daughter loved it; I'd take another aisle. And
he'd always wear hats. He loved props.''

 &HT;    Virginia Union wins 21-7, sends Morehouse to 0-8
 &HT;    By Seth Coleman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the eighth straight game, Morehouse was
overwhelmed by a stronger opponent as Virginia Union defeated the
Maroon Tigers 21-7 Saturday before a homecoming crowd of 10,000 at
B.T. Harvey Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   For Morehouse (0-8), the opponents change but the result remains
the same _ a valiant effort falls short against stronger,
experienced teams. But Panthers head coach Willie Bailey didn't
think it was a total mismatch. He thought coming in to the contest,
Morehouse had a decided edge in quickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that there was no use running outside on them because
they are so much quicker than we are,'' said Bailey, whose Panthers
move to 5-2 overall, remain 3-2 in the CIAA. ``But we thought we
could run straight at them. I'll tell you one thing, they may not
have won any games yet, but they give you one hell of a fight for
four quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had success moving the football as the Panthers, who
will travel to Norfolk State next week for a key CIAA matchup,
rolled up 386 yards of total offense _ 251 on the ground _ while
Morehouse amassed 243 total yards. Andre Braxton led the Panther
rushing attack with 84 yards on 19 carries.
</P>
<P>
   The game was also a duel between two freshman quarterbacks,
Virginia Union's Jasun Thompson (cq) and Chivarlrik Daughtry from
Morehouse. Thompson was 9-of-14 passing for 135 yards and two
touchdowns, while Daughtry, who evaded several sacks by a strong VU
rush, was 11-of-22 for 122 yards and the Maroon Tigers' lone
touchdown.

 &HT;    Georgia Bulldogs `back on track'
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia took the first step toward erasing the
memory of last week's bitter loss to Tennessee, rolling 31-6 over
hapless Vanderbilt in Saturday's homecoming game in front of 83,911
fans at Sanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs improved to 5-1, including 3-1 in the SEC, ahead of
this week's road date at pass-happy Kentucky. Vanderbilt fell to
0-6 and 0-4 in the SEC, moving closer to the program's first
winless season in its 109-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really good to get back out there and get a win,''
Georgia linebacker Orantes Grant said. ``It gives us back our
confidence and gets us back on track.'' Georgia won despite using
starting quarterback Quincy Carter for only the first quarter.
Carter, a freshman from Decatur, bruised his left (non-throwing)
shoulder in the 22-3 loss to Tennessee last week. He completed
3-of-6 passes for 62 yards and two touchdowns, to Champ Bailey and
Tony Small.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could become very difficult for (Carter) to play if he
continues to get hit,'' Georgia coach Jim Donnan said. ``He got
hurt in the first quarter last week, then played the rest of the
game. He was able to practice all week without getting hit, and
then got hit only once (against Vandy). I expect him to be at
full-strength next week.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Commodores stacking the line of scrimmage to stop
Georgia's running attack, Carter and backup Jon England both called
audibles for ``tunnel screens'' to Bailey, who turned the quick
slants into scoring receptions of 29 and 44 yards. Bailey finished
with 159 all-purpose yards, including five catches for a
career-high 130 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're bringing that many people, there's nobody in the
middle to cover him,'' center Jonas Jennings said. ``Once Champ
gets past the first level, no one can catch him.''
</P>
<P>
   England, a junior who lost the starting job to Carter in
preseason, completed 6-of-12 attempts for 96 yards in the most
extensive action of his college career.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs' running game also improved. Highly regarded
freshman Jasper Sanks finally saw action and led all Georgia
players with 57 yards on nine carries, including a 28-yard burst.
Georgia finished with 222 rushing yards, its highest total on the
ground since gaining 289 in the season opener against Kent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good to get out there,'' Sanks said. ``I was a little
nervous on the first few carries, but now ... I'm ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs outgained the Commodores by only 12 yards, yet
Vandy scored just once, and that was against the Bulldogs' second-
and third-teamers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to worry about anything they did against our
defense,'' Donnan said, ``because there were guys out there that I
didn't even know were on our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's get-well game turned into a special-teams nightmare
for the Commodores, who lost to the Bulldogs for the fourth
straight time. Georgia scored on a blocked punt and scored after
another botched punt and a fumbled kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia took a 17-0 lead after Vanderbilt's Lew Thomas, a
freshman from Westlake High, fumbled a kickoff, which Dogs strong
safety Earl Chambers recovered at the Vandy 31. Carter needed only
two plays to find Bailey for his first score.
</P>
<P>
   When Vandy attempted to punt with about 11 minutes left in the
opening half, punter Joe Webb dropped the snap. When he picked it
up and tried to punt, Georgia cornerback Glenn Ford blocked the
kick, catching the ball in the air and returning it 46 yards for a
touchdown. Junior Hap Hines' extra point made it 24-0 with 10:31
remaining in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he bobbled it, I thought I had a chance,'' Ford said. ``I
just took off. I blocked, I caught it and I returned it. Coach
Donnan was telling us we needed to create more turnovers. We were
able to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, a senior from Columbus, became the first Bulldog to block
a punt since Trey Sipe stuffed one against New Mexico State in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Commodores had botched another punt earlier when Webb
fumbled a high snap. The Commodores recovered, but the Bulldogs had
possession and drove in for a 44-yard field goal by Hines, their
first points of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Vandy's only score came late in the third quarter on backup
quarterback Greg Zolman's 36-yard pass to redshirt freshman Adam
Ditto of Kennesaw's Harrison High.

DEFINING FAMED CHOREOGRAPHER-DIRECTOR BOB FOSSE NO EASY STEP
</HEADLINE>
 Los Angeles: He loved props.'' 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's well-known that Fosse placed tremendous emphasis on
(ITAL)acting(END ITAL) a dance part. A wiggling finger, a tipped
bowler hat or the angular thrust of a leg weren't intended simply
as stylish gestures but as expressions of a dancer's inner life.
Fosse wanted dancers who not only could move but sing and act as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it was because of Jerome (Robbins) and Bob that the
dancers all took singing lessons,'' Verdon says. ``The minute those
two men started directing, everybody wanted dancers who could sing.
So, all of a sudden, everybody could sing. Look at Chita Rivera.''
</P>
<P>
   Fosse also sought individuality in his dancers. He'd always been
a fan of the Nicholas brothers, Fayard and Harold, American tap
stars of the 1930s and '40s known for their fluidity and expressive
personalities. Although Fosse's pupils were trained in ``the Fosse
style,'' they constantly were encouraged to be themselves, says
Pettiford, who first worked with Fosse when she was 17 in the
musical ``Dancin'.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was definitely open to (suggestions), especially if he
trusted you,'' Pettiford says. ``When you were partnering (with
him) he would try out different things. That's what I loved about
Bob is he used those things. If he was working on a piece and he
was smoking and smoke got in his eye, he would figure out a way to
keep that, either by the gesture of smoking or waving it away or
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Fosse acquired a reputation of being tough on dancers,
particularly women, whose bodies had to contort to his rigorous
positioning. But Tarzana resident Jane Lanier, another dancer
featured prominently in the show, says his choreography reflected
Fosse's multifaceted view of women. As evidence, she points to two
roles she performs in ``Fosse'' -- the ``Steam Heat'' number from
``Pajama Game'' and ``Big Spender'' from ``Sweet Charity'' -- parts
originally created for Carol Haney and Verdon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get to play so many different women and important women in
his life and his art,'' Lanier says. ``I get to be sexy and the
funny one, because he lets women be all those things, because we
!ital!are!off! all of them. Most shows, you're (either) the ingenue
or the vamp.''
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, the show's creators aimed to create a broad
spectrum of ages and ethnicities among the cast, reflecting Fosse's
belief that a strong ensemble required an interesting cross-section
of diverse individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Annie's point of view was to show a span of people from, let's
say 19 to, well, I won't tell their real age, but to verging 40,''
Verdon says. ``It just shows that the body continues to move; you
don't drop dead at 35. ... I would say some of the most beautiful
women in the show are verging on what Hollywood would call over the
hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Fosse'' first opened July 16 at the Ford Centre for the
Performing Arts in Toronto, its length has been trimmed from about
three hours to two hours, 23 minutes, with two 15-minute
intermissions.
</P>
<P>
   Picking one moment from the show's roughly 30 dance numbers that
sums up the essence of Fosse can't be easy. But when asked to do
so, Verdon doesn't hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Valarie Pettiford opens the show with `Life Is Just a
Bowl of Cherries,' because that was his philosophy. She does it
beautifully,'' Verdon says. ``In the beginning, she presents his
point of view: `The good things in life to you are just loaned/So
how can you lose what you never owned?' ''

DEFINING FAMED CHOREOGRAPHER-DIRECTOR BOB FOSSE NO EASY STEP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Fill in the blank: Bob Fosse's choreography is
known for being extremely ...
</P>
<P>
   Dark? Erotic? Humorous? Theatrical?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, to all of the above. But what about classy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'm so glad you said that,'' Gwen Verdon exclaims. ``Most
people don't spot that; they just see sex and eroticism and
sensuality and bumps and grinds. He had great elegance.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed he did -- not that Fosse had anything against bumping and
grinding, either.
</P>
<P>
   It was his unique way of fusing dissimilar traits -- sensuality
with sophistication, sardonicism with joy, funkiness with wit --
that Verdon and several other longtime collaborators are seeking to
commemorate with ``Fosse: A Celebration in Song and Dance.'' The
Broadway-bound musical, which includes numbers from ``Cabaret,''
``The Pajama Game,'' ``Chicago,'' ``Pippin'' and ``Damn Yankees,''
among others, opens Wednesday at the Ahmanson Theatre, where it
will play through Dec. 6 en route to its Jan. 14 Broadway premiere.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, ``Fosse'' is a kind of family reunion, uniting
members of the late choreographer-director's extended (and densely
intertwined) personal and professional lives.
</P>
<P>
   Verdon, Fosse's third wife, was perhaps his pre-eminent
interpreter, winning Tony Awards for ``Can-Can,'' ``Damn Yankees,''
``New Girl in Town'' and ``Redhead.'' She's listed as the new
show's artistic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Reinking, who co-conceived ``Fosse'' along with Richard
Maltby Jr. and Chet Walker, was one of Fosse's greatest proteges
and his close companion of many years. She's sharing choreographic
duties with Walker, who first approached Fosse with the idea of a
revue based on his work in 1986, a year before Fosse died at age
60.
</P>
<P>
   For once, the phrase ``labor of love'' seems more than just a
cliche here. Even when communicating by phone, it's impossible to
miss the immense affection those who knew Fosse best still feel
toward this complex, demanding and singular American artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonderful time in my life, and it's very gratifying
to see that he entrusted me with so much belief in me,'' Reinking
says of her years spent working with Fosse on shows such as
``Dancin' '' and the 1979 feature film ``All That Jazz,'' the
thinly disguised biopic that Fosse directed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a remarkable gift and one that I've always been
grateful for, and it's also wonderful to be doing this again and to
have the chance to experience it again,'' Reinking adds.
</P>
<P>
   Surely the most striking behind-the-scenes tribute is that
Reinking, 47, and Verdon, 73, have worked together to honor a man
whose love they once shared. (Though Verdon and Fosse eventually
separated, they never divorced and stayed close friends as well as
creative partners.)
</P>
<P>
   ``To see them now -- they have such respect for each other,''
says ``Fosse'' cast member Valarie Pettiford. ``They love each
other, and it's a beautiful thing. And it's because of their love
of Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortuitously, ``Fosse'' is arriving at a moment when its
inspiration's stock is higher than ever. A wildly successful
revival of the noir-ish musical ``Chicago'' is touring the country.
``Cabaret,'' another show Fosse choreographed, also enjoyed a
successful Broadway revival starring Natasha Richardson last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most significantly, Fosse's sultry, insinuating
choreographic style, and the often cynical material that attracted
him, seem suddenly in step with the times. Much as Paddy
Chayefsky's ``Network'' looks even more prescient now than it did
in 1976, the mordant, post-Watergate satire of ``Chicago'' now
serves as a bracing, ice-water antidote to the politics of
Monicagate.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be a mistake, the show's creators say, to
overemphasize any one aspect of Fosse's work. The man who admired
Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill's moral starkness also helped stitch
together Sid Caesar's brilliant, quick-change clowning in the Neil
Simon musical ``Little Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He not only liked heavy-duty stories but he also liked light
stories like `Damn Yankees,' '' says Reinking. ``He employed a
broad spectrum of feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Verdon says that, in addition to such choreographers as Agnes de
Mille, Jack Cole and George Balanchine, her husband was greatly
influenced by the stylized movements and archetypal characters of
medieval commedia dell'arte, as well as by such great burlesque
comedians as Burt Lahr and W.C. Fields. Fosse himself had started
out performing in burlesque theaters as a Chicago youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still remember W.C. Fields walking behind Mae West and
just missing the train of her dress,'' Verdon says. ``There was an
economy and elegance about humor; it was not just four-letter words
and making fun of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, Fosse maintained an edge of playfulness,
both on stage and off, Verdon says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob used to dance in supermarkets, because he loved all that
(piped-in) music,'' she says. ``He'd take a cart and go dancing
down the aisle. Our daughter loved it; I'd take another aisle. And
he'd always wear hats. He loved props.''
</P>
<P>
   (2ND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   It's well-known that Fosse placed tremendous emphasis on
(ITAL)acting(END ITAL) a dance part. A wiggling finger, a tipped
bowler hat or the angular thrust of a leg weren't intended simply
as stylish gestures but as expressions of a dancer's inner life.
Fosse wanted dancers who not only could move but sing and act as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it was because of Jerome (Robbins) and Bob that the
dancers all took singing lessons,'' Verdon says. ``The minute those
two men started directing, everybody wanted dancers who could sing.
So, all of a sudden, everybody could sing. Look at Chita Rivera.''
</P>
<P>
   Fosse also sought individuality in his dancers. He'd always been
a fan of the Nicholas brothers, Fayard and Harold, American tap
stars of the 1930s and '40s known for their fluidity and expressive
personalities. Although Fosse's pupils were trained in ``the Fosse
style,'' they constantly were encouraged to be themselves, says
Pettiford, who first worked with Fosse when she was 17 in the
musical ``Dancin'.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was definitely open to (suggestions), especially if he
trusted you,'' Pettiford says. ``When you were partnering (with
him) he would try out different things. That's what I loved about
Bob is he used those things. If he was working on a piece and he
was smoking and smoke got in his eye, he would figure out a way to
keep that, either by the gesture of smoking or waving it away or
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Fosse acquired a reputation of being tough on dancers,
particularly women, whose bodies had to contort to his rigorous
positioning. But Tarzana resident Jane Lanier, another dancer
featured prominently in the show, says his choreography reflected
Fosse's multifaceted view of women. As evidence, she points to two
roles she performs in ``Fosse'' -- the ``Steam Heat'' number from
``Pajama Game'' and ``Big Spender'' from ``Sweet Charity'' -- parts
originally created for Carol Haney and Verdon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get to play so many different women and important women in
his life and his art,'' Lanier says. ``I get to be sexy and the
funny one, because he lets women be all those things, because we
!ital!are!off! all of them. Most shows, you're (either) the ingenue
or the vamp.''
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, the show's creators aimed to create a broad
spectrum of ages and ethnicities among the cast, reflecting Fosse's
belief that a strong ensemble required an interesting cross-section
of diverse individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Annie's point of view was to show a span of people from, let's
say 19 to, well, I won't tell their real age, but to verging 40,''
Verdon says. ``It just shows that the body continues to move; you
don't drop dead at 35. ... I would say some of the most beautiful
women in the show are verging on what Hollywood would call over the
hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Fosse'' first opened July 16 at the Ford Centre for the
Performing Arts in Toronto, its length has been trimmed from about
three hours to two hours, 23 minutes, with two 15-minute
intermissions.
</P>
<P>
   Picking one moment from the show's roughly 30 dance numbers that
sums up the essence of Fosse can't be easy. But when asked to do
so, Verdon doesn't hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Valarie Pettiford opens the show with `Life Is Just a
Bowl of Cherries,' because that was his philosophy. She does it
beautifully,'' Verdon says. ``In the beginning, she presents his
point of view: `The good things in life to you are just loaned/So
how can you lose what you never owned?' ''

WHITE HOUSE CALLS JONES SETTLEMENT OFFER UNACCEPTABLE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Paula Corbin Jones Saturday demanded that President
Clinton pay her $1 million as part of a $2 million package she
would receive to drop her sexual misconduct lawsuit against him,
but White House advisers quickly described the proposal as riddled
with insurmountable problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones' much-awaited final counteroffer and the swift White
House reaction ended a month of intense settlement negotiations in
which both sides briefly appeared close to ending the four-year-old
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent end of negotiations means that the lawsuit that
helped bring the president to the brink of impeachment will now
remain alive in the courts as Clinton deals with a formal
impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The White House did not formally reject the offer Saturday
night, but advisers made it clear that the president would not
participate in the package Ms. Jones had proposed. The other $1
million was to come from Abe Hirschfeld, a New York real estate
magnate.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ms. Jones and Clinton had strong reasons to reach a
settlement. Clinton and his advisers had believed that ending the
lawsuit would make it easier for him to deal with Congress because
many of the accusations he faces stem from the Jones matter.
</P>
<P>
   The House is considering, among other things, whether he lied to
Ms. Jones' lawyers when he testified under oath in a deposition
last January that he had not engaged in ``sexual relations'' with
Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   While a settlement of the lawsuit would not help Clinton in
strict legal terms, he and his advisers believed it would make it
more difficult for Congress to move against him for behavior in a
lawsuit that no longer existed. He would also be more free to
reverse himself and admit he lied in the deposition. Such an
admission while the lawsuit existed would place him in greater
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Jones, a settlement would mean she would be guaranteed
some money after years of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the negotiations, Clinton and Ms. Jones seemed
fairly close, the lawyers involved said, with only $300,000
separating them. Ms. Jones asked for $1 million in September and
the White House countered with $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation became clouded in recent days as the cast of
lawyers and advisers in Ms. Jones' camp increased. At one time Ms.
Jones had a single lawyer representing her, but this weekend, there
were at least six sets of lawyers in her camp dickering over
Hirschfeld's $1 million offer and what to demand of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyers now have lawyers. And Ms. Jones has a new lawyer
whose sole job is to represent her to her other lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   One White House official said that it was not reasonable to
expect Clinton to come across with $1 million because he had
explicitly rejected that figure before. To do so now, the official
said, would make it harder for the president to argue that his
contribution did not amount to an apology, because it could be
viewed as demonstrating how desperate he was to make the lawsuit go
away.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also did not want to have anything to do with
Hirschfeld's offer. Yet another problem is that Joseph Cammarata,
who formerly represented Ms. Jones, has insisted that he receive
something like the first $800,000 of any settlement to pay for his
legal costs. Cammarata has asserted that a federal trial judge has
approved such an arrangement, although it is far from clear that
she has done so.
</P>
<P>
   Cammarata has hired a lawyer to represent his interests.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld has balked at any arrangement in which Cammarata and
his partner, Gilbert Davis, would take such a large slice.
</P>
<P>
   A scheduled argument for next Tuesday in St. Paul before an
appeals court panel has served as a kind of deadline driving the
negotiations. Ms. Jones is asking the appeals panel to reinstate
her case, which was dismissed April 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Ms. Jones seemed influenced the most by William
McMillan, a California lawyer, to help her deal with her lawyers.
McMillan is the husband of Susan Carpenter-McMillan, who has served
as an adviser, friend and spokesman for Ms. Jones. The McMillans
became involved as well the last time settlement negotiations
seemed on the brink of success, in September 1997, when Cammarata
and Davis withdrew from the case in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones' new set of lawyers agreed to take the case if Mrs.
Carpenter-McMillan ended her role as an adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones charged in her suit that in 1991 when Clinton was
governor of Arkansas and she was a state employee, he had her
summoned to his hotel suite in Little Rock and made a crude sexual
advance.

MORE SAINTLY BEHAVIOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Ditka and Bill Kuharich may not win the Super Bowl trophy
this year in New Orleans but they should be in line for the Sister
Teresa Aid to Homeless Quarterbacks Award.
</P>
<P>
   When Ditka and Kuharich claimed disgraced ex-Carolina
quarterback Kerry Collins on waivers last week, it brought to two
the number of lost souls they've imported at that position in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   Just last November it was Ditka's Saints who signed Billy Joe
Hobert a month after he'd been fired by the Buffalo Bills for
admitting he didn't have a clue what his team was trying to do
against the Patriots during a 33-6 loss in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   Hobert told the Buffalo media the next day that he had never
even looked at the game plan and thus was baffled once he found
himself in the game after a shoulder injury had finished starter
Todd Collins for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Hobert threw two interceptions and often looked like a guy who
had no idea what he was supposed to be doing, which turned out to
be exactly the case. When an embarrassed and dejected Hobert made
his unethical work ethic public, he was fired, and many felt he
would never work again in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, however, Kuharich and Ditka brought him to New
Orleans and in less than two months he had become their starting
quarterback. Hobert has now been lost to a season-ending injury and
the Saints are trying the same route again, agreeing to bring in
Collins a week after he allegedly went to Panthers head coach Dom
Capers and said the unthinkable: He said he didn't want to play
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Or did he?
</P>
<P>
   That's what Kuharich, the Saints' president, general manager,
and chief operating officer, needed to find out before his team put
a claim in on Collins after the Panthers were unable to trade the
former No. 1 draft choice for a pair of socks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to do a Paul Harvey,'' Kuharich said Friday. ``I
needed `the rest of the story.' It was very strange, so I just
thought there was more to it than was being reported. They had just
offered him a contract extension a few weeks ago worth $25 million
for six years. So something was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three questions we needed to answer before we brought
Kerry here was (1) what kind of football player is he. That was a
no brainer. (2) What really happened in Carolina. (3) How would it
effect our team. The last one was what I was most concerned
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuharich said he talked with no one ``in the Panther family''
about Collins because they might have been in an emotional
situation that prevented them from seeing the forest for the trees.
He also didn't talk to Collins's agent, Leigh Steinberg, until
after the Saints had claimed him because he wanted to avoid the
mist of the best spinmeister in the game.
</P>
<P>
   So he talked with the man who made Collins the fifth player
taken in 1995's draft, Colts president Bill Polian, as well as two
of his own players, safety Chad Cota and wide receiver Eric
Guliford, who both played with Collins in Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   He came away believing that the stories about Collins having a
drinking problem or suffering with the manic depression that has
been found in his family were, at best, overblown and that the day
Collins went to see Capers was one filled more with
misunderstanding than with a desire to stop playing football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's only concerned with what happens here, but I was a
little more interested in trying to see what happened up there
because I've learned perception is not always reality,'' Kuharich
said. ``Chad had a lot of good things to say about him. Polian
thinks a lot of him. We liked him coming out of college and a big
factor was he's only 25 and has already had success in this
league.''
</P>
<P>
   That success came when Collins and a stiff defense combined to
lead the Panthers to the NFC Championship game in 1995. Although he
has struggled since, both on and off the field, Collins was a Pro
Bowl selection that year and Kuharich understands that in a league
that lacks enough quarterbacks to go around, if you can get a Pro
Bowl one for nothing, what's the risk?
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes here with a clean slate,'' Kuharich said. ``Kerry
basically has an 11-week evaluation period. We would not have
traded for him because basically we don't believe in trading with
teams within our division. But there was no risk claiming him. He's
a free agent at the end of the season but if we like each other I
think he'll want to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   What Kuharich and Ditka liked was an NFL arm, experience as a
starter, and, surprisingly, toughness.
</P>
<P>
   Collins had shown that last year when he came back to play with
his jaw wired after Bill Romanowski shattered it in preseason, but
it had come into question when Capers said he had asked out of the
lineup saying his heart was no longer in football.
</P>
<P>
   That story was seconded by backup quarterbacks Shane Matthews
and Steve Beuerlein, who claim that Collins said as much to them in
a quarterback meeting following his session with Capers. But when
Collins got to New Orleans, he denied it, saying there was a
misunderstanding of his feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard three different stories,'' Kuharich said. ``I heard
his heart wasn't in it. I heard he told Capers if he felt the team
was 0-4 because of him, he should sit him down. And I heard he was
upset about all the free agents they signed for big money in the
offseason before they got to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm aware of the talk about him. I know there have been
stories about a drinking problem and depression but we've got a
good support system here. If he shows signs of that, we can support
him. But I won't prejudge problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think maybe he doesn't like being the person out front
and that's tough for an NFL quarterback. I believe that's more of
the situation and I think we have the coach who can handle that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuharich believed it enough to agree to pay the final $746,058
of the $1.153 million Collins was to earn this season and take his
chances that a former Pro Bowl quarterback can yet return to that
form in a new city.
</P>
<P>
   He particularly believed all of that after watching Collins pass
during the Panthers' loss to Atlanta two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a string of a dozen throws that were as good as anyone
in the league,'' Kuharich said. ``If you saw this one seam route he
threw, you'd say, `What's the risk?' There's such a lack of
quarterbacks today and here's a guy who was a No. 1 pick for a
reason. He showed against us and other teams in the past the skill
he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding Collins to a locker room that already had Hobert might
lead some to think Ditka and Kuharich had decided to open the Boys
Town of the NFL. To others it might just seem dangerous business.
But to Bill Kuharich and Mike Ditka, it was something much simpler
than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we're the home of lost souls,'' Ditka said. ``I know
there's angels everywhere. Maybe we're going to be his guardian
angel. I hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   If they are, the Saints could end up being a devil of a team in
a year or two with a lost kid named Kerry Collins at quarterback
backed up by another one named Billy Joe Hobert.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   If  &UR; Jerry Rice  &LR; is to be believed, there is one guy worth
keeping an eye on Monday night when the Jets have the ball: wide
receiver  &UR; Keyshawn Johnson &LR; . ``He's a good guy and he has a lot of
confidence,'' says Rice. ``There's nothing wrong with that. The
thing I like about him is he's a playmaker. He's going to be around
for a long, long time.'' ... Rice happens to be a bit of an expert
on quarterbacks, as well, and here's his opinion of the apparently
ageless  &UR; Steve Young &LR; : ``The ball has exploded downfield this year.
I like to test him at times. I try to sprint hard downfield and
outrun the football. So far, he's been putting the ball out there
and I have to utilize my extreme burst to get to the ball, so he's
looking better than ever.'' ... Rice could tie  &UR; Art Monk's  &LR; NFL
record for consecutive games with a reception Sunday. Monk had
receptions in 183 straight games. Coincidentally, the last time
Rice didn't make a catch was on Dec. 1, 1985, in a game against the
Redskins, Monk's team, at RFK Stadium. To give you an idea of what
that record means, the next closest active player is Dallas's
 &UR; Michael Irvin  &LR; with 114 and then Minnesota's  &UR; Cris Carter  &LR; with
104 ... When Cincinnati quarterback  &UR; Neil O'Donnell  &LR; used a faked
spike to freeze the Steelers' defense last Sunday and throw a
game-winning touchdown pass to  &UR; Carl Pickens  &LR; as time was running
out, not everyone was fooled. Safety  &UR; Carnell Lake  &LR; reacted and ran
to cover  &UR; Darnay Scott  &LR; when O'Donnell yelled, ``Clock, clock,'' as
he came to the line. Unfortunately for Pittsburgh, the rest of the
defense did not react, which is probably why Lake is a consistent
Pro Bowl player ... Speaking of Pittsburgh, that city is on
schedule to open both a new baseball park and a new football
stadium in 2001. Both will be built within the shadow of Three
Rivers Stadium. How come a city like Pittsburgh can build two new
stadiums faster than Massachusetts can build none? ... Denver
running back  &UR; Terrell Davis  &LR; is finally resting Sunday because the
AFC West has a bye. He should need it, because he hasn't been
resting much. Davis is averaging 144.2 yards a game, a pace for
2,307 yards. That would break the record of 2,105 set by  &UR; Eric
Dickerson  &LR; in 1984 ... No wonder the Philadelphia Eagles are mired
near the bottom of the NFL standings. In 1995, the Eagles decided
not to trade for Jacksonville quarterback  &UR; Mark Brunell &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has
the Jaguars undefeated at 5-0. They also got rid of both  &UR; Bubby
Brister  &LR; and  &UR; Randall Cunningham  &LR; in recent years. Brister and
Cunningham this morning are the top-rated passers in the AFC and
NFC, respectively, although Brister technically does not have
enough attempts to qualify. They're also a combined 11-0 with
Denver and Minnesota, respectively. So the combined record of
unwanted ex-Eagle quarterbacks is 16-0. And what of Philly's
quarterbacks?  &UR; Rodney Peete  &LR; has the only win. Over winless
Washington, we must add ... Speaking of the Deadskins, you can't
blame Patriots secondary coach  &UR; Ron Lynn  &LR; if he's of a mind to say,
``I told you so.'' That's because Lynn was fired as the Redskins'
defensive coordinator after the 1996 season despite inheriting a
defense that was 26th in the NFL in 1993 and improving it to 18th
by 1995. In his final season in Washington, that defense allowed
nearly a touchdown less per game than the one he inherited. Yet he
was blamed for the Redskins' failure to make the playoffs and
fired. Lynn has been a defensive coordinator in the NFL since 1986,
rebuilding bad units into competent ones in San Diego and
Cincinnati before going to Washington. He was particularly
excoriated for being unable to improve the 'Skins run defense but
his replacement,  &UR; Mike Nolan &LR; , &UR;  &LR; did little better last season
(142.2 yards a game under Lynn in 1996, 138.8 in 1997 with Nolan).
This year Washington is 0-6 and its rushing defense is 28th in the
NFL despite paying more than $57 million for free agent defensive
tackles  &UR; Dan Wilkinson  &LR; and  &UR; Dana Stubblefield &LR; . Washington has
allowed an average of 163.2 rushing yards, has forced only three
turnovers, and, worst of all, is dead last in the league in points
allowed per game (31). Maybe Lynn knew more about defense than the
guy who fired him.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Stubblefield claims one reason he signed with the Redskins
instead of with his old friend  &UR; Ray Rhodes  &LR; and the Eagles was that
the facilities were so shoddy in Philadelphia. ``As far as the
weight room goes,'' Stubblefield said, ``I know some players with
bigger ones in their houses. Ray took one look at my facial
expression and knew he had no chance to sign me. I love Ray dearly,
but not that dearly.'' ... Last Sunday at Foxboro Stadium, there
was a ruckus in the crowd in front of the press box that had a new
twist. The instigator was not some sot in the seats but Kansas City
Star sports columnist  &UR; Jason Whitlock &LR; . When security personnel saw
several fans standing up in front of the glass windows that enclose
the press box and tapping on them, they came to quiet the unruly
parties only to find that Whitlock had been holding up hand-drawn
signs designed to irritate the locals. One said, ``Drew Bledsoe is
gay!'' Another said the Patriots stunk, but in stronger language. A
third said it was warm in the press box, which considering the
damp, rainy weather was galling. The security people apprised their
counterparts inside the press box, who confiscated the signs, and a
protest was lodged with Whitlock's boss by the Patriots' PR staff.
The case has reached both the league and the Pro Football Writers
Association. Although the Star has not announced any disciplinary
action, Whitlock's column did not appear in the paper this week ...
Although there has yet to be a breakout day, Patriots line coach
 &UR; Paul Boudreau  &LR; believes the long-chastised running game is
rounding into shape in front of rookie  &UR; Robert Edwards &LR; , who has
gained 94, 97, and 102 yards the past three games. ``The efficiency
of your running game is more important than your average per run,''
Boudreau said. ``Are you moving the chains? People get wrapped up
in yards per carry but if you're averaging 4 yards a carry but
don't get it on third and 2, what does it mean? I'd rather get
those 1- and 2-yard gains when you need them. The other numbers
will come if you stick with it.'' Boudreau said one of the things
he likes most about Edwards is that a good run or a bad one doesn't
change him. ``If he's had a success or a failure on a play, he
doesn't change,'' Boudreau said. ``He's always the same.'' ... When
the new Cleveland Browns appear in the Hall of Fame game next
August in Canton, Ohio, a huge ticket crunch is expected. It won't
help much, but the Hall has made 3,750 tickets available to the
Browns. Normally, each NFL team gets 450.

   &UR;  &LR; There wasn't a single moment, an instant Tim Sweeney could
point to that told him it was time to quit. Sweeney, who retired
from professional hockey a week ago at the age of 31, said it was a
gradual process.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, a Weymouth native, played for nine pro seasons. He
began in 1989-90 after four years at Boston College, spending a
year in Salt Lake of the International League. In 1990-91, he split
his time between Calgary and Salt Lake before joining the US
Olympic team. He played 11 games for Calgary that season before
signing as a free agent with the Bruins in 1992. He played mostly
in Providence in 1992-93, and from there, his career took him to
Anaheim, back to Providence and Boston, and then to the Rangers'
organization last year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, Sweeney said he saw the writing on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of snowballed when there was less and less interest in
my services,'' he said. ``I could've gone to a training camp on a
tryout, but ...''
</P>
<P>
   Turning down an IHL offer that was worth more money but would
have required his family to move, Sweeney accepted a deal to return
to Providence, but his heart wasn't in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought when it came down to it, I could go to Providence,
play well, and maybe get an NHL deal,'' he said. ``But I thought,
`If they didn't sign me all summer, are they really going to sign
me now?'''
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, what made up his mind was his lack of
enthusiasm in Providence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't do it,'' he said. ``I don't always show it, but I'm
an emotional guy. Hockey isn't a 9-to-5 job. If I can't play with
the passion and emotion you need to play, I'm not going to be
successful. I played emotionless games. The thing that got me was I
didn't care if I played a bad game. I can't play hockey that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on his career, Sweeney laughed and said, ``It's
been nine long years, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a rocky career. I spent some good years in the NHL
and some years in the minors. I just couldn't find a niche to be a
regular in the NHL. There were a lot of things involved. I felt my
luck was starting to run out. Providence seemed like the best fit.
It's a tough position for a guy my age. The AHL is basically a
development league. I was playing with guys who were 10 years
younger than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney is exploring his options. He joked that all of his
friends have been in the working world for 10 years and he'll be
picking their brains to figure out what to do next. For now, he's
just getting used to the idea of his hockey career being over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only been a couple of days,'' he said. ``I don't know how
I'm going to react. But I can tell you, I'm not feeling a lot of
stress right now. Right now, it feels like the right decision. A
month from now, it might not feel that way.''

   The arrival of defenseman  &UR; Mathieu Schneider  &LR; on Broadway
increased the Rangers' payroll to $41.64 million, one of the
league's highest. Schneider, who was traded to New York last week
from Toronto for defenseman  &UR; Alexander Karpovtsev  &LR; and a
fourth-round pick in next June's entry draft, was thrilled to back
in the city in which he was born. ``I heard rumors for a while,''
he said. ``I knew New York was talking to us, Carolina was. I think
in the back of my head, I always wanted to come here. This is home.
I hope I can help us get going in the right direction. I've
stressed to (general manager)  &UR; Neil  &LR; ( &UR; Smith &LR; ) that this is where I
want to be for the rest of my career.'' ... The Penguins' financial
problems continue. Not only did they file for bankruptcy, but
Pittsburgh Mayor  &UR; Tom Murphy  &LR; has asked for an investigation into
whether the team's co-owners,  &UR; Roger Marino  &LR; and  &UR; Howard
Baldwin &LR; , &UR;  &LR; could be criminally charged for collecting amusement
taxes and not turning the funds over to the city. Pittsburgh
officials believe the city is owed $900,000 in taxes collected from
last season. In an even more bizarre development, the Penguins won
a backruptcy judge's approval for an emergency loan of $2.5 million
so they could meet their payroll. The source of the loan was
Marino, who plans to charge the team 8 percent interest on the
60-day note. Marino has said the club has lost $37.5 million over
the last two seasons. Murphy is said to be upset that Marino
shopped the Penguins to Houston, Kansas City, Oklahoma City, and
Las Vegas. That prompted both the city and Allegheny County to seek
a court order barring relocation discussions before the team's
lease expires in 2007. Former Penguin  &UR; Mark Recchi &LR; , &UR;  &LR; now in
Montreal, said  &UR; Mario Lemieux &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who sued the club for money he was
owed and has since settled, apparently wasn't the only player
shortchanged. ``There's an agenda there,'' Recchi said. ``I think
the guy wants to move the team. There are seven or eight guys that
are owed money there, not just Mario.'' ... Speaking of financial
messes, New Jersey coach  &UR; Robbie Ftorek  &LR; said he saw plenty of them
during the 1970s when he played in the World Hockey Association.
``I never missed a paycheck and I played for some teams with
financial problems,'' said Ftorek, a Needham native. ``The NHL is a
lot more secure than the WHA was. In the WHA, when teams had
financial problems, that made the guys on that team play better
because if the team disbanded tomorrow, you wanted to make sure you
would get picked up.'' ... New Lightning owner  &UR; Art Williams  &LR; is
nothing if not a hands-on guy. Last week he fired both  &UR; Phil  &LR; and
 &UR; Tony Esposito &LR; , &UR;  &LR; promoting coach  &UR; Jacques Demers  &LR; to GM as well as
bench boss. When his club played the Islanders and lost, Williams,
who is a former football coach, didn't mince any words. ``I talked
to the team Tuesday night,'' he said. ``In football, you run 120
plays a game and four or five will decide the game. Looks to me
like we got too many players on this team that take too many plays
off.'' Williams said that game was only his fourth or fifth, and
that he didn't really know hockey but was going to learn it ...
Flames defenseman  &UR; Phil Housley  &LR; said his reputation for being
selfish and a defensive liability is a mystery to him. ``I don't
know if I ticked someone off when I was younger or what,'' he said.
``Every player who plays the game is going to have a media
perception where there are positives and negatives. I can't figure
it out; I actually think that I am a pretty good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   New Blackhawks coach  &UR; Dirk Graham  &LR; was asked what had changed
since he took over for  &UR; Craig Hartsburg &LR; . ``Personally, I think all
of us coaches are overrated,'' he said. ``We don't have a lot to do
with the outcome of the games.'' ... On Friday night, at Detroit's
home opener, the Red Wings were reunited with coach  &UR; Scotty
Bowman &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is recovering from knee replacement surgery. Bowman
was scheduled to undergo a checkup late last week, which was likely
to determine whether he returns behind the bench or calls it a
career. The players said they were looking forward to spending time
with Bowman, whom they hadn't been around since mid June. ``I'm
sure he's going to be as sarcastic as ever and I'm sure we're going
to hear something about the outstanding preseason we had,'' joked
forward  &UR; Kris Draper &LR; , &UR;  &LR; ``but he deserves to be here. He's a huge
part of the reason why we have won two Stanley Cups.'' ... It's
likely that defensemen  &UR; Gary Suter  &LR; (offseason elbow surgery) and
 &UR; Marcus Ragnarsson  &LR; (broken thumb) will miss tonight's home opener
in San Jose against the Bruins. They are both skating, though, and
appear close to returning ... Country music has embraced the hockey
team in Nashville. Reportedly,  &UR; Garth Brooks  &LR; is a friend of
Predators coach  &UR; Barry Trotz &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and last Wednesday the entire team
was supposed to dine at  &UR; Barbara Mandrell's  &LR; home ... After
starting the season 2-0, the Leafs took a little side trip to the
resort of Banff, Alberta. Included in the three-day stay was
hiking, bowling, and bird-watching ... Former NHL dean of
discipline  &UR; Brian Burke  &LR; was in town for the Bruins' opener against
the St. Louis Blues. Burke has traded the headaches of the league
job for that of general manager of the Canucks. He said he will
trade disgruntled forward  &UR; Pavel Bure  &LR; when and if the right deal
comes along. The other problem is trying to come to terms with
Group 2 free agent  &UR; Bryan McCabe &LR; . ``I told him,'' said Burke,
``either wake up or go get a good TV set.'' ... WEEI's  &UR; Ted
Sarandis  &LR; recently worked an AHL game for Fox Sports New England
with former Bruin assistant coach  &UR; Cap Raeder &LR; . Sarandis was very
impressed with the new Lowell club, which has 14 players who spent
time in the NHL last year, among them former Bruin defenseman  &UR; Dean
Malkoc  &LR; ... 98 days to the All-Star Game.

WATCHING BASEBALL, PLAYING HARDBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The World Series is under way, the final event in what
baseballologists contend has been a dream season, maybe the best
ever.
</P>
<P>
   But when the final pitch is thrown, reality again will set in.
The sport is in serious financial trouble in part because there is
no way to control player salaries or profligate owners. That is
exactly why the NBA is where it is today.
</P>
<P>
   You hear and read a lot about the NBA ``learning'' from
baseball's mistakes in 1994, when a player strike wiped out the
postseason. Yes, the NBA is trying to learn from baseball's
mistakes. But the decade is wrong. They're trying to stop what
happened to baseball in the 1970s, when Marvin Miller drove a pipe
through the owners that still hasn't been dislodged.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa et al did a lot for baseball this year.
But when the season ends, you're still seeing an industry losing
tens of millions. This past year, the American League had
two-thirds of its teams play under .500 for two-thirds of the
season. You had Triple A-level teams masquerading as big leaguers
in small-market cities.
</P>
<P>
   That is what the NBA wants to avoid, and it feels the only way
that can be done is to establish some correlation between salaries
and growth. The former can't outpace the latter, which is now the
case. We're not talking about the reinstitution of indentured
servitude here. Neither side is starving or going to starve when
this is settled.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's impossible to feel sympathy for either side. But
what's unmistakable, at least for now, is the owners' determination
to regain control of the game. Baseball didn't do it in the '70s
and failed again in the '90s, when it lost its showcase event and
then had to return under the same system it was trying to change.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA players are not as strong as their baseball brethren,
and the NBA owners, with David ``Easy Dave'' Stern riding herd,
appear to be more cohesive than the baseball owners. The NBA owners
feel, as Dave Checketts noted this past week, that baseball blew it
by caving in too soon. That won't happen here; the owners feel this
is their last, best, maybe only chance to stop the runaway train,
even if it means missing a season.
</P>
<P>
   The owners aren't making things easy. Checketts's remarks had to
be approved in advance by the NBA. Stern notes that the owners are
not publicly trashing the players, but then submits a proposal to
the union that can only be described as punitive.
</P>
<P>
   The elements from that proposal, the one union chief Billy
Hunter called ``an enormous step back in the process,'' are still
on the table. Among them is a requirement that players with less
than six years service who clear waivers must play in the CBA to
keep their guaranteed money. Meanwhile, the team that waived the
player still keeps his rights.
</P>
<P>
   The theory among some player agents was that the proposal was so
overloaded with horrible things that, once they were removed, then
maybe the proposed economic concessions wouldn't be seen as so bad.
</P>
<P>
   But here's another theory. We're still waiting for Dean ``Mr.
October'' Feerick to deliver his arbitration decision on whether
players with guaranteed contracts should get paid during the
lockout. Any labor lawyer will tell you that is a slam-dunk: They
are not entitled to be paid. Why Feerick has taken a month to
decide this is mind-boggling, unless he either enjoys seeing his
name in the paper or is angry at the NBA for blasting him for the
Latrell Sprewell decision and is making people sweat.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Feerick, as seen in a couple of his rulings
(Sprewell, Dino Radja) is that he wants to please everyone instead
of just making a ruling based on law and principle. It's hard to
see how he can split the baby this time. But it's harder to see how
he could have dragged this out so long, so who knows?
</P>
<P>
   If he rules for the players, the league will appeal (good luck)
and re-challenge Feerick's authority to hear the case. It could
then take a new approach and end the lockout by declaring an
impasse in negotiations (another theory as to why the last NBA
proposal was so wretched) and imposing its own economic system.
Then the teams will open camps and invite the players in, knowing
full well they won't come in and thus will have to strike. End of
paychecks, guys. The union might then vote to decertify and then,
well, you'd have a real mess.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, neither side is helping itself with the public,
which, so far, has shown it cares not a whit. Patrick Ewing may
have uttered the single most ridiculous statement of this entire
affair when he said that the players could not survive with a hard
salary cap. The idea of an NBA middle class is almost oxymoronic
or, rather, moronic, especially when the entry-level salary for
guys who can't even play is almost $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the owners aren't helping matters with proposals they have
to know have no chance and can only serve to inflame the union.
They can't be serious about good-faith bargaining with such a
ludicrous list of demands. Hunter is right. Those proposals look
more like an attempt to break the union than to resolve the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The owners do need a mechanism to keep salaries in line with
revenue growth. The players' response has been that of Paul Gaston:
Just say no. That's fine and admirable, but in this league, if you
do that, you're Denver. Former Nuggets general manager Allan
Bristow got plenty of encouraging calls after he said no to Antonio
McDyess and traded him to Phoenix for three worthless draft picks.
No one was calling him a few months later to say ``good job'' when
he was fired as his team was en route to an 11-win season.
</P>
<P>
   For every owner who says no, there are plenty willing and able
to say yes. The only way that stops is with a level playing field.
That's what the owners want. If they took out all of the garbage
from their last proposal, they might actually get to something that
works.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics released their annual 10-K report to the Securities
and Exchange Commission at the end of last month. It doesn't have
the intriguing gems from last year, such as  &UR; M.L. Carr's  &LR; $1
million golden parachute or  &UR; Rick Pitino's  &LR; $49 million ransom, er,
salary. But the economic news was very, very good. The team made a
profit of more than $12 million, due primarily to a huge increase
in ticket revenue (more sellouts, more expensive seats) and a big
jump in broadcast revenue. Revenue from ticket sales went up 25
percent to more than $39 million while another $28 million came in
from NBC, TNT, WEEI, SportsChannel (now Fox Sports New England),
and Channel 38. Gaston, meanwhile, received a bonus of more than
$324,000 on top of his $1 million salary because profits exceeded a
certain point. The report does offer this caveat: ``If the lockout
extends into the 1998-99 season'' _ which it already has _ ``it
would materially and adversely affect (the team's) financial
condition and results of operations.'' Even worse, the report said,
would be having to cough up guaranteed money to players ...  &UR; Chris
Ford  &LR; is flying to Los Angeles Monday to interview for the vacant
Clippers opening. It's the last opening and, well, it's a job.
Clipper coaches tend to have a shorter life span than a fruit fly.
``I've done my homework,'' said Ford, who has become a volleyball
dad, watching daughter  &UR; Katie  &LR; play for Division 3 powerhouse
Williams. He's also getting hints from the house that he might be
better off employed. ``I've just painted the den,'' he reported.
``There are a lot of projects.'' And he didn't even mention  &UR; Keith
Closs &LR; .

SPLIT DECISION ON TYSON IS OMINOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don King believes the Six Wise Men from Boston will rue the day
they ever met Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   King knows Tyson as well as anyone in the world. He has promoted
him for more than a decade and spent many hours dealing with
Tyson's problems, the bulk of which have been of his own making. So
when he read the former heavy-weight champion's rantings in a
nine-page Playboy interview, he saw nothing unusual. King had heard
it all before.
</P>
<P>
   What he wonders now, on the eve of a relicensing hearing for
Tyson in Las Vegas Monday, is whether the Six Wise Men at
Massachusetts General Hospital who concluded that Tyson was not at
significant risk to repeat the kind of ring behavior that led him
to bite off a chunk of Evander Holyfield's ear saw that Tyson. If
they didn't, he says, they will soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Tyson, brother,'' King said. ``Those psychics (sic)
over in Boston better go back and cover their ass. Their
credibility goes down the toilet if they didn't do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's on a self-destruct course. I love him but I don't want to
get blamed for it any more. I never would have let him do that
interview.''
</P>
<P>
   King is no longer in a position to control such things, because
Tyson has filed a $100 million lawsuit against him, charging King
with stealing his money and violating their promotional agreement.
He has a new armada of lawyers, advisers, and enablers around him,
all of whom portray King as the cause of Tyson's problems. He is
broke because of King, they say. He is suspended because of King,
they say. He is not what people in boxing thought he would become
because of King, they say.
</P>
<P>
   King and the Six Wise Men know better than that.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ronald Schouten, Dr. Thomas Deters, Dr. David Henderson, Dr.
Barry Jordan, Dr. David Medoff, and Dr. Jeremy Schmahmann are six
of the world's most highly trained psychologists and neurologists.
They gathered for four days in Boston last month to evaluate a
convicted rapist, occasional cannibal, and professional
prizefighter to see if he was sane enough to be let loose in a
boxing ring with someone trying to punch him in the nose.
</P>
<P>
   They concluded, according to a report filed with the Nevada
Athletic Commission, that Tyson suffers from ``a constellation of
neurobiological deficits.'' They said he had problems with anger,
impulse control, depression, and self-esteem, he is pessimistic
about the future, is socially isolated, and suffers from ``an
increased risk of impulsivity and poor judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   They said he expressed a wish to harm two of the doctors when he
grew frustrated or embarrassed but did not act on those desires,
which you may conclude was a good thing both for the doctors and
for Tyson. Dr. Schmahmann concluded, ``It was this evaluator's
clinical impression that this incident did not reflect Mr. Tyson's
intent to intimidate but rather that it was an expression of a
fantasy in reaction to the frustration of this evaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson told the doctors he had no one in his life that he trusts
despite the presence of a wife, four children, enough attorneys to
open an international law firm, accountants, bodyguards, and
assorted hangers-on.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors ``strongly recommended'' weekly ``if not more
frequent psychotherapy sessions'' to help him manage his anger and
bouts with depression.
</P>
<P>
   Two said they were ``unable to predict whether or not Mike Tyson
will lose control of his behavior in a future boxing match. He
exhibits neurobehaviorial and emotional deficits that make him
susceptible to this but are by no means predictive of it.''
</P>
<P>
   After all that, they concluded the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the opinion of the evaluation team that Mr. Tyson is
mentally fit to return to boxing, to comply with the rules and
regulations and to do so without repetition of the events of June
28, 1997,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same guy who told Playboy, ``I know I'm going to
blow one day. But I'm going to make sure that when I blow, my kids
are fine. There's not much more of this (expletive) I can take. I'm
going to blow one day. I try very hard, I'm doing a very good job,
sir. I'm doing a very good job. I'm just really angry these days.
Really, really angry. This whole year has been a total retrospect
of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Six Wise Men know a guy with problems but the ability to
cope with them. Don King knows the guy who says ``I'm going to blow
one day.'' What the Nevada Athletic Commission has to decide now is
which one they'll be sending back into a boxing ring.
</P>
<P>
   The bet is they'll try to push and bait Tyson to see if he
explodes. If he doesn't _ and anyone who has seen Tyson con people
over the years, as I have, believes he won't _ he'll get his
license and fight in Las Vegas Dec. 5 in a triumphant return to the
ring that will earn everyone around him millions, including the
IRS. If he doesn't get the license, he'll fight somewhere else
because he needs the money and so do the people around him.
</P>
<P>
   What that fight will earn Tyson is suspect, since he owes so
many people. He owes the government millions in back taxes, he owes
several million (some say $7 million) to Irving Azoff, one of his
new advisers, he owes that armada of lawyers and accountants, he
owes his hangers on, he even owes the Six Wise Men.
</P>
<P>
   If the net from his first fight in 15 months doesn't make him
blow, maybe nothing will, but as New Jersey Athletic Commission
executive director Larry Hazzard watches the circus from afar, he
is both sympathetic and smug toward the commission that once
promised it would decide Tyson's fate in less than a day after he
withdrew a license request in Hazzard's state under pressure and
returned to the scene of the original crime, Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marc (Ratner, executive director of the Nevada Commission) is
a friend of mine, but the thing I'm laughing about is Nevada was a
little angry when Tyson came to New Jersey first,'' Hazzard said.
``They said they wouldn't be like New Jersey. They'd decide that
day. We're still waiting. This guy isn't as easy as he seems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate to see Mike Tyson be the tragic figure of our times
but no matter which way he turns, it seems to be drama after drama.
I hope he comes back and fights and does well. I hope he gets his
license back and nothing else happens. But until he leaves boxing
he's always going to be hustled. You feel it in the pit of your
stomach. Everybody who says they're there to help him is getting
paid. Who's there to help Mike Tyson? Come on. Look at the reality
of Mike Tyson.''
</P>
<P>
   King has seen that reality up close. Maybe the Six Wise Men
have, too, but in their reports, each pointed out somewhere that
Tyson was responding to Holyfield's head butts and the referee's
refusal to do something about them when he became enraged and bit
Holyfield's ear off. One said such overzealousness happens in most
contact sports from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if the Six Wise Men understood boxing as well as they do
mental health they would have known that is fiction. Tyson was an
initiator, not a victim, of head butts. It was his head that came
forward time after time, not Holyfield's.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson has done that all his career, and most of his opponents'
responses have been to retreat and get clipped with a left hook.
Holyfield, however, does not retreat. He comes forward, and because
of his refusal to cower from a charging Tyson, they clashed heads
repeatedly and Tyson got cut. In boxing's world, Tyson cut himself
and he knows it.
</P>
<P>
   He just can't admit it. Isn't that half his problem?
</P>
<P>
   This is a guy who says in Playboy that one thing he'll never do
is commit suicide over his troubles because ``it's not my fault I'm
this way. Write a letter to God. `God, why did you bring this black
convict into the world? Why did you do that, God?' He's the reason
I am what I am. Blame the big boy. Blame God.''
</P>
<P>
   If Tyson ends up following the pattern his first trainer and
father figure once claimed is true of all of us, God won't be
blamed for what Tyson does next.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy born round don't die square,'' Cus D'Amato used to say.
</P>
<P>
   Six Wise Men in Boston better hope D'Amato didn't know more
about the kid he raised than they do about the man he became.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   King and Holyfield signed a bout agreement to take on World
Boxing Council champion  &UR; Lennox Lewis  &LR; in February, finally ending
two years of stalled negotiations for a unification heavyweight
title fight. But nothing is final in boxing until the fists fly,
and problems still exist. As usual, they're on the side of the guy
who keeps claiming everyone is afraid to fight him. Holyfield
agreed to accept $20 million for the fight, which was his original
asking price. Lewis's side has said it will fight for $8 million,
but it's really $10 million because King is buying out Lewis's
promoter's end from  &UR; Dino Duva  &LR; and  &UR; Panos Eliades &LR; . Problem is,
the original agreement included a clause that made Lewis's
promoters responsible for up to $1 million in losses if the
pay-per-view show bombs, and they're balking at that now since they
won't be in charge. They claim that's Time Warner's problem, since
it announced last summer in London that it would put up the
necessary purses to make the match. Time Warner believes it did so
with the assurance that both sides would cover some of the
potential downside if sales lag. King believes it's all baloney,
just another way for Lewis's people to talk big but carry a small
stick. So where do things go now? All sides were negotiating over
the weekend, and it's likely the thing will be resolved, because
after all the talking Lewis's people have done the past two years,
they'd look as phony as  &UR; Howard Cosell's  &LR; toupee if they let $1
million kill the promotion. But King has also said publicly that he
wants no options on Lewis yet Lewis's people claim the first
contract they received after making a verbal commitment to the
fight included a three-fight option. That, too, must go to make the
fight, and fair enough. It's time for both sides to stop arguing
over every nickel and dime and either make the fight or shut up and
move on because, frankly, fight fans are tired of hearing about it
and never seeing it ... HBO's most recent ratings indicate that
boxing is on the upswing in a big way. It has had five straight
double-digit ratings with four different headliners, and its
``Boxing After Dark'' series continues to win its Saturday time
slot against ``Saturday Night Live'' and the  &UR; Howard Stern  &LR; show
...  &UR; Lou Savarese &LR;  is still being held as a possible opponent for
Lewis if the Holyfield fight can't be made. Meanwhile, it seems
likely that Holyfield's World Boxing Association mandatory defense
vs.  &UR; Henry Akinwande  &LR; will be ignored by the organization because
of Akinwande's inability to pass a test for hepatitis B ... How do
you know Tyson will fight somewhere Dec. 5? Cable operators are
holding the date open, for one thing, and under the terms of his
deal with the IRS, he must fight by Dec. 31 or face foreclosure
proceedings on many of his properties.

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Glenn Foley understands New England fans and
New York players very well and knows how friction must rub the two
into heat, but most of all, he remembers Tuna Bowl I last September
in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunday night game, wasn't it?'' asked the former Boston
College quarterback, now with the Jets. ``Most of all, I remember
it was wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley speaks in that Philadelphia-New Jersey accent of his youth
_ much closer to New York's than Boston's _ but he also speaks of
New England fans whom he grew to know at BC.
</P>
<P>
   ``New England fans are great, they're the most unique people in
the world up there,'' he said. ``And I remember that night, they
were raucous and wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Jets and Patriots, Patriots and Jets, Bill Parcells and Bob
Kraft, traitor or genius, chef or grocery-shopper, New England and
New York, too close to each other for comfort, the twain so seldom
meeting, too much, too difficult, too different, too many chips
earned over too many lifetimes on too many shoulders. New York is
big; New England thinks it's better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know them and they know us,'' said Foley. ``We line up
pretty well against each other, and we just go out there and wrack
them and frack them, just to see who's standing at the end. Awww,
it was electric that night. That was one of the most electric
stadiums I've ever been in.''
</P>
<P>
   The only comparison, Foley said, ``is like being in Yankee
Stadium for a playoff game. I went to a playoff game the other
night and you have this electricity in the place, electricity that
you feel as a player and electricity that you don't get in other
stadiums. I've always loved that electricity in Foxboro Stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley remembers New England fans pelting him and Parcells and
the other Jets with verbal abuse ``and you'd think, seeing I played
in Boston, that they'd give me a break, maybe be a little kinder
toward me. But I had those enemy colors on and it was like, `We
don't care who you are.' Everything goes. They're cursing and
screaming at you. Aww, I loved it. It was great. It's one of the
best places in the world to play.''
</P>
<P>
   So this longest of weeks for Glen Foley, the week he was
benched by Parcells, was made even longer because New York's next
game is in New England. Monday night. And Foley _ along with his
dream of once again quarterbacking in Foxboro Stadium _ will be on
the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the game that I had the star next to on the schedule
even before the season,'' said Foley. ``So it's tough that way on
me. Real tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Byars aware
</P>
<P>
   A New York writer was asking Keith Byars if he had noticed a
greater maturity in Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe this season
and the former Patriot demurred, saying that he had seen the
Patriots play ``only a quarter or so of the Denver game and a
little bit last week against Kansas City.'' He said he did not have
enough knowledge to comment.
</P>
<P>
   But when Byars was asked about his memories from Tuna Bowl I,
the words poured forth.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, Byars wanted to say, ``I'm still friendly with a
lot of the guys up there and we already said a lot of things to
each other during the offseason to take care of this week'' when
Patriots and ex-Patriots might deem it wiser not to speak to each
other. ``We've been jabbing back and forth during the offseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Byars said he and New England tackle Bruce Armstrong did some
jabbering. ``Me and Bruce go at each other a lot,'' he said. ``And
Chris Slade, Slade's always saying, `Man, when you were in Miami
we'd beat you,' and `You better be glad you were on our team.' But
now, we're foes again and Slade and I'll be jabbering at each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Byars tried to say Monday night ``will be just another game _
for the most part. I don't have any animosity in my heart toward
anybody in the organization up there. But this is a game we just
have to win. It's a division game and we can't fall behind any more
than we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Byars expects Patriot fans to boo him, ``but I'm not going to
take it personally. I like those Patriot fans but, remember, the
game is for 60 minutes and, in 60 minutes, they might find some
reason to boo me. I can handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``New England holds somewhat of a special place in my heart
because I was one of the guys who helped them, and they helped me,
get to the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Patriots, and former Patriots coaches, are everywhere in
the Jets' complex at Hofstra University, and this situation causes
an identity crisis on all sides _ players and media alike. Ask
Byars about Tuna Bowl I and he replies, ``It was a fun game to
play, and a great game to win,'' and he says that while sitting in
a New York locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game was probably as close as you can get to a playoff
game in the regular season,'' recalled Byars of New England's
overtime victory. ``The buildup and the hoopla _ all this in Week
3, and I'm saying, `We still have 13 weeks to go.' You know, `Calm
down.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was overhyped, but, as it turned out, it was a
good experience for some of the young guys on the team, the ones
who didn't go to the Super Bowl. They learned what a crazy week can
be like. You know, pressure similar to a Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   And Byars added, sitting in that Jets locker room, ``It was a
great learning experience for both teams, us and the Jets.''
</P>
<P>
   That identity crisis again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this one as being just as big,'' said Byars, ``but being
that we're at each other for a third time, it might die down a
little bit. It can be old news after a while, you know. I mean, how
much can (Patriots fans) say they hate a guy?''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches' perspective
</P>
<P>
   That ``guy'' himself, Bill Parcells, said he doesn't expect this
game to be as overhyped as last year's. The Jets' coach said he
senses that ``it's not as big as it was last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why, really, so much was made of last year's
game. I really don't,'' Parcells said with a straight face. His
return ``was newsworthy, but it's not relevant,'' he added. ``I can
tell this year is much less. This year, it's about the players
playing in the game, and that's the way it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the first question to Pete Carroll about
Parcells this season came after weeks of camp, five weeks of
exhibition games, and untold gatherings with the media. The
question came on Thursday, Sept. 3, prior to the Patriots opener
against the Broncos, when a Denver beat writer asked the Patriots
coach about the former Patriots coach. Carroll momentarily was at a
loss for words, saying, ``That's the first time I've been asked
that since last year,'' and then he gave a bland answer.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after speaking more of his mind to a Newark
Star-Ledger sportswriter about Parcells (``He's full of it''),
Carroll quickly backtracked, telling Jets beat writers, ``The
rivalry has enough going for it and enough to it that I'm not
commenting on any of that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Jets safety Victor Green, never a Patriot himself (there are
actually some of those in the New York locker room), was asked
about the return of Curtis Martin to Foxborough, added to the
return of Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be like a bomb,'' said Green with a laugh. ``Something's
going to go off. But it's going to be a good one, you know? What
with Parcells and a lot of guys who played for Bill with the
Patriots, just that itself, and last year started something, and
along with it being a Monday night game, it'll be a lot of hype.
It's going to be a game to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said the atmosphere won't be too much for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like games like this,'' said the Jet. ``I like playing in
games like this, what with national television, and playing against
your big rival. But we can't let it being a Monday night, and all
those guys playing against guys who used to be on their team, keep
us from doing our thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive lineman Mike Gisler _ yes, another Jet who once was a
Patriot _ was on the New England side of the rivalry last year. And
when asked what his most vivid memory of Tuna Bowl I was, Gisler
responded, ``That we won _ in the end. And then that blocked kick
we had just before the end (of regulation).''
</P>
<P>
   That identity crisis again.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, said Gisler, ``I remember that there was a lot of
hype for a game that was crucial for that time of year, but not
critical. Guys (on the Patriots) took it differently. Some guys
were hyped up and some guys couldn't care less. But I think
everybody felt that excitement in the air. You know, it was our old
coach and obviously there were guys here who had left New England
and gone there. So, I remember there was a greater sense of
anticipation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gisler, like Martin, like Byars, said he was looking forward to
going back.
</P>
<P>
   He has talked to his former teammates on the New England
offensive line, such as Max Lane and especially center Dave
Wohlabaugh, ``and right now neither Dave nor I are saying a whole
lot. You know, you have to be careful what you say. But normally,
we talk about how each of us is playing _ we play a lot of the same
teams _ and I'll see something on film that he's done and he'll see
our game on film and we'll talk about personnel on other teams.
He'll give me pointers about how to play them and I'll give him
pointers.''
</P>
<P>
   But not this week.

GRIER PICKY, AND IT PAYS OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Monday night, Bill Parcells will get to see some of
the groceries he wasn't able to shop for. They are mostly Bobby
Grier's groceries, though some of them came courtesy of Parcells,
who upon leaving the Patriots also brought them valuable draft
picks in compensation.
</P>
<P>
   At draft time, Grier took some criticism from draft gurus and
scouts who said he didn't make the best of a great situation. But
those who gave Grier average or below-average grades may be
reconsidering.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Grier recommended to Patriots owner Bob Kraft
that he hire Pete Carroll, who has emerged as a very good coach,
finishing 10-6 in a tumultuous first year and losing in the second
round of the playoffs by 1 point.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll's team enters Monday night's nationally televised game
against the Jets at 4-1, with a four-game winning streak and on the
heels of a near-perfect 40-10 win over the Kansas City Chiefs, whom
many selected to be in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Grier, the Patriots' vice president of player personnel, seems
to have made some wise draft choices, as well. Running back Robert
Edwards is off to an excellent start. The other No. 1 pick, Tebucky
Jones, may get some playing time soon, while second-rounder Tony
Simmons, a receiver from Wisconsin, is scheduled to get his baptism
in the pro ranks, taking over for the injured Vincent Brisby.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Chris Canty, last year's maligned No. 1 pick, is
starting and has improved; free safety Chris Carter is now in the
nickel and dime packages; three huge offensive linemen have become
true backups, able to come into games and play; fullback Chris
Floyd has been impressive on special teams and is being used more
to spell Tony Carter; Brandon Mitchell is in a regular rotation at
defensive tackle; and Greg Spires, who has showed excellent
quickness as a pass rusher in camp, recorded his first sack last
week.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, Grier has drafted decent players who have
made contributions and appear to be on the upside, working toward
becoming starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage we've played five games,'' said Grier. ``The
thing I wanted to see was them to develop and come along and be
ready to play. It might happen a lot sooner than we expected. They
were going to play sooner or later, and to me that's what matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought Simmons would take a while, but we thought he'd
come along quicker and he did that in camp. We know he has
tremendous hands and tremendous speed. The thing he had to learn
was route running. There are certain routes you don't want him to
run, but there are some he runs very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier defends his pick of Jones and doesn't agree that he is
behind schedule. He said he never thought Jones would be ready to
start the season as the right corner, against the big receivers in
the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (hamstring) injuries really slowed him down,'' said Grier.
``In our rookie minicamp he really started to come. I think we wore
him down in that first camp, when he had the first pull. We brought
him back and he had the other pull, so the injuries have set him
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, Tebucky's situation is very similar to Ty Law's when we
drafted him. It took Ty about seven games to break into the lineup.
To be honest it's happening a lot sooner than we expected in both
cases. I'd like to see it happen if he's ready. If he's not ready
to play _ regardless of size of receiver _ he'll just get
frustrated. He'll determine when he's ready himself by how he
performs in practice. In the last week and a half, he's had great
practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier says the situation with Carroll has turned out even better
than hoped. Grier and Kraft knew they had lost one of the greatest
coaches in NFL history, so anyone they brought in would pale by
comparison and be put under microscopic scrutiny. Carroll has
handled it well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the team has taken Pete's character in terms of
defense,'' said Grier. ``We're much more aggressive. Sizewise we
might be the same. We're quicker and more aggressive. That's the
big difference. For Pete's system and what he wants to do, this is
what works for us.''

Scheduling presents a different headache for NBA
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
So, you think the NBA has problems now.
</P>
<P>
   Just wait until the lockout ends. That's when the problems
really begin.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when the league gets down to the business of doing
business, there will be issues to address. Players will have to be
signed, trades will have to be made and when all that is finished,
the league can get on with its schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But what will that schedule look like?
</P>
<P>
   Television and travel commitments dictate games will have to be
picked up from whatever point in the season the schedule resumes.
That means there will be an imbalance in the total number of games
and the division of home and road games for teams throughout the
NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, like every other NBA team, play 82 games _ 41 at
home and 41 on the road. When the league canceled the first two
weeks of the season, the Rockets lost seven of those games, three
at home and four road games.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers, who also had seven games lopped off
their schedule, lost five road games, including much of their only
East Coast swing.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland lost eight games, four each at home and on the road.
Minnesota, which is trying to build itself into contention, had
only six games erased, four of which _ road games against Phoenix,
Seattle and the Lakers and a home game against New York _ would
have been hard to win.
</P>
<P>
   Former Laker Nick Van Exel, traded to Denver before the lockout
went into effect, tried to look at the bright side of the scrambled
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be good for us,'' said Van Exel, whose Nuggets lost
six games. ``We might only play two games, be 2-0 and make the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it might work in the Nuggets' favor. The fewer games, maybe
the better for us. That's what I'm banking on.''
</P>
<P>
   He was joking, but Van Exel touched on a serious point _ an
imbalanced schedule could have a large impact on playoff seedings.
</P>
<P>
   One idea being bandied about is a 56-game schedule, in which
each team plays another twice, on a home-and-home basis, which
would represent a big sacrifice in home-game revenue for the
owners.
</P>
<P>
   But putting together a longer season would be difficult,
according to NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that we really don't have a lot of
flexibility,'' Granik said. ``Most of our arenas are booked most of
the time so you really can't make up any of the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we look at it, these two weeks, while you might be able to
make up a game here or there, or make some adjustments if we
somehow made a deal within the next week or so (it would be
difficult to make up the games).
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't lose every single game (in the canceled two
weeks), you're going to pretty much lose most of them. That means
we probably have lost about one-twelfth of our regular season and
that amounts to about $85 million in lost players' salaries. I
don't think that will ever be made up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can make up a game here or there, you might make up a
few dollars of it, but for the most part, I believe it is lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer? Nobody's quite sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the main thing is that they're going to have to come
up with some sort of arrangement where everybody plays 75 games, 62
games or whatever,'' said San Antonio's Avery Johnson. ``Whatever
it is, everybody has to play the same number of games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have to give every team an ample amount of time
to get their rosters filled in a way that it can be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' Robert Horry offered one solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I can see them doing is (reviewing the schedule to see)
where sometimes you're going to play teams four times, they might
trim that down to three,'' Horry said. ``Say you've got a Jan. 15
game against the Timberwolves, and you're scheduled to play them
four times (even with the shortened schedule).
</P>
<P>
   ``They could cancel that game. They could take the remaining
four-game series and make them three-game (series). That way they
can try and get the schedule evened out. I guess that's the only
thing they can do.''

BRUINS BLAME MISSED CHANCES, NOT RULINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE _ They were hard-luck losers to the Los Angeles Kings
Friday night, dropping a 2-1 overtime decision in their final visit
to the Great Western Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson learned for the Bruins? There were two, really. The
first is that the video replay officials giveth and they taketh
away. In Colorado last Wednesday, Chris Drury was in the crease for
an Avalanche goal that would have cut Boston's lead in half. The
goal was nullified and the Bruins went on to win, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Kings, the Bruins had two goals disallowed, both in
the second period. Rob DiMaio's was disallowed because Chris
Taylor's left skate was in the crease. It was Taylor's brother Tim
who had his left skate in the crease to nullify P.J. Axelsson's
overtime goal against Washington in last season's playoffs. The
Capitals went on to win the game and the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That crease rule,'' said DiMaio, shaking his head. ``It always
seems to include our line for some reason. It's a frustrating rule
sometimes. It's great when it goes your way and it's awful when it
doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Allison's goal was not allowed because defenseman Steve
Duchesne intentionally dislodged the net as Allison was shooting.
According to Allison, the officials had blown the whistle before
the puck went into the net. If that's the case, it appears they did
so in error. The rule states that the whistle is supposed to be
blown after the offending team gains possession of the puck. That
never happened.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson No. 2: If you play lousy for the first two periods and
then well in the third, chances are those 40 minutes of lethargy
will come back to haunt you.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns took a ``you-can't-cry-over-spilled-milk''
philosophy regarding the result, the Bruins' first loss in four
games this season. Next up are the Sharks tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Don) Sweeney's pass gets on (Sergei) Samsonov's stick,
we're talking victory,'' he said. ``They picked it off, (Luc)
Robitaille shot the puck, they won the game. Don't point fingers,
don't blame anybody, that's the way it is. On to the next town.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a bitter disappointment for goalie Byron Dafoe, who has
been the team's best player so far. Dafoe said he was jazzed up to
play his former team and he held the Bruins in it for two periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no momentum in that game either way,'' he said.
``The second period, we had two goals disallowed and we couldn't
seem to get anything going out there. It's just unfortunate,
Robitaille gets a break down the wing and puts it in the net. If we
get one break, we win the hockey game, but we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe said he wasn't sure what happened on Robitaille's goal,
scored from long range with 2:13 remaining in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grant (Ledyard) kind of tried to block it,'' he said. ``I
thought it was a little bit of a two-on-one, maybe a two-on-two, so
I might have been cheating a little bit. I was surprised that Luc
shot it but he put it in the corner, right where it had to go.''

MUCH WORK TO DO BEFORE SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They know about amateur greatness, but not professional
happiness. And that did not change at the recent LPGA Tour
Qualifying School.
</P>
<P>
   Kelli Kuehne was the most notable failure during the proceedings
at LPGA International in Daytona Beach, Fla. _ but she had company.
Marisa Baena met with disappointment, as did Silvia Cavalleri and
Vicki Goetze-Ackerman, but Kuehne is the name that jumps out.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Kuehne was a two-time US Women's Amateur champion
who left the University of Texas early, carrying a bagful of Nike
money and riding a wave of claims that she was the female Tiger
Woods. One year ago, Kuehne was finishing tied for fifth at Q
School to gain her Tour card in her first try, proof that she was
as good as advertised, supporters said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kuehne, 21, is probably looking at the Futures Tour,
thanks to a 74-78-76 in Daytona Beach, a poor finish to an
uninspiring rookie campaign. She played in 24 LPGA Tour events in
1998 and missed the cut 13 times. With just $39,831 in earnings,
the youngster from the golf-rich family in McKinney, Texas (her
brother Hank recently won the US Men's Amateur and older brother
Trip lost in the 1994 final to Woods) was forced back to Q School,
where pro golf continued to humble her.
</P>
<P>
   Baena, for one, can relate. She lost to Kuehne in the 1996
Amateur final and is a former NCAA champion. After this year's
Amateur, Baena said she was leaving the University of Arizona to
turn pro and Q School figured to be the first step of a promising
career. Not quite, for the charismatic player from Colombia shot
75-67-75-78 at LPGA International and earned only non-exempt status
for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   That's the category into which Cavalleri and Goetze-Ackerman
fall, too.
</P>
<P>
   Cavalleri, the Italian who surprised the experts by winning the
US Women's Amateur at Brae Burn CC in West Newton in 1997, matched
par just once in four rounds at Q School after tuning up on the
European women's circuit this year.
</P>
<P>
   As for Goetze-Ackerman, it seems so long ago that she was the
rage. There were US Women's Amateur victories in 1989 and 1992
(over Brandie Burton and Annika Sorenstam, no less) as well as an
NCAA championship while she starred at the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But amateur accolades have not turned into professional dollars
_ Goetze-Ackerman has been 82d, 77th, 56th, and 95th on the money
list, and when she plummeted to 171st this year ($12,049 in 24
events), it was back to Q School.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after shooting 72-75-74-76, Goetze-Ackerman, though only
26, is staring at a professional comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Given her taste of success, that may seem upsetting, but if
Goetze-Ackerman should need comforting, perhaps she can seek out
another former US Women's Amateur winner _ Laura Baugh. She will be
44 next May, but the mother of seven is still chasing the
professional success that she once seemed destined for.
</P>
<P>
   At Daytona Beach, Baugh shot 69-72-74-75 and _ like Baena,
Cavalleri, and Goetze-Ackerman _ gained non-exempt status for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   For  &UR; Geoff Sisk &LR; , the scenario is clear-cut: win the Nike Tour
Championship and earn a PGA Tour card. The 33-year-old Marshfield
resident heads out Monday for Semmes, Ala., and the final event of
the year, which is reserved for the Top 50 on the money list (Sisk
is 35th at $70,694).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of highs, but a lot of lows,'' said Sisk of
his first full year of playing pro golf since the 1991 Hogan Tour.
``It's been frustrating and your patience wears thin. Looking back,
I don't think I budgeted my time well enough and I got tired at the
end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, though he had a strong tournament in Moreno Valley,
Calif., two weeks ago, shooting three rounds in the 60s to finish
tied for fifth. He then had a chance to end a five-week stretch on
the road and spend time with his wife and 10-month-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   But it's back to business this week, and while the $54,000 top
prize would vault him into Top 15 territory (and earn him a coveted
PGA Tour card for 1999), Sisk is setting sights on a more realistic
goal. ``If I play well, I could get into the Top 25,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That may not sound like much, but to golfers like Sisk, Top 25
carries a precious prize _ an exemption into the final stage of PGA
Tour Qualifying School. ``Avoiding that second stage would be a big
deal,'' said Sisk. ``That's such a grind.''
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, Sisk has secured his Nike Tour card for 1999 and a
spot in the field for the second stage of Q School.
</P>
<P>
   Sisk's good friend and roommate on the Nike road,  &UR; Kevin
Johnson &LR;  of Pembroke, finished 62d on the money list and is tuning
up for another go-round at Tour School. Johnson will tee it up at
the Country Club of South Carolina during the first week of
November.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   With Woods, there's always something to report. Word is out that
he has extended his association with IMG but dumped  &UR; Hughes Norton &LR; 
as his agent. A graduate of the Harvard Business School, Norton is
given credit for putting together Woods's blockbuster deals with
Nike and Titleist, but apparently his relationship with the golfer
soured in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Norton was not in Scotland for the recent Dunhill Cup, but the
golf world certainly had to take note of Woods's debut at St.
Andrews. It was, to say the least, overwhelming, and if it was any
indication of what is to come in 2000 when the British Open returns
there, they can probably start inscribing his name on the Claret
Jug.
</P>
<P>
   In weather that ranged from perfect to horrendous (in other
words, typical British Open weather), Woods was near-flawless. He
was 14 under in four trips around the Old Course, a whopping seven
shots better than his nearest competitor, which happened to be his
good friend  &UR; Mark O'Meara &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it was team competition and the field was not
deep, &UR;  &LR; but Woods showed both immense power (he drives the par-4s at
9, 12, and 18) and the deft touch needed to negotiate the mounds
and swales that distinguish the sacred grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only glimpse you got of the Dunhill Cup was Woods
burying his head in his hands after missing a 4-footer for birdie
at the 18th hole. It resulted in a stunning upset loss to  &UR; Santiago
Luna &LR;  as Spain shocked the US team, 2-1, and led the media to do
what they generally do _ treat Woods's miscues too harshly. As if
he's the only golfer who ever missed an important 4-footer.
</P>
<P>
   The bogey at 17 and the three-putt par at 18 were probably the
only shortcomings in his marvelous 72 holes at St. Andrews (for
comparison,  &UR; Ernie Els  &LR; was even par in those same four rounds).
The image of Woods on that 18th green should not overshadow this
reality: If he is on his game, no one will challenge Woods at St.
Andrews, where the driver can stay in his hand all day.
</P>
<P>

   You think they have some kids who can play a little down there
on Cape Cod?  &UR; Bob Kingman  &LR; can vouch for the amount of talent. He's
the golf coach at Barnstable High School, and last week a unique
dilemma fell into his lap: Three members of his team went to Las
Vegas to take part in the Oldsmobile Scramble, a wildly popular
national event that pairs a club pro with three amateurs.  &UR; Jesse
Schectman &LR; , &UR; Tyler Gold &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Pat Rogers &LR; , &UR;  &LR; playing with  &UR; Mike
Boden &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the first assistant at Hyannis Golf Club, had earned their
spot in qualifying last month, but the decision to go to Vegas was
not an easy one. Kingman told the boys there was a good chance the
MIAA would take action against them, though the coach conceded he
did not object to their decision to go. ``There's certainly a lot
of benefits,'' said Kingman. ``There are college coaches watching
and there's not much recognition at the state level. I'm a firm
believer in taking advantage of everything you can.'' It meant
replacing his third, seventh, and eighth players. No problem, not
when the pool of juniors numbers 250 at Olde Barnstable Fairgrounds
alone. Kingman brought up  &UR; Josh Coffey &LR; , &UR; Lucas Tierney &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Tim
Moynihan  &LR; from the JV and what happens? Moynihan, a sophomore,
shoots 37 for medalist honors and leads the team to victory over
New Bedford. Then, in the next match, Kingman's club remained
undefeated by dealing Silver Lake its first loss. The only blemish
for Barnstable is the news handed down by the MIAA earlier in the
week _ Schectman, Gold, and Rogers can play in the remaining
matches, but not in the State Championship Oct. 29 ... Speaking of
Cape golfers,  &UR; Michael Carbone  &LR; of Brewster and  &UR; Kenneth Lewis  &LR; of
Dennis, along with  &UR; Hans Sherman  &LR; of Chestnut Hill, were honorable
mentions to the annual American Junior Golf Association
All-American team ... Thirty lucky souls who this year made the
ultimate golf shot, the hole-in-one, were to get a chance at $1
million in the second installment of a Dunkin' Do-nuts promotion.
Held Saturday at the Easton Family Golf Center, the event featured
three shots for each player from 165 yards; the payoff goes from
$50,000, to $100,000, to a cool million on the third round. The
group of players included  &UR; Todd Obuchowski &LR; , who made arguably the
most talked-about ace of this or any other year. At Beaver Brook in
Haydenville, Obuchowski overshot the 116-yard fourth hole, but his
ball hit a passing car driven by  &UR; Nancy Bachand &LR;  and ricocheted
back into the hole. The bizarre shot earned him a guest spot with
 &UR; Jay Leno  &LR; on ``The Tonight Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   When  &UR; Frank Vana Jr. &LR;  failed to make it into match play at the
recent US Mid-Amateur Championship, it sealed MGA Player of the
Year honors for  &UR; Justin Peters &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is a fifth-year senior at the
University of Nevada-Reno. Peters won the Horn-blower Memorial in
May, was low amateur in the State Open (where he finished fifth),
and qualified for the US Public Links Championship ... The first
MGA Senior Player of the Year award was won by  &UR; Ed Fletcher &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who
is getting better with age. He won the New England Senior Amateur
two weeks ago at Metacomet, then came back a few days later to win
the MGA Senior Championship at Eastward Ho! ... Lewis earned Junior
Player of the Year honors ... Longtime MGA official  &UR; Ray
Bump &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who deserves most of the credit for bringing the USGA
Public Links Championship to Massachusetts (Stow Acres) in 1995, is
recuperating at Braintree Hospital Rehabilitation. Few have
championed the public player's cause more ardently. Cards and well
wishes would be appreciated ... As it did to alleviate
oversubscription to its Four-ball Championship, the MGA has taken
steps to allow more players a chance at the coveted State
Mid-Amateur Championship. Next year, two qualifying rounds will be
held in September, pushing the championship back to early October.
The age limit will be dropped from 35 to 30 (it is 25 for the
national Mid-Am) ... The MGA also announced that all of its events
in 1999 will be spikeless ... The 64th New England Intercollegiate
Golf Championship tees off Monday at New Seabury in Mashpee, with
48 schools represented. The University of Rhode Island is favored
to repeat its 1997 title;  &UR; Bill Link &LR;  of Holy Cross is the
defending individual champ ... Prestigious honors went to Boston
College students  &UR; Matthew Kelly &LR;  and  &UR; Pat Dunn &LR;  at the recent
annual meeting of the Francis Ouimet Scholarship Fund. Kelly, a
senior, was presented the first Eddie Lowey Award for the top
Ouimet Scholar who is also a caddie, while Dunn, a junior who stars
for the BC team, was named the first winner of the Billy Maich
Award.

KWAN LEFT OUT IN COLD AT SKATE AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Why is Michelle Kwan being kept out of next week's Skate
America event in Detroit? Because the International Skating Union
is trying to keep Olympic-eligible skaters from deserting the Grand
Prix circuit for the ISU's own easy-money open events.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan, who has already won two opens against pros this fall and
skated in a third in San Jose last night, hadn't signed up for this
season's Grand Prix, which was already hurting because Tara
Lipinski, Chen Lu, and Surya Bonaly all have turned pro. The
reason: Kwan's programs weren't ready and she wasn't sure which
Grand Prix events she'd be assigned. So when Kwan wanted to defend
her Skate America title, which she has won thrice, the ISU turned
thumbs down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really looking forward to being there,'' Kwan said.
``But life goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Skate America still has a bunch of marquee names: former US
champ Nicole Bobek, world medalist Maria Butyrskaya, three-time
world champ Elvis Stojko, and current title-holder Alexei Yagudin.
But it's silly of the ISU to punish the only top female star who is
staying eligible for the next Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the US Figure Skating Association scrubbed the
three-year, million-dollar contract it had with Lipinski after the
Olympic gold medalist ducked the Daytona Beach open earlier this
month. Lipinski hasn't competed against Kwan since Nagano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skaters have to do what's good for them,'' Kwan shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Add Bonaly to the list of skaters for this week's ``Evening With
Champions'' benefit at Harvard's Bright Center, which includes
Yagudin and fellow world champs  &UR; Elena Berezhnaya  &LR; and  &UR; Anton
Sikharulidze &LR; , &UR;  &LR; plus former Olympic gold medalist  &UR; Oksana Baiul
 &LR; and silver medalist  &UR; Paul Wylie &LR; . Bonaly will skate Saturday night
only. For tickets call 617-493-8172 ... At least the US men's
basketball team won't have to go to Guadalajara next summer to
qualify for the Olympics. The Mexican organizers backed out after
the government couldn't subsidize the event, so the international
federation is looking for a new venue. If FIBA wants to make sure
the Americans make it to Sydney, it'll give them home (or at least
Canadian) cookin'. The larger issue for USA Basketball is who'll be
on the team. The NBA lockout cost the Yanks the gold medal at this
summer's world championship and deprived them of an automatic
Olympic bid. Should they stick with the Dream Teamers? Or go with a
guaranteed, but lesser, melange of overseas pros, CBAers, and
collegians? USA Basketball will ponder the decision at next month's
annual meeting ... Look for the USOC to outsource its drug-testing
program in the future to boost its international credibility. ``We
think we have a very good doping control program, but we're the
only country in the world to have to do the testing ourselves,''
says executive director  &UR; Dick Schultz &LR; . ``Other countries look at
us and say it's like having the fox in the henhouse with the
chickens.'' ... Los Angeles, which hasn't hosted the US figure
skating championships since 1954, will stage the 2002 event, which
will double as the Olympic trials. Site will be the Staples Center,
which opens next autumn and will house the Lakers, Clippers, and
Kings ... That familiar face on the halfpipe this winter will be
former Olympic luger  &UR; Duncan Kennedy &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has gotten serious
about snowboarding after giving up sliding. Kennedy, who retired
from luging last winter after brain-stem bleeding made him dizzy
and nauseated, has quit as coach of the US junior luge team to
indulge his fascination with the slopes.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Auspicious start for Brookline's  &UR; Dan Weinstein &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who grabbed a
silver medal at the recent World Cup short-track speedskating meet
in Saratoga Springs. Weinstein, who made the Olympic team at 16
last winter, ended up fifth in the overall standings ... Plenty of
frequent-flier miles this fall for Wellesley attorney  &UR; Paul
George &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the US representative on the International Olympic
Committee's evaluation commission checking out sites for the 2006
Winter Games. George, who was the US chef de mission at the Nagano
Games last winter, is making three trips to Europe, where all the
bidders are ... Yes, the  &UR; Elfi Eder  &LR; who is Grenada's one-woman ski
team is the same woman who won the 1994 Olympic silver in slalom
for Austria. Eder, who sat out last season because she was feuding
with her federation, went country-shopping and ended up in the
Caribbean ... US women's field hockey coach  &UR; Pam Hixon &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who
resigned recently after five years at the helm, was a victim of
unrealistic expectations. Though the federation believed that the
Americans should have done better than eighth (of 12) at last
spring's quadrennial World Cup after winning bronze in 1994, the
team was still in post-Olympic rebuilding mode after losing more
than half of a squad that had been together for six years. With
another year to develop the newcomers before the Pan American Games
(the next qualifying opportunity), odds are Hixon would have gotten
the team a ticket to Sydney ... Encouraging performance by
comebacking former champ  &UR; Lance Armstrong &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who placed fourth in
both the road race and time trial at the recent world road cycling
championships in the Netherlands. ``I think I can win again,'' said
Armstrong, who was diagnosed with testicular cancer two years ago.
Armstrong posted the best finish for the Americans;  &UR; Mari Holden
 &LR; was seventh in the women's time trial.

PERU AND ECUADOR AGREE TO PUT BORDER DISPUTE IN OUTSIDERS' HANDS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ After emotional debates, the Congresses
of Peru and Ecuador have agreed to give the United States, Brazil
and two other nations the power to impose a solution on South
America's longest-running border dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations have tried war, once in the early 1940s and
again in 1995, and negotiation, but have been unable to agree on
who should have a 49-mile stretch of the Condor Mountains that lies
between them.
</P>
<P>
   The votes passed overwhelmingly Friday night in both countries
just as President Alberto Fujimori of Peru and his Ecuadorian
counterpart, Jamil Mahuad, headed for the Eighth Iberian-American
summit meeting in Oporto, Portugal. There they were to meet with
leaders and representatives of the four nations helping seek the
accord _ the other two are Argentina and Chile _ to formally
deliver the votes of their Congresses and to chart their next
moves.
</P>
<P>
   Casualties from the brief 1995 war ran into the hundreds; the
hostility over the border has also been the pretext for a sizable
arms buildup that neither nation can afford. The heavily fortified
frontier, now closed, has divided Indian tribes who once lived
there. Those visiting kin must now travel for days through river
networks via Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual decision in both capitals to allow the guarantor
nations to impose definitive borders indicates how intractable the
problem remains. At a meeting here last year, the two countries
agreed to a strict timetable for confidence-building measures and
settling of disputes, and there was even talk of turning the entire
contested area into an international nature reserve.
</P>
<P>
   But the heart of the contention, the border markings, has eluded
solution. The two presidents eventually appealed to President
Clinton and the other guarantors, who said they would help only if
the Congresses in both Ecuador and Peru agreed to abide by their
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Though legislators overwhelmingly agreed to turn the guarantors
into arbiters, debates in both capitals revolved around martyrs,
national sovereignty and the nature of democracy. As the Congresses
convened Thursday afternoon, demonstrators turned out in both
capitals calling for ``peace with dignity,'' and legislators in
both countries said _ perhaps inauspiciously _ that they expected
final borders favoring their side.
</P>
<P>
   In Quito, Ecuador, Gen. Paco Moncayo, chief of the armed forces,
told Congress there was no other way to resolve the dispute and
presented a letter signed by top military leaders backing that
view. Jaime Nebot, a party leader who had lost the presidential
election to Mahuad in July, also supported the move Friday, saying
it was time for Congress ``to assume responsibilities and make
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Those opposing the vote labeled it a surrender of national
sovereignty. Carlos Ferrero, a Peruvian legislator whose cousin,
Eduardo Ferrero Costa, had resigned his post as foreign minister
over the proposal, called for a popular referendum to approve any
borders that the guarantor nations present. ``To try to close the
border by punching a hole in democracy is an error as dangerous as
can be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Chirinos Soto, a columnist for a Peruvian daily,
Cambio, called the congressional vote a ``jump into the void,''
since the Congresses had no idea what they were ultimately
accepting.

 &HT;    Taking a look inside college football
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the other guy gets 600 yards, has his offense on the field
for 30 more plays, and you still win the game, there are reasons.
Bob Casulo, Georgia Tech's special teams coach, was celebrating one
of those reasons after Saturday's 41-38 win over No. 7 Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching special teams isn't glamorous work, but if you do it
long enough, you'll eventully have your moments to shine. Casulo
and his troops had several sterling performances Saturday evening:
</P>
<P>
   _ Charlie Rogers, who returned a punt 54 yards for a touchdown
and set up a field goal with a 21-yard return. All total, the
senior from Cliffwood, N.J., returned six punts for 117 yards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Georgia Tech's kick coverage teams, which held Virginia to
just 9 yards on two punt returns and just 30 yards on two kickoff
returns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Punter Rodney Williams, who averaged 45.4 yards on five kicks
(with a long of 54), and boomed several kickoffs deep into the end
zone.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Yellow Jackets kickoff return team, which had five chances
for 96 yards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Field goal kicker Brad Chambers, whose 47-yard field goal in
the fourth quarter was his career-long.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: All those return yards gained (213 on punts and
kickoff returns) and returned yards saved by good coverage add up
in a game like this.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew our guys had a chance to play a big part in this game,
and boy did they play great tonight,'' Casulo said. ''I can't tell
you how proud I am of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rogers, whose work kept Tech in the game while the defense
struggled: ''There's all kinds of ways to win games and we knew our
return teams were going to have to step up,'' he said. ''And we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those most appreciative of the work of Casulo's Crew was
head coach George O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   ''Special teams were huge for us tonight,'' he said. ''When
you're struggling to stop people, you have to get it done in other
facets of the game. I really like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Others sights, sounds, and observations from Tech's memorable
victory:
</P>
<P>
   _ The comparisons to Georgia Tech's win over Virginia by the
same score in 1990 were many. That game, played in Charlottesville,
Va., was also the last time Tech fans tore the goalposts down after
a victory. Tech students, so excited that the Jackets had knocked
off the No. 1 Cavaliers, broke into a closed Bobby Dodd Stadium and
ripped down the goalposts. Then they started a bonfire on campus.
The goalposts, which cost about $7,000 each, were last seen at a
fraternity house.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tech quarterback Joe Hamilton may never know how close he came
to being pulled from Saturday's game. Hamilton came back after
sitting out a series with a slightly-sprained knee in the second
quarter but it was clear the junior was hobbled. Once Tech fell
behind 38-17 in the third quarter, O'Leary began thinking about
getting Hamilton off the field. ''If we couldn't get back into the
game, I wasn't going to let him stay out there and get beat up,''
O'Leary said. But six minutes later Delaunta Cameron returned a
fumble 34 yards for a touchdown and Tech had new life. And so did
Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   _ It won't become official until Monday morning, but expect ESPN
to bring its College Game Day show back to the state of Georgia for
the second time in two weeks. Next week's game with Florida State
is a 7 p.m. telecast on ESPN. The Game Day set will be down in the
southwest corner of Bobby Dodd Stadium. Chris Fowler, Lee Corso and
Kirk Herbstreit were in Athens on Oct. 10 for the Georgia-Tennessee
game.
</P>
<P>
   _ Trailing by three in the final seconds, Virginia drove to the
Tech 24 and had a chance to win or tie. Coach George Welsh wanted
to just run the ball and take what would have been a 41-yard field
goal and overtime. But Welsh got talked out of it in favor of
taking a shot at the end zone and the win. Quarterback Aaron Brooks
was sacked and was called for intentional grounding, essentially
taking the Cavaliers out of field goal range. Todd Braverman was
short on a 54-yard attempt.
</P>
<P>
   _ Among the questions Virginia fans will be asking today: How
does a nationally-ranked defense get beat on third-and-13 with a
35-yard touchdown pass and then, just a few minutes later, get beat
on third-and-seven with a 54-yard touchdown pass?
</P>
<P>
   _ Said more than one Georgia Tech player late Saturday night:
''Can you imagine where we'd be if we hadn't lost to Boston
College?''

 &HT;    Tech showed refusal to quit
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just like that, Georgia Tech isn't totally back to the
days of Bobby Dodd, but the football gods are suggesting that the
Yellow Jackets are a Florida State victory shy of those of Bobby
Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Here we are, three games and a miracle into the ACC season for a
Tech team that has done nearly everything right on this side of its
Boston College fiasco, and nobody sits higher in the conference
than this absolutely resilient bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Definitely not Virginia. In fact, the Cavaliers are joining the
rest of us in wondering how Tech rose from oblivion Saturday at
Bobby Dodd Stadium to capture one of the wildest victories during
its 106 years.
</P>
<P>
   This made no sense. One moment, Tech was resembling the
loveliest of patsies along the way to going easily to Virginia. The
next, there were nearly 46,018 screamers tearing up the place with
the mightiest burst of glee around here over a football game since
... well, since Tech shocked Virginia by this same 41-38 score
eight years ago along the way to a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say, because I've never felt this way in
my life,'' said Tech defensive tackle Nate Stimson, describing his
thoughts, those of his teammates and those of the many who ripped
down both goalposts and cheered deep into the gorgeous October
night.
</P>
<P>
   No way this should have happened. Virginia's Thomas Jones rushed
for 207 yards, mostly without resistance. When he wasn't making
Tech's defense look pathetic, everybody else on Virginia's offense
was. Quarterback Aaron Brooks completed pass after pass with only
air covering his receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia finished with 600 yards overall to Tech's 370. And,
with many among Tech's homecoming crowd thinking of tipping out
during the third quarter for an early dinner, Virginia led 38-17.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking three touchdowns. That's what Tech needed during
the game's final 19 minutes, just to tie their seventh-ranked foes,
and Tech did better than that.
</P>
<P>
   Tech won, because this isn't the same Tech bunch that flinches
at the sight of a big opponent in a big game. Tech won, because
coach George O'Leary wouldn't let the Jackets quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very professional locker room at halftime,'' said
O'Leary, whose team not only trailed 31-17, but barely showed a
pulse outside of Rodney Williams' mighty foot on kickoffs and
punts. ``I just told them to concentrate on the three things that
we weren't doing in the first half. I was referring to effort,
enthusiasm and execution.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech eventually went three-for-three in those categories, and
then Tech won, because Tech has a group that doesn't want to quit.
Even after Jones tried to shove a dagger into the heart of the
Jackets' comeback thoughts with a 65-yard sprint to the end zone
for that 38-17 lead, Stimson foreshadowed great things to come for
Tech.
</P>
<P>
   On Virginia's next possession, Stimson sacked Brooks for a
6-yard loss on third-and-6. Then came Virginia's next possession,
when he forced Brooks into a fumble that Tech's Delaunta Cameron
scooped up and returned 34 yards to push the Jackets closer to
their miracle.
</P>
<P>
   They'll need another miracle next week, when sixth-ranked
Florida State comes to town.

EVERY CRIME IS A HATE CRIME

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm not outraged because Matthew Shepard was a gay man who got
murdered.
</P>
<P>
   I don't understand the candlelight vigils or the pompous
political pronouncements or the sad-looking bunch of Hollywood
actors protesting on the Capitol steps because Shepard was a gay
man who got murdered.
</P>
<P>
   That only cheapens his death.
</P>
<P>
   Or the deaths of others.
</P>
<P>
   In the town where I live, 15-year-old Renelyn Simmons, a
cheerleader, and 16-year-old Andre Bradley, a football player, were
shot dead as they walked along 41st Drive on their way to a pizza
parlor.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not outraged because Renelyn was a cheerleader who got
murdered; or because Andre was a football player who got murdered;
or because they were teenagers who got murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Also here, Laura Munoz, a mother of six who'd suffered through
years of domestic abuse, was murdered one night after she tried to
escape from her own house but couldn't find room in a
battered-women's shelter.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not outraged because Munoz was a woman who got murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen local children died at the hands of their parents last
year. They'd done nothing but be born into the wrong families. They
could not have been more innocent.
</P>
<P>
   It's not what makes victims different that's important. It's
what makes them the same. It's the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Murder is the outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Any murder. All murders. &QL; 
ANOTHER KIND? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. House or Representatives decided to go out on a limb
and pass a ``non-binding'' resolution last week condemning the
brutal killing of Universityof Wyoming student Shepard as
``unacceptable and outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   As if the people we elect to run the country and write the laws
believe there is another kind of murder.
</P>
<P>
   One that is acceptable and not outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   After Matthew Shepard's death, President Bill Clinton said,
``Congress needs to pass our tough hate-crimes legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   As if there is no law to punish Shepard's alleged killers, who
sit in jail accused of murder.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that I don't believe in hate crimes; it's that I don't
believe in any ``other'' type of crime.
</P>
<P>
   In the age of political correctness, we've developed the idea
that killings can be typed and sorted, divided, subdivided and
arranged into tidy categories.
</P>
<P>
   Some, we declare, are more hateful than others, worse than
others. &QL; 
CAN IT BE LESS BAD? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But if it's worse that someone like Matthew Shepard is killed
because he was gay, then it must be less bad when someone like
Laura Munoz is killed because she was in an abusive relationship.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not.
</P>
<P>
   Ask anyone who knew her.
</P>
<P>
   Ask her family.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the families of any of the five other women across the
Valley who police say were murdered during a three-month period
this year by boyfriends or husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the families of Renelyn Simmons and Andre Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Every murder is an outrage. Any excuse for it is outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   A person run over by a drunk driver is no less dead than a
person done in by a terrorist bomb.
</P>
<P>
   A person killed in a drive-by shooting is no less a victim than
one shot during a robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Or a person murdered over an insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   It would be no less a horror if Matthew Shepard died during a
convenience store robbery, or because he didn't belong to the right
gang, or because he accidently cut someone off on the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Or because, like Robert ``Mike'' Poduch and Hans Hummel, he
chased a suspected shoplifter out of a Wal-Mart store.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter if the killer hates gays, or hates not owning
a TV set, or hates his wife, or just hates the idea of getting
caught.
</P>
<P>
   It's not important to define a hate crime. It's only important
to hate crime. &QL;

SYMINGTON AIDE GEORGE LECKIE DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES KELLY  
 and AMY SVITAK  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Edward Leckie, former deputy chief of staff to then-Gov.
Fife Symington, and a key player in political and legal brouhahas
that preceded Symington's downfall, is dead at 57.
</P>
<P>
   Leckie, an outgoing businessman often accused of overreaching
and intrigue in connection with his government service, died at a
Paradise Valley home Thursday after a long battle with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   To the end, Leckie remained loyal to Symington, who left office
last year after being convicted of bank and wire fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was an extremely close friend and a highly valued
adviser,'' Symington said by phone from New Hampshire. ``He's been
a part of our family for years. Ann and I will miss him very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Connelly, Leckie's lawyer, said Leckie's relationship
with Symington remained warm though they went through difficult
times together.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said he, too, was glad to have known Leckie.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Leckie was a gentleman and my friend,'' Connelly said.
``He knew what the word loyalty meant.''
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, Connelly won an acquittal for Leckie on federal
charges that Leckie leaked confidential information to the late
John Yeoman, Symington's accountant, to rig a bid for a $1.5
million state contract.
</P>
<P>
   That contract, for a cost-cutting program called Project SLIM,
went to Yeoman's accounting firm, Coopers and Lybrand. Yeoman was
killed in a car crash shortly after he and Leckie were indicted in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments of Leckie and Yeoman were seen as giving federal
prosecutors leverage to get them to testify against Symington, but
neither did. Connelly said the pressure on Leckie was clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government wanted him to co-operate and point the finger
and he said `That's not me and there are no fingers to point,' ''
Connelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Leckie was acquitted in the criminal case, he earlier had
agreed to pay a $25,000 settlement in the SLIM matter after an
Arizona Attorney General's Office investigation turned up evidence
that he and Yeoman had exchanged vital bidding information.
</P>
<P>
   Coopers and Lybrand, which agreed to pay the state a $725,000
settlement acknowledged ``a grave appearance of impropriety.''
However, neither the firm nor Leckie admitted wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Coopers later agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors in
the Symington case, and to pay $2.275 million to end the
investigation into its role in the bid-rigging scandal as well as
its work for Symington's real estate business.
</P>
<P>
   Leckie was born Dec. 24, 1941, in Champaign, Ill., to Robert
Fulton Leckie and Olive Harriett Brunskill.
</P>
<P>
   In his resume, he listed himself as a 1963 graduate of MacMurray
College, Jacksonville, Ill., with a bachelor's degree in government
and economics.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he attended Vanderbilt University Law School for
two years, and graduated from the Loyola University Graduate School
of Business with an MBA in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   His business career took him around the country _ to
manufacturing companies in Chicago, Hollywood, Fla., Detroit, and
Mesa. He also owned businesses in Tucson and Clinton, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   And he served as president and trustee of Phoenix Country Day
School, trustee for Hospice of the Valley, and director of the Mesa
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But his business career had its ups and downs. When he went to
work as finance chairman for Symington's first campaign for
governor in 1989, Leckie's business enterprises had been ailing. In
a deposition taken that year in connection with a lawsuit involving
several of his businesses, Leckie said he hadn't had an operating
company or a job since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   After Symington won a runoff election in 1991, Leckie was
installed as his deputy chief of staff. In that position, he was
often the subject of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed the $3.4 million Governor's Office budget to run $1
million in the hole, forcing layoffs and belt-tightening to avoid a
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   He also improperly billed a state fund $1,336 for a Hawaiian
vacation with his girlfriend, paying the money back only after he
was called to account. And he listed himself as working when he was
on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The Project SLIM affair, which led to Leckie's indictment, put
Symington's administration under a cloud when rumbles about it
surfaced two years after Leckie left the administration in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   When Leckie left Symington's service, however, the governor
lauded the job he'd done, saying Leckie revitalized Project SLIM,
solved problems at the state Lottery, and contributed to economic
development efforts.
</P>
<P>
   After the resolution of the bid-rigging case against him, Leckie
worked as a business consultant.
</P>
<P>
   And he periodically appeared at Symington's trial last year on
fraud charges, offering Symington moral support. On Sept. 3, 1997,
Symington was convicted of multiple counts of bank and wire fraud
in connection with his real-estate development business. He is
appealing those convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew George as a very loyal friend of Fife's,'' said Terence
Lynam, an attorney for Symington. ``I remember how supportive he
was during the trial. Considering his own health situation and the
fact that he had gone through a trial himself, I thought it was
great that he was being so supportive of Fife. I thought he was a
wonderful guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynam recalled that Symington resigned immediately after the
verdict and had dinner that evening at his east Phoenix home with
family attorneys and a few friends, including Leckie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very tough evening, but George got up and toasted
Fife and Ann and said he was pleased to be their friend. It was
very warm and moving.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, Leckie had been undergoing treatment
for a cancer that was found in his mouth and lymph nodes in 1996.
Shortly after that diagnosis, doctors removed part of his palate
and three upper lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Leckie's, public relations man David Hans Schmidt,
said the cancer continued to spread throughout Leckie's body,
despite recent treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Leckie is survived by a daughter, Jeanne; a son, Bryce; a
brother, Jim; and a sister, Mary Francis.
</P>
<P>
   Services will be held at 3 p.m. Tuesday, at Saint Barnabas on
the Desert Church, 6715 N. Mockingbird Lane in Paradise Valley. &QL;

PHONE CALL ENDS THE WAITING FOR MOM, GIRL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The ribbon on the door Saturday was the color of mourning, no
longer the bright yellow of waiting.
</P>
<P>
   The ribbon's hue, and the family's mood, changed after
authorities confirmed their worst fears: that bones in the desert
had been identified as those of 28-year-old Tammy Meier.
</P>
<P>
   Her remains were spread over a quarter mile north of Phoenix,
intermingled with her daughter's. The remains of Chelsey Gragg, 9,
were identified last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the hard part,'' said Billie Gragg, Chelsey's
grandmother, ``changing our yellow hope ribbon to black.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery crushed Gragg's father, Eddie Gragg, the
ex-husband of Meier, who had refused to the end to believe the pair
was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had hope the whole time,'' said Gragg. ``Then we got the
phone call and it took that hope away.''
</P>
<P>
   Meier leaves behind three children. Bailey, 2, and Nick, 9, are
staying with the Gragg family. T.J., 7, lives with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Billie Gragg said Nick understands what happened to his mother
and sister. But she hasn't explained the murder to her youngest
grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   ``She used to ask a whole lot . . . `Where's Mommy?' And I had
to tell her Mom is at work. `Where's Chelsey?' `Chelsey's at
school.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nick broke down and cried when he was told that the bodies of
his mother and sister were found in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you remind him of it, he'll still cry,'' Billie Gragg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you tell him your mother and sister are gone? How do
you make it easy?'' asked Eddie Gragg, as his son lounged barefoot
next to him on a bench. ``I'm trying to not have him left with the
anger feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother and daughter disappeared Feb. 4 after a dentist's
appointment. Their van was found in a grocery store parking lot on
Feb. 11. And the family went on several search missions in the
desert surrounding Phoenix, at times following directions from a
psychic from Show Low.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand I was within five minutes of where they was. I
just didn't go far enough,'' said Irene Moody, Meier's mother, who
came out to Phoenix from Marshall, Mo., several times to search.
</P>
<P>
   A hunter last weekend discovered the remains just west of
Interstate 17 and New River Road. Authorities said they weren't
sure if the bodies had been buried or left in the open.
</P>
<P>
   Gragg said he at first thought Meier went out of town just to
get away for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``But time passed, and no phone call. She wouldn't have left
Bailey like that,'' he said, as Bailey stood at his knee eating
bologna out of a Tigger bowl. ``So we figured something was
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Meier moved to Phoenix with her family in 1986, her mother said.
The family moved back a few months later, but Meier wanted to stay
to finish high school.
</P>
<P>
   She met Eddie Gragg and had two children with him, which also
kept her in Phoenix, despite what her mother said were desperate
pleas to get Meier back to Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   She divorced Gragg in 1991 and had a string of boyfriends, most
of whom didn't get her mother's approval.
</P>
<P>
   The family was pointing fingers at a ex-boyfriend of Meier's who
is an ex-convict. The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office would only
say it has strong investigative leads, but would not name them.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 Maricopa County Sheriff's Office homicide detectives
and posse members combed the desert looking for additional remains
and evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``She planned on moving back to Missouri in March. But she
didn't make it to March,'' Moody said. ``We have a big enough home,
my husband and I, that we could have accommodated her and the four
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would have been no problem.'' &QL;

FILM STARS BACK RIVALS IN ARIZONA 6TH DISTRICT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEXA HAUSSLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Picture the flicks: the ``Sundance Kid'' takes on ``Ben Hur''.
</P>
<P>
   Or ``The Natural'' goes to bat against, well, Moses.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like pure Hollywood. But two legendary film stars have
made Arizona politics their latest projects.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Redford and Charlton Heston are taking sides in Arizona's
closest, and most dramatic, race: The 6th Congressional District
bout of incumbent Republican J.D. Hayworth and Democrat Steve
Owens.
</P>
<P>
   This time, instead of launching home runs or bringing down a
president, Robert Redford is flexing his Hollywood muscle for
Owens, who came within 2,500 votes of defeating Hayworth in 1996 in
one of the state's ugliest election battles.
</P>
<P>
   Redford praises Owens in a radio ad, which started airing
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Arizona experiences some of the fastest growth in the
country, Steve Owens wants to hold developers accountable and fight
to manage our growth and to protect the desert,'' the liberal
Redford says in the advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Owens said in a press release Friday that Redford offered to do
the radio spot because the League of Conservation Voters, a group
in which Redford is active, endorsed him.
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth spokesman Jeff Breedlove said Saturday the congressman
isn't sweating Redford's endorsement of his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, it appears that Mr. Redford is auditioning for a new
role here. Perhaps a remake of the ``Terminator'' because he's
trying to destroy the rural economy which is so important to the
6th District of Arizona,'' Breedlove said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, rather than parting the Red Sea or painting the
Sistine Chapel, National Rifle Association President Heston is
putting in a good word for Hayworth.
</P>
<P>
   Heston, who is wildly popular with the state's senior citizens,
agreed to make a personal appearance in the district and to do a
radio ad for Hayworth, Breedlove said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Mr. Heston's supporting Congressman Hayworth because
he recognizes that Congressman Hayworth has done a great job
listening to the people of Arizona and representing the mainstream
common sense values of Arizona,'' Breedlove said. &QL;

FOSTER INJURY COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ UCLA freshman tailback DeShaun Foster is
expected to miss 2-3 weeks with a sprained medial collateral
ligament in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had torn it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Foster suffered the injury with nine minutes left in the second
quarter. After catching a screen pass and running to the Oregon 8,
he was hit from the side by a Ducks defender. He grabbed the knee
immediately, then was helped to the sideline. He watched the second
half in street clothes, sitting on the training table with injured
receiver Freddie Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still had Keith (Brown) and Jermaine (Lewis), and I was
hoping they'd get the job done,'' Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown rushed for a career-high 101 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Foster will have an MRI on Monday to determine the extent of the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the information I have now, I think he'll be out 2-3
weeks,'' said Dr. Gerald Finerman, UCLA's team physician.
</P>
<P>
   Miami stuff: UCLA and Miami will play at 11 a.m. (PST) on Dec.
5, the Bruins announced Saturday. The game will be televised by
ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Drew and a prayer: If it seemed strange for a reserve
quarterback to play receiver with 22 seconds and 58 yards to go,
consider this: UCLA's Drew Bennett is 6-foot-5 and has a 38-inch
vertical jump. He can dunk a basketball any-which-way and is one of
the Bruins' best athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the coaches inserted Bennett into the ``Hail Mary''
lineup, and he practiced the play once.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm supposed to use my vertical to jump up and get it,'' he
said. ``But (the Ducks) didn't guard me. I was all by myself. I
didn't have to jump.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett caught Cade McNown's pass at the 4, but Chris Sailer
missed the ensuing field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Bouncing back: McNown's week started with a scathing headline in
the Daily Bruin: ``Bruins Win Despite McNone,'' a reference to his
10-of-24 performance against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   It ended with 395 yards passing and three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little upset,'' offensive coordinator Al Borges said
of the criticism. ``But in the final analysis, he kept it in
perspective. He's learned to live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in action: Defensive end Kenyon Coleman played his first
game since injuring his knee Sept. 19 against Houston, and he did
not miss a beat. He forced two fumbles, recovered one, and had one
tackle-for-loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the ball on the ground and the crowd started cheering,
so I figured it was a fumble,'' he said of his second recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Cornerback Marques Anderson and linebacker
Brendan Ayanbadejo led the Bruins with eight tackles. Ayanbadejo
also had two sacks in overtime.... UCLA had a season-low three
penalties.... The Bruins are 12-0 when they score at least 40
points under coach Bob Toledo. &QL;

HALLOWEEN EMPORIUM LETS BOOS AND GHOULS EXPLORE THE DARK SIDE OF
RETAIL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- As darkness descends on North Hollywood, a young
mother pushing a stroller walks with her two small children. As
they approach a store, she suddenly commands them: ``Don't look.
You kids don't have to look at that stuff,'' trying to divert their
eyes from the gold metal coffin that sits in front of Panoptikum.
</P>
<P>
   A Halloween come-on? Hardly. Panoptikum, named after an obscure
German museum of the bizarre in the 1930s, is open all year long
selling ``home decor for your dungeon,'' including such items as
skull-and-candle chandeliers, replicas of torture devices, stuff
from funeral homes, horror-related props from Hollywood studios --
and it's not cheap. Chandeliers go for between $250 and $3,500. A
Borneo headhunter's chair costs $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is for people who enjoy Halloween year-round,''
says store co-owner Patrick McGuire.
</P>
<P>
   It's a statement that can be applied to two other like-minded
stores in the area that draw a steady stream of customers
interested in the dark side throughout the year. Next to Panoptikum
is Raven's Flight, which can be described as a witches' shop, and a
mile or so away in Burbank is Dark Delicacies (``The House of
Horror'').
</P>
<P>
   Dottie Harrison and her companion, Jim Marler, had made visiting
Dark Delicacies their first order of business because there was
``nothing like it back in Dallas,'' where the couple are from. It
was 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get up till 1,'' Marler admits, sheepishly. ``I
couldn't sleep,'' adds Harrison. ``I must have vampire in me.''
</P>
<P>
   There seem to be more and more people who think they have a bit
of vampire in them, and there are even a few who think of
themselves as vampires, some of whom drink blood.
</P>
<P>
   But the emphasis at Dark Delicacies is clearly on fun -- with
almost a ghoulish delight. Fenced off in the corner are two small
black dogs named Gomez and Morticia. There is a coffin for storing
wine, and displayed on the wall behind the counter are silver
``life masks'' of horror stars such as Boris Karloff and Vincent
Price made by studio makeup men. Store owner Del Howison, wearing a
T-shirt that says ``Zombies A-Go-Go,'' fires off quips faster than
a speeding silver bullet -- ``You know, being an astronomer would
be a good job for a vampire.''
</P>
<P>
   During the four years that Howison and his wife, Sue, have run
Dark Delicacies, their business has grown steadily. The stores
sells books, jewelry, posters, CDs and other items related to the
horror genre and receives mail orders from as far away as Europe.
While there is an upturn in sales between September and December,
the Howisons say it's not because of Halloween as much as the fact
that it's the gift-giving season. Their biggest advertiser is
word-of-mouth, bringing in customers year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison attributes her interest in horror to author Anne Rice's
vampire novels but says she doesn't take it too seriously. She buys
more than $300 in items, including a coffin jewelry box, and refers
to her purchases as ``conversation pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   The Howisons say the store's clientele runs the gamut. Some of
them are baby boomers who have fond memories of bygone Halloweens;
some are collectors of such memorabilia as old horror-film posters.
</P>
<P>
   More serious are the Goths -- those who like to dress in black
and listen to dark music. Some of them take it a bit further and go
to vampire bars, which Del Howison equates with country-western
bars where people put on cowboy hats and pretend they're cowboys
for a weekend. In vampire bars, says Del, a guy who is a computer
programmer all week can put on a cape, snap in fangs, change to
color contact lenses and be Vlad for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And there are others who are benign but think of themselves as
vampires. A few, says Del, take it past the point of fun.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's hard to tell how many people are taking it seriously
and how many are just dabbling, it's clear we are in a horror
phase, says J. Gordon Melton, director of the Institute for the
Study of American Religion, which studies alternative religions and
is housed at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no sign of it abating, Melton says, pointing to the
success of horror films, TV series such as ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'' and the enduring popularity of such Universal Studios
figures as the Frankenstein monster and the Mummy.
</P>
<P>
   There is a wide range of types attracted to the dark side, says
Melton. He cites groups such as the Count Dracula Fan Club, which
has been around since 1965, as being quite serious. On the fringe,
there is a smaller group, ``the fetish crowd and people who are
into various forms of S&AMP;M,'' but Melton believes it is a fairly
small segment.
</P>
<P>
   Melton himself has an abiding interest in horror and has written
a number of books on the subject, including ``The Vampire Book: The
Encyclopedia of the Undead,'' which has sold more than 100,000
copies, according to its publisher, Visible Ink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Halloween is just a time when the rest of the culture
acknowledges those of us who are interested in vampires and the
rest,'' says Melton, who calls his interest in Halloween a hobby
and traces his fascination in horror to the old Hammer Studios
films starring Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no easy way to know who's interested in the dark
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't expect those people who buy the large items to be
interested in the merchandise,'' Panoptikum co-owner McGuire says.
``They're ... looking for something unique and strange.''
</P>
<P>
   According to McGuire, customers at Panoptikum (``Emporium for
the Macabre'') include police officers, firefighters, paramedics,
lawyers, directors, musicians and actors. Some are famous, he says,
declining to mention names.
</P>
<P>
   He admits that there are people who can't handle the store but
says he hasn't received any flak from the neighborhood. ``Many
people have walked in, not expecting what's in here, and literally
run out ... but nothing's going on in here that doesn't happen in
any other store.''
</P>
<P>
   (2ND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Next door at Raven Flight, ``an ethical shop serving the
pagan/Wicca community,'' items for sale include herbs, oils,
incense and other tools used in Wicca, or as it is better known,
witchcraft. But unlike the evil witches of fairy tales, these
witches practice a nature-based religion whose beliefs are derived
from pre-Christian Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wicca movement ... is here to stay,'' says Melton. ``It's
more than just a psychological salve; it's become a fairly
sophisticated worldview.'' He estimates that there are between
40,000 and 70,000 serious witches in this country.
</P>
<P>
   As for Halloween, it doesn't generate any more sales for Raven's
Flight than the other seven major Wiccan festivals, says Raven
Monauni, the store's owner and a self-proclaimed witch whose
husband, Thomas, is co-owner of Panoptikum. Halloween, says Raven,
derived from the Celtic holiday known as Samhain, which was the
last harvest festival and a time to honor the dead.
</P>
<P>
   As for her customers, they come in all ranges of seriousness,
Monauni says.
</P>
<P>
   Some are teens who saw a movie like ``The Craft'' and want a
book of spells, but that's more a fad. Her real customers, she
says, are not the ones who ``buy the cute little spell books but
buy the serious mythologies.'' Monauni calls her store, which she
started 1{ years ago, a place where people who have a common
interest can connect.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Howison expresses a similar sentiment. ``It's more like a
family,'' she says of Dark Delicacies, ``because you have a place
where you can talk about the latest scary book you just read and
not feel you're going to be condemned because you happen to like
the darker side.''
</P>
<P>
   A book signing Oct. 11 for Katherine Ramsland, author of
``Piercing the Darkness: Undercover With Vampires in America
Today,'' brought out a slightly different family -- the
``vampires'' she had written about in her book.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Dean, 31, of Tarzana calls himself a vampire and attributes
his lifestyle to a near-death experience he had after a motorcycle
crash in 1993, after which he began to submerge himself in the
culture by reading books and listening to music. He says he had no
interest in the dark side before the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dean, who works at Disney Animation in Burbank doing
computer support technology, says people like him are going back to
a more romantic time. ``Everyone is speeding toward the millennium
at 100,000 miles an hour. We kind of just stepped off the ride and
said, `Let's go back to when things were elegant, chivalrous and
beautiful.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Dean stresses that he is more than just a weekend vampire.
``You alter everything in your lifestyle to fit this. ...
Fortunately, I'm allowed to do this at my job as well, but if I was
financially able, I wouldn't be working a day job.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Dean opened a vampire club in Beverly Hills called
the Fang Club, which he says is not open at the moment because it's
merging with another club (the Web site is www.fangclub.com). It's
where he met his girlfriend, Bridget Farrington, a costume and
clothing designer. Dean says it was their commitment to the vampire
life that brought them together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Halloween, for us, is there all the time,'' he says. ``It's
still our favorite time of the year because all the rest of the
country aligns themselves more with us. We like it better that way.
You start looking at the houses, and they look like the way my
house looks anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsland, who is known for her books about Anne Rice, says there
are vampire clubs running most nights of the week in Los Angeles
(the Fang Club Web site has links to some of these) but doesn't see
the vast majority of these people as dangerous. ``I wouldn't
hesitate to hang out with (Dean) or go to his club,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She says she also wouldn't hesitate in going to the home of
Catrina Coffin, another self-professed vampire, though Coffin
sleeps in a casket, has a number of snakes as pets and drinks
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Coffin is president and founder of the Los Angeles Hearse
Society, a sort of car club for hearse owners.
</P>
<P>
   As for drinking blood, Coffin claims her obsession began as a
child because she liked the taste. Now, she says, she has donors
who she knows so she can screen them for diseases, including AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use a medical scalpel and I make a small, not very deep cut,
usually on the wrist or arm, and then I put my mouth on the wound
and drink blood from it until the blood stops flowing.''
</P>
<P>
   She stresses that this is ``a consenting-adult thing,'' and no
one is seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Coffin, who drives a limo, among other things, to support
herself, says she's open about her lifestyle, having been on talk
shows and in documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   As for being hassled about her vampire life, ``I've never had
any problems,'' Coffin says. ``There aren't people running around
chasing me with a wooden stake and a mallet.''

<P>
   ``We didn't get up till 1,'' Marler admits, sheepishly. ``I
couldn't sleep,'' adds Harrison. ``I must have vampire in me.''
</P>
<P>
   There seem to be more and more people who think they have a bit
of vampire in them, and there are even a few who think of
themselves as vampires, some of whom drink blood.
</P>
<P>
   But the emphasis at Dark Delicacies is clearly on fun -- with
almost a ghoulish delight. Fenced off in the corner are two small
black dogs named Gomez and Morticia. There is a coffin for storing
wine, and displayed on the wall behind the counter are silver
``life masks'' of horror stars such as Boris Karloff and Vincent
Price made by studio makeup men. Store owner Del Howison, wearing a
T-shirt that says ``Zombies A-Go-Go,'' fires off quips faster than
a speeding silver bullet -- ``You know, being an astronomer would
be a good job for a vampire.''
</P>
<P>
   During the four years that Howison and his wife, Sue, have run
Dark Delicacies, their business has grown steadily. The stores
sells books, jewelry, posters, CDs and other items related to the
horror genre and receives mail orders from as far away as Europe.
While there is an upturn in sales between September and December,
the Howisons say it's not because of Halloween as much as the fact
that it's the gift-giving season. Their biggest advertiser is
word-of-mouth, bringing in customers year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison attributes her interest in horror to author Anne Rice's
vampire novels but says she doesn't take it too seriously. She buys
more than $300 in items, including a coffin jewelry box, and refers
to her purchases as ``conversation pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   The Howisons say the store's clientele runs the gamut. Some of
them are baby boomers who have fond memories of bygone Halloweens;
some are collectors of such memorabilia as old horror-film posters.
</P>
<P>
   More serious are the Goths -- those who like to dress in black
and listen to dark music. Some of them take it a bit further and go
to vampire bars, which Del Howison equates with country-western
bars where people put on cowboy hats and pretend they're cowboys
for a weekend. In vampire bars, says Del, a guy who is a computer
programmer all week can put on a cape, snap in fangs, change to
color contact lenses and be Vlad for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And there are others who are benign but think of themselves as
vampires. A few, says Del, take it past the point of fun.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's hard to tell how many people are taking it seriously
and how many are just dabbling, it's clear we are in a horror
phase, says J. Gordon Melton, director of the Institute for the
Study of American Religion, which studies alternative religions and
is housed at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no sign of it abating, Melton says, pointing to the
success of horror films, TV series such as ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'' and the enduring popularity of such Universal Studios
figures as the Frankenstein monster and the Mummy.
</P>
<P>
   There is a wide range of types attracted to the dark side, says
Melton. He cites groups such as the Count Dracula Fan Club, which
has been around since 1965, as being quite serious. On the fringe,
there is a smaller group, ``the fetish crowd and people who are
into various forms of S&AMP;M,'' but Melton believes it is a fairly
small segment.
</P>
<P>
   Melton himself has an abiding interest in horror and has written
a number of books on the subject, including ``The Vampire Book: The
Encyclopedia of the Undead,'' which has sold more than 100,000
copies, according to its publisher, Visible Ink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Halloween is just a time when the rest of the culture
acknowledges those of us who are interested in vampires and the
rest,'' says Melton, who calls his interest in Halloween a hobby
and traces his fascination in horror to the old Hammer Studios
films starring Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no easy way to know who's interested in the dark
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't expect those people who buy the large items to be
interested in the merchandise,'' Panoptikum co-owner McGuire says.
``They're ... looking for something unique and strange.''
</P>
<P>
   According to McGuire, customers at Panoptikum (``Emporium for
the Macabre'') include police officers, firefighters, paramedics,
lawyers, directors, musicians and actors. Some are famous, he says,
declining to mention names.
</P>
<P>
   He admits that there are people who can't handle the store but
says he hasn't received any flak from the neighborhood. ``Many
people have walked in, not expecting what's in here, and literally
run out ... but nothing's going on in here that doesn't happen in
any other store.''
</P>
<P>
   (2ND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Next door at Raven Flight, ``an ethical shop serving the
pagan/Wicca community,'' items for sale include herbs, oils,
incense and other tools used in Wicca, or as it is better known,
witchcraft. But unlike the evil witches of fairy tales, these
witches practice a nature-based religion whose beliefs are derived
from pre-Christian Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wicca movement ... is here to stay,'' says Melton. ``It's
more than just a psychological salve; it's become a fairly
sophisticated worldview.'' He estimates that there are between
40,000 and 70,000 serious witches in this country.
</P>
<P>
   As for Halloween, it doesn't generate any more sales for Raven's
Flight than the other seven major Wiccan festivals, says Raven
Monauni, the store's owner and a self-proclaimed witch whose
husband, Thomas, is co-owner of Panoptikum. Halloween, says Raven,
derived from the Celtic holiday known as Samhain, which was the
last harvest festival and a time to honor the dead.
</P>
<P>
   As for her customers, they come in all ranges of seriousness,
Monauni says.
</P>
<P>
   Some are teens who saw a movie like ``The Craft'' and want a
book of spells, but that's more a fad. Her real customers, she
says, are not the ones who ``buy the cute little spell books but
buy the serious mythologies.'' Monauni calls her store, which she
started 1{ years ago, a place where people who have a common
interest can connect.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Howison expresses a similar sentiment. ``It's more like a
family,'' she says of Dark Delicacies, ``because you have a place
where you can talk about the latest scary book you just read and
not feel you're going to be condemned because you happen to like
the darker side.''
</P>
<P>
   A book signing Oct. 11 for Katherine Ramsland, author of
``Piercing the Darkness: Undercover With Vampires in America
Today,'' brought out a slightly different family -- the
``vampires'' she had written about in her book.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Dean, 31, of Tarzana calls himself a vampire and attributes
his lifestyle to a near-death experience he had after a motorcycle
crash in 1993, after which he began to submerge himself in the
culture by reading books and listening to music. He says he had no
interest in the dark side before the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dean, who works at Disney Animation in Burbank doing
computer support technology, says people like him are going back to
a more romantic time. ``Everyone is speeding toward the millennium
at 100,000 miles an hour. We kind of just stepped off the ride and
said, `Let's go back to when things were elegant, chivalrous and
beautiful.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Dean stresses that he is more than just a weekend vampire.
``You alter everything in your lifestyle to fit this. ...
Fortunately, I'm allowed to do this at my job as well, but if I was
financially able, I wouldn't be working a day job.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Dean opened a vampire club in Beverly Hills called
the Fang Club, which he says is not open at the moment because it's
merging with another club (the Web site is www.fangclub.com). It's
where he met his girlfriend, Bridget Farrington, a costume and
clothing designer. Dean says it was their commitment to the vampire
life that brought them together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Halloween, for us, is there all the time,'' he says. ``It's
still our favorite time of the year because all the rest of the
country aligns themselves more with us. We like it better that way.
You start looking at the houses, and they look like the way my
house looks anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsland, who is known for her books about Anne Rice, says there
are vampire clubs running most nights of the week in Los Angeles
(the Fang Club Web site has links to some of these) but doesn't see
the vast majority of these people as dangerous. ``I wouldn't
hesitate to hang out with (Dean) or go to his club,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She says she also wouldn't hesitate in going to the home of
Catrina Coffin, another self-professed vampire, though Coffin
sleeps in a casket, has a number of snakes as pets and drinks
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Coffin is president and founder of the Los Angeles Hearse
Society, a sort of car club for hearse owners.
</P>
<P>
   As for drinking blood, Coffin claims her obsession began as a
child because she liked the taste. Now, she says, she has donors
who she knows so she can screen them for diseases, including AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use a medical scalpel and I make a small, not very deep cut,
usually on the wrist or arm, and then I put my mouth on the wound
and drink blood from it until the blood stops flowing.''
</P>
<P>
   She stresses that this is ``a consenting-adult thing,'' and no
one is seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Coffin, who drives a limo, among other things, to support
herself, says she's open about her lifestyle, having been on talk
shows and in documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   As for being hassled about her vampire life, ``I've never had
any problems,'' Coffin says. ``There aren't people running around
chasing me with a wooden stake and a mallet.''

LANDFILL MAY GIVE UP VITAL CLUES IN MOM'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDI VILLA  
 and RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cookie Jacobson's body could tell tales. Or it could be
unreadable.
</P>
<P>
   Even if investigators find her corpse under layers of trash at a
dump they plan to search, they may never be able to tell how she
died.
</P>
<P>
   Proving murder, forensic scientists say, will depend on whether
they find the right parts, and whether those parts haven't
decomposed too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really depends on how much of her is left,'' said Dr. Laura
Fulginiti, a forensic anthropologist with the Maricopa County
Medical Examiner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   And though Jacobson's body might have tissue, only bones remain
of Chelsey Gragg, 9, and Tammy Meier, 28, whose skeletons were
found in the desert north of Phoenix last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, when you're dealing with skeletal remains, you
do have to have some sort of fracture to indicate some type of
trauma,'' said Sgt. Dave Trombi, of the Maricopa County Sheriff's
Office, speaking of the remains of the mother and daughter, who had
been missing eight months.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there any other means of death, strangulation, or anything
that has to do with tissue, when you're down to skeletal remains,
that's difficult to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in many cases, dead bodies can provide clues to a
person's demise, anthropologists say. Tissue and bones, even
partial ones, often can reveal if a person was shot, stabbed,
strangled or poisoned.
</P>
<P>
   And they can reveal whether trauma occurred before or after
death.
</P>
<P>
   In Jacobson's case, that means investigators may be able to
determine if injuries to the body were caused before or after
death.
</P>
<P>
   But Jacobson's body will be far from an ideal case.
</P>
<P>
   Her body would likely have been crushed by garbage trucks,
rolled over as many as 400 times by bulldozers. If it is in the
landfill it has been amid rotting trash for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson, 49, disappeared Sept. 21, and police are convinced she
was killed by her son, Aaron, 16, and thrown in a garbage
container, which was then picked up and hauled to the landfill.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Jacobson told police that he found his mother dead in her
bed and, fearing he would be blamed for her death, he and his
sister, Laura, 13, disposed of the body. The siblings were arrested
and released Oct. 1 after prosecutors said there wasn't enough
evidence to hold them. &QL; 
BLOOD IN TRASH BIN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Tempe police found blood in a recycling bin and a
garbage container behind the Jacobson home, and announced that they
would search the Butterfield Station Landfill, southeast of
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   But ``in a month's time, you could lose a lot of tissue,'' said
Walter Birkby, director of the Human Remains Identification Unit in
Tucson. ``Whenever you're missing your soft tissue, that's when
you're going to wind up in trouble identifying a cause of death.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because knife and gunshot wounds don't always penetrate
into the bone, leaving most of their bruising evidence in the
tissue. Tissue is also where investigators would find evidence of
poisoning or a drug overdose, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   Soft tissue decomposes first, said Dr. Charles Merbs, an
anthropologist at Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The better preserved, the better the chances of coming up with
evidence,'' Merbs said. ``If you don't have the soft tissue, you're
losing all the evidence that is only in the soft tissue.'' &QL; 
CRUSHED, RECRUSHED &QL; 
Assuming Jacobson's body is in the landfill, it was compacted in a
standard garbage truck carrying four to six tons of waste.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at a transfer station, it was crushed again and loaded
into a trailer hauling 25 tons to the landfill. At that point,
garbage has been squeezed to 70 percent of its original volume.
</P>
<P>
   At the landfill, 100,000 pound bulldozers with six-inch blunt
spikes on their wheels, roll over the garbage throughout the day.
At the end of the day, six inches of fresh dirt are placed over the
flattened garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Landfill officials have already cordoned off a 3,500-square-foot
area that's 13 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   After a month, the body could range from moderately decomposed
if it was buried deep enough to pretty skeletonized.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a dry place, sometimes the body is well-preserved,'' said
Dr. Henry Lee, forensic pathologist for the Connecticut State
Police, who testified in the O.J. Simpson trial. ``Sometimes, the
body is mummified if its really hot weather.''
</P>
<P>
   With tissue, gunshot or stab wounds could still be visible. Medi
cal examiners can also run tests to determine poison or drug
overdose.
</P>
<P>
   With only a skeleton, as in the Chelsey Gragg and Tammy Meier
case, the work is tougher. If only Jacobson's skeleton is found in
the dump, and the bones show injuries, investigators will have to
determine which injuries were caused by her killing and which by
the crushing bulldozers. &QL; 
MARKS FROM WEAPONS &QL; 
Sharp instruments, such as knives and hatchets, would leave very
distinctive marks in the bones, different from marks left by a
bulldozer or a trash compactor.
</P>
<P>
   However, distinguishing a blunt-force trauma from one inflicted
by a compactor would be more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much blunt force trauma that can be inflicted in
the landfill,'' Fulginiti said. ``You've got heavy trucks rolling
over them. You've got other garbage. You've got compacting.
</P>
<P>
   ``But bone reacts differently (to injury) if it's still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when the body is injured, the body automatically
shoves blood towards the injury to help it heal. This causes
discoloration and bruising that won't be evident if the person is
already dead and the blood flow stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries that happen to the bones after death ``look very
white,'' Fulginiti said. The bones also become hard and brittle
after death.
</P>
<P>
   Fulginiti equates it to breaking a green stick versus breaking a
dry, dead stick. The dead stick will break in a distinctively more
jagged pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Even harder to determine will be if Jacobson died of suffocation
or strangulation, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Manual strangulation often causes blood vessels and capillaries
to rupture and can be detected in the ligatures of the neck.
Evidence also can be picked up from the eyes. However, this
evidence may also have been lost in decomposition, Birkby said.  &QL; 
`YOU HAVE TO BE LUCKY' &QL; 
Depending on how hard a person was strangled, there might be a
broken hyoid bone, located in the neck at the base of the tongue,
but Merbs said it would probably take a strong adult to break that
bone.
</P>
<P>
   Suffocation would be nearly impossible to prove, Merbs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wouldn't show any evidence at all unless you had a
complete, well-preserved body,'' he said. ``You have to be lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   And finding a completely intact body isn't likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, if a body is dismembered or chopped up, that's
another problem because it could be everywhere,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   The skull, several experts say, would be one of the most
valuable pieces of evidence to find. This is because the head would
provide positive identification, and also it is the area most
likely to have sustained trauma in a murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different if you find the skull and you have a bullet
hole in it,'' said Phoenix police Detective Mike McCullough. ``You
don't need a whole lot more. But the skeleton isn't always enough.
When you're unsure, the skeleton may not have everything you
need.''
</P>
<P>
   It's anybody's guess whether Jacobson's skull would have
survived the repeated crushing at the landfill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of it like an egg,'' Fulginiti said. ``It's really hard
to break an egg, except in certain ways. The skull is the same
way.'' &QL; 
TORSO IS VALUABLE &QL; 
The torso, including chest, thorax and abdomen, also would be
extremely valuable because experts could examine the ribs and the
vital organs. There might even be enough there to run toxicology
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Arms and legs are only helpful to determine if there was a
struggle, Fulginiti said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, finding anything in a landfill is ``sporadic,'' said
Fulginiti, who participated in the 1996 landfill search for the
body of a 13-year-old Ahwatukee boy. Brad Hansen was never found.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like luck of the draw,'' she said.

SILVER CHARM BEATS FREE HOUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ They ran the first mile of the Goodwood Handicap
together for old times' sake Saturday, Silver Charm and Free House
rarely separated by more than half a length, the two gray colts
reliving '97 Triple Crown memories as 20,000 fans at Santa Anita
roared their approval.
</P>
<P>
   Then sentiment took a back seat to cold-hearted thoroughbred
tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of a few strides on the turn for home in the
1[-mile race, Silver Charm put away his one-time rival and set his
sights on a new rival.
</P>
<P>
   His powerful, 2{-length victory, under a perfect ride by Gary
Stevens, not only settled the best-in-the-west debate but earned
Silver Charm a shot at Horse of the Year front-runner Skip Away in
the Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs on Nov.7.
</P>
<P>
   If Silver Charm beat Skip Away, whom he hasn't faced before, he
would get some votes for racing's top award.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll supplement to the Breeders' Cup,'' owner Bob Lewis
declared in the winner's circle, meaning he'll put up the $480,000
necessary to enter the Classic, whose $4 million base purse will
swell each time an unnominated horse like Silver Charm is entered.
``I wouldn't be so bold and pretentious as to say we're going to
win. But we're going to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm was scheduled to fly to Kentucky this morning. It's
at Churchill Downs that he won the Kentucky Derby last year.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Silver Charm and Free House were two very fast peas
in a pod, facing each other in six consecutive races from February
to June '97. Silver Charm won three, Free House two, and Touch Gold
beat them both in the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   But they hadn't met in the 16 months since then, each missing
most of the rest of '97, each coming back to score major victories
in '98. Their reunion Saturday shaped up as the highlight of the
Oak Tree Racing Association season.
</P>
<P>
   Score Quick, an 11-1 shot in the six-horse Goodwood, tried to
upstage them and led most of the way. Stevens and Free House jockey
Chris McCarron fought a positional battle in second and third and
Stevens got the edge by angling Silver Charm to the outside in the
first turn.
</P>
<P>
   When Free House went for the lead, he was wedged between horses.
When Silver Charm attacked on the outside at the top of the
stretch, he was in the clear and home free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little surprised we got by Free House as easily as we
did,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   The final time, 1:47.21, made this the second-fastest Goodwood
of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Free House finished second, 2{ lengths in front of Score Quick.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!The undercard:!off! Gold Land, rested for the past two
months, extended his vacation into the first half-mile of the
Ancient Title Handicap before accelerating from last place to a
three-quarter-length victory under Kent Desormeaux.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, at 5-1 odds, probably will send the 7-year-old to
the $1 million Breeders' Cup Sprint, trainer Neil Drysdale said.
</P>
<P>
   The filly A.P. Assay, a stablemate of Free House, held on for
second. Favored Kona Gold finished fifth in the 6-furlong race,
timed in a fast 1:08.50.
</P>

RANGERS BLOW A 2-GOAL LEAD BUT EARN A POINT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ The Pittsburgh Penguins may be bankrupt, but you've
got to give them a little credit. They are undefeated in three
games, the latest being a 3-3 tie with the Rangers Saturday night
in the Igloo.
</P>
<P>
   And the Penguins earned their point in the standing the hard
way, overcoming a two-goal deficit late in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers also earned their point while ending a four-game
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Playing their second game in two nights and their fifth in nine
nights, they fell behind by 3-2 early in the third period, but tied
it at 13:35 of the period on Todd Harvey's second goal of the
night.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh took the lead at 5 minutes 35 seconds of the third
period on a power-play goal by Kevin Hatcher. It was set up by
Jaromir Jagr, the third assist of the night for the Penguins
captain. Harvey scored on a rebound when the Rangers had a two-man
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey helped set up the game-tying goal by drawing a penalty
against Jiri Slegr, who chased him down the boards and elbowed him.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored the first goal of the game _ and took their
first lead of the season _ at 10:32 of the first period, when Todd
Harvey sent a rebound shot past Tom Barrasso, who made the initial
save on Adam Graves' high slap shot. Barrasso remained in the game
for about a minute after that, but then left with a strained groin
and was replaced by Peter Skudra.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey had been the Rangers best player in a 2-1 defeat in
Madison Square Garden against the Devils on Friday night. Obtained
from Dallas in a trade last season, Harvey is the ``heartbeat of
the team,'' according to Coach John Muckler, because he provides
the youthful vigor the Rangers have lacked for several seasons.
Back in the Rangers' lineup was the rookie center Manny Malhotra,
who was a healthy scratch Friday night. Mike Richter, who sat on
Friday in favor of Dan Cloutier, started Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins, who had a two-man advantage for 1:17 midway
through the first period, had an excellent chance to tie the score
with Jagr orchestrating the attack. But several shots were wide and
one hit the post.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a feud between their two co-owners and a recent
declaration of bankruptcy, the Penguins started the season 2-0 with
victories over the Islanders and the Devils. This, their third
game, was their home opener, and there were only a few empty seats
in the high rows.
</P>
<P>
   Not in a Penguin uniform for for the second consecutive season
is Petr Nedved, the center who remains a Group 2 free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who once employed Nedved, are interested in him.
Neil Smith, president and general manager of the Rangers, has
discussed trading for Nedved several times in recent months with
Penguins General Manager Craig Patrick. However, Patrick said
Saturday that he did not expect any deal soon. Nedved is playing
with Las Vegas of the International Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers increased their lead to 2-0 on the power play at
4:50 of the second period when Wayne Gretzky, standing to the left
of Skudra, scored his first goal of the season. Key to the play was
Harvey, who took up space in the low slot and deflected a shot by
Brian Leetch.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that goal, Kevin Stevens rammed Skudra, a
provocative tactic with Barrasso already injured. Skudra seemed
stunned for a moment by the collision, but soon righted himself and
continued.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins tied the score with two goals 85 seconds apart late
in the second period. Jagr assisted on both goals, the first of
which was scored by Patrick Lebeau at 16:36.Robert Lang scored the
second at 18:01.
</P>
<P>
   The defenseman Mathieu Schneider, playing in his second game as
a Ranger since his trade from Toronto, accidentally turned over the
puck creating a two-on-one involving Jagr, whose heavy wrist shot
was stopped by Richter but not controlled. Lebeau knocked in the
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   On the second goal, Hatcher blasted a long shot wide to the left
of the net that bounced of the end boards. Lang beat everyone to
the rebound on the right side of the net and put it in the net.

WITH BRODEUR STRUGGLING, THE DEVILS FALTER AGAIN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The last thing the punchless Devils need
now is for Martin Brodeur to allow soft goals.
</P>
<P>
   After winning their first game of the season Friday night
against the Rangers, the Devils returned home Saturday and fell to
the Edmonton Oilers, 4-2, before a crowd of 15,737 at Continental
Arena. It was the third loss in four games for New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Guerin, who was traded by the Devils to Edmonton last
season, scored two goals for the Oilers. Ryan Smyth and Andrei
Kovalenko had the other goals for the Oilers, while Petr Sykora
scored for the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to do well against your former team,'' said
Guerin, who was involved in a contract dispute with the Devils last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Guerin was jeered when he touched the puck early in the game,
but was booed with 1 minute 41 seconds left in the first period
when he picked up a rebound from a shot by Josef Beranek, waited
for Brodeur to commit, then beat the goalie with a rising shot for
his second goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes things get a little sour,'' Guerin said of his trade
to the Oilers, ``but this is the nature of the business. I had some
good times here, but I'm happy where I am now.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerin saw plenty of ice time. Playing right wing on a line with
Beranek and Kovalenko, Guerin used his speed and strength to cause
problems for the Devils. He has been made alternate captain by the
Oilers, and he said he was happy to be in Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   With three forwards who didn't play in the victory over the
Rangers a night earlier, the Devils showed plenty of enthusiasm and
spank.
</P>
<P>
   With Brendan Morrison, Sergei Brylin and Vadim Sharifijanov, who
took the place of Dave Andreychuk, Bob Carpenter and Scott Daniels,
the Devils searched for goals from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils looked dangerous in the offensive zone and
capitalized on their first manpower advantage of the night, scoring
their first power-play goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   After failing on seven advantages in the first three games, they
scored 6 minutes 52 seconds into the game. They probably didn't
care that Edmonton was 23nd in the league in killing penalties
coming into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora scored the power-play goal when he beat Mikhail
Shtalenkov through the pads from the bottom of the left circle
after a pass from Denis Pederson, but the Oilers tied it behind
Guerin.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils took more than twice as many shots as Edmonton (15-7)
in the second period, but it was the visitors who scored the only
goal to take the lead going into the third.
</P>
<P>
   The goal came at 5:07 from the stick of Smyth, who found himself
unattended at Brodeur's right door step for his first of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur, who allowed what appeared to be ``soft'' goals in the
losses to Chicago and Pittsburgh, had a clear view of the third
goal, scored by Kovalenko, 11:15 into the last period.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalenko's shot came from the high slot and hit Brodeur in the
chest before bouncing behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Robbie Ftorek said he was not concerned about Brodeur
having allowed three soft goals in four games. ``To me, every shot
on net is a good save,'' he said.

CLINTON RETURNS TO MIDEAST SUMMIT IN MARYLAND  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ Trying to force the pace of a Middle East
agreement, President Clinton returned to Maryland's Eastern Shore
Saturday, meeting in turns with the Palestinian and Israeli
delegations sequestered here.
</P>
<P>
   Details were scarce, and so was official optimism. The two sides
were said to be biding their time on serious commitments, and
officials suggested that if the usual pattern of Middle Eastern
summit meetings holds, there will be tantrums, threatened walkouts
and finally, possibly, a breakthrough at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   But the State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said in an
evening briefing that ``a lot has gone on, and the work has been
constructive.'' He said he expected talks with the leaders to go on
late into the night with special intensity after the Jewish Sabbath
ended at sundown and the Israeli delegation could resume normal
activity.
</P>
<P>
   The American plan, Rubin said, remained the same, with the idea
of reaching an agreement here by Sunday night, presumably with a
White House ceremony or announcement on Monday. But he did not rule
out an extension of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is an interim accord by which the Israelis will
withdraw from 13 percent more of the West Bank, in return for
specific, phased actions by the Palestinians to fight terrorism.
The land issue, after nearly 19 months of squabbling, is largely
agreed. But the specifics of Palestinian security cooperation _ and
how Palestinian efforts are judged sufficient by the Israelis, with
American mediation _ are intricate and unresolved, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But the advantage of a secluded meeting like this one is that
concessions can be offered quietly without embarrassing the side
that makes them, American officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came here by helicopter from Washington with his
national security adviser, Samuel Berger, and had lunch with the
American team, led by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the
special envoy Dennis Ross, before they began an 80-minute
discussion with Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and his
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then telephoned the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak,
to bring him up to date on the talks, before beginning a similar
session with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that while the Israelis could not work normally
because of the Sabbath, it was possible to discuss important
questions. While they were doing so, some of the Palestinians
repaired to a mall of outlet shops here to pursue the offerings of
American discount capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said the president, with ``a
strong reservoir of trust'' from both sides ``has a unique role
here to help both sides understand each side's position.'' Clinton
is expected to return here on Sunday.

KING RICHARD TAKES STOCK  
 PETTY STILL WEARS THE CROWN IN THE KINGDOM OF NASCAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once a King always a King.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, six years after he last nestled into the cozy belly of
a stock car, ``King'' Richard Petty remains permanently atop the
NASCAR Winston Cup throne.
</P>
<P>
   The view is breathtaking. And, sometimes, bothersome.
</P>
<P>
   Petty retired following the 1992 season and now owns the
familiar blue and red STP Pontiac that John Andretti will drive in
next Sunday's Dura Lube 500 at Phoenix International Raceway. He
had this to say about NASCAR's season-long 50th Anniversary
celebration: ``We always thought (NASCAR) was a big deal because we
were part of it. But now that it has 50 years behind it, it has
some history where everybody can look at it being a pretty big
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all started with nothing in a basket, kind of like starting
a farm with one acre. Then, every year you add an acre to the farm
and the first thing you know you have 50 acres. No one knew it
would get this big.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty on restrictor plate races, one of which was Saturday night
at Daytona International Speedway: ``The way I look at it, you got
40 (drivers) that all of a sudden have become good race car drivers
with a fast car. If you didn't have (the restrictor plates), cars
would be going 215 (mph instead of 195), but you'd have drivers
separating themselves from the crowd pretty dadgum quick.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (NASCAR) did it for safety, but all they did was cause
more trouble. I just don't like them, never liked to drive them and
don't even like to watch them. It's just sort of going out on the
interstate and watching 40 cars go by.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty on Jeff Gordon and Mark Martin dominating the circuit this
season: ``I've seen better racing, put it that way. You got too
many cars that are basically the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the competition is too good. When the competition gets too
good, you got a first place guy and a 20th place guy on the same
straightaway with you. That makes it stale. In order to have
racing, you've got to have somebody passing. That means you have to
have fast cars, medium cars and slow cars.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, NASCAR doesn't have that.
</P>
<P>
   What it does have is Jeff Gordon, Mark Martin and little else.
</P>
<P>
   In Petty's prime, however, all NASCAR seemingly had was Petty.
</P>
<P>
   Petty's 200 victories, 172 of which came during a 13-year span
between 1962-75, may be as unapproachable as Joe DiMaggio's 56-game
hitting streak or Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game.
</P>
<P>
   Petty, 61, also won seven driving titles, a crown he shares with
Dale Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon may be the driver to one day surpass Petty's legendary
feats, but even NASCAR's present-day Sir Lancelot realizes no one
ever will dethrone the King.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's (Petty) been the one who set the standards for all of
us,'' Gordon said in a telephone interview. ``He set the standards
on the racetrack by his performance and off it by the way he
handles himself with the fans and the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that's sort of the benchmark I look at. It's what being
a NASCAR Winston Cup driver is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershel McGriff, 70, whose first NASCAR race was in 1950, said
the sanctioning body couldn't have hand picked a better
representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important for NASCAR is having a really good image, not
like the NBA right now with their bickering and fighting,'' said
McGriff, who was Petty's driving teammate for a few races during
the 1970s. ``And Richard is probably more responsible for that than
anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been a big booster for NASCAR. He's signed
thousands and thousands of autographs, and always has had time for
the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually everyone ever associated with the sport has a kind
word to reflect upon Petty, whose father, Lee, ranks No. 7 on the
all-time winning list with 55, and son, Kyle, has eight career
victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's contributed more to the sport than any other
individual,'' said retired driver Junior Johnson, chosen by
``Sports'' ``Illustrated'' the top driver in NASCAR history. ``And
even though he's been one of the highest people ever in the history
of racing, he's never let his attitude get out of hand. He's given
to the sport a lot more than he's took from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditto Bill Elliott, a 12-time winner of NASCAR's Most Popular
Driver award.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, when it gets a little hard for me to deal with
people, I think of how Richard would act in the same situation,''
Elliott said. ``He's been a role model for every driver, sponsor
and for NASCAR.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what you would expect from a King. &QL;

EVANS DEMANDS 3 D'S, COMMANDS RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - So you want to be a Sun Devil and play basketball
at Arizona State for Rob Evans? Good. But you'd better have some
skills. Not necessarily Parade All-American Super Prep Best of the
Universe Render Dick Vitale Speechless skills, but basic talent,
raw instinct. This is the Big Time, the Pac-10. Arizona, UCLA and
all that. They're not taking any stiffs. Why should he?
</P>
<P>
   There are a few other things you ought to know, as well.
</P>
<P>
   You must play defense. Constantly. Relentlessly.
</P>
<P>
   You must bust your . . . Whoops. Sorry, no cursing. Or
trash-talking. Or showing off of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   You must go to class and study hall. Everyone. No exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   When you attend a function or represent the team, no hats. Can't
even wear 'em forward. No earrings. When you walk through an
airport, you are presentable. No, not a coat and tie. Just
presentable.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they can't have any of those ear deals on,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Ear deals? You mean ear phones?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, ear phones.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Evans is 52 years old and not entirely aware of the
advances in portable audio. But he might be a marketing dream.
Attention, slick suits: Evans is so out, he's in. ``Old school''
has become a hip, trendy expression, and Rob Evans is one room,
kindergarten through 12th grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old school with an open mind,'' he said. ``I'm not an ogre.
But my job is to make sure we win basketball games. And my job also
is to mature the young.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not shore up the crumbling world economic markets while
you're at it?
</P>
<P>
   No, these goals are enough. They are inordinately difficult to
achieve, yet Evans has achieved them, dating back to his 24 years
as an assistant coach _ seven at New Mexico State, 15 at Texas
Tech, two more at Oklahoma State _ and, most notably, his six years
as the head coach at Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   He has succeeded at every level, which include his playing days
at Lubbock Christian and New Mexico State, through bulldog
determination, a firm grasp of strategy and nuance and a rigid
adherence to a few basic principles. As ASU opens its 1998-99
season under its third coach in three years _ practice began
Saturday _ he will try to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   There is not one person with whom Evans comes in contact who
believes he won't. But he has help. Not surprisingly, his coaching
staff _ Russ Pennell and Dan O'Dowd, who followed him from Ole
Miss, and Tony Benford, who came from New Mexico _ are the most
fervent disciples.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could all be head coaches, too,'' said senior forward
Mike Batiste, whose academic slide was halted at missing the first
eight games largely through the staff's intervention and crisis
management. ``The way they work so hard to push us, to get us into
game shape. The way they check on us in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're real serious about everything. Like Coach Evans said,
`If you're not here to get an education, walk out the door.' He's
real strict, but it's all part of being disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   Discipline is written on the back of the Sun Devils' practice
jerseys. Defense is on the shorts. The third component of Evans'
Three D's, dedication, rests inside the uniform. Corny, huh? Sure.
And so is the story of how Evans went to Oxford, Miss., to become
the first black basketball coach there, and how with the
Confederate flag and the band playing ``Dixie'' as a backdrop he
took the Rebels from the scrap heap to the the top of the
Southeastern Conference. He ran his players, pushed them, ran them,
benched them, ran them, suspended them. The suspensions came early,
during the feeling-out process. Eventually, everyone knew what to
expect.
</P>
<P>
   Live clean. Play hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole lot easier to do things right and enjoy life than
it is to do things wrong and sit around and feel bad about it,''
Evans said. ``We have fun if we do things properly. It's imperative
that we teach life's lessons to these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, Evans and some other black coaches get together to
talk basketball and anything else that might be relevant, like the
real world. Evans calls it an ``enhancement seminar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk a lot about X's and O's, but it's more than that,'' he
said. ``If we don't teach life's lessons, where else are they going
to get it? They have to understand there are consequences when they
do things they're not supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans and his wife, Carolyn, have two children _ Damon, a banker
in Memphis who is moving to the Valley to get his MBA or go to law
school, and Amber, a student at Mesa Community College majoring in
broadcast journalism. A character in one of the novels by John
Grisham, a family friend back in Oxford, is named for Damon. But
Evans' extended family is huge. People seem to gravitate to Evans
and seek his advice, fatherly or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   With his team, this is mandatory. Evans requires that every
player come in and talk, if only for a few minutes, every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn a lot talking face-to-face,'' Batiste said. ``About
life. How to be a man. I mean, my dad was in and out of the house
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans has been in Tony Benford's house, and life, a lot. They
both grew up in Hobbs, N.M., and are distant cousins. Benford
played at Texas Tech when Evans was an assistant there. Before
that, Evans drove Benford to the Texas Tech basketball camp, Hobbs
to Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been a father figure to me,'' Benford said. ``He's
always led by example. `This is the way you operate. Work hard,
good things are gonna come. No one's gonna give you anything.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember him telling me there's a direct correlation between
hard work and success. I really respect the guy because he's
persevered. . . . What you see with the coach is what you get.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans was supposed to follow Gerald Myers as the Texas Tech head
coach, but it didn't work out. So he spent a couple of years with
Eddie Sutton at Oklahoma State, and then Ole Miss happened. ASU
fans take heart. Whatever Evans is inheriting doesn't make half the
mess of what he previously stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a difficult assignment, but the assignment at Ole
Miss, I can't even begin to tell you,'' he said. ``It would take a
whole week to talk about the situation, the problems. There was
absolutely no tradition. They did not have a Division I player on
the team. The facilities were unreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie (Sutton) tried to talk me out of it. I would have talked
me out of it if I knew then what I know now.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans, in effect, worked a miracle, not only competing with the
Kentuckys and Georgias and South Carolinas, but beating and even
surpassing some of them.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. Now what?
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge here, first of all, is getting people in place,
getting the fan support,'' he said. ``You've got to win home games,
you've got to get that home-court advantage. We need ASU people in
the stands. The other challenge is a winning attitude. I always
talk to the kids about thinking big, not thinking small.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I tell them is, `You've got to dream.' '' &QL;

<P>
   PHOENIX - ``Da foe'' for the Phoenix Coyotes Monday night at
America West Arena is ``Lord Byron,'' and don't think for a moment
the Coyotes aren't aware of it.
</P>
<P>
   Bad puns aside, the man in question is actually Byron Dafoe, the
27-year-old Boston Bruins goalie who made a big name for himself in
the NHL last season. Twice he had the Coyotes eating out of his
hand, posting a 3-2 overtime win in Phoenix and a 5-2 victory at
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very good goalie,'' Coyotes goaltending coach Benoit
Allaire says. ``He's very quick and he's tough on the second and
third shots. He always keeps himself between the puck and the net
and he never gives up.''
</P>
<P>
   That assessment comes as no big surprise for fans of the former
Phoenix Roadrunners of the International Hockey League. Dafoe has
long been big in their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   In a 49-game stay with the Roadrunners during the 1994-95
season, Dafoe set franchise records for wins, minutes and shutouts,
as he posted a 25-16-6 record while on loan from the Washington
Capitals organization.
</P>
<P>
   So popular was the 5-foot-11, 190-pound netminder, that he was
afforded the rarest of honors any minor-league player can receive _
his own official fan club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always enjoy coming back to Phoenix,'' Dafoe said Saturday,
a day after suffering his first defeat, a 2-1 setback to the Los
Angeles Kings in overtime. ``I still have a lot of friends and
great memories there. I'll still probably have some fans who will
be pulling for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I own a house there, and it's the city where I plan on
retiring.''
</P>
<P>
   While Dafoe was on loan to Phoenix, the brain trust of the Los
Angeles Kings, the Roadrunners' NHL affiliate, were so impressed
with him that they packaged Alexander Volchkov and Justin Davis to
trade for him and Dimitri Khristich.
</P>
<P>
   He had two solid years as a part-time starter for the Kings
before he and Khristich were sent to Boston for Jozef Stumpel,
Sandy Moger and a fourth-round draft pick just weeks before the
season started last year.
</P>
<P>
   It was only fitting that his 100th career victory came in the
overtime win in Phoenix last season.
</P>
<P>
   Just as his performances with the Roadrunners made him a wanted
commodity, that win helped propel him to a season record of
30-25-9. He became the first Bruins' goalie since Jon Casey to win
30 games (1993-94) and his six shutouts were the most since famed
backstop Pete Peeters had eight in 1982-83.
</P>
<P>
   His 2.24 goals-against average was the best he's posted at any
level of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, (last season) didn't come as that big of a surprise to me
because I always thought I had it in me,'' said Dafoe, who is 2-1-1
with two shutouts entering tonight's game at San Jose. ``I had a
couple of good years in Los Angeles, but I'd start four or five
games and then I'd go to the bench and be forgotten about for
awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bruins Coach) Pat Burns came in last year and gave me a
chance to play. He played me for four or five games early and I did
pretty well, so he stayed with me. It was really the first time in
the NHL that I've been the main guy and I worked hard to keep it.
His faith in me really helped my confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns' close to the vest defensive style received most of the
credit for the Bruins' rebound from a 26-47-9 season two years ago
to make the playoffs last season, where they exited in six
first-round games to eventual Stanley Cup finalist Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes captain Keith Tkachuk, however, said he believes it's
Dafoe who deserves most of the credit for the Bruins turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston as a whole had a great year, but it all starts with
your goaltender,'' Tkachuk said. ``Him stepping up and already
having back-to-back shutouts this year just shows how much he has
become their main guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an unbelievable year. He's just tough to beat. He's so
quick. I'm glad we don't play him more often. We knew he was good
from Los Angeles, but it was a big jump for him. He got a chance to
start and just turned it up another level. He was their MVP last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   No Coyote better knows Dafoe's value to the Bruins than center
Mike Sullivan, who played for Boston last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just terrific for us,'' Sullivan said. ``He's a guy who
really works hard and makes a lot of second-effort saves. Some guys
think they have him beat, or he seems to be down and out, and
somehow he gets a glove or a pad on the puck for a second or third
save.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he played so well he gave our team that much more
confidence and he's certainly a big part of the Bruins right now.''
</P>
<P>
   While Dafoe's 1.97 goals-against average against Phoenix last
season suggests differently, he said he is bringing a healthy
respect into Monday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix is a very talented team with guys like Tkachuk,
(Jeremy) Roenick, (Greg) Adams and (Rick) Tocchet,'' he said.
``We're going to have to play a conservative style because we can't
run and gun with them because they probably have more guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll play tight defensively and take care of the
puck against them.'' &QL;

ROENICK LOSES WISDOM TEETH 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ.- Spectators at Saturday's Phoenix Coyotes
practice were surprised to see rookie  &UR; Daniel Briere skating at
center with the No. 1 line instead of  &UR; Jeremy Roenick.
</P>
<P>
   While the move definitely shows Briere is ready to return to
action after the concussion he suffered in the final preseason game
against Anaheim, it was not a significant move.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick was absent from practice after having four wisdom teeth
pulled on Friday. Defenseman  &UR; Keith Carney also sat out the workout
because of back spasms but is expected to be ready for Monday
night's game against Boston.
</P>
<P>
   While Briere's presence with the No. 1 line might not be
permanent, he did leave a dandy drop pass that  &UR; Keith Tkachuk
quickly one-timed for a goal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEW NUMBER: How hard was Briere hit by Anaheim's  &UR; Ruslan
 &UR; Salei? &UR; Hard enough to knock 46 numbers off his game sweater. The
rookie has scrapped the No. 54 and will wear No. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first number I had when I started playing hockey,''
Briere said. ``And I wore it in juniors for awhile, too. I'm glad,
but I was happy with No. 54 as long I as I got to stay in the
NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   Briere said  &UR; Jim Johnson, &UR; who wore the digit last season before
retiring and joining the team's radio broadcast as an analyst, has
given him some friendly grief about taking the number.
</P>
<P>
   What, Johnson thought the Coyotes would retire it? &QL;

FALL LEAGUE OFFERS BIG NAMES TO LURE FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Last week wasn't the greatest for  &UR; Steve Cobb,
executive vice-president of the Fall League.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up a case of food poisoning, and while attempting to,
uh, alleviate the condition, passed out in his bathroom. He smacked
into a door and wound up with 11 stitches in his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks I got into a fight with  &UR; Mike Tyson,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he suffered a recurrence of the problem, but it was
nothing a bottle of Mylanta couldn't cure.
</P>
<P>
   He also felt better because of a big turnout at HoHoKam Park on
Friday night. The United Way of Mesa bought and distributed most of
the tickets, and former Chicago Cubs star  &UR; Ryne Sandberg was there
autographing baseballs. The crowd of 2,241 was the Fall League's
largest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   So far, attendance averages 340 a game. Not great, but better
than last year. Cobb is encouraged about a promotional campaign
that brings Diamondbacks and Hall of Famers (present and future) to
the ballparks to sign some baseballs and generally be a presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to pick certain games and make them special
events,'' he said. ``We try to increase (the crowds on) those
nights rather than worry what we're going to do on Tuesday
afternoon at 1 o'clock. Frankly, I'm not sure what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks such as  &UR; Andy Benes and  &UR; Matt Williams have
participated in Wednesday night games. The roster of Hall of Famers
who have come out for Saturday night games includes  &UR; Bob Gibson and
 &UR; Lou Brock, with many more scheduled. Among them are  &UR; Tom Seaver,
Jim Palmer, Gaylord
 &UR; Perry, Joe Morgan, Brooks Robinson, Rod Carew, Don Sutton and
 &UR; Robin
 &UR; Yount.
</P>
<P>
   Future Hall of Famer (and Diamondbacks pitcher?)  &UR; Randy Johnson
was just added to the list. He's scheduled to sign autographs at a
playoff game Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fly them in, and not one player has received compensation,
nor asked for it,'' said Cobb, who credits the work of Director of
Baseball Operations  &UR; Frank Robinson, a Hall of Famer himself, for
making it happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to fill the stadiums, we realize that,'' Cobb
said. ``We're trying to take a special-event approach and build up
20 or 30 of the games. We're also offering name-recognition. While
we have good players, people don't know who they are. One year ago
exactly, if you said the name,  &UR; David Dellucci, what would it mean?
One year later, you say David Dellucci, you have a lot of females
saying, `Where?' '' &QL; 
New Scorpion &QL; 
The decision to add  &UR; Julius Matos to the Diamondbacks contingent on
the Scottsdale Scorpions, replacing the injured  &UR; Danny Klassen,
wasn't that difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Like Klassen, Matos is a shortstop. And he's good. Matos was the
only position player from the Class-A High Desert club to make the
postseason California League All-Star team (pitcher  &UR; Brad Penny
also was selected).
</P>
<P>
   Purchased from Sioux City of the independent Northern League in
1997, Matos, 23, hit .301 with 19 stolen bases last season. He was
a 16th-round draft pick of the Cleveland Indians in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a nice year in High Desert, and he's somebody we think
will benefit from this level of competition,'' Diamondbacks General
Manager  &UR; Joe Garagiola Jr. said. ``It's also a chance to find out a
little more about him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks seem to have an abundance of proven and
promising middle infielders. There are  &UR; Jay Bell and  &UR; Tony Batista
with the big club, plus Klassen,  &UR; Junior Spivey and Matos. &QL;

PITY THE PENGUINS, NOT THEIR OWNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Rick Tocchet remembers the good times. In a lot of ways, they
were some of the best moments of his hockey career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning the Stanley Cup,'' the Coyotes veteran forward said,
``isn't something you forget.''
</P>
<P>
   But oh, how far the mighty have fallen. The Pittsburgh Penguins,
whom Tocchet helped lead to the second of back-to-back
championships in 1991-92, have gone from the glory years to the
sorry years faster than the pet-rock fad of the '70s fell out of
style.
</P>
<P>
   Bellbottoms, platform shoes and (gulp) even disco have made a
recovery, but the once-proud Penguins might never be able to make
it back after the incredible financial mess brought on by unethical
co-owners  &UR; Howard Baldwin and  &UR; Roger Marino, who might be the two
biggest frauds in the history of the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Their incompetence, lack of foresight, and incredible string of
bad business deals have led the franchise to complete shame and
shambles. They owe money _ millions of dollars _ to hundreds of
people and the line of lawsuits stacked against them is longer than
the lines outside the ticket office at the Civic Arena. The city
has sued them. The county has sued them. Television networks have
sued them. Duped investors have sued them.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, it finally caught up to them. Baldwin and Marino, who
have been feuding over control of the club, jointly agreed to file
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. And NHL Commissioner  &UR; Gary Bettman let
them. How pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real disheartening to me,'' Tocchet said. ``Just the
other day, (teammate)  &UR; Mike Sullivan was asking me where my
favorite place to play was and I told him Pittsburgh. Not just
because I won a Cup there. But because it's a great hockey town. To
think all this crap has happened, that there's a possibility they
might even move, I just can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bettman and the league were strong, Baldwin and Marino would
be stripped of their ownership, and the NHL would step in
immediately and operate the franchise until a suitable owner could
be found, which wouldn't take long.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin and Marino, who claim they have lost $37 million the
past two seasons, don't just owe retired superstar  &UR; Mario Lemieux
$28 million in back pay. According to sources, they also owe  &UR; Kevin
 &UR; Stevens, who hasn't played for the Pens since 1995, an estimated
$600,000. What's more, Marino borrowed $2.5 million just so the
team could meet payroll on Thursday and pay its players. &QL; 
Just curious, but what person in his right mind would give that
kind of a loan to a guy who filed for bankruptcy just 48 hours
earlier? Bettman, maybe?
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin and Marino, despite their dishonesty and shady deals,
are probably going to get away with running this franchise into the
ground. If they get their wish, they'll get a new arena built, soak
more investors for all they're worth, and be absolved of most of
their debts. What a travesty, should that be the case.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble in Tampa &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The truth behind the firings last week of Tampa Bay Lightning
General Manager  &UR; Phil Esposito and his brother, assistant  &UR; Tony
 &UR; Esposito, really had nothing to do with on-ice performance from the
Dead Bolts.
</P>
<P>
   Quite frankly, new Owner  &UR; Art Williams didn't like the Esposito
brothers' work ethic and he was livid that Phil was already $5
million over budget. The team's payroll now stands at $33 million,
among the top-third in the league. Williams also sought the advice
of other executives around the NHL. The prevailing response was to
get rid of the Espo boys and move on.
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Jaques Demers, who already had been promoted to director
of player personnel, will run the show on his own until a new
management type can be found. There is speculation that  &UR; Jack
Ferreira, the vice president of hockey operations for the Mighty
Ducks of Anaheim, will be offered the assistant GM job.
</P>
<P>
   Though many in the NHL didn't find the Esposito firings a huge
surprise, the timing of it _ just two games into the regular season
_ is a bit of shock. Williams, though, indicated there's never a
bad time to correct a bad situation. Translation: He waited until
Phil finalized the rest of the player contracts, including that of
rookie
 &UR; Vincent Lecavalier, the No. 1 overall draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Phil Esposito said he would have glady accepted a
lesser role to remain with the organization. Williams wouldn't
offer him one, prefering to make a clean break and start over. &QL; 
Told you so
</P>
<P>
   Remember last week's item about tough-as-nails new Coach  &UR; Dirk
Graham in Chicago? Well, it only took a couple of losses for the
former Blackhawk to start cracking the whip. And he wasn't afraid
to snap it at a few of the club's veterans.
</P>
<P>
   After getting flattened by Dallas and Anaheim, Graham threatened
to make wholesale changes and even suggested he might bench a star
player or two. ``Certainly from some of the guys, I haven't liked
what I've seen,'' he said. ``I think we're at a stage where we need
to make some decisions.'' &QL;

HMO? POS? CHOICES SPELL CONFUSION FOR EMPLOYEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAX JARMAN AND JODIE SNYDER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Across the state, Arizonans are studying materials perplexing
enough to give even scholars a headache: their employee benefits
packets.
</P>
<P>
   Which health plan to select from an alphabet soup of
possibilities: HMO, PPO, POS? Which insurer to choose? What happens
if you are given only one choice?
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time for many of the 1.2 million Arizonans covered by
HMOs to do their health-care homework as their employers offer the
annual chance to change benefits or choose new plans.
</P>
<P>
   Considering managed-care's turbulence over the last year,
enrollees have plenty of brain-busting subjects to consider when it
comes to picking a plan:
</P>
<P>
   Math: What's worth more _ lower premiums or more choice?
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in several years, enrollees are bracing
themselves for double-digit premium increases. The trade-off, say
experts, is that there are more choices available as employers
offer less restrictive programs, such as point-of-service and
preferred provider plans, which allow enrollees to go outside their
plan's network of physicians, although at greater cost.
</P>
<P>
   Geography: Where's my doctor? Mergers, contract disputes and
financial fallout have made health-care delivery as complicated as
Balkan politics. With more pressure by employers to offer a wider
variety of care at a lower cost, look for even more upheaval,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Political science: Which candidate is right? HMO reform is a
1998 campaign hot button in state and national elections.
</P>
<P>
   As Arizonans select plans, they are hearing advertising
campaigns with horror stories of people denied life-saving
procedures by pencil-pushing insurance adjusters.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the state Insurance Department has a
grievance plan so people can complain about plans' arbitrary
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it may be home economics that is the most
important subject when it's time to choose, said Mary Rybka, owner
of MR Consultants, a Mesa business that helps people figure out and
fight their health-care bills.
</P>
<P>
   It's essential that people understand their own health-care
situation and how the fine-print insurance rules affect them, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're younger, look at how it covers pregnancy. If your
child is older, you should think about emergency-room visits. What
does the book say about this?''
</P>
<P>
   Rybka suggests people take yellow highlighting pens to their 12-
to 15-page benefits book and dissect them. A dictionary may come in
handy as well, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the terminology is very sophisticated. I just had a
client whose ER visits are covered only if they are `emergent.'
What the heck does `emergent' mean?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, what seems like an emergency at the time may not end
up being one. It's important to know how they (the plans) handle
that. How do they define emergent?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Patients also need to consider future needs as well, said Dr.
Michelle May, an Ahwatukee physician and president of the Arizona
Academy of Family Physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think since there is no medical crisis going on in
their lives and they only see the doctor once a year, they may as
well save a few bucks,'' May said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then something happens and they are unhappy to learn that
there are restrictions on who they see and what drugs they get.
They perceive the doctors as restricting their care, when it's
actually their choice of plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are sick, that is the last stress that you want to
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients already living with chronic conditions also need to
delve into the details, said Sunny Carpenter, director of program
operations for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.
</P>
<P>
   MS patients frequently complain to Carpenter that their plan
will take them but not cover their condition, labelling it
pre-existing. Or they will deny treatment for as long as a year
after they enroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another question is if they will pay for the current
treatments on the market. These are big deals, costing $15,000 a
year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are certain things plans must have.
</P>
<P>
   If a plan brags about offering yearly mammograms for women 50
years and older or paying for 48-hour maternity stays for vaginal
deliveries, don't be overwhelmed _ state statute requires them to
do that, said Vista Brown, state Insurance Department spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, however, plans are going beyond the basics.
</P>
<P>
   Employers who want to keep and attract workers are asking
insurers for more variety, said Gay Ann Williams, executive
director of the Arizona Association of Health Maintenance
Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   That means HMOs are now compelled to add services at a time
while they are struggling to think of additional cost-cutting
measures, creating an uneasy mixture of higher rates and increased
competition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Industry instability could trigger additional mergers and
acquisitions, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona consumers already have seen a revolving door of changes:
</P>
<P>
   Locally owned HealthPartners Health Plans this year was bought
by Minneapolis-based United HealthCare, a relative newcomer to the
state.
</P>
<P>
   FHP Health Care was sold last year to Pacificare of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Intergroup of Arizona was bought by California's Foundation
Health Corp. in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   There may be even more changes from the fallout from the July
bankruptcy of San Diego-based FPA Medical Management Inc., which
acted as an intermediary between doctors and HMOs such as
Intergroup and Pacificare.
</P>
<P>
   FPA's bankruptcy left more than 300 doctors holding the bag for
millions of dollars in services they provided and were never paid
for. It also rocked the 187,000 patients who received care from
doctors and staff at Thomas-Davis Medical Clinics operated by FPA.
</P>
<P>
   All this instability means that you may not end up with the
insurer or doctor you signed up with in the beginning, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   It also indicates the importance of also doing your homework on
your potential insurer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing what I know, it's just hell behind the scenes when
they do those mergers,'' Rybka said. ``People are a lot better off
avoiding being in the middle of that and going with someone who is
stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter of the MS society tells her clients to ask their
current insurers about their prospective insurer's financial
health.
</P>
<P>
   May suggests getting a doctor's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some physicians will not sign up with the plans because they
pay so poorly and in the end that has to impede good care,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other times, the plans are just not accepting new physicians.
Patients need to ask to find what they are getting themselves
into.''
</P>
<P>
   May argues that one of the first things an enrollee should
consider is who will be their doctor under the proposed plan.
</P>
<P>
   Although studies have shown that patients will change their
physicians to save $5 on a co-pay, they may regret that when they
try to get extra services, May said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patient needs to understand that the trade-off for lower
costs for themselves and their employers is some restriction on
access.''
</P>
<P>
   As family physicians have greater say-so on whether their
patients see specialists or get certain prescriptions, it's
important to have doctors that you trust, May said.
</P>
<P>
   During this campaign year, politicians as well as physicians are
talking as much about managed care.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress debates measures to rein in managed care, Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Paul Johnson has tried to make HMO reform a
campaign issue, saying HMOs should be held accountable for
decisions that kill or injure patients; offer greater accessibility
to specialists; and protect doctors who report quality problems.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull's campaign has said that there may be a general
sense of dissatisfaction with managed care, but that the state has
a system in place to protect patients, including a new state law
that allows people who have claims or services denied by their HMOs
to go through an informal review. If the matter isn't resolved,
they go through a formal appeal. If necessary, they then can have
the case reviewed by a doctor with the state Insurance Department.

   Rybka, who works with health-care consumers daily, is taking a
wait-and-see attitude on the new grievance plan.
</P>
<P>
   She does strongly suggest that people brush up on their civics
and complain to their state legislators if they aren't getting
proper care.
</P>
<P>
   But when they select a managed care plan, what they may need the
most is a crash course in assertiveness, Rybka said.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, one of her clients was told by her HMO that her
headache medicine was covered. When she tried to fill the
prescription, however, she was denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took her three months of pushing but she got what she
needed,'' Rybka said. ``You've just go to learn to push for
things.'' &QL;  &QL;

STUDY FINDS THAT LITTLE PRESSURES ADD UP IN DAILY LIFE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Researchers are providing the first wide-angle view of America's
daily rat race, and you're likely to spot yourself in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   The most common causes of stress aren't muggings, traffic
tickets or money woes, but the little things that add up each day:
burning dinners, hunting for parking spaces, running late, dealing
with rude neighbors. And a lot of the strain comes from the very
same people who enrich our lives _ friends, relatives, children,
co-workers and spouses.
</P>
<P>
   Called the National Study of Daily Experiences, the project's
11,000 telephone interviews with 1,500 people in 48 states _ mostly
people at midlife _ chronicle loss, danger, disappointment and
frustration, along with simple pleasures and unselfish service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The daily lives that Americans endure are disturbingly
stressful,'' said David Almeida, 34, the lead investigator and an
assistant professor of family studies at the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter if you're a graduate student trying to juggle
studies with a social life, a parent shuttling kids between school
and soccer games or an executive dealing with an unruly staff;
stress affects practically everyone. Only 8 percent in the Daily
Experiences study said they didn't experience stress.
</P>
<P>
   To better understand life in the '90s, researchers called the
same people for eight consecutive days and asked them about their
routines and the stresses they experienced.
</P>
<P>
   The results: The top two sources of stress involved arguments or
tensions with others at work or home. Together they made up more
than 16 percent of the reported stresses. Worrying about someone
else's health was third, followed by work overload _ not having
enough time at work or home.
</P>
<P>
   Being concerned about relatives or friends in trouble was fifth
in line as a major stress.
</P>
<P>
   Money, stress No. 6, didn't rank as high as many might expect,
perhaps because a strong economy prevailed during the survey
period.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the eight days, many people, having grown used to
a daily telephone call from someone who was interested in their
problems, expressed sadness that the calls would stop.
</P>
<P>
   According to Almeida, they didn't have anyone call them up every
night to talk about job promotions, changing relationships,
computers crashing, or partners who wanted too much or too little
sex.
</P>
<P>
   That unexpected response made Almeida and other researchers
realize the profound isolation many people feel in today's culture.
</P>
<P>
   The study of daily stress is part of a larger National Survey of
Midlife in the United States, which is focusing on people ages 40
to 60. Midlifers are being studied because far less is known about
them than seniors and children. People as young as 25 and as old as
74 also were included for comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding more about the everyday tensions of life is
important, Almeida said, because of their frequency daily stresses
are thought to affect physical and psychological health as much as
big events such as a divorce or the death of a spouse.
</P>
<P>
   The findings have implications for future public policies,
workplace decisions, health programs and family counseling.
</P>
<P>
   We experience tension at home, at work, even in our cars, said
Almeida, who lives close to the UA campus so he can walk to the
office.
</P>
<P>
   About 9 percent of reported stressful events happen in
automobiles, from not being able to find a parking spot to a family
pet falling out. Drivers get lost, get to work late, get stuck in
traffic and have angry run-ins with other drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The study found direct connections between stress and health. On
days when people reported having significant daily stress they were
two or three times more likely to report stomach pains, headaches
or muscle pains.
</P>
<P>
   Even though being connected _ having a stable social life _ is a
sign of health, the study confirmed that women have different daily
lives than men.
</P>
<P>
   Women are more distressed by a son or daughter having a bad day
at school, a sister stuck in a bad relationship or a friend having
a tough time at work. Men are more affected by work stresses, such
as overload or pending deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   It feeds the stereotypes of women being nurturers and men being
providers, Almeida said. But it also could be that men aren't
reporting someone else's problems as their stress.
</P>
<P>
   The frequency of daily stress declines as people get older.
Women ages 35 to 45 had stressful days 50 percent of the time. By
age 60, women report daily stresses on 30 percent of the days.
</P>
<P>
   Men's peak stress years are between 25 and 34, when they report
almost half of their days as being stressful. By age 60, it's only
about one in five.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the interview period, people were asked how they
viewed the stresses of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Younger and older people had the same number of days when they
were feeling sad, angry or agitated. But young people were more
likely to say the whole week was stressful, while older people
tended to give credit to the good moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is part of the wisdom of growing older _ part of
maturing,'' Almeida said. ``We eventually learn to deal with
irritations and put them in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   For many people, relationships aren't working or aren't there.
Single people talked about beginning new relationships or resuming
old ones. They described difficult first dates, breaking dates and
being dumped or stood up.
</P>
<P>
   They talked about the compromises: ``We're getting married, and
he's arguing about the amount of money for the honeymoon,'' said
one bride-to-be. ``I had to call a travel agent to try to find
something cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman allowed researchers to interview her throughout
the stressful week before the wedding. In the last phone
conversation, the researcher could hear the band playing at the
reception in the background as the new bride reported on the flood
of little problems that describe a modern wedding.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding is just the beginning. Married couples said the
stresses of their schedules don't give them enough time with each
other, and they described a lack of truthfulness and mutual
respect, an uneven division of responsibility for cleaning the
house, and stresses arising from political, religious and
philosophical differences.
</P>
<P>
   Separations, breakups and divorces sometimes swept over the
normal daily stresses.
</P>
<P>
   A man talked about the stress of trying to understand his wife's
decision to proceed with a divorce: ``She just wants a single life.
That's what I am hearing so far. I'm trying to rationalize that
there is something I did, but she says nothing. That's stressful.''
</P>
<P>
   Several families on vacation took part in the study by calling
an 800 number, confirming that vacations often are more stressful
than working, especially for young families with children. Almost
every day on the road included some major conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Frictions and jealousies, even among friends, were in the daily
reports. A woman, proud to have received an award for her volunteer
work, said that an envious friend tried to downplay it by saying it
was no big deal and that she knew of somebody else who had
volunteered for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first instinct was to get angry and lash out, but it's not
worth it,'' she said, proud that she had managed to control her
emotions. ``This lady is just that way.''
</P>
<P>
   School and work present major stresses. Parents worry about
getting their kids into college, and adult students worried about
how to balance class demands with other needs of life. At work, the
computerized cubicle office is seen as a life-numbing assembly
line, sometimes full of boredom and conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women talked about the problems associated with changes
in their workplaces, often described as unfair overwork. They
talked about starting new jobs, quitting, demotion, dismissal and
downsizing. Stress came from missed deadlines, boredom, lack of
challenge and relentless interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Said one man: ``It seemed like everybody all day today had
questions. I hardly had 10 minutes to think before somebody would
come in with another question.''
</P>
<P>
   Some complained about computers crashing, work vehicles breaking
down, threats of eviction, hassles of moving and problems with rude
neighbors. They complained about not accomplishing enough at home,
work or school.
</P>
<P>
   With more people working at home now, the line between home
stress and work stress is fuzzier, Almeida said. For home office
workers, the problems of home can no longer be escaped for nine
hours in the middle of the day, and work problems can't be avoided
after 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A suicide attempt, a major accident, a heart attack, a daughter
having an abortion were in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   But the news isn't all bad.
</P>
<P>
   To the daily interview question ``Did you help anybody out
today?'' came answers that describe Americans as a generous people.
In general, older people give money, midlifers give emotional
support, and young people give practical, hands-on help.
</P>
<P>
   Interview subjects also shared the good moments, especially
where they felt appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent about an hour with my wife discussing her yearly
review at work, including how she's going to approach some of the
problems she has to deal with,'' one midlife husband said. ``It
makes me feel good that she values my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   And to the question ``Were you productive today at work and at
home?'' came surprisingly positive answers. A day that one person
might find anxiety-ridden might stimulate another person.
</P>
<P>
   One mother, for example, described an incredibly busy day of
opening and closing her store and running her children and assorted
other people all over town, only to conclude that, ``I feel good
about myself for being able to get it all done today.''
</P>
<P>
   The information from the interviews is so rich and complex that
Almeida says he will be mining it for several years in research
papers and possibly a book. The results may suggest additional
lines of research that will be useful to sociologists,
psychologists, business planners and others.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, it will help counselors, ministers and others
identify people who may be at risk for stress that could be
damaging to their health, Almeida said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our stresses are self-imposed, but others are from
survival,'' Almeida said. Some causes are genetic; others depend on
how much money you make or how old you are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't make intelligent changes in our lives unless we can
objectively see what's going on,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot more to learn, he said, and he is just beginning
to look deeper and share his findings.
</P>
<P>
   On the Web site for the UA family studies home page, Almeida
chose a photo of himself cruising a sidewalk on a skateboard.
Putting a little more fun in your day and organizing your life away
from cars and commuting are among the important lessons he has
learned from listening to 1,500 people's daily stresses. &QL;
