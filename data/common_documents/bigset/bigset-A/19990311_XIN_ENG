<HEADLINE> Spanish Basque Separatists Suffer Another Blow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Spanish police arrested nine
suspected members of the Basque separatist group ETA Wednesday,
following the capture of six suspected ETA men by French police in
Paris on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Spanish officials said the arrests marked the dismantling of
ETA's so-called Donosti Commando, which police blame for the
kidnap and murder of Miguel Angel Blanco, a popular young city
councilor, in July 1997. The death of the councilor triggered an
anti-ETA wave across Spain.
</P>
<P>
The Basque region, which is in the north of Spain, is home to
more than 1.25 million people of Basque ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
More than 800 people, including many civilians, have been
killed by ETA, since it was set up in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The police action against the ETA has gained wide support even
from the opposition parties in Spain. Many believe the strike is
necessary to maintain the normal operation of a legitimate country,
and it is good for the domestic peace process.

<HEADLINE> SMEs Play Decisive Role in EU, Eurostat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Small and Medium-sized
enterprises (SME) with fewer than 250 employees each are playing a
decisive role in the 15-nation European Union (EU), the EU
statistical office, Eurostat, reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Almost all 18 million EU firms in the non-agricultural sectors
are SMEs. Currently, the SMEs provide two-thirds of EU jobs, "
Therefore they play a decisive role in the EU," said Eurostat.
</P>
<P>
In the EU region, jobs are divided almost equally among firms
with fewer than 10 employees, those with fewer than 250, and large
enterprises with 250 and above. However, the EU's 36,000 large
enterprises account for 45 percent of total turnover, Eurostat
said.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat said very small enterprises are often self-employed
people in craft activities, in construction, small family
businesses in the trade, hotel and restaurant sectors. They are
also active in real estate and other services.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises with 10-49 workers account for 19 percent of all
firms EU-wide. The situation is comparable in all member states,
which is never more than six percentage points from the average.
These firms dominate such sectors as metal processing, clothing
and leather industries and wholesales, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Medium-sized firms average about 95 employees in EU states. In
Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg, they employ an above average
proportion of the workforce. Most of such firms are engaged in
manufacturing. In Luxembourg and the Netherlands, they are also
very active in service sectors such as computer science, Eurostat
added.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Impotence Pill Viagra Approved in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Viagra, the anti-impotence pill,
has received its final approval from Health Canada on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Growing anticipation for Viagra among Canadian men is expected
to make it one of the country's hottest selling drugs when it
becomes available in about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Health Canada approved the drug after a two-year safety review.
According to clinical trials, which involved about 500 Canadians,
viagra was effective in seven out of 10 men.
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 Canadian men -- about 10 percent of the
estimated three million who suffer from erectile dysfunction
associated with a range of medical conditions, including diabetes,
multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular disease, and depression -- are
expected to seek treatment.
</P>
<P>
Viagra's approval in Canada had been delayed because of adverse
reactions reported in other countries. Presently more than 50
countries have approved Viagra.

<HEADLINE> EU Publishes Candidate Countries' Real GDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
Wednesday published for the first time the growth rate of real
gross domestic product (GDP) of 11 EU candidate countries, who are
expected to obtain the EU membership in the early next century.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat, the EU's statistical office, said in its report that
real GDP of candidate countries for accession (CCAs) of central
and eastern Europe rose by 3.4 percent in the second quarter of
1998 compared to the same quarter of 1997. This followed 3.8
percent growth in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Among the 11 CCAs, Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic,
Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, the Slovak
Republic and Slovenia, most continued their positive growth in
1998. However, two of the larger economies, the Czech Republic and
Romania, saw falls in the first half of 1998 compared to the same
period of 1997. The former fell by negative 0.9 percent in the
first quarter and negative 2.4 percent in the second quarter, the
latter by negative 9.4 percent and negative 1.9 percent
respectively, Eurostat said.
</P>
<P>
Poland, with the largest CCA economy by far, witnessed
substantial growth in 1998: 6.5 percent in the first quarter and
5.3 percent in the second quarter, compared to the same quarters
of 1997. Bulgaria registered very high growth of 18.9 percent and
6.3 percent in the first two quarters of 1998. But these should be
set against sharp falls in the first half of 1997. Growth was not
enough to regain the GDP of first half 1996, Eurostat added.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hopes to See Signed Agreement on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Wednesday morning said he hopes that the March 15 peace
talks on Kosovo can produce an agreement which is acceptable to
both warring parties in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
Voicing his hope upon his arrival at the U.N. headquarters,
Annan told reporters that the two parties "are due to meet again
on the 15th of March and I hope at that meeting we will walk away
with an agreement."
</P>
<P>
Annan made the remarks as the U.S. special envoy in the
Balkans, Richard Holbrooke, is in Belgrade for talks with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke was making the visit at the request of U.S. Secretary
of State Mandeleine Albright to try to bring the two warring
sides, ethnic Serbs and Albanians, closer before international
mediated peace talks, which will resume Monday in France.
</P>
<P>
"As you know, Ambassador Holbrooke is in Belgrade today talking
to President Milosevic, and the Contact Group in Europe are very
actively engaged in a search for peace in Kosovo," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope all these efforts will be successful and the two
parties will sign the agreement on the table," he said.
</P>
<P>
Igor Ivanov, foreign minister of Russia which opposes NATO air
strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, is due to meet
with Milosevic Friday. Russia is one of the six members of the
Contact Group in charge of the Balkan diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in Kosovo in February last year after
ethnic Albanians, who make up some 90 percent of the province's
population of 2 million, had been fighting Serbs for independence.

<HEADLINE> UK to Appoint Smuggling Tsar on Organized Tobacco Smugglers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The British government will
appoint a "smuggling tsar" to crack down on increasing criminals
who smuggle cheaper cigarettes from the European continent, a
government spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman said that container
trucks and even chartered aircraft were being used to move tobacco
products from France and Belgium into Britain, avoiding steep
British excise duties designed to discourage smoking.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was looking for a high-powered official
who could concentrate on the problem, cooperating with Britain's
Customs and Excise Service.
</P>
<P>
"We want to get someone in there who can get right to the heart
of the problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under European Union rules, Britons traveling to the continent
may bring back unlimited amounts of tobacco products for their own
use. But they break the law if they resell the products.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Gordon Brown said in his budget speech Tuesday
tobacco smuggling was now a "1-1/2 billion pounds (2.4 billion
U.S. dollars) a year racket."
</P>
<P>
The cigarette industry itself estimates one in seven cigarettes
smoked in Britain has been smuggled.
</P>
<P>
Brown, undeterred, increased tobacco duty in his budget in the
name of promoting public health.

<HEADLINE> Britain Urges EU Nations to Play Full Part in Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Wednesday urged its
European Union (EU) partners to take a strong vision and
adaptability to their military forces and defense structures to
ensure they can play their full part in the defense of the
continent.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the NATO 50th Anniversary Conference here, British
Defense Secretary George Robertson stressed the role to be played
by a reinforced European pillar of the military alliance.
</P>
<P>
European countries need to find better way of spending their
money and should assess the caliber rather than the quantity of
their military assets, Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for strong political will and decision making
processes, which can translate into smarter, integrated spending
of future equipment and a deployable, flexible and sustainable
allied troop.
</P>
<P>
"We need forces that are genuinely usable in the field and not
just on paper. Our ultimate aim is not so much a European Security
and Defense Identity but something altogether more ambitious --
namely a European Security and Defense Capability," Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
"Without effective military capability to back up European
foreign policy goals, we are wasting our time. We risk being an
economic giant but a strategic midget," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain and France last December agreed to explore the idea of
a European Security and Defense Identity, which would for the
first time give the EU the capacity to take autonomous military
action.
</P>
<P>
"I attach the highest priority to ensure that the EU is given
the structures and capabilities to ensure that military decisions
are competent and sensible ones," Robertson said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Slovak Minister of Foreign Affairs
Eduard Kukan voiced the hope here Wednesday that Slovakia would be
admitted to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
"We definitely expect some concrete signals or signs on how
NATO will open its door and what we should do to be accepted soon,
" Kukan told reporters during the "NATO at Fifty" Conference.
</P>
<P>
"For Slovakia, (joining NATO) the sooner the better. We are
ready at any time to join NATO. We are ready for that no matter
how soon it might be," said Kukan.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana told the
conference that the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland would
become the military alliance's members "in three days" time.
</P>
<P>
Kukan said Slovakia had sought to join NATO shortly after its
independence from former Czechoslovakia and would continue to work
for an early entrance into the alliance.
</P>
<P>
The "NATO at Fifty" conference, which is being held to mark the
50th anniversary of the military bloc, is scheduled to end on
Wednesday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Blair Urges Northern Irish Leaders to End Deadlock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
on Wednesday urged Northern Irish politicians to show "courage and
leadership" to break the deadlock over the province's new
government.
</P>
<P>
In an article for the Belfast Telegraph newspaper, Blair said
neither he nor any other outsider had the leverage to force an end
to the deadlock, which has delayed the formation of a coalition
executive from the original target date of March 10.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot force progress alone. Political leaders will only be
able to take part in an executive if their parties back them,"
Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Although he avoided any direct appeal to Sinn Fein and its
military arm the Irish Republican Army (IRA) to hand over their
weapons, Blair stressed arms decommissioning was a necessary part
of the Good Friday peace agreement signed last April.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement must be implemented in all its parts," Blair
wrote.
</P>
<P>
The pro-British Ulster Unionist Party refuses to form a
coalition cabinet with the Sinn Fein party unless its leader Gerry
Adams gets his IRA guerrilla allies to hand over arms.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb President Rejects Dismissal by Westendorp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb President Nikola
Poplasen said Wednesday that his dismissal by the international
High Representative in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, was "incredible
and totally unreasonable," reported Yugoslav Tanjug News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Poplasen said only the Bosnian Serb parliament had the right to
dismiss him.
</P>
<P>
Westendorp, tasked by the international community with
implementing the Dayton peace accords ending the ethnic war in
Bosnia, sacked Poplasen on March 5, accusing him of abusing his
office.
</P>
<P>
However, the Bosnian Serb parliament voted late Sunday for a
resolution rejecting the dismissal of Poplasen by 57 to 15. It
said the decision to dismiss Poplasen went against the
Constitution of the Republika Srpska and electoral rules approved
by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Westendorp said on Monday night he would not accept the Bosnian
Serb parliament's resolution and reiterated his hope that Poplasen
will "step down of his own free will."

<HEADLINE> GCC Oil Ministers Call for Output Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Oil ministers of several member
states of the Gulf Cooperation Council on Wednesday called for
slashing oil production to bolster the sagging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Oil ministers from Oman, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia made
the call in a statement issued after a meeting in Al-Shiba
, Saudi Arabia earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Given the oil price slump, the ministers consider the oil
market unfavorable neither for the producing countries nor the
oil industry in the short-run and the long-run, the Saudi News
Agency quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The current oil production situation will severely affect the
oil supplies in the future, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The countries represented at the Shiba meeting would intensify
consultations with other oil producing countries on cutting oil
output to raise the prices, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier consultations aroused hopes of the participants in the
Shiba meeting for reaching an effective agreement during the
coming few weeks to restabilize the oil market, it added.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, the other two members of
the six-nation GCC, did not attend the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Schools in England Failing Ethnic Minorities, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- State schools in England still
need to do far more to identify and meet the needs of pupils from
ethnic minorities, according to a report from the schools
inspectorate, Ofsted, released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Some schools are "institutionally racist," said Oftsed's
Director of Inspections, Jim Rose -- to the annoyance of teachers'
unions.
</P>
<P>
Rose said, "Much of that (racism), we think, is to do with
unwitting stereotyping of youngsters and the lack of expectation
or lowered expectation of teachers as a result of that sometimes."
</P>
<P>
Inspectors looked at the attitudes of 48 schools in 25 local
authority areas which had a significant percentage of pupils from
four focus groups: Bangladeshi, black Caribbean, Pakistani and
gypsy travelers. They also went to 34 other schools known to have
good practices in educating pupils from ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
It is a follow-up to a study published by Ofsted two years ago,
which showed that certain ethnic minority groups were failing to
keep up with the general rise in educational achievement.
</P>
<P>
The new report said not much has changed: schools could be
doing much more to target improvements in standards amongst ethnic
minority pupils and should put greater effort into monitoring
their results.
</P>
<P>
Chief Inspector Chris Woodhead said there were important
messages in the report for schools, local education authorities
and central government.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot afford to ignore them," he said. "Nor can we, as a
nation, ever be satisfied with an education system which fails any
sector of the community."
</P>
<P>
"This report confirms not only that significant minority ethnic
groups are not being enabled to fulfill their potential but that,
within those groups, boys are generally doing worse than girls,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Many thousands of pupils, notably black Caribbean boys, are
therefore facing double jeopardy. When you add the inner city
dimensions, the odds are brutally stacked against them. Schools
can and must make a difference."

<HEADLINE> Mordechai Vows to Advance Peace Process if Elected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Center Party leader
Yitzhak Mordechai promised on Wednesday that he will implement
the Wye peace agreement immediately if he is elected prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai told the Israel Radio that if he wins the elections
in May, he will also resume the peace talks with the Palestinians
to solve the remaining issues under the 1993 Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese peace talks will also
be re-started if his party wins the elections, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, former defense minister of the Likud government, was
dismissed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on January 23 for
what he called "disloyalty" to the right-wing group.
</P>
<P>
He joined the Center Party two days later and became the
party's candidate for the premiership.
</P>
<P>
The Center Party is scheduled to launch a election campaign
Wednesday in Tel Aviv, despite the party's platform and list of
parliament candidates have not been finalized.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu stopped implementing the Wye agreement last
December, blaming the Palestinian side for not fulfilling its
commitment in fighting terrorists and anti-Israel incitement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered agreement, signed last October in Washington,
asks Israel to hand over a further 13.1 percent of West Bank in
exchange for tougher Palestinian crackdown on terrorism.

<P>
NAIROBI, March 10 (Xinhua) --The Ethiopian embassy in Nairobi,
capital of Kenya, in a press statement Wednesday, refuted a
report that Ethiopian troops looted private properties in the
Somali border town of Balanballe Sunday night .
</P>
<P>
The press statement said, "the Ethiopian defense force is a
disciplined outfit. It has no track record of looting property or
any misconduct anywhere, any time."
</P>
<P>
A report from Mogadishu Tuesday said, "Hundreds of heavily
armed infantry Ethiopians crossed into Balanballe" Sunday night
and took away "VHF radios, quite a few guns, car-batteries and all
of the medicine in the only chemists shop of the town."
</P>
<P>
The press statement said, "These allegations are baseless and
a pack of lies which we wish to categorically refute." Such
mischievous claims were being made to tarnish Ethiopia's image or
to draw international attention, it added.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the Ethiopian defense force, aware of the intent
of some terrorist groups to make incursion into Ethiopia with
their sinister motive, while exploiting the unfortunate situation
in Somalia, will not relent in efforts in taking appropriate
measures.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia respects the territorial integrity of Somalia despite
the absence of a central government in that war-town country. We
therefore wish to emphasize that Ethiopia has been and still is
tirelessly working to bring about peace in Somalia," the press
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Albright Urges Congress Not to Debate on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright Wednesday begged Congress to put off a vote on deployment
of U.S. troops in Kosovo while negotiations were at a critical
time.
</P>
<P>
"A congressional debate now, I assure you, would complicate our
efforts to get Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians on board" for a
peace deal, Albright told a congressional committee.
</P>
<P>
The House has scheduled a full floor debate for Thursday on
whether U.S. troops should be sent to Kosovo. A Senate vote on the
same issue could come as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
Albright warned that an actual vote to oppose deployment could
be even more damaging because "it sends a totally wrong signal to
Yugoslavia as well as U.S. NATO allies."
</P>
<P>
"A vote at any time to oppose an authorization would be seen by
both sides (in Kosovo) as a green light to resume fighting," she
told a House appropriations subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
Republicans who control Congress are divided over the Clinton
administration's plan to deploy about 4,000 U.S. troops as part of
a prospective 28,000 NATO implementation force if a Kosovo peace
deal is concluded.

Albright promised to Congress that the administration "will not
make a decision on sending U.S. troops until we have an agreement
in hand and can evaluate whether it meets the conditions President
(Bill) Clinton has outlined."
</P>
<P>
Clinton has said troops will not be deployed in Kosovo unless
both sides sign a peace deal and endorse the NATO peacekeeping
operation.
</P>
<P>
Subcommittee Chairman Harold Rogers, Republican representative,
voiced skepticism toward any U.S. mission in Kosovo, asking
Albright what was the U.S. interest in being there and whether the
administration would set an exit deadline.
</P>
<P>
In answering the question, the secretary of state said, "We
know instability in the Balkans harms U.S. interests," suggesting
the conflict could easily spread to other parts of the region.
</P>
<P>
"It's easier to put out a campfire rather than a forest fire,"
she added.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday met behind closed doors to consider a report by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who recommends the extension of the
mandate of the U.N. Observer Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL) for
a further period of three months.
</P>
<P>
A draft resolution is expected to be tabled at the Security
Council Thursday in a response to the report by Annan, diplomatic
sources said.
</P>
<P>
"I therefore recommend the extension of UNOMSIL's mandate for a
further period of three months, until June 13, 1999," Annan said
in his 14-page report.
</P>
<P>
"Its mandate will continue to provide information to me, and
through me to the Security Council, about the situation in Sierra
Leone in its political, military, security, human rights and
humanitarian aspects; to continue to liaise closely with the
government of Sierra Leone" and with West African peacekeepers,
known as the ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council meeting came at a time when the United
Nations is returning to Freetown, capital of the West African
country, due to the stabilization of the military and political
situation on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. special representative for Sierra Leone, Francis Okelo
of Uganda, told reporters Monday, "The situation in Freetown has
very much stabilized."
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led ECOMOG and government troops intended to
"pursue this process into the other parts of the country as well,"
Okelo said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels invaded Freetown on January 6, unleashing more than
two weeks of fighting before being flushed out of the capital city
into surrounding suburbs and adjacent hills by ECOMOG forces.
</P>
<P>
Up to 5,000 people died during the invasion and vast areas of
the city were razed by rebel-set fires.
</P>
<P>
The fighting forced the United Nations relief agencies to
return to Freetown to resume their work there "and hopefully in
the rest of the country," Okelo said.
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, the Nigerian president-elect, General Olusegun
Obasanjo, said that Nigerian peacekeeping forces would not be
immediately pulled out of Sierra Leone when he takes office on May
29 in the most populous country in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian overwhelmingly dominates the 15,000-strong ECOMOG in
Sierra Leone, which is the only protection elected President Ahmed
Kabbah has against rebels and renegade soldiers fighting to
overthrow him.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar, who will
step down for Obasanjo, said Tuesday that Nigerian troops would
disengage from Sierra Leone only once talks to end the war made
progress.
</P>
<P>
"The possible partial withdrawal of Nigerian forces from ECOMOG
following the elections in the country and the consequent effects
on ECOMOG's military effectiveness in Sierra Leone could require a
major reappraisal of the situation," Annan said in his March 4
report.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, the dual track approach pursued so far, which
combines support for ECOMOG military action to maintain law and
order with a willingness to negotiate with the rebels, may need to
be reviewed," he said.

<HEADLINE> Four Suspected Agents of American Secret Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A local administration of
Pakistan has arrested four foreigners suspected to be agents of
some American secret agency who were trying to enter Afghanistan
without legal documents, an official source said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The foreigners arrested are identified as two Americans, one
British lady and one Dutchman.
</P>
<P>
The political administration of South Waziristan district of
North West Frontier Province arrested them from the tribal area
Toyia Khala and Gulkatch closed to the Afghan border, said the
source.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners are not allowed to enter tribal areas without prior
permission from the Home Department, officials said, adding none
of the four arrested had permission to visit South Waziristan.
</P>
<P>
An official requiring anonymity said that they are suspected to
be agents of some secret agency and were about to enter
Afghanistan to gather information about Saudi dissident Osama bin

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Denies Troops Looting in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 10 (Xinhua) --The Ethiopian embassy in Nairobi,
capital of Kenya, in a press statement Wednesday, refuted a
report that Ethiopian troops looted private properties in the
Somali border town of Balanballe Sunday night .
</P>
<P>
The press statement said, "the Ethiopian defense force is a
disciplined outfit. It has no track record of looting property or
any misconduct anywhere, any time."
</P>
<P>
A report from Mogadishu Tuesday said, "Hundreds of heavily
armed infantry Ethiopians crossed into Balanballe" Sunday night
and took away "VHF radios, quite a few guns, car-batteries and all
of the medicine in the only chemists shop of the town."
</P>
<P>
The press statement said, "These allegations are baseless and
a pack of lies which we wish to categorically refute." Such
mischievous claims were being made to tarnish Ethiopia's image or
to draw international attention, it added.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the Ethiopian defense force, aware of the intent
of some terrorist groups to make incursion into Ethiopia with
their sinister motive, while exploiting the unfortunate situation
in Somalia, will not relent in efforts in taking appropriate
measures.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia respects the territorial integrity of Somalia despite
the absence of a central government in that war-town country. We
therefore wish to emphasize that Ethiopia has been and still is
tirelessly working to bring about peace in Somalia," the press
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Primakov: No Big War in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said Wednesday that no decision has been made to use
force in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"We will not lead the country into a big war. This is not to
be," he told journalists following a meeting on the situation in
the breakaway republic in the aftermath of the abduction of
Interior Ministry representative Gennady Shpigun last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, called by the order of Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, was attended by officials from the defense and interior
ministries.
</P>
<P>
However, Primakov said the federal authorities will continue to
take tough steps to free Shpigun, who was kidnapped right from an
airliner at the airport of Grozny, the Chechen capital.
</P>
<P>
He said the control on the administrative border with Chechnya
and over air traffic will be tightened.
</P>
<P>
Primakov would "not confirm that ground troops are
concentrating for a strike into Chechnya. Nothing of the kind is
happening," Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
"Our Interior Ministry and Chechen special units under Chechen
President Aslan Maskhadov are working together" to free Shpigun,
the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev confirmed that no decision to
use force against Chechnya had been made.
</P>
<P>
He said Primakov may meet with Maskhadov on the situation in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said 57 law enforcement officers have been sent to
Nazran, the capital of the neighboring Ingush republic.
</P>
<P>
Primakov will brief Yeltsin on the proposals agreed upon at the
conference, Presidential First Deputy Chief of Staff Oleg Sysuyev
told journalists.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Calls for Lifting Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein Wednesday called for an immediate lifting of
U.N. sanctions on Iraq during a meeting with visiting U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
During a closed-door meeting with Cohen, Abdullah said it had
become a moral obligation to lift the crippling sanctions on Iraq
imposed by the United Nations following Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait which triggered the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived in Amman Wednesday as part of his tour of nine
nations in the Middle East. His tour is believed to be aimed at
rallying support for the U.S.-British air strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Abdullah extended thanks to the United
States for its military and economic aid to Jordan, and stressed
that his top priorities were economic growth, poverty and
unemployment in the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah also briefed Cohen on Jordan's efforts to upgrade its
armed forces for the purpose of safeguarding peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli-Palestinian issue, he called on all concerned
parties to abide by the peace agreements already reached to revive
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Cohen briefed the Jordanian ruler on the U.S. policy on
Iraq. Diplomatic sources in Amman said he was also trying to drum
up support from Arab countries for a plan to topple Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is the seventh leg of Cohen`s Middle East tour, which
had also taken him to Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, the United Arab
Emirates, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Washington regarded Jordan as an ally in the Arab world, and
U.S. economic and military assistances to the kingdom would
amount to 300 million U.S. dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
After ascending to the throne last month, Abdullah said on
several occasions that he would not allow any force to use Jordan
as a "spring board" for interference in the internal affairs of
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government has reiterated that it will follow a
policy of peace and develop friendly relations with all
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials also expressed their support for the
territorial integrity of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was isolated by Arab countries during the 1990 Gulf
crisis during which it was believed to be sympathetic with Iraq
after it invaded Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Amman distanced itself from Baghdad in 1995, and called for
political changes in Iraq, but currently the kingdom still
depends on Iraq for cheap crude oil and oil products.

<HEADLINE> Opportunities Seen on Cyprus: U.S. Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- There are opportunities for a
settlement to the Cyprus issue this year, U.S. State Department
Coordinator on Cyprus Thomas Miller said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Miller arrived here on Wednesday for a two-day stay as part of
a general visit to the region. The American diplomat came here from
Turkey where he had met government officials and business people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on his arrival, Miller reconfirmed that the United
States, in cooperation with the United Nations, would continue to
work toward a settlement that would create a bizonal, bicommunal
federation in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Miller said "there are no breakthroughs at hand. We have been
doing a lot of talking in Washington, .... We see some
opportunities out there and we also see dangers."
</P>
<P>
The American diplomat said the only way the problem in Cyprus
could be solved was through an "intensive negotiating process."
</P>
<P>
While in Cyprus, Miller will meet Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, and Ann Hercus,
the European Union's special envoy to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Miller will also fly to Athens to meet Greek Foreign Minister
Giorgos Papandreou.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island, but
the peace talks between the two sides have been stalled since
summer in 1997.

<HEADLINE> German Businessmen Urged to Invest More in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian official on Wednesday
called on German businessmen to step up efforts to set up joint
ventures in Egypt's free trade zones.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Investment and Free Zones Authority Ibrahim
Fawzi told a gathering of Egyptian and German businessmen that
taxes will be exempted as long as the German investors run
export-oriented projects.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has set up six free trade zones in Cairo, Alexandria,
Ismailia, Suez, Port Said and Dumyat in the Nile delta to attract
foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Fawzi expressed confidence that the future will witness a
growth in Egyptian-German economic cooperation and establishment
of joint projects as German businessmen enjoy long-time experience
in investments in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Germany invested 210 million German marks (128.83 million U.S.
dollars) in Egypt in 1997, accounting for about 16 percent of the
total foreign investments in Egypt that year.
</P>
<P>
Fawzi told the gathering, aimed at probing prospects of
investment and trade in Egypt, that his country has the potential
to be an investment and production base that can produce and
export quality products.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Germany maintain good and close relations in various
fields, in the political and economic areas in particular, Fawzi
said.
</P>
<P>
"We need the assistance of our German friends in the
establishment of German projects on Egypt's soil, and their
production should be channeled to export," he added.
</P>
<P>
The gathering was attended by 60 Egyptian and 40 German
businessmen, who arrived here on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Cohen in Egypt for Talks on Mideast Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Defense Secretary of the United
States William Cohen arrived here Wednesday evening for a two-day
visit as part of his Middle East tour.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is expected to hold talks with
him on issues in the region, Egypt's Middle East News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Defense Hussein Tantawi is also to confer
with Cohen on bilateral military relations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. offers 1.3 billion dollars of military aid annually to
Egypt, one of the U.S. closest allies in the region.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the eighth stop of Cohen's Mideast trip, which has
taken him to Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab
Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait and Jordan. He will travel to Israel after
wrapping up the visit here.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official's ongoing tour is aimed at fostering military
cooperation with Mideast countries. He has held talks with Arab
leaders and senior officials on U.S. policy towards Iraq and Iran
and the Mideast East peace process.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes patrolling the "no-fly" zones have
extended attack on Iraqi targets because of Baghdad's defiance.
Iraq said it does not recognize the restricted zones and would
fire at warplanes violating its airspace.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies imposed the no-fly zones after the 1991
Gulf War to "protect" the ethnic Kurdish minorities in the north
and the Shiite Muslims in the south from "Baghdad suppression."
</P>
<P>
Some Arab countries, including Qatar, have called on the U.S.
to end air strikes on Iraq.

UNITED NATIONS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Health
Organization (WHO), which has an office in Islamabad, had hired a
helicopter and sent 400 kilograms of medical supplies to the areas
of Afghanistan affected by an influenza-like disease, U.N.
Spokesman Fred Eckhard said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest report, the unknown disease has claimed
close to 200 lives in a remote mountainous area of northern
Afghanistan.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Takes Cautious Stand on European Defense Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) - The United States Wednesday took a
cautious stand to its European Union allies' plans to create a
unique European common defense entity.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott told a conference,
held here to mark the 50th anniversary of NATO, that Washington
supported in principle the effort led by Britain and France to
develop a European Security and Defense Identity (ESDI) within
NATO.
</P>
<P>
But he warned at the same time that the plan should not break
the vital transatlantic security link or exclude other European
NATO members.
</P>
<P>
"If ESDI is misconceived, misunderstood or mishandled, it could
create the impression -- which could eventually lead to the
reality -- that a new, European-only alliance is being born out of
the old transatlantic one," Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
"We have another concern as well: it is essential that ESDI not
take a form that discriminates against those allies who are not
members of the EU," he said.
</P>
<P>
The aim of Britain and France's plan is to enable the 15-nation
EU for the first time to conduct military operations using NATO
assets in situations when the United States does not want to
become involved.
</P>
<P>
Talbott said the arrangements for making available NATO assets
for European-only security operations would not be completed in
time for next month's 50th anniversary summit of the Atlantic
military alliance in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"That's where the devil still resides -- in the details of
decision-making procedures, of command structures, of arrangements
for the sharing of assets and planning capabilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he also stressed that Washington had full confidence in
Britain's conduct of the drive for a more integrated EU defense
effort.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered to the same conference only minutes after
Talbott's speech, British Defense Secretary George Robertson urged
EU partners to radically improve their armed forces to ensure they
played their full part in the defense of the continent.
</P>
<P>
"Without effective military capability to back up European
foreign policy goals, we are wasting our time. We risk being an
economic giant but a strategic midget," Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
"We need forces that are genuinely usable in the field and not
just on paper. Paper armies never won a war or kept a peace," the
defense secretary told the conference.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Records Trade Deficit from Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Ghana recorded a trade deficit of
67.1 million pounds with Britain last year, according to
statistics released by the British High Commission in Ghana
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ghana's exports to Britain in 1998 appreciated to 155.1 million
 pounds sterling from 134.9 million pounds sterling registered in
the previous year, Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Imports from Britain in the same year, however, dropped to
222.2 million pounds from the 270.1 million pounds posted in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Giving an overview of statistics of UK/Ghana Trade, Steve
Davis, third secretary in charge of the Commercial Section of
the British High Commission, said the figures represent the top
imports from Ghana in 1998.
</P>
<P>
They are cocoa, coffee, spices, fish, cork, wood, vegetables,
fruit, metal ores and scrap.
</P>
<P>
He said exports from Britain to Ghana are manufactured items,
general industrial machinery and equipment, specialized machinery,
power-generating equipment and vehicles.

<HEADLINE> There Is No Alternative to Peace Process: Weizman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Whoever wins the May elections
in Israel should realize that there is no alternative to peace
process with the Palestinians, President Ezer Weizman said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on a special panel marking the 20 years of peace
between Israel and Egypt, Weizman said the courage and spirit of
the peace founders such as late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin must prevail in the current
peace process.
</P>
<P>
After relentless hostility and five costly wars, Israel and
Egypt signed a peace treaty in March 1979, paving the way for
Israel's peace with Egypt and other Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Weizman noted that it was actually this treaty that first
addressed the need to solve the Palestinian issue. What began
20 years ago must continue, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace process has been stalled since
December when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu froze the
implementation of an interim agreement he signed with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Israel will hold elections on May 17. The right-wing Likud
candidate Netanyahu and opposition Labor Party leader Ehud Barak,
have both vowed to carry out the peace process, though on
different terms.
</P>
<P>
Speakers on the special panel, which included former diplomatic
officials from both Israel and Egypt, all disagreed that the two
countries are in a "cold peace," but they all agreed that the two
sides should have done more and the peace could have been much
warmer.
</P>
<P>
They called for more economic cooperations and people-to-people
exchanges, which they said have not been paid as much attention as
it deserved.
</P>
<P>
The panel was held by the Israel Council on Foreign Relations,
an independent think-tank in Israel, in cooperation with the
International Alliance for Arab-Israeli Peace, a regional peace
movement in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Okays Emergency Relief to 272,000 Displaced Ethiopians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food
Program (WFP) has approved a 24.3-million-U.S. dollar emergency
operation to feed up to 272,000 Ethiopians internally displaced by
the Ethiopian-Eritrean border conflict, a U.N. spokesman announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, U.N. spokesman, told a press conference that the
fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea over the disputed territory
of Badme displaced some 337,300 Ethiopians.
</P>
<P>
"The (Ethiopian) Government is trying to integrate the
displaced with the local population, avoiding camps," Eckhard
quoted WFP sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
"In response to the Ethiopian Government's request for
emergency food assistance, the WFP emergency operation will assist
people displaced by the conflict and ease the burden on host
communities and host families who themselves experience food
insecurity," he said.
</P>
<P>
The operation is to last for nine months from March through
November 1999.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea fought each other over the disputed
territory of Badme, a rocky area, in May last year, and the
fighting resumed early this year.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has called upon the two neighboring
countries to immediately end hostilities and start peace talks
for a proper solution to the bilateral dispute.

<HEADLINE> Duma Adopts Law on Protection of Moral Standards on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma Wednesday
adopted a law that calls for the establishment of a federal body
to protect the moral standards in television and radio
broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin, however, said the bill "practically creates a body
of censorship" and that President Boris Yeltsin will veto it one
hundred percent, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The law needs to be approved by the Federal Council, or upper
house of parliament, and Yeltsin before entering into force.
</P>
<P>
The document maintained that TV and radio broadcasting in
Russia is free from censorship but it may be restricted in the
degree in which it is necessary for protecting the fundamentals of
the constitutional system, morality, health, rights and lawful
interests of individuals, for upholding the country's defenses and
national security.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, the 12-member Supreme Council has no right to
demand from broadcasting companies and editorial boards of mass
media organs that they coordinate materials with it in advance.
</P>
<P>
Neither will the body have the right to ban the broadcasting of
some reports, programs or their segments.
</P>
<P>
However, it can issue warnings to the broadcasting companies or
use other authorized measures against them, if they air contents
that induce the audience to commit criminal offenses, create a
feeling that one may go unpunished after committing such offenses,
pose a threat to individual or national security or kindle social,
racial, ethnic or religious hatred, or advocate war, cruelty or
violence.
</P>
<P>
The prescribed punishment for violation of those morals include
a fine ranging from 10 to 500 times the minimal wage for
territorial broadcasting companies, and from 100 to 5,000 times
the minimal wage for regional companies.
</P>
<P>
The current minimal wage is 83.5 rubles (about 3.6 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
If national broadcasting companies are involved in such
violations, the fine will range from 1,000 to 50,000 times the
minimal wage.
</P>
<P>
Other punishments include recommendations for the revocation of
licenses and the sacking of the companies' leadership, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Council will be a permanent state body, made up of
12 members. The president, the prime minister and the upper and
lower houses of parliament will each appoint three members.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Reassures U.S. Support for Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen Wednesday reassured U.S. support for the security
and economic needs of Jordan in appreciation for its role in the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after his meeting with Jordanian King
Abdullah Bin Hussein, Cohen said Washington was standing firmly
with Jordan and moving forward with its 1999 economic and military
aid package to the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Washington regarded Jordan as a staunch ally in the Arab world,
and U.S. economic and military assistances to the kingdom would
amount to 300 million U.S. dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived here earlier as part of his nine-nation Middle
East tour, believed to rally support for the U.S.-British air
strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is the seventh leg of the trip, which has also taken him
to Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he and the Jordanian king discussed bilateral ties,
the Iraqi issue and the stalled Middle East peace process during
their closed-door meeting.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah stressed that it has become a moral obligation to lift
the crippling economic sanctions on Iraq imposed by the United
Nations following Iraq`s invasion of Kuwait over eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
He thanked Washington for its military and economic aid, and
briefed Cohen on Jordan`s efforts to upgrade its armed forces for
the purpose of keeping peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli-Palestinian issue, the Jordanian monarch called
on parties concerned to abide by the peace agreements already
reached to revive the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that social security issues must be taken
into considerations for a durable and comprehensive peace in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Eve, Ancestor of Women, May Be Older Than Thought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Eve, from whom all women are
descended, is twice as old as we thought, scientists have
suggested.
</P>
<P>
Biologists used to think that DNA of mitochondrial, the
energy-generating structures in all human cells, was passed on
virtually unchanged from mother to daughter.
</P>
<P>
Even if mitochondria from sperm get into the egg during
fertilization, they were believed to be rapidly eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Using this simple pattern of inheritance, biologists in the
1980s were able to estimate that "Eve," the most recent common
ancestor of all women, lived in Africa between 100,000 and 200,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, two new British studies of the distribution of
mitochondria DNA mutations in human populations are now
challenging the idea that mitochondria DNA is only inherited from
the mother, the New Scientist magazine reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two researches, carried out by scientists at the University
of Sussex and a team led by Erika Hagelberg of Cambridge
University, have discovered that there is a degree of paternal
mitochondria DNA entering the egg and mixing with the maternal
mitochondria DNA.
</P>
<P>
The results, also published in the British journal Proceeding
of the Royal Society, showed that using mitochondrial DNA to track
genetic lineage isn't as accurate as scientists had assumed.
</P>
<P>
"These two studies represent the first evidence that
recombination is happening in mitochondrial DNA," Adam
Eyre-Walker, a member of the Sussex team, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"These findings mean that she (Eve) must be twice as old,"
Eyre-Walker said.

<HEADLINE> Hotel Room Rates Rise In Greater Los Angeles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The price of the average
hotel room in Greater Los Angeles grew by nearly 5 percent in
January even as occupancy remained flat, according to data
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The average price for an overnight hotel stay in January was up
5.13 U.S. dollars from 108.74 a year ago, according to statistics
from PKF Consulting, which tracks the region's hotel industry.
</P>
<P>
However, the data show the occupancy rates remained mostly
steady, dropping just 0.6 percent in January compared with the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The January figures underscored a trend among Los Angeles
hotels, which last year saw average room rates climb nearly 9
percent while occupancy remained largely unchanged, posting a
slight increase of 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Over the last several months, local hotel operators have been
ratcheting up the price per room in a bid to match room prices of
other major metropolitan areas such as Chicago and New York, where
the average price of hotel room is about 202 dollars per night.
</P>
<P>
Michael Collins, executive vice president of the Los Angeles
Convention &AMP; Visitor Bureau, said the rising local rates were also
the effect of a strong U.S. economy that has encouraged a jump in
both domestic and business travel to the region.

ANKARA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Eleven rebels of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) were killed Wednesday in military
operations by Turkish security forces in southeastern Turkey, an
official statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the office of Emergency Regional Rule
said the security forces had wiped out the PKK militants in the
provinces of Bingol, Tunceli and Diyarbakir in the region.
</P>
<P>
It added that the security forces also captured two PKK
guerrillas during the military operations in the region.
</P>
<P>
One soldier of the security forces was killed in the armed
clash with the PKK, it said.
</P>
<P>
Over 37,000 people, including PKK rebels, government troops
and civilians, have been killed in conflicts since the PKK
started a guerrilla war for an independent Kurdish state in
southeastern Turkey in August 1984.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Movie Production: Spending Dips, Marketing Costs Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The average cost of producing
a major Hollywood movie declined 1.4 percent in 1998, but the cost
of marketing those films soared 13 percent in the same year,
according to the Motion Picture Association of American (MPAA).
</P>
<P>
Jack Valenti, chairman of the MPAA, told theater owners in Las
Vegas Tuesday the average cost of producing a film at the seven
major studios declined by 748,000 U.S. dollars to 52.7 million
dollars in 1998 compared with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes production costs are coming under control
because studio executives are adopting a more "disciplined
approach" to setting their production budgets.
</P>
<P>
But the drop is little comfort to Hollywood because the average
cost of marketing a movie jumped to 25.3 million dollars in 1998
from 22.3 million dollars in 1997, Valenti said.
</P>
<P>
"Advertising on television and newspapers and all the other
panoply of ways to persuade (people to go to the movies) have just
gone up. There is nothing we can do about it," he said at the
movie industry's biggest trade show in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
Despite the cost issues that perpetually trouble Hollywood,
movies were enjoying a boom time in the United States during 1998,
according to the MPAA, which said 6.95 billion dollars was taken
in at the U.S. box office last year, a 9.2 percent increase over
1997.
</P>
<P>
There was a 6.7 percent gain in the number of admissions during
1998, the MPAA said, adding that 1.48 billion tickets were sold,
the largest number in 40 years.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone President May Pardon Rebel Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The president said since Sankoh has appealed against the
sentence, matters should be left in the hands of the court, Ghana
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"But if I have to use my clemency to release Sankoh in order to
bring a lasting solution to my country, I will do that," Kabbah
told journalists in Accra, Ghana's capital, shortly before he
emplaned home after a two-day visit to Ghana as part of his
sub-regional tour to consult his counterparts on the trouble in
his country.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah said there are signs of a lasting peace in his country.
</P>
<P>
"I have had assurances from rebel leader Sankoh and his
members that they are prepared for serious dialogs," he said,
adding that the cease- fire declared by Sankoh is an indication
of "light at the end of the tunnel."
</P>
<P>
Kabbah announced that Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings has
invited Sankoh to Accra for further negotiations based on the
trust exhibited by the rebel leader to consolidate the peace so
far achieved.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leonean President, however, declined to give
details of the invitation as to when Sankoh is expected in
Accra, when pressed to do so.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he had any regrets for the execution of the 25
rebels for treason against his government, President Kabbah said
those rebels did something against the land and he considered the
matter carefully before the executions.
</P>
<P>
"I feel comfortable with the executions which I considered to
be the best thing at that time."
</P>
<P>
On the future of the army, the Sierra Leonean President said
there has to be demobilization of troops. "It will not be proper
for a small country like Sierra Leone to keep a large army."
</P>
<P>
He said those who would not be absorbed into the army would be
 retrained to live a decent life on their own.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian President Rawlings who was at the airport to see his
counterpart off, described their discussions as encouraging and
expressed the hope that Sankoh would complement the renewed
efforts.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that the west African peace-keeping force of
ECOMOG is now in a position to swiftly deal with those rebels who
still want war.

MOSCOW, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia Wednesday reiterated its
opposition to NATO's eastward expansion and vowed to reduce the
negative aftermath of the enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said the
inclusion of new members in the transatlantic alliance
"contributes to the development of new demarcation lines in
Europe, brings close to the Russian borders the military
infrastructure of the alliance, which remains first of all the

NATO is set to accept Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in

bordering Russia, such as the three Baltic states, are also
pressing for membership in the alliance, a scenario Moscow
vehemently opposes.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin said the creation of a sound system of European
security and stability "is only possible on the European basis
with a proper use of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe."
</P>
<P>
"It is the only way for creating in Europe such architecture of
security, which would indeed involve the interests of all the

situation, economic potential or belonging to different unions,"
Itar-Tass quoted Rakhmanin as saying.

NICOSIA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will apologize in writing
to two Senegalese who were refused entry into the country earlier
this month allegely because they are black.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' government made the decision at a cabinet meeting on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two Senegalese computer experts, Agdou Hkadre Diop, 25,
and El Hadji Malick Sakho, 33, arrived here on March 1 with valid
passports visas, return airline tickets, an invitation to attend a
conference here, reservations at the Hilton Hotel and travel
orders from their Dakar employer and cash.
</P>
<P>
However, immigration police at Larnaca airport refused them
entry and the two men were deported.
</P>
<P>
Sakho said he thought they were deported "because we are
black."
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a problem of racism," Diop added, "We are
black, and they asked themselves how two black men could stay in
the Hilton Hotel."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' government Christos Stylianides said "the cabinet
expresses regret about the event and apologizes to the two foreign
nationals and their country for the trouble they endured."
</P>
<P>
He said apology letters would be sent to both of the men and
the Cypriot government would investigate the event to see if a
disciplinary offense had been committed.

Executive director and president of the Institute of Economic

About 78 percent of sub-Saharan Africa's revenue came from

getting rid of poor performing state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"If 78 percent of our livelihood is controlled by donors, then
we have to reform our economies in order to start generating
resources otherwise. If this continues, we may end up mortgaging
our countries," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 10 (Xinhua) -- the number of male condoms
distributed in Zimbabwe since 1997 has been on an upward trend
mainly due to the HIV/Aids scourge which is said to be killing
about 700 people a week, a National Aids Control official said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean condom management advisor Daisy Nyamukapa told the
Zimbabwe News Agency that a total of 42.1 million condoms were
distributed in 1997 and last year saw the distribution of a total
of 50.8 million.
</P>
<P>
This year, Director of the Zimbabwe National Family Planning
Council Godfrey Tinarwo said the council was set to procure 45
million male condoms for distribution, adding the numbers were set
to rise as the private sector had chipped in.
</P>
<P>
She said, "We are now widening the distribution of the female
condom gradually. About 265,000 condoms are set to be distributed
this year from the 40,000 distributed last year."
</P>
<P>
"The female condom is not meant to compete with or replace the
male condom but to increase the number of protected sex acts in
the country," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi said
here on Wednesday that he would propose the Palestinians postpone
declaring an independent state till after May 4.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with professors and students of Cairo
University, Gaddafi said the postponement would help win world
recognition of the future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
"I advise (Palestinian leader Yasser) Arafat to wait in order
to win Europe's recognition (of the Palestinian state)," Gaddafi
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have been patient for scores of years, and we can afford
another six months or so," the Libyan leader added.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi said Arafat had told him that so far 80 countries had
expressed support for the declaration of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi met with Arafat in Cairo on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat announced on several occasions that he would declare an
independent Palestinian state on May 4 under agreements signed
with Israel regardless of the results of the peace talks between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
But Israel has been opposed to the possible move, denouncing
the step as a unilateral action. It has also threatened to take
tough actions against the move, including annexation of parts of
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi accused the Israeli government of failing to carrying
out the signed agreements with the aim to prevent the Palestinians
from declaring their own state.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan leader arrived in Egypt last Friday on a week-long
visit for talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the
Lockerbie crisis, the Middle East peace process and the Iraqi
issue.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Denies U.S. Supports Plans to Break up Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen Wednesday rejected as "groundless" reports that
washington is supporting plans to break up Iraq though U.S. forces
kept on bombarding Iraqi positions.
</P>
<P>
News stories that the U.S. government is striving for an
disintegration of Iraq are "false and without any foundation,"
Cohen said at a press conference after his meeting with Jordanian
King Abdullah Bin Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that Washington is not supporting any concept of
federation (within Iraq), but is "supporting the continuous
territorial integrity of Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived in Amman Wednesday as part of a nine-nation
Middle East tour believed to rally support for the U.S.-British
air strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He explained U.S. policies on Iraq during his meeting with King
Abdullah, who in turn called for a lifting of U.N. sanctions
imposed on Iraq since Iraq`s invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah stressed that it has become a moral obligations to
put an end to the sufferings of the Iraqi people under the
crippling international sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. defense chief also pledged continued U.S. support for
Jordan, which President Bill Clinton regarded as a staunch ally in
the Arab World.
</P>
<P>
Economic and military assistances promised by Washington to
the kingdom amounted to some 300 million U.S. dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is the seventh leg of Cohen`s trip, which has also taken
him to Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and
Saudi Arabia.

<TEXT>
<P>
Mwila said this on Wednesday at the Zambia power rehabilitation
project financiers meeting held in Lusaka which included
officials from the World Bank and other donor nations.
</P>
<P>
He said the power rehabilitation project will deal with the
Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) physical system of
generation, transmission and distribution which will address the
environmental, social and capacity building in order to achieve
sustainability of the power sector.
</P>
<P>
Mwila said the project will support the government's policy of
 establishing an institutional and regulatory framework conducive
to private participation in the power sector.
</P>
<P>
Apart from promoting the growth of an efficient service
delivery system, it will improve the efficiency of ZESCO and
ensure its financial viability,
</P>
<P>
he said.
</P>
<P>
The project will address ZESCO's needs of more than four
decades old electricity system which has lacked maintenance and
investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Funds have been sourced from World Bank, the Development Bank
of South Africa, European Investment Bank and French Development
Agency, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mwila noted that the government had reached a point where it
can begin the implementation of the project in earnest because
the World Bank had declared the credit effective on March 2,
1999.
</P>
<P>
The government has already demonstrated its Commitment to the
smooth implementation of the project by giving a waiver of duty
and taxes on all equipment and machinery to be procured for the
project. he said.

CAIRO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Saudi Arabian Minister of Industry and Electricity
Hashim Yamani said his country worked out a long-term plan for
developing a power grid.
</P>
<P>
The project envisages the expansion of the power grid and
promotion of its generating capacity from 20,000 megawatts to
70,000 megawatts until 2020.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The European Union halted its imports of fish from
Egypt and set the end of March as deadline for Egypt to meet its
conditions for resuming the importation.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said the move is a new escalation of
intransigence against Egypt's exports of potatoes and textiles.
</P>
<P>
The EU also demanded that a single act be worked out to define
the body authorized to organize Egypt's fish export, import,
production and canning.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's fish export was less than 456 tonnes in 1997, but is it
expected to export more if the EU conditions are met as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian government decided to open the door for
individuals and private enterprises as well as Arab and foreign
investors in the mining field.
</P>
<P>
The decision aims to alleviate the state budget of the burdens
of countrywide exploration for minerals and metals.
</P>
<P>
The decision was included in the Mine and Quarry Draft Act
submitted by the government to the People's Assembly (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Under the draft, the total term of mine and quarry concession
will be extended to 99 years.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Petroleum Authority (EPA) decided on Monday
to invite an international tender on oil and gas exploration in 15
areas in 1999. The areas cover 170,000 square kilometers, or 17
percent of Egypt's total area.
</P>
<P>
The areas are located in Nile delta, the Western Desert and its
southern parts, the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, Wednesday's

MOSCOW, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Kirghizia's Seismologic Institute
has suspended its activities indefinitely because of a lack of
funds, the Itar-Tass news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Electricity supply has been cut to the institute, a subsidiary
under the Central Asian republic's National Academy of Sciences,
and computers and electronic mail systems are no longer working,
Director Asker Turdukulov said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the institute has stopped processing data
collected by the republic's seismic stations.
</P>
<P>
"Almost all our personnel is on the so-called vacations, and
the institute's management is trying to get money from the Finance
Ministry," Turdukulov said.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the situation persists and an earthquake takes
place during the period, "the seismic situation in Kirghizia will
be out of control, and the scientists will not be able to forecast
potential epicenters of the calamity."

<HEADLINE> UK Company Develops Biosensor to Spot Toxic Chemicals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Zeneca, the British agrochemicals
company, is testing biosensors, which by spotting dangerous
pesticides and fungicides can reduce the need for animal testing,
the New Scientist magazine said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It won't substitute for full toxicology testing in animals
with the final molecule," David Evans, research and development
director at Zeneca, told the magazine.
</P>
<P>
"But it will offer early alerts which allow us to navigate the
chemistry into safer areas," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zeneca expects the biosensor to provide a wealth of data on
desirable and undesirable effects, for example, whether an
experimental pesticide would endanger humans, farm animals or
plants.
</P>
<P>
It could also help show if the chemicals are dangerous to bees
and earthworms, and how effective they are against pests, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
The biosensor consists a chip of glass, nylon or silicon, which
is coated with fragments of genes from one species, each fragment
occupying a set position on the surface.
</P>
<P>
The genes used are those known to be switched on when the
organism is exposed to high levels of toxic chemicals. In humans,
for example, some liver genes become unusually active when exposed
to potent toxins.
</P>
<P>
David Lawrence, head of crop research at Zeneca, told New
Scientist that 2,000 human genes known to be activated by toxic
drugs or pesticides are being tested to find the best indicators
among them.
</P>
<P>
The biosensor will become more useful as more human genes are
sequenced in the human genome project, Lawrence said.

LUSAKA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- One more local journalist was
arrested by Zambian police here Wednesday, bringing to three the
total number of the journalists arrested since Tuesday night for
allegedly reporting the country's military secrets.
</P>
<P>
The police made the arrests following directives from the

some details on the country's military force.
</P>
<P>
Recently Angola has repeatedly accused Zambia of supplying arms
to the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
rebels and threatened to take military actions against those

NICOSIA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. State Department
Coordinator on Cyprus Thomas Miller on Wednesday held a two-hour
meeting with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, procedural issues that would lead to the
resumption of talks for a Cyprus settlement was discussed, Cyprus
News Agency (CNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The American envoy described the meeting as "very good" and
said he and Clerides discussed a wide range of subjects. But he
did not reveal the details of their talks.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday Miller is scheduled to meet Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Miller arrived here from Turkey on Wednesday and will fly to
Athens to meet Greek Foreign Minister Giorgos Papandreou.
</P>
<P>
Asked if anything new had come out of his meetings in Ankara
and other countries, Miller said "yes", adding "we've had a lot
of interesting conversations."

<P>
During his visit to the region, Miller is trying to ascertain
whether the two sides in Cyprus would be willing to
unconditionally return to the negotiating table, under
U.N. auspices.

<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of
the island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.

<P>
The U.N has been trying for decades to reunite the island, but
the peace talks between the two sides have been stalled since

<HEADLINE> Solution to Lockerbie Issue Takes Weeks: Egypt's FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said on Wednesday that a solution to the Lockerbie dispute between
Libya on the one hand, and the U.S. and Britain on the other,
could take a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with his Libyan
counterpart Omar al-Montassir, Moussa said the U.N. embargo on
Libya will be lifted once Tripoli turns over the two suspects in
the Lockerbie bombing.
</P>
<P>
He said the Lockerbie issue is "in a delicate stage," during
which Libya is making diplomatic and political moves to reach a
final settlement soon.
</P>
<P>
Libya has been at odds with the U.S. and Britain over the trial
of the two Libyans suspected of blowing up a Pan Am jetliner in
1988 over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
The two Western powers succeeded in 1992 to press the United
Nations Security Council to slap an arms and flight embargo on
Libya for its failure to surrender the two suspects.
</P>
<P>
Mediated by South Africa and Saudi Arabia, progress has been
made in the issue. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi said on March 2
that he is willing to accept guarantees and assurances by Saudi
Arabia and South Africa over resolving the Lockerbie issue.
</P>
<P>
Libya has agreed to let the two former intelligence agents to
face trial in the Netherlands before Scottish judges in accordance
with Scottish law. But it demanded guarantees for the suspects'
security and a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
In a further step to coordinate stances, Gaddafi arrived here
last Friday for a week-long visit to discuss with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak a possible handover of the two suspects.
</P>
<P>
Al-Montassir said at the press conference that Egypt has been
exerting efforts to solve the Lockerbie issue.
</P>
<P>
Libya is waiting for the real assurances and guarantees for a
fair trial of the suspects, he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on recent statements made by U.S. ambassador in
Cairo Daniel Kurtzer that the ball was in the Libyan court,
al-Montassir said that "the ball is now in the Americans' court."
</P>
<P>
Libya has demanded assurances that the suspects would not be
interrogated by the Americans and British, or extradited to the
U.S. or Britain.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Forces May Move Southward: Angolan Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Angolan government troops' heavy
blow to opposition UNITA forces in the central part of the country
may force the latter to move southward, Defense Minister Kundy
Payama said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Payama said the government forces have made full preparations
to give a due reply to Jonas Savimbi's UNITA, known as the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister made the remarks in Ondjiva, capital of
Cunene Province in the south. Since Tuesday, he has started tour
to the strategic points in the southern provinces of Huila, Cunene
and Namibe.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the government forces have stepped up attacks on
UNITA- controlled Bailundo and Andulo towns in the central part,
which are respectively the headquarters and military base of
UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the towns will sooner or later be
recaptured and UNITA will have to give up the central part which
it has controlled for decades. After that, it may either move
northward to merge with its main force stationed at the border
with Congo (K), or retreat to sparsely populated southern
provinces to continue its guerrilla wars.
</P>
<P>
The minister said: "Savimbi attempts to launch a massive
campaign, but that will be in vain. The state armed forces are
standing in combat readiness to strike UNITA army relentlessly."
</P>
<P>
After several intense fightings, Angola's civil war went
through a lull in late February. Analysts believed that this is
just a calm period before a thunderstorm when the two sides are
building up strength.

BUCHAREST, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Romanian policemen cracked down
on a drug smugglers ring, cutting loose connections that stretched
from Colombia to Germany via Romania.
</P>
<P>
According to a Wednesday report of Rompres, a Romanian-born
resident in Germany was caught last week with drugs in his pockets
at a bar entrance in Arad, a city at 20 km of the Hungarian
border, in western Romania.
</P>
<P>
Investigations that followed traced to a local young woman
named Maria Niculina Croitoru, and a Colombian citizen, who were
part of the ring. The latter used to mail drugs to addressees
recommended by the Romanian woman and the recipients were supposed
not to tamper with the envelopes, but wait until other people came
to pick them up.
</P>
<P>
Gheorghe Ardelean, the Romanian-born citizen from Germany would
later collect the drugs and smuggle them into Germany.
</P>
<P>
The police so far have identified two Romanian people who
received three envelopes containing cocaine, approximately 60 g in
all. Two more envelopes with 44 g of cocaine were seized. The two

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Review Safety after Italian Cablecar Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon on Wednesday
appointed an admiral to lead a joint U.S.-Italian review of the
safety measures put in place after a U.S. Marine jet last year
damaged the cables of an Italian ski-lift, killing 20 people.
</P>
<P>
The 30-day review is designed to prevent the kind of mistakes
that led to the February 3, 1998 accident in which the Marine Corps
jet severed cables holding a ski gondola near Cavalese, Italy.
</P>
<P>
The pilot of the EA-6B jet, Marine Capt. Richard Ashby, was
acquitted last week in a military court-martial, but the verdict
outraged Italy and families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton announced the review after meeting
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema at the White House
shortly after the acquittal.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Three Europeans Missing in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Three Europeans and an Angolan
national have gone missing in a northern city in Angola,
diplomatic sources said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Two Portuguese and one French, together with the Angolan,
disappeared in the suburbs of the Cabinda City, said Jorge
Fernando, a consul at the Portuguese embassy in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The consul said he was informed that the four people were
abducted by a local armed group. However, there has been no
independent report to confirm the incident.
</P>
<P>
The missing people work for Bouygues, a French service firm,
and U.S. oil company Chevron respectively. The group went out and
travelled by car Tuesday evening. On Wednesday morning their car
was found empty and abandoned, without any traces of violence.
</P>
<P>
The two Portuguese include Jose Manuel Neves Pereira, 55, and
50-year- old Jose Dias Bettencourt, both have worked in Angola
for nearly ten years as electrical engineers. The French is named
Patrick Harr, an employee of the Bouygues Company.
</P>
<P>
Cabinda is an Angolan enclave surrounded by Congo (B) and Congo
(K). With abundant oil resources, it is the most wealthy province
in Angola. Local residents have fought for years for independence
and organized armed groups, with Liberation Front of Cabinda
Enclave being one of the largest.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Plans to Set Up COMESA Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ASMARA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Eritrean plans to set up a
representative office in the Common Market for the East and
Southern Africa (COMESA), an Eritrean foreign trade official
disclosed here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Berekhet-ab Habtemarlam, head of the Foreign Trade Division of
the Eritrean Ministry of Trade and Industry, said that his country
plans to open a representative office in Kenyan capital Nairobi,
or Zambian capital Lusaka or Uganda capital Kampala later this
year or next year so that Eritrea could be more active in the
COMESA area.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea became a member of the COMESA in 1994. At present, it
only exports sea salt to other COMESA member states, Habtemariam
said.
</P>
<P>
He added Eritrea has more to sell to the east and southern
African markets, such as leather products, shoes, garments,
sweaters and various fish.
</P>
<P>
Under a transport facility agreement, vehicles with yellow
plates of the COMESA states can pass freely in the region, he
said.
</P>
<P>
But the border dispute between the two Horn of Africa neighbors
has blocked the Eritrean trucks from going to other COMESA
countries via Ethiopia, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that his country is considering to arrange its
goods to go by sea through Kenya's Mombasa port to reach other
countries.
</P>
<P>
After the Ethio-Eritrean war broke out last May, Ethiopia has
diverted its goods from Eritrea's ports of Massawa and Assab to
Djibouti port.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Says No Trade Expansion with India Without </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz said Thursday that the Pakistani-Indian economic
relations cannot make headway without improvement in the two
countries' political relations.
</P>
<P>
"Economic relations cannot move forward if political relations
move backward," Aziz told a visiting 45-member delegation of the
Federation of Indian Export Organizations.
</P>
<P>
He urged the delegation members to use their clout to end the
hostility and reduce the tension with Pakistan through a
negotiated settlement of the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said, "we cannot go into normal trade at the moment unless
there is some progress (on political issues)."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, has taken many initiatives like bus service,
release of Indian fishermen and civilian prisoners, "but there is
no initiative from India."
</P>
<P>
He said that now serious negotiations have been started between
India and Pakistan to find a solution to this problem.
</P>
<P>
"If you really search, you can find a workable and acceptable
solution" to the Kashmir dispute, said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The ground situation in Kashmir, he said, is not "healthy or
normal" as India has deployed over 600,000 military and
paramilitary troops in Indian-held Kashmir and killings were going
on there.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the 900-mile, 1.9-billion-U.S.-dollar gas pipeline
for importing gas from Turkmenistan to Pakistan "can go from here
to India."
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Pakistan can export electricity to India, if it is
offered a reasonable price.
</P>
<P>
Both India and Pakistan can benefit from their economic
relations given the complementarity of their economies and low
cost of production, said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Though trade between the two countries has started, it is far
below the existing potential, the minister noted.

MOSCOW, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Thursday met with Grigory Yavlinsky, a liberal economist who heads
the Yabloko faction in the State Duma, lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky said the conversation with Yeltsin in the Central
Clinical Hospital "was about life," the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held amidst mounting rumors that Yeltsin is about
to reshuffle the cabinet of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, is
seen by some observers as a prelude to Yavlinsky's entry into the
government.
</P>
<P>
However, Yavlinsky told reporters that Yeltsin did not ask him
to enter the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is convalescing in the Central Clinical Hospital from
stomach ulcer. Russian media reports quoted sources as saying that
the treatment will take some two more weeks.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Proposal of Postponing Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
denied in Gaza Thursday that Jordanian King Abdullah has proposed
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat postpone the declaration of an
independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Tayeb Abdel Rahim, Secretary General of Arafat, told the Voice
of Palestine (VOP), that media reports that Abdullah has requested
Arafat to postpone declaring an independent Palestinian state were
groundless.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian position on this issue is supportive to the
Palestinian stance and the Jordanian king has never made that
proposal to Arafat, Rahim added.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that during Arafat's visit to Amman on
Wednesday, Abdullah has urged Arafat not to declare a state on May
4, adding that it will be preferable to delay the declaration.
</P>
<P>
Rahim said the Palestinian leadership will continue to hold
consultations on this issue with other countries but a final
decision will be made by the Palestinian leadership itself.
</P>
<P>
He said Arafat will travel to Britain on Friday to
discuss this issue with British Prime Minister Tony Blair before
he visits the United States on March 23.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Arekat is
scheduled to travel to Jordan in the next few days to hold
consulations on the issue with Jordanian and Egyptian foreign
ministers. The Jordanian meeting is aimed at coordinating the
Arab position before Arafat's visit to Washington, he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said on many occasions that he has the right to
declare an independent Palestinian state on May 4 when the
transitional period of the Oslo accords expires.
</P>
<P>
But Israel rejected this idea. Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu threatened to annex parts of the West Bank if Arafat
declares statehood on that date.

DAR ES SALAAM, March 11 (Xinhua) (C Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa blamed the Western nations for interfering in
Tanzania's internal affairs by attacking his ruling party's effort
for a second term.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said that the west has no authority to tell Tanzania what
kind of democracy it should follow, Tanzania's newspapers reported
Thursday. !0I see nothing wrong in CCM(Chama Cha Mapinduzi)'s wish
to continue serving the people of Tanzania after 2000 and beyond,"
he said while on a four-day tour of the Pemba Island.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa told a cheering rally Wednesday that even the United
States President Bill Clinton is campaigning for a continued
Democrat's rule under his Vice- President Al Gore while British
ruling Labor's Tony Blair wants to do the same for his party.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the CCM election manifesto of 1995, which
Tanzanians had rightly judged as the best course of action for the
country, was the party's key for entrance into the Union and
Zanzibar state houses.
</P>
<P>
"CCM will do all it can in accordance with the rule of law to
ensure the party's victory next year," he said.
</P>
<P>
 Mkapa also spoke highly of the peace and tranquility in Pemba
and the increased solidarity among its people.

government will work together to ease the problems like poor road
conditions, shortages of drugs, books as well as electricity.

CAIRO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
DUBAI -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) Airways will spend
about 1.8 billion U.S. dollars in the coming three years to
purchase 17 new Airbus aircraft to meet the expected increase in
scheduled flights and to replace a number of planes that are no
more fit for service.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has received the first "Airbus 200-330" Wednesday at an
estimated 108 million dollars, and more will arrive.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Total investments in the building of a unified
electricity network among the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
member states are expected to reach 3 billion dollars, saving some
3.5 billion dollars as a result of reduced cost in operation and
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
A Western expert said that the three-phase project will help
meet any gap that may arise in the electricity sector among the
GCC states in future due to the fast increase in consumption.
</P>
<P>
He added that the project will materialize in 2004, fulfilling
electricity need of each GCC state and meeting the ever-growing
demand.
</P>
<P>
GCC governments are due to allocate roughly 2 billion dollars
to finance the project, with the rest from bank loans and private
sector contributions.
</P>
<P>
The first stage is to link electricity generation plants in
Bahrein, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, the second to cover
electricity plants in Oman and the UAE, and the third to link all
the stations into one unified network.
</P>
<P>
MUSCAT -- Oman signed a new loan agreement Wednesday with the
Japanese Export and Import Bank to the tune of 250 million dollars
to finance the construction of the new Sahar harbor which will be
restricted to export heavy industrial products.
</P>
<P>
The maturity of the loan is 16.5 years with a three-year grace
period. It will be provided with 50 percent in dollars and 50
percent in Japanese yen. But neither side revealed the interest
rate.
</P>
<P>
The Sahar harbor, located in the northern part of Oman will
only supply and export products of an industrial park under
construction, including aluminum and petrochemical products.
</P>
<P>
ALGIERS -- The Algerian Central Bank announced Wednesday that
the country's external debts dropped to 30.47 billion dollars by
the end of 1998 from 31.22 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the government was seeking to reduce foreign
debts, which consume more than 5 billion dollars in debt servicing
a year.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, petroleum and natural gas exports,
representing 96.15 percent of Algeria's exports, dropped to 9.7
billion dollars in 1998 from 13.6 billion dollars in 1997 due to
sagging prices on world markets.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Kuwait signed a 164-million-dollar contract
Wednesday with a Korean company for heavy industries for the
construction of a plant for the desaliniation of sea water in
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
A Korean official said the deal stipulates the construction of
a plant with a maximum production capacity of about 100 million
liters of water a day. He said the project would be completed in
36 months.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that minimum production capacity of
the plant is estimated at about 90 million liters a day and the
maximum at about 110 million liters.

areas.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Daniel Yona told a workshop here Wednesday

Meanwhile, the minister also warned the agents that
transparency is critical in the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
"Brokers and agents must be transparent and professionally
trained to ensure that insurance contracts are well translated to
reduce and minimize misunderstanding," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Announces Weapons Sale to Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen announced here Thursday that America will sell 3.2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of advanced weapons to Egypt in the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
Cohen told a news conference after his meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak that the weapons include 24 advanced-model
F-16 fighter, 200 M1-A1 tanks and one eight-unit Patriot 3 model
anti-missile battery which has 32 missiles.
</P>
<P>
He said some of the weapons are the most sophisticated in the
U.S. arsenal. Egypt now has 196 F-16 fighters and 555 M1-A1 tanks.
</P>
<P>
The planned arms sale requires U.S. congressional approval,
which is considered likely by U.S. defense officials.
</P>
<P>
The new tanks will be assembled in Egypt from parts
manufactured in the U.S., U.S. defense officials said, adding that
the Patriot 3 model anti-missile system is still being developed
and tested and will be delivered in several years.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the multi-year weapons purchase will be
financed out of the 1.2 billion dollars military aid that Egypt
gets annually from the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived here Wednesday for a two-day visit after trips to
the six Gulf Cooperation Council states of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia,
Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait, and Jordan. He
traveled to Israel on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> China's Expectation for Men's Singles Title Demolished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, England, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China's expectation
for men's singles title at the All England Open Badminton
Championships was demolished here Thursday when three Chinese
players were outplayed by Danish and Indonesian rivals
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Chen Gang, world junior gold medalist and national champion at
the eight National Games in 1997, played a hard-fought match
against Thomas Stuer-Lauridsen of Denmark before losing at 15-4,
10-15 and 15-12.
</P>
<P>
His namesake Chen Wei, who had an easy win over Japanese Shinji
Ohta in the first round Wednesday, could not face the challenge
from Budi Santoso of Indonesia, giving up the match at 15-8 and 15-
6.
</P>
<P>
Xia Xuanze, runner-up to Chen Gang at the junior worlds, was
ousted by world top player Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen of Denmark at 15-
13 and 15-5.
</P>
<P>
Chinese team head coach Li Yongbo said after the three matches
that the failure was not beyond his expectation. "It is normal,"
he said. But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, all of the Chinese women's singles players had an
easy path to the third round which is slated for Thursday evening.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Wants Level Playing in Trade With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz Thursday stressed the need to create a level playing
field for Pakistan and India to enhance their trade and commercial
relations.
</P>
<P>
"A level playing field needs to be created in order to enhance
trade and commercial relations between the two countries as well
as within the larger ambit of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC)," Aziz said in a meeting with a
delegation of the Federation of Indian Export Organization.
</P>
<P>
He said India has complained that it is not given reciprocal
Most Favored Nation (MFN) status by Pakistan. "But despite this it
still imports less from us than we do from India," he added.
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, he said, the balance of trade has been in
India's favor for the last five years and was to the tune of 64
million U.S. dollars in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
India seeks free trade areas with its neighbors but maintains
non-tariff barriers and qualitative restrictions, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the minister said, New Delhi also insists on
restrictive lists that include core trading commodities.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that both Pakistan and India, although in different
stages of development in different sectors, are developing
nations.
</P>
<P>
In many areas, he said, "our economies are competitive rather
than complimentary."
</P>
<P>
He said a larger Indian production capacity seeks additional
markets whereas the smaller, nascent Pakistani industry needs
protection.
</P>
<P>
"We have no hesitation in stating clearly that as a smaller
economy, it is imperative for Pakistan to support and protect its
nascent industrial base," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Despite these limitations, he said, there are also numerous
trade and economic opportunities between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Given the appropriate political environment, he said, Pakistan
and India can become natural trading partners.
</P>
<P>
He said there exists great potential for the expansion of the
two countries' bilateral economic relations in the fields of
agriculture, communications, industry, trade, services,
infrastructure and development.
</P>
<P>
He said there is also great scope for expansion of economic
relations within the framework of SAARC.
</P>
<P>
However, he underscored the need for "a level playing field,
especially for protecting the interests of smaller economies."
</P>
<P>
Beyond SAARC, he said, there are great possibilities for trade
and economic cooperation with the Central Asian region.

<HEADLINE> Album Confirms Tibet Links to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A picture album issued here today
confirms the close contacts between the Chinese central government
and the Dalai and Panchen which have existed for generations.
</P>
<P>
The book depicts pictures of over 100 tributes and gifts from
the Dalai and Panchen lamas for generations, and invaluable
historical data is also included.
</P>
<P>
They give evidence that the titles, both political and
religious, of the two Living Buddha systems existing in Tibet were
conferred and granted by the Chinese central government.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, they show that the rule of drawing lots from a golden
vessel during the incarnation ceremony of reincarnating "soul boy"
was established in the mid-Qing Dynasty (1644-1911); and that the
Dalai and Panchen lamas for generations sent tributes and gifts to
the central government with their compliments, to show their
support to and acknowledge allegiance to the central government.
</P>
<P>
"This historical information underlines the central government'
s authority and effective sovereign supervision over Tibet," said
one of the album's publishers. "And the data vividly confirms that
Tibet is an inalienable part of China."
</P>
<P>
He said that he believed that the album would help people learn
about Tibet's past and present, as well as about the religious
situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Pictures of the golden appointment table and gold seal granted
to the 11th Panchen, the golden board inscribed with the words of
"Safeguard the Country and Benefit the People" from President
Jiang Zemin to Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery, and gifts from the 11th
Panchen to the central government were published for the first
time in the book.
</P>
<P>
The album is published by the Xinhua Publishing House in
Chinese and English editions with Tibetan captions.

<HEADLINE> Greek FM Calls for Regional Meeting on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Greek Foreign Minister
George Papandreou on Thursday urged the Balkan states to hold a
regional meeting to help promote the Kosovo peace talks, which are
scheduled to continue in France next week.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference following a meeting with Romanian
counterpart Andrei Plesu, Papandreou said Romania and Greece hold
a common position which is to ensure a peaceful solution to the
crisis in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
The Greek foreign minister claimed that the Balkan meeting
would seek to ease tensions in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
During the recent talks in Rambouillet, France, the Yugoslav
government and ethnic Albanians failed to agree on a peace plan
proposed by the international Contact Group on the former
Yugoslavia. The peace talks is due to reopen in Paris on March 15.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou also voiced the hope that Romania, as the present
rotating chairman of the organization for cooperation between the
eastern and southern European states, will exert influence on the
Kosovo issue by chairing the proposed regional meeting.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou, who arrived here only for a few hours, will leave
for Belgrade, the last leg of his five-nation tour, which has
taken him to Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, to meet with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Announces Weapons Sale to Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen announced here Thursday that America will sell 3.2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of advanced weapons to Egypt in the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
Cohen told a news conference after his meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak that the weapons include 24 advanced-model
F-16 fighter, 200 M1-A1 tanks and one eight-unit Patriot 3 model
anti-missile battery which has 32 missiles.
</P>
<P>
He said some of the weapons are the most sophisticated in the
U.S. arsenal. Egypt now has 196 F-16 fighters and 555 M1-A1 tanks.
</P>
<P>
The planned arms sale requires U.S. congressional approval,
which is considered likely by U.S. defense officials.
</P>
<P>
The new tanks will be assembled in Egypt from parts
manufactured in the U.S., U.S. defense officials said, adding that
the Patriot 3 model anti-missile system is still being developed
and tested and will be delivered in several years.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the multi-year weapons purchase will be
financed out of the 1.2 billion dollars military aid that Egypt
gets annually from the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived here Wednesday for a two-day visit after trips to
the six Gulf Cooperation Council states of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia,
Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait, and Jordan. He
traveled to Israel on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions whether his current Mideast tour is
aimed at promoting sales of U.S. weapons, Cohen said the United
States is not bringing an arms bazaar to the region.
</P>
<P>
"To the extent that Egypt feels it needs to modernize its
military in order to protect its own self-defense, that's a

<HEADLINE> German Parties Pass Citizenship Law Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 11 Xinhua) -- The German coalition government
reached a compromise Thursday on a modest reform of the country's
86-year-old bloodlines citizenship law, Interior Minister Otto
Schily said.
</P>
<P>
Under the reform, foreign children born in Germany will
automatically receive German citizenship and be allowed to remain
dual-nationals until aged 23 when they will have to choose a
single nationality.
</P>
<P>
Currently, children born to foreigners in Germany are not
allowed to receive German citizenship even in the third or fourth
generation, unless they go through a complex and expensive
naturalization process and agree to give up their foreign passport.
</P>
<P>
The new law will also allow adult foreign residents in Germany
to apply for German citizenship after eight-year instead of the
current 15-year waiting period.
</P>
<P>
Applicants will be judged on three criteria: allegiance to the
German constitution, ability to speak German, and a crime-free
record, said Schily, adding that adult dual-nationality will be
barred except for foreigners living longer than 30 years in
Germany or aged over 60.
</P>
<P>
The bill is backed by the Greens Party, the junior partner in
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's coalition. The compromise bill came
after the government ditched plans to offer dual-nationality to 7.
3 million foreigners living in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Anger in Germany over the planned dual-nationality option
helped the defeat of Schroeder's Social Democrats (SPD) in Hesse,
where they had been in coalition with the Greens.
</P>
<P>
Changing the citizenship law requires approval of parliament's
upper chamber, the Bundesrat, which represents Germany's 16 states.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's SPD has lost control of the Bundesrat after being
defeated in Hesse state election.
</P>
<P>
The key to get the compromise bill passed was approval of the
tiny Free Democratic Party (FDP) serving within a coalition with
SPD in Rhineland-Palatinate state.
</P>
<P>
The FDP, strongly against offering adult foreigners dual-
nationality, had the final say on the extent of the reform in
negotiations with Schily in Mainz on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hesse's SPD-FDP government will now vote for the bill, which is
expected to be approved by both chambers before the summer
parliamentary recess.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Calls For Strengthening NPC Supervisory Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Top Chinese legislator Li Peng
said today that China's legislature, the National People's
Congress (NPC), will strengthen supervision over government work
and safeguard judicial justice.
</P>
<P>
Attending a group discussion with NPC deputies from Liaoning
Province, Li said that, compared with its legislative work, the
NPC's supervisory work is relatively weak.
</P>
<P>
The public not only wants to have laws to go by but has a
strong hope that laws are strictly enforced and that whoever
breaks the law will be dealt with and punished, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the NPC and its deputies have the constitutional
right to supervise government work and that it is imperative to
work out a proper procedure to further standardize and
institutionalize its supervisory work.
</P>
<P>
To better exercise supervision, the NPC Standing Committee has
listed in its five-year work plan the enactment of a supervision
law and is making preparations to draft the law, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Focuses of our supervision should be on the national economic
development plan and implementation of the budget approved by the
NPC, major problems arising from the reform and development
process and issues that attract public concern or those that are
most complained about by people," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that in exercising supervision over individual
cases, the NPC should exercise its power collectively.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to promote grassroots democracy and
bring into full play the role of workers' congresses in
enterprises, residents committees in cities and villagers
committees in rural areas, he said. "Important decisions in
enterprises should be made with the consent of workers, and
enterprise management should accept supervision by workers," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is the country's old industrial base and workers there
have made important contributions to the country by providing huge
amounts of raw materials and key equipment, Li said.
</P>
<P>
But its irrational industrial structure formed under a planned
economy has brought about difficulties for enterprises there. Many
workers in state enterprises there have been laid off, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li urged the provincial government to give priority to
maintaining stability and to doing a good job of providing a basic
living standard guarantee for laid-off workers and helping them re-
employed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Ninth
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), urged a better job from all the CPPCC
committees and members today at the closing meeting of the 2nd
Session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
"All the CPPCC committees and members should have a high sense
of historical responsibility and mission and do a better job in
every field," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Earth-shaking changes have taken place in China during the
past 50 years. The CPPCC and the people have always had close
links and stood through thick and thin. The CPPCC committees and
members of all previous terms have made indelible contributions to
the country's prosperity, reunification of the motherland, social
development, happiness of the people and development of the CPPCC,
" the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China has experienced and overcome numerous
difficulties and obstacles of all kinds during the past 50 years.
"Such experiences caused us heavy cost but we also accumulated
rich experience which could lead us to stability and prosperity.
We should conscientiously sum up such experience and learn a
lesson from history for reference in the future," the chairman
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the current situation in China, Li Ruihuan said: "
The situation in China is generally favorable at present. Under
the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at
the core, we have withstood the test of the Asian financial crisis
and the catastrophic flooding, with the national economy
maintaining moderately high growth, reforms in all fields being
pushed ahead, people's life being improved and society being
maintained stable."

<P>
"But we still face lots of difficulties and problems in our
reform and development," he pointed out, adding that "To solve
these problems, we need to investigate into the new situation,
learn new knowledge, seek new approaches, and create new methods
in line with the basic principles of Marxism, basic laws of
development, and bear in our mind and cherish the basic experience
we have accumulated from the past."
</P>
<P>
Calling for better work from the CPPCC, the chairman pointed
out that investigation and study into the practical situation are
bases for improvement in work and should be emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"China is in a transitional period from a state planned economy
to a socialist market economy, and improvement is necessary in
many aspects and the situation is rather complicated," he said. "
We might mass up things because of misjudgment if we do not put
much efforts into investigation and study."
</P>
<P>
"Experience has shown that investigations of special issues is
an effective way to mobilize the CPPCC members and an important
means to enliven the CPPCC work," said the chairman.
</P>
<P>
The year 1999 is an important year in China's history since it
marks the 50th anniversary of the founding of New China and the
return of Macao to the motherland, Li Ruihuan said, calling for
all CPPCC committees and members to strengthen resolve and press
ahead despite difficulties, put forward proposals and suggestions
to share the burden of the Party and the people, and coordinate
relations and solve contradictions to help create a harmonious and
stable society.

Pyongyang, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Air strikes launched by the U.S.
against Iraq in no-fly zones violate Iraq's sovereignty and
territorial integrity, said a Foreign Ministry spokesman of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Thursday.

Iraq has formally expressed its stand of unrecognizing the "No-

</P>
<P>
Now, air strikes underwent almost every day, inflicting
casualties and economic hardship on Iraq, while causing
international concern over the region. The DPRK ministry holds the
U.S. and Britain responsible, he added.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones themselves were illegally established in
violation of a U.N. resolution, the spokesman said, adding that
the DPRK opposes conduct by the U.S. which violates the U.N.
charter and international law.

<HEADLINE> China to Set up Taxation Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official disclosed here
today that the government is considering setting up a special
police for tax collection as part of its efforts to reinforce the
taxation sector.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, China will further strengthen the field through
punishing various fraudulent activities including tax evasion and
obtaining illegal export tax refund from the state.
</P>
<P>
Jin Renqing, Commissioner of the State Administration of
Taxation, made the remarks during a group discussion of the
Beijing delegation to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC),
in session here since last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jin said that this year China will continue implementing a
proactive financial policy and, therefore, taxation departments
need to do a better job of tax collection.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, 95 percent of the financial
income of the country comes from tax collection.
</P>
<P>
Jin told the NPC deputies that there are 27 million self-
employed businessmen in China, but only a little more than 10
million of them have registered for paying tax. In future,
taxation departments will coordinate and cooperate with
administrations of industry and commerce to curb tax evasion, he
said.

<P>
OTTAWA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien has criticised French culture minister Catherine
Trautmann for inviting a Quebec minister to a meeting of cultural
ministers in Paris.
</P>
<P>
"There are international rules that must be followed," Chretien
told the House of Commons on Wednesday when questioned about
Canadian Heritage Minister Sheila Copps's decision to boycott a
ministerial meeting on March 11 because Quebec Cultural Affairs
Minister Agnes Maltais had been invited.
</P>
<P>
"This is an international conference, not a conference that
deals with La Francophonie," Chretien said. "The French minister
did not follow agreements between Canada and France. Under the
circumstances, the minister of Canadian heritage was very well
advised to act as she did, and I have myself protested to the
French Prime Minister."
</P>
<P>
"It was Canada's duty to ensure that international rules were
followed by everyone, including France," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Canadian Heritage Minister Sheila Copps canceled her
planned flight to Paris because France had refused to withdraw the
invitation to Quebec.

<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- England is more hopeful to win the
bid for staging the 2006 World Cup soccer finals after Wembley Plc
shareholders decided on Thursday to sell the Wembley Stadium to
the English Football Association.
</P>
<P>
The deal costs 106 million pounds (172 million U.S. dollars) to
the English Stadium National Trust, a subsidiary of the F.A.,
ending months of debate over the stadium's future.
</P>
<P>
England is planning to rebuild the world most famous soccer
stadium for the 2006 campaign, which will end when FIFA made the
final decision on where the finals will take place in March next
year.
</P>
<P>
Wembley was the venue for the 1948 Olympic Games and the 1966
World Cup finals and has been the home of the F.A. Cup Final since
it was built in 1923.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Lower Against U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian rupiah was closed at
9,350/9,450 to the U.S. dollar on the Jakarta inter-bank spot
market Thursday, declining by 295 points compared with Wednesday's
close of 9,055/9,075 per U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
This was the rupiah's lowest level since mid-January when the
rupiah plunged to 8,600 against the greenback.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that heavy U.S. dollar-buying interest from local
banks pushed the rupiah sharply lower from the start of trading.
</P>
<P>
With the demand for U.S. dollars magnified by the continuing
unrest in Ambon, capital of Maluku province, and other provinces,
and by fears of escalating tensions in the run-up to June's
parliamentary elections, many market participants believe the U.S.
currency will head higher still over the medium term.
</P>
<P>
Although Bank Indonesia had sold U.S. dollars through state
banks, the apparent intervention had little effect, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
With market liquidity evaporating fast as remaining
counter-party credit lines are trimmed ahead of this Saturday's
expected government announcement of bank closures, the demand for
U.S. dollars had a disproportionate impact on the rupiah's
exchange rate, explained the traders.

KIEV, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko and visiting Chinese State Councilor Wu Yi Thursday
discussed the possibilities of improving economic cooperation and
trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
China attaches importance to developing trade with Ukraine,
said Wu. The two countries should develop new avenues for
bilateral economic cooperation, said Wu, who arrived here Monday
for a four-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
She proposed diverse forms of economic cooperation including
processing and assembling, co-manufacturing and mutual investment.
Pustovoitenko agreed with Wu's comments.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed an accord regarding a 50 million yuan
(about 6 million U.S. dollars) loan to Ukraine by China. The loan
will be used to develop cooperation between the countries'
businesses.
</P>
<P>
In a separate meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Boris
Tarasyuk, Wu said she was pleased with the development of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Wu said China and Ukraine have no conflict of interests and
there are no obstacles to the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Tarasyuk said Ukraine would observe the principles defined in
the joint communique regarding the establishment of diplomatic
ties between the two countries. Ukraine will stick to the position
that the government of the People's Republic of China is the
legitimate government of China, and Taiwan is an inseparable part
of China, said Tarasyuk.

Wu left Kiev Thursday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Denies Secret Diplomatic Contact with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday ruled out
establishment of diplomatic relations with Israel and described
press reports in this regard as "speculative."
</P>
<P>
"There has been absolutely no contact with Israel. We have no
plan to open a diplomatic contact with Israel," Pakistani Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz told a group of reporters who were seeking
for confirmation of a news story on secret contacts between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
An English daily of Pakistan on Thursday quoted American
magazine Defense News as claiming that Pakistani and Israeli
diplomats have been secretly engaged in unofficial contacts for
the past two years despite Islamabad's official stance of no
recognition of Israel.
</P>
<P>
In its latest issue the magazine reported that Israel is
seriously considering developing defense ties with Pakistan and
has quoted the country's top national security official David Ivry
as making the statement.
</P>
<P>
"We have no contact with them and no intention to open
diplomatic relations. Some people are issuing such speculative
stories," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Pakistan's Ambassador in Washington Riaz
Khokhar as saying in mid-1998 interview that "Pakistan was
interesting in forging full diplomatic relations with Israel once
other Islamic states in the Gulf region did so."
</P>
<P>
"It makes a lot of sense to establish diplomatic relations with
Israel. But we will not be among the first to do so," Khokhar was
quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Offer Food Aid to War Displaced Ethiopians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) has approved a 24.3 million U.S.dollars emergency
operation to feed up to 272,000 Ethiopians internally displaced by
the border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release from WFP Nairobi Office available
here Thursday, the operation, expected to get underway by the end
of March, will last nine months and will involve distribution of
some 45,000 tons of food aid to mainly women and children in
Ethiopia's northern Tigray region.
</P>
<P>
The press release said that due to the conflict between Ethiopia
and Eritrea, many people had been displaced with the majority of
small subsistence farmers from very poor backgrounds being forced
to leave their land.
</P>
<P>
The WFP estimated that women and children represent up to 80
percent of those who require daily rations of the emergency food
aid.
</P>
<P>
The UN agency plans to provide 36,720 tons of cereals, 2,938
tons of pulses, 2,203 tons of vegetable oil, 368 tons of sugar
and 368 tons of salt for the emergency operation, with an
additional 2,754 tons for supplementary feeding for vulnerable
groups, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
WFP is also appealing to the international donor community to
provide the food necessary for the emergency operation.
</P>
<P>
To the extent possible, the press release said, WFP would
purchase locally the cereals and blended food aid for the
operation and imported food would be moved by WFP from port of
Djibouti to Mekele, capital of Tigray region.

<HEADLINE> Seoul to Offer Fertilizer to Pyongyang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will provide nearly 100,
000 tons of fertilizer to Pyongyang via an inter-Korean Red Cross
channel for the coming spring planting season, the Unification
Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of shipping the relief foods, we reached the
conclusion that it would be more effective from a humanitarian
standpoint for the Korean National Red Cross to send fertilizer
directly," a high-ranking ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Although it is too early to predict the size of Seoul's
potential fertilizer aid to the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK), the volume will range from a minimum of 50,000 tons
to a maximum of 100,000 tons, he said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea will have no problem in arranging delivery of the
fertilizer, since more than 500,000 tons of fertilizer is
available now.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Korean National Red Cross President Chung Won-shik
said his organization will launch fund-raising activities for
three months until June 15.
</P>
<P>
Last April, at the DPRK-South Korean talks in Beijing, China,
the DPRK requested a discussion of the possible provision of some
200,000 tons of fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
However, the talks broke down after the South Korean delegation
asked the DPRK to take steps to realize the reunion of separated
families under the principle of "reciprocity."
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has long suffered from food shortages due to natural
disasters such as floods and drought. A shortage of oil imports
has badly damaged the nation's chemical industry, slashing
fertilizer production drastically.
</P>
<P>
Under the statistics issued by the Unification Ministry, the
DPRK is able to produce only about 630,000 tons of fertilizer, far
short of its annual demand of 1.7 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Warring Factions Begin Fresh Talks: U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's warring groups
Thursday kicked off their crucial talks under the aegis of the
United Nations in Asghabad, capital of Turkmenistan, in a bid to
settle their thorny differences, a U.N. statement said here.
</P>
<P>
The statement released on behalf of the negotiating teams said:
"the start of the talks between the senior delegations clearly
demonstrates the shared willingness of both sides to search for a
political settlement through face-to-face negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Maulvi Wakil Ahmed Motawwakil, the dominant Taliban movement's
main spokesman, led his side at the talks with representatives of
northern opposition alliance headed by Younas Qanooni, political
advisor of key anti-Taliban commander Ahmed Shah Masood.
</P>
<P>
U.N. official Andrew Tasrewe is overseeing the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The talks failed to take place on Wednesday as scheduled as
representatives of northern opposition alliance could not fly to
Asghabad due to inclement weather in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"The talks are based on the mutual willingness of both sides
and are held without pre-conditions or pre-arranged agenda," the
U.N. statement said.
</P>
<P>
The negotiating teams thanked the "friendly and neighboring
country of Turkmenistan" for hosting the talks and also the United
Nations for its efforts to promote political settlement of the
conflicts in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The rival Afghan sides had a similar meeting in Asghabad last
month which produced no results.
</P>
<P>
Afghan sources said the representatives of Taliban, which
control more than 80 percent of the war-ravaged country including
capital Kabul, have expressed readiness to talk on ceasefire and
swap of prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
But the anti-Taliban coalition, which is confined to a few
pockets in northern Afghanistan, insisted on discussion on
political issues like formation of a broad-based government.
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan Foreign Minister Boris Sheikhmuradov arranged the
new round of peace talks during last week meetings with both
sides.
</P>
<P>
Sheikhmuradov paid a visit to Kandahar in southern Afghanistan
where he met with Taliban's top leader Mulla Muhammad Omar. On his
way back home, he stopped in Dushanbe, capital of Tajikstan, and
held talks with Masood, former Afghan defense minister.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations peace negotiator on Afghanistan Lakhdar
Brahimi last week announced that the representatives of the two
sides will meet in Asghabad "without any conditions and
prejudices."
</P>
<P>
"I would not say it is the last chance (to negotiate peace),
but I would appeal to them not to disappoint the people of
Afghanistan once again," said the former Algerian foreign
minister, who is currently in Iran on the third leg of his tour to
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the negotiators to go into the talks "with a
spirit of understanding, compromise and constructiveness."
</P>
<P>
The talks are taking place amid fears of renewed fighting
between the rival factions at the end of the Winter season. "Even
now each side is feverishly preparing for war," Brahimi told a
press conference in Islamabad.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier on Taxation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing
today called for intensified efforts to improve the taxation work
according to law and plug all loopholes in tax levying, so as to
ensure a steady growth of the state revenue.
</P>
<P>
"If taxation can't be guaranteed according to law, it will be
extremely hard for the government of a country to maintain normal
operations," said Li Lanqing, also a Standing Committee member of
the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central
Committee, during a panel discussion with deputies to the Ninth
National People's Congress, China's top legislature, in session
here since last Friday, from north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
In establishing the socialist market economy, there must be a
complete law system, and the government also must administer
according to law, the vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is the obligation of every citizen and legal
person to pay taxes according to law, and that efforts should be
made to improve the people's legal awareness in this respect.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier stressed that taxation policy is decided by
the state and no tax collector has the power to make any
adjustment to it or make any arbitrary decision to postpone levy
or grant tax reduction and exemption.
</P>
<P>
"Tax collectors must earnestly perform their duties and strive
to collect all due taxes to ensure a steady growth of the state
fiscal income," he urged.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the current problem of random collection
of various fees in some places has reflected a lack of legal
awareness and administrative regularity.
</P>
<P>
Effective measures must be taken to turn the reasonable parts
of these fees into corresponding taxes and resolutely chop off
those unreasonable parts, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Li also expressed his views on issues like governing the
country according to law, separating government functions from the
management of the enterprises.

<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese hi-tech firms are urging
securities departments to loosen listing restrictions so that they
can raise funds in the capital market, according to the Economic
Daily.
</P>
<P>
Financial experts believe that the accession of China's hi-tech
industry into the capital market will greatly promote the
development of China's hi-tech sector.
</P>
<P>
China's securities regulatory authority announced Wednesday
that China will give priority to listings by hi-tech firms
regardless of their scale and ownership.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has 120 listed hi-tech companies, with capital in
circulation accounting for 14 percent of the total in the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
However, long-term and sustainable development of the hi-tech
industry is hindered due to insufficient research funds and
irrational investment structure.
</P>
<P>
The experts stress that hi-tech firms should be encouraged to
get listed on the stock markets through capital restructuring, and
that the establishment of risk investment funds should be speeded
up.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A giant panda is critically ill
after apparently being trapped overnight by three dogs on a five-
meter tall pine tree in northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The panda, called Liuliu, was discovered in a distressed state
by a farmer in Liuba County and it has refused water and only
eaten a little food, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Now a team of vets is making all out efforts to save the panda'
s life. They say that because of its rough ordeal it is in a very
poor state and has also caught a cold.
</P>
<P>
The vets have also carried out routine tests on the beast's
excrement and urine after mucus was found in its droppings.
</P>
<P>
Believed to be about eight years old, the panda, the first to
be discovered in Liuba County, is under 24-hour supervision in the
Shaanxi Rare Animal Rescue Center, where it was sent for emergency
treatment last Sunday. There, vets are giving it a series of
injections and special pills every day.
</P>
<P>
There are six giant pandas in the Shaanxi Rare Animal Rescue
Center, a local wildlife management center. All were rescued after
being injured or falling ill in the wild. The oldest among them is
estimated to be about 20 years of age and the youngest two.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel Thursday vehemently
rejected the European Union's (EU) position over the holy city of
Jerusalem, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, in a formal letter to Israeli Foreign
Ministry, German, which is holding the EU presidency, reconfirmed
EU's support for the internationalization of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Thursday that Jerusalem is the eternal capital of Israel and any

</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon also stressed that
Israel views Jerusalem as an inseparable part of Israel. He noted
that Israel is now contacting with the EU so that it will withdraw
the letter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Germany Embassy in Israel said that the letter
was written after Israel demanded the EU representatives refrain
from meeting Palestinian officials in Jerusalem.
</P>

The embassy said that the EU's position over Jerusalem is in

<P>
Israel seized east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast

Under the Oslo agreements signed between the Palestinians and
Israel, the status of Jerusalem will be settled in the final
status talks, which has not yet started, but should be completed

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Reach Agreement on Agricultural Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's (EU) farm
ministers agreed here Thursday to compromise over the reform of
the 15-nation bloc's common agricultural policy.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came after the ministers held a series of
marathon talks starting on February 22 to March 11. The talks were
embodied in a reform package known as Agenda 2000.
</P>
<P>
The package involves reforms in the sectors of arable crops,
beef and veal, milk and wine, as well as in rules applying to
rural development support.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministers, the new blue print for the
agricultural budget will be left to the EU leaders, who will meet
on March 24-25 in Berlin to finalize an accord on the future of EU
spending.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the EU's agricultural funding, which totals 45-
billion U.S. dollars, accounts for nearly half of the total EU
budget.
</P>
<P>
European Commission President Jacques Santer said Wednesday in
the European parliament that the coming weeks are crucial for the
future of the union.
</P>
<P>
"We are preparing to make a decision on Agenda 2000 that will
play a decisive role in how we meet the challenges of the 21st
century and will prepare the union to take in a substantial number
of new member states," he told EU lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The present EU budget reforms, including the agricultural
policy reform, are vital to the bloc's proposed inclusion of new
member states from central and eastern Europe early in the next
century.

<HEADLINE> 2 Militiamen Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Two members of Israeli-allied
South Lebanon Army (SLA) were wounded Thursday in south Lebanon,
the National Broadcasting Network radio reported.
</P>
<P>
They were injured in attacks launched by the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrilla group on SLA's outpost at Krumi Arz in
Jezzine, just outside the Israeli-occupied border zone in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
One of the wounded was air-lifted to Israel for treatment, the
radio quoted SLA sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The attack raised to seven the number of SLA militiamen
wounded in south Lebanon, with another killed, since the beginning
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has since been spearheading a guerrilla war to drive
Israeli forces and SLA militiamen out of the country.

<P>
The New York Times:

<HEADLINE> Cong(K) Expels Six Western Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 11 (Xinhua)- - The Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) Thursday ordered the expulsion of six western
diplomats and officials who it accuses of spying.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Gaetan Kakudji told a news conference late
Wednesday night that the six included a British diplomat whose
expulsion had been announced earlier in the day, according to a
report reaching here from Kinshasa, capital of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The others are four British government officials and one from
the United States, detained in Kinshasa since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The government has decided to proceed with their immediate
expulsion from national territory by the first plane leaving
Kinshasa," Kakudji said.
</P>
<P>
"These men violated the Vienna Convention by introducing
themselves illegally into the grounds of the Ndolo Military Base,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"After an in-depth investigation, all the facts have been
established. These men were carrying sophisticated photography
equipment, maps of the barracks and of strategic points in the
city of Kinshasa and its environs," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
"This illustrates sufficiently the bad intentions of these
undesirable visitors with regards to the Democratic Republic of
the Congo."
</P>
<P>
DRC, the former Zaire, has been engulfed by eight months of
war as Kabila's government forces and those of his allies
Zimbabwe, Angola, Chad and Namibia fight Congolese rebels backed
by Rwanda and Uganda. The rebels control much of the country's
eastern regions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, Kakudji said the British diplomat who
was detained on Sunday was the ring-leader of the six-strong group
and had been ordered to leave the country at once.
</P>
<P>
Britain earlier criticised the expulsion of the diplomat, whom
it named as Gregor Lusty, and denied charges that the detained men
were spying.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian PM Against International Tribunal for KR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen said Thursday that he thinks the international tribunal cannot
be set up by the United Nations Security Council because of
differences over the issue between the council members.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with the Time magazine here, Hun Sen said
that the trial of Khmer Rouge (KR) leaders should be carried out
in Cambodia, not abroad.
</P>
<P>
He gave some reasons for that. "First is that we do not have
the confidence in the so-called international court of law because
some countries had involved in supporting the Khmer Rouge before."
</P>
<P>
"And second," he said, "is that there would not be any hope for
the establishment of the international court of law because there
would be some countries' veto or opposition at the U.N. Security
Council. So if such a court of law could not be established, for
how long we should be to keep Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok?"
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said "it is us who had tried to topple and dismantle
the political and military organization of the Khmer Rouge, so we
should be given the right to handle the issue by ourselves."
</P>
<P>
The fourth reason he put forward is related to the legal
framework under the Constitution of Cambodia which says no
Cambodian should be transferred to a foreign country to be tried.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said Cambodian courts have jurisdiction in cases of
genocide, and a local trial would be quicker and easier than
setting up an international tribunal. He also said that Ta Mok
will be tried on charges of genocide or crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Hun Sen said no one would be immune from the
prosecution in Cambodian courts. "I have to reaffirm my point that
I have not guaranteed anyone exemption from responsibility before
the law," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the interview which was broadcast by television Bayon,
Hun Sen denied the allegation that he Thai government or military
had been involved in the arrest of Ta Mok. Instead, he
acknowledged that the United States had offered some cooperation
in the arrest of Ta Mok.
</P>
<P>
The capture of Ta Mok, the last Khmer Rouge leader still alive
who had not defected to the government, has intensified the debate
on setting up an international tribunal to try the Khmer Rouge
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's Military Court has started from Tuesday to
investigate the charges against Ta Mok who was detained in Phnom
Penh's Military Prosecution Department prison.

<HEADLINE> ADB to Continue Helping Nepal Reduce Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) will continue to focus on poverty reduction in its
assistance to Nepal in the period of 2000-2002, the bank's Nepal
Resident Mission said Thursday in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached recently between the Nepalese
government and the bank's Country Programming Mission, agriculture
will continue to be an important sector in the process due to its
poverty reduction potential as well as its large share in the
country's overall output, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
It said the agreement outlined the directions and indicative
levels of loan and technical assistance for the targeted period.
</P>
<P>
It said annual lending levels have been programmed to be
similar to the average of 80-85 million U.S. dollars achieved over
the last five years.
</P>
<P>
"Projected levels of technical assistance grants will remain
around 5 million dollars annually," it said.
</P>
<P>
The press release noted that the loan funds will be provided
from the Asian Development Fund, the bank's soft loan window which
provides loans at 1 percent to 1.5 percent interest and a maturity
of 24 to 32 years including an eight-year grace period.
</P>
<P>
It said in the targeted period, the ADB will help Nepal reduce
poverty through the generation of productive employment
opportunities and the increase in rural incomes resulting from
faster, broad-based economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Improvement in basic and primary education and health services
as well as protection and improvement of the environment to
sustain gains in economic growth and poverty reduction over the
long term will also be pursued, the press release stated.
</P>
<P>
"Support will also be given for physical and social
infrastructure projects, capacity building, human development and
environment protection," the press release said. "The development
of the private sector, through the creation of an enabling
environment, would receive particular attention."
</P>
<P>
Being a founding member of the ADB, Nepal has traditionally
been an important borrower from the Asian Development Fund.
</P>
<P>
On a cumulative basis, the bank's lending to Nepal had reached
1.6 billion dollars for 94 loans by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
And by that time, the bank had also provided 208 technical
assistance grants of 85 million dollars for capacity building,
policy studies and preparation of projects, the press release
added.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial Hails Closing of CCPPC Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Friday edition of the People'
s Daily, a leading national newspaper in China, will carry an
editorial hailing the conclusion of the Second Session of the
Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), China's top advisory body.
</P>
<P>
The session was convened in an important period for the country'
s ongoing reform, opening-up and modernization drive and has
completed its scheduled agenda in a democratic, truth-seeking,
encouraging and satisfactory manner by upholding the great banner
of Deng Xiaoping Theory and implementing the principle of the
Fifteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
and the Third Plenary Session of its central committee, the
editorial says.
</P>
<P>
CPPCC national committee members have a good understanding of
the special significance of the annual session of the CPPCC
national committee and speak highly of the great achievements
China achieved in 1998, it says.
</P>
<P>
Members also spoke highly of the government work report, saying
that the report reflects the attitude of seeking truth from facts
on the part of the government, it says.
</P>
<P>
During the session, members expressed constructive views and
raised valuable proposals that "will play an important
consultative and referential role" for decision making by the CPC
and the government, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
Facts once again prove that adhering to and improving the
system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under
the leadership of the CPC is of great importance to ensuring
success in building socialism with China's characteristics, it
says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial goes on to point out that Macao will return to
the motherland in more than 200 days. This marks a complete ending
of the history when pieces of Chinese territory were occupied and
ruled by foreigners, it says. Members show great concern and
enthusiasm for the forthcoming event, it says.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC, the patriotic united front organization having the
broadest representation of the Chinese society, will make new
contributions to a smooth return of Macao and the reunification
of the motherland, the editorial says.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Ecological Problems Arouse International Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The improvement of ecological
conditions in the Three Gorges Dam area has caught the attention
of the World Bank, Japan and Germany, who are to cooperate with
the Chongqing Municipal Government in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Work on the Three Gorges Dam project at the upper reaches of
the Yangtze River, believed to be the largest of its kind in the
world, is in full swing. The project includes the damming of the
Yangtze River to create a 1,000 square kilometers reservoir, over
80 percent of which is in the Chongqing area.
</P>
<P>
Experts point out that environmental protection in the area
needs to focus on curbing water pollution in the Yangtze,
especially as the reservoir will be expected to have a very high
water quality.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and Chongqing Municipal Government will invest a
total of four billion yuan from this year mainly to improve the
sewage system and water and waste treatment of the city, as well
as the water supply and water environmental monitoring systems in
surrounding districts and counties where people moved from the dam
area now settle down.
</P>
<P>
A Sino-Japanese cooperative program, with a total investment of
nearly six billion yuan, will help tackle the problems of litter
and garbage and industrial wastes, and promote ecological
environmental protection in Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-German ecological program, which will cost about 178
million yuan this year, aims to increase the forestry coverage of
the Three Gorges Dam area by about 50,000 hectares in six years.
</P>
<P>
The French government has also expressed willingness to
cooperate with China in ecological protection in Chongqing. A
French company donated environmental protection equipment to the
southwest Chinese city last year.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang to Further Develop Border Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region in northwest China will continue to develop border trade as
an important component of the region's efforts of opening to the
outside world, a top local official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Last year witnessed the most rapid development for Xinjiang's
border trade, the total volume of which reached 869 million US
dollars, up by 15.9 percent over the previous year," said Abdul'
ahat Abdurixit, chairman of the Xinjiang Autonomous Regional
Government, in an interview with Chinese and foreign reporters.
</P>
<P>
Border trade contributed some 55 percent of the autonomous
region's overall foreign trade volume in 1998, which was 1.53
billion US dollars, representing an increase of 5.9 percent
compared with the figure of 1997, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Abdul'ahat, border trade in Xinjiang mainly
involves exports of grains, meat, sugar and other agricultural
products and daily necessities, as well as imports of raw
materials and chemical fertilizers from neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"There are three major forms of border trade, including barter
trade between people living in border areas, inter-company trade
and tourist shopping," said the chairman, adding that last year
goods purchase by tourists accounted for about two-thirds of
Xinjiang's border trade volume.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed confidence in bright prospects for a further
development of border trade in Xinjiang, which he said boasts
geographical advantages and strong complementarity in trade with
its neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Bordering on a variety of countries, such as Russia, Kazakhstan
and Kirghizstan, Xinjiang currently has 15 points of entry.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Disputes Trouble European-U.S. Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- With the rising dispute over the
banana trade between the two coasts of the Atlantic, a series of
new troubles in relations between the European Union (EU) and the
United States have broken out since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
After the European Union refused to open its market to Latin
American bananas, the United States unilaterally imposed a 100
percent customs duty on banana-containing products from EU
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, French bags and British cashmeres, which have nothing
to do with banana trade, have been affected by the sanction. The U.
S. expects to collect 500 million U.S. dollars of extra customs
income from the punitive action against the EU.
</P>
<P>
The unilateral action by Washington has caused indignation in
EU countries. In an unprecedented reaction, Britain summoned U.S.
ambassador to London twice to lodge its protest.
</P>
<P>
Despite the risk of unilateral sanctions by the U.S., which
bans international companies from cooperating with Iran in the
energy sector, French and Italian oil companies have also signed
new contracts with Iran on oil exploration.
</P>
<P>
The causes of the new trade friction between the EU and the U.S.
are the growing trade deficit in U.S. overseas trade and the slow-
down of economic growth in EU countries, which have contributed to
rising protectionism on both sides.
</P>
<P>
The birth of the European single currency euro has also
presented a potential threat to the domination of the U.S. dollar
in international monetary system.
</P>
<P>
Besides economic disputes, political disputes between the U.S.
and the EU are also on the rise.
</P>
<P>
France has openly criticized the continuous bombings of Iraq by
the U.S. and called for the lifting of economic sanctions against
Iraq, especially the oil embargo.
</P>
<P>
The French and U.S. defense ministers, Alain Richard and
William Cohen, made their separate tours to the Gulf
simultaneously last week and voiced opposite views about Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Kosovo, European countries and the U.S. differ
greatly over the ways to end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is more inclined toward a military option to force the
Serbs to accept the peace plan presented by the Contact Group,
while the EU takes a relatively moderate position and wishes to
persuade both Belgrade and ethnic Albanians to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
The plan to build a European defense system, first initiated by
France, Germany and Italy, and also accepted by Britain at the
Franco-British summit held in November in Saint-Malo, France, has
also caused concern in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Washington has warned Europeans against the creation of a
defense capacity separate from the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), which may cut the defense links between the U.
S. and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also accused EU countries of discriminating against
non-EU members of NATO such as Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Europeans are also bewildered by the U.S. participation in the
recent capture of Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan, the acquittal of
a U.S. pilot accused of murder in the mountain cable tragedy in
Italy last year, the execution of two German brothers by U.S.
prison authorities, and refusal by Washington to return the
archives of the former East German intelligence agency Stasi,
which the CIA bought from former KGB agents.
</P>
<P>
All the economic and political disputes between the EU and
Washington have cast a shadow over the forthcoming NATO summit in
Washington at the end of April, on which leaders will discuss
sensitive issues like the future strategy of NATO and the evolving
structure of European-U.S. military alliance.

According to the resolution, the CPPCC members have made
proposals on stabilizing and strengthening the development of
agriculture and rural economy and deepening state enterprise
reform, expanding domestic demand to drive economic growth,
preventing financial crisis, supporting the collective, self-
employed and private sectors, guaranteeing the basic life of the
layoffs of the state enterprises and helping them with re-
employment, implementing the strategy of invigorating the nation
through science and education, fighting corruption, cracking down
on criminal activities, and improving engineering project quality.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC members will continue to promote the cooperation
between Hong Kong and the inland areas in the fields such as
economy, trade, science, technology, and culture, and contribute
to maintaining its long-term prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
They believe that Macao will surely realize its smooth
transition and handover of political power.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Authorities are also urged to respond to the eight-
point propositon by President Jiang Zemin to push forward the
process of the reunification of the motherland, according to the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
The resolution says that the CPPCC will continue to improve the
standardization and systematization of political consultation,
democratic supervision and participation in government affairs.
</P>
<P>
The resolution concludes that the 2nd Session of the Ninth
CPPCC National Committee calls on all the CPPCC members to hold
high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and, under the
leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) with Jiang Zemin at the core, adhere and improve the
system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under
the CPC leadership, and strive for realizing the targets set for
the socialist modernization drive and the reunification of the
motherland.

<HEADLINE> China Not To Bring Poverty Into Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Wang Chaowen, a senior official
with the National People's Congress, still remembers how he walked
25 kilometers along hilly paths to his home village to arrange the
funeral for his deceased mother 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The then governor of Guizhou Province in southwest China
carried with him a briefcase filled with candles as there was no
electricity in the small village deep in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
Wang, now director of the NPC Ethnic Affairs Committee, has
just learned from his folks who are here attending the
legislature's annual session as deputies that 95 percent of the
households in his hometown are now lit with electricity lights and
that highways and phone lines lead to every village.
</P>
<P>
The changes in Wang's hometown mirror initial but remarkable
successes achieved by Guizhou province and China as a whole in
poverty elimination.
</P>
<P>
Strenuous efforts by local and central governments have reduced
the number of people living in absolute destitution in China from
250 million 20 years ago to 42 million at present. Last year alone
saw the number drop by an additional eight million, according to
deputy Yang Yongzhe, who used to be an official in charge of the
national anti-poverty program.
</P>
<P>
In Guizhou Province, one of the economically underdeveloped
regions noted for its huge poor population, about one million
people have shed poverty annually in recent years, said deputy Liu
Fangren, secretary of Guizhou provincial Party committee.
</P>
<P>
Dingxi,Hexi and Xihaigu are three prefectures in Gansu and
Ningxia, northwest China, described as "the hardest nut to crack"
in China's anti-poverty drive. People there have been mobilized to
build terraced fields, dig pools for storing water and construct
water conservation projects. As a result, millions of people in
the regions are emerging from poverty with relatively sufficient
food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
China still has 42 million people living under the poverty line.
Out of the total, about 20 million are in the remote areas of
southwest provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan with typical
karst topography, 10 million are in arid and dry northwest regions
and the remaining 10 million in extremely cold mountain areas that
have little access to transportation.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report to the current NPC session,
Premier Zhu Rongji pledged to help more than 10 million shake off
poverty this year.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the central government pledge, NPC deputies from
poor areas have aired views and offered suggestions and proposals
to help achieve the goal.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Yang Yongzhe said distributing relief funds among poor
people is no way to lift them permanently out of poverty. The
right approach is to help them help themselves by guiding them in
tapping development potential in the light of local conditions.
</P>
<P>
The central government will earmark six billion yuan by the
year 2000 to improve education in nine provinces in western
regions, in addition to expanding their export labor service,
soliciting international assistance and increasing cooperation
with eastern regions.
</P>
<P>
Governor Liu Fangren said Guizhou expects to eliminate absolute
poverty before the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Said Yang Yongzhe, "China will not bring poverty into the 21st
century as long as we make concerted efforts toward this end."

BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Education has
released a list of renowned Chinese scientists from across the
world, who will be appointed visiting scholars at major Chinese
universities beginning this spring, the first part of a special
program sponsored by the Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the scheme, which was given funding and sponsorship

shing in 1998, is to attract leading scientists to Chinese
universities.
</P>
<P>
Participants will receive an annual salary of 100,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The acclaimed scholars will teach courses in 48 disciplines
offered by 63 major universities throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>

will curb the brain drain in Chinese universities and stabilize
the teaching faculties.
</P>
<P>
They point out that the special fund will benefit China's
universities enormously and assist them to take an active part in
highly competitive worldwide academic fields, and will nurture
leading Chinese scientists for the coming century.
</P>
<P>
The professors will be asked to guarantee the length of their
working time in China, and every year they should spend no less
than four months in China.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close at Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A late surge carried the
Australian sharemarket to a new all-time high Thursday, sweeping
it through the 2,950 point barrier.
</P>
<P>
After opening lower, the market found its legs late in the day,
with a rally in banks and resources stocks, particularly oil and
gold shares, driving the market.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index picking up 19.1 points to
close at 2,950.5, off a high of 2,953.4, after drifting through
most of the session little changed.
</P>
<P>
That marked a new record for the domestic bourse, surpassing a
previous peak of 2,940.5 points recorded in January.
</P>
<P>
"The market was lackluster for most of the day and then seemed
to spurt itself upward as portfolio funds came back buying," said
Macquarie Equities' Lucinda Chan.
</P>
<P>
Chan said most of the focus was on telecommunications giant
Telstra which delivered an 1.8-billion-Australian-dollar (1.143
billion U.S. dollars) net profit for the first half of 1998/99, a
12.2-percent increase over the previous corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
Despite the profit increase, Telstra shares sank three cents
with analysts attributing the fall to a failure by Telstra to
include a special dividend in the interim results.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the all industrials index rose 21.2 points to 5,321.9
while the all resources lifted 21.4 points to 1,006.8.
</P>
<P>
The domestic market had opened slightly lower amid investor
uncertainty about the volatile U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
The gold sector was also shining with the index rising 26.7
points to 1,053.4 and the gold bullion spot price adding 1.70 an
ounce to 293.20 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Topping turnover on the broad market was major interest of the
day Telstra with 12.69 million shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Rival telecommunications company Cable &AMP; Wireless Optus was not
far behind with turnover of 11.18 million shares.
</P>
<P>
BHP was up 31.3 cents, and it is due to release its third
quarter results on March 26.
</P>
<P>
News Corp. was steady at 11.50 Australian dollars while its
preferred shares dipped five cents.
</P>
<P>
The banking index also gained some ground in late trade,
picking up 62.7 points to 6,917.6 points.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank lifted 46 cents, National Australia Bank
gained 25 cents, Westpac added one cent on turnover of 9.6 million
shares and ANZ rose 3.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
National turnover on the sharemarket was 572.33 million shares
worth 1.39 billion Australian dollars (875.7 million U.S. dollars)
with 632 rises, 610 falls and 416 steady.

<P>
BANGKOK, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government burned 1,142
kilograms of illicit narcotics in an annual drug-burning ceremony
to show its resolution to crack down on illicit drug use and
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony, held in the central province of Ayutthaya, some
70 kilometers north of Bangkok, was organized by the Food and Drug
Administration, the Office of the Narcotics Control Board and the
Government Public Relations Department.
</P>
<P>
Among the narcotics burned in the ceremony were 680 kilograms
of heroin, 340 kilograms of opium and 101 kilograms of
amphetamines.
</P>
<P>
Thailand was hailed by the United States annual narcotics
report last month as a leader in the war against drugs in Asia.
However, the country was warned that harsh budget cuts resulting
from the economic crisis were undermining its efforts in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, Thailand and its neighbor Myanmar announced
a joint plan to crack down on narcotics so as to meet a deadline

ISLAMABAD, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Rafiq Tarar
said here Thursday that his country will continue to play a
positive role in attaining durable peace in the world and
"particularly in this region."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint sitting of the Parliament to mark the advent

world.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan now has possessed enough strength to repel any
aggressive assault.
</P>
<P>
The best way for Pakistan to serve the cause of peace is by
removing the temptation of aggression from the path of those "who
think that we are weak and therefore they can bully us and attack
us," said Tarar.
</P>
<P>
"We are aware of the horrors of atomic warfare and we shall go
on working for the peace, prosperity and progress of the whole
world in keeping with the spirit of Islam," Tarar said.

<HEADLINE> Non-State Sector China's Major Employment Source (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese legislators and
government advisors gathering in Beijing for annual full sessions
share the view that the non-state-owned sector has become a major
employment source in China today.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here regard this as a very positive sign for the
smooth adoption of a draft Constitutional amendment, submitted to
the ongoing Second Session of the Ninth National People's Congress,
China's legislature, for deliberation last Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendment suggests adding to the Chinese Constitution
a statement which describes the non-publicly-owned sector as "an
important component" of a socialist market economy and stresses
protection for its development.
</P>
<P>
The non-state sector in China includes not only private
businesses, but also collectively-owned enterprises and joint
stock companies without state capital in both urban and rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics late last
month show that by the end of 1998, China's total employment was
699 million people, up by 3.57 million over 1997. Meanwhile, the
urban private sector hired 32.32 million people, an increase of 5.
63 million compared with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"These figures indicate that the non-state sector is assuming
an increasingly important role in helping expand employment in
China while the state-owned economy can no longer provide so many
job opportunities," one analyst said.
</P>
<P>
China is under increasing employment pressure as a result of
the country's baby boom in the 1960s and 70s and massive layoffs
of loss-making state-owned enterprises eager to find a way out by
downsizing.
</P>
<P>
Top Chinese leaders have repeatedly expressed great concerns
about the employment issue, as China's urban registered
unemployment rate hit 3.1 percent last year. Urban population in
China is about 379 million.

<TEXT>
<P>
Legislators from Beijing noted that in the Chinese capital,
some 80 percent of the former unemployed and workers laid off from
state-owned enterprises have found new jobs in non-state
enterprises in the service sector, such as real estate management
companies, franchised stores, restaurants and community service
centers.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, China's largest city and industrial base, the
total number of private enterprises has to date reached 94,000,
said legislator Huang Qifan, director of the Shanghai Municipal
Economic Commission.
</P>
<P>
From 1994 to 1998, the private sector in Shanghai hired a total
of 178,000 workers laid off from the state-owned sector, Huang
added.
</P>
<P>
According to legislator Qian Xingzhong, mayor of east China's
coastal city of Wenzhou, state-owned enterprises in the city over
the past two decades of reform and opening-up have laid off as
many as one-third of their employees, but none of these laid-off
workers has ever asked the local government to help them find a
new job.
</P>
<P>
"This is all because we have spared no effort in promoting the
development of the private economy in the city," said Qian.
Wenzhou enjoys fame as "the capital of China's private economy".
</P>
<P>
Legislator Li Yining, one of the most prestigious economists in
China today, said it's high time for the government to help laid-
off workers understand that employment doesn't necessarily mean
having a job in a state-owned enterprise and that the non-state
sector is also a fine place to work in.
</P>
<P>
"I hope China's non-state sector can achieve further
development and offer jobs to everyone who wants to work," said
this professor of Beijing University.

<HEADLINE> India Not Serious in Talks: Pakistani Army Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff
General Pervaiz Musharaf Thursday said that India is not serious
in talks with Pakistan and therefore the talks are only an
exercise in verbosity.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen after President Rafiq Tarar's address at the
joint sitting of the parliament, Musharaf said, "Unless India is
serious, talks on Kashmir are useless."
</P>
<P>
"Indians are only interested in verbosity," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Pakistani government knows better on talks with
India.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Siachen dispute with India is not
separated from the Kashmir issue. "There will be no separate
agreement on Siachen with India."
</P>
<P>
Musharaf welcomed the president's announcement that there will
be no cut in the defense budget and said the armed forces will
meet the nation's expectations.
</P>
<P>
On India's military exercises in Pokhran near the Pakistani
border, he said they pose no danger to Pakistan. "We are not
worried about them. We are fully alive to the country's defense,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Unemployment Rate Falls to Lowest Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Australia's unemployment rate in
February fell to its lowest level in eight-and-a-half years, new
figures showed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate fell to 7.4 percent, seasonally adjusted, from
7.5 percent in January, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
said.
</P>
<P>
This is the lowest level since September 1990, the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
It said 32,900 more people were employed in the month, while
the participation rate of people in the workforce rose marginally,
to 63.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists had expected employment growth to pick up in
February, but the jobless rate was expected to rise marginally
because of an expected lift in the participation rate.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard said the fall in the jobless rate
was tremendous, but more needed to be done to reform the labor
market.
</P>
<P>
He said the youth unemployment rate was the lowest since
September 1991.
</P>
<P>
The ABS said 8.7 million people were now in the workforce.
</P>
<P>
It said the number of people out of work and looking for a job
fell by 7,400 to 696,500.
</P>
<P>
Youth unemployment fell to 23.5 percent, seasonally adjusted,
from 24.1 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
The number of long-term jobseekers - those registered as
unemployed for more than a year - fell by 0.4 percent (1,460) to
376,844.

to regain my composure," said the 24-year-old Juinio, who needed
two hours and 20 minutes in toppling the world's No. 447 Jessup.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate Divided On Visiting Force Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Most of Philippine Senators are
inclined to vote for the ratification of the Philippine-United
States Visiting Force Agreement (VFA) but they remain divided on
whether to submit the accord to a referendum, an official report
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to a Philippine News Agency report, Senators Blas
Ople and Ramon Magsaysay said that a referendum on the agreement
is not mandatory, while Senators Teofisto Guingona and Rodolfo
Biazon believe that it might be better for the people to share in
the decision over the VFA.
</P>
<P>
Guingona said a referendum would enable the people not just to
have a say on the issue, but more importantly, to exercise their
power as the source of "our country's sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
The seriousness of the issue warrants a referendum on the VFA,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The agency report quoted senate sources as saying that at least
13 senators are already inclined to vote for the ratification of
the VFA, while only three are categorically opposed to it.
</P>
<P>
This leaves only seven senators still undecided, and more of
them may vote for ratification, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The ratification of the VFA needs a two-thirds majority, or 16
of the 24 members of the senate must vote in favor of the accord.
</P>
<P>
The VFA, an implementing mechanism of the Philippine-U.S.
Mutual Defense Treaty, is envisioned to serve as the legal
framework for the treatment of American troops visiting the
country for limited periods to participate in joint military
exercises with Filipino troops.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The French telecommunications
company, Alcatel, will lay off 12,000 employees from its plants
around the world in the years 1999 and 2000, said the president of
Alcatel, Serge Tchuruk, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tchuruk said that the lay-off plan will most affect Alcatel's
employees in the United States, where the company will close its
plant Alcatel Data Networks.
</P>
<P>
Alcatel, which employs 120,000 people, has already sacked 30,
000 employees since 1995.
</P>
<P>
The fresh lay-off will enable the company to save 300 million
euros (330 million U.S. dollars) in the coming two years, Tchuruk
said.
</P>
<P>
The company made a net profit of 2.34 billion euros (2.574
billion dollars) in 1998, 711 million euros (781.1 million dollars)
more than that in 1997, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A president-signed executive
order has transferred Sports programs and activities of Department
of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) to the Philippine Sports
Commission (PSC), making it the primary agency tasked to formulate
policies and oversee the national sports development program.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said Thursday that the
order, aiming at rationalizing the implementation of sports
programs and activities, was signed by President Estrada on March
5.
</P>
<P>
Barican said the order mandates the DECS to continue to have
jurisdiction over the enhancement of the physical education
curriculum and its application in whatever form inside schools.
</P>
<P>
However, the management and implementation of all school-based
sports competition among schools at the district, provincial,
regional, national and international levels, in coordination with
concerned public and private entities, will now be the
responsibility of the PSC.
</P>
<P>
Under an executive order of Estrada, DECS was mandated to
formulate, plan, implement and coordinate policies, plans programs
and projects for physical education.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Production Slows Down Sharply in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- India's industrial production
declined sharply in the first 10 months of the current financial
year beginning from April 1, 1998, official statistics released
here Thursday show.
</P>
<P>
Growth in industrial production from April 1998 to January this
year went down to 3.3 percent from 6.9 percent in the same period
of the last financial year, according to the Index of Industrial
Production (IIP) released by the Central Statistical Organization
(CSO).
</P>
<P>
The growth rate fell even further to 2.1 percent in January
this year in contrast to 7.8 percent in the same month last year,
the IIP shows.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing, which accounts for almost four-fifths of the
total weight in the IIP, registered a growth rate of 2.6 percent
in January compared to 7.5 percent in the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative growth rate in the manufacturing sector was 3.5
percent during the 10-month period as against 7 percent during the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
CSO, in its advanced estimates released last month, had
predicted a 5.8-percent growth rate in the manufacturing sector
for the whole year, which will be over at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the mining sector continued to be negative at 4.5
percent in January compared to a 10.6-percent growth rate
registered in the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
The electricity sector registered a growth rate of 4.5 percent
last December as against 7.6 percent in the same month in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The sector, whose performance in general was better than the
other sectors, posted a growth of 6.5 percent in the April-January
period compared to 6.2 percent recorded in the last financial
year, according to the CSO figures.
</P>
<P>
The capital goods sector recorded a growth rate of 9.8 percent
in January, marginally lower than the 10.1 percent achieved in the
same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Cumulative growth rate in capital goods during the year so far
was put at a much higher level of 10.6 percent compared to only 7
percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the basic goods sector registered a negative growth
rate of 0.4 percent in January this year compared to 7.5 percent
in the same month in 1998, thus pushing the cumulative growth rate
of the sector so far to 1.4 percent in contrast to last year's 6.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of intermediate goods went up to 6.8 percent in
January from 4.8 percent in the same month last year, while the
cumulative growth rate in the sector declined to 4.8 percent from
8.6 percent in the same period of the last financial year.
</P>
<P>
Consumer goods recorded a negative growth rate of 1.3 percent
in January compared to 10.3 percent in the same month last year
and the cumulative growth rate in the segment went down to 2.1
percent during the April-January period from 5.3 percent in the
same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Finishes Stronger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar finished
stronger but off its highs Thursday, as negative comments from
Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Ian Macfarlane took the
gloss off strong employment data.
</P>
<P>
MMS Standard &AMP; Poor's currency strategist Alex Douglas said the
local unit rose during the first half of the day, urged on by
strength in gold, a leading commodity index, the Japanese yen, and
an eight-and-a-half-year low in unemployment.
</P>
<P>
But Macfarlane's conclusion that the Australian economy would
slow this year and the current account deficit would head towards
6 percent of the GDP dragged the local currency down during the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Douglas said the RBA governor's Tokyo speech "caused a little
bit of concern."
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished trading at 63.68 U.S. cents from
63.50 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Douglas said the Australian dollar strengthened Wednesday night
and earlier Thursday mainly on the back of commodity gains.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in a month, the much-watched Commodity
Research Bureau index broke through 190 points, finishing up 2.41
points in New York at 190.56.
</P>
<P>
Also in New York gold for current delivery closed at 294.20
U.S. dollars per ounce, up 80 cents from Wednesday's close.
</P>
<P>
"The jobs data helped us reach that peak," Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics said the unemployment rate
fell to its lowest since September 1990, at 7.4 percent in
February.
</P>
<P>
But the Australian dollar faded later after Macfarlane's Tokyo
comments.
</P>
<P>
The governor said the Australian economy is still expected to
slow noticeably despite surprisingly strong growth in 1998, and
described the jobless rate as average.
</P>
<P>
"While Australia has had good results on growth, inflation and
productivity, our results on unemployment could only be described
as average," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was also buying 76.25 Japanese yen from
76.90 and 0.5801 euro from 0.5834.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Host 1st South Asian Neurosurgical Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The first South Asian
Neurosurgical Congress will open here Friday with the theme of
"regional collaboration in neurosurgery."
</P>
<P>
About 130 papers will be presented at the three-day meeting
which will be attended by 300 specialists including eminent and
emeritus neuroscientists from the United States, Britain, Germany,
Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri
Lanka and Nepal, the Nepalese Society of Clinical Neurosciences,
the organizer, said Thursday in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The Nepalese Society of Clinical Neurosciences said that "the
expensive ultra-modern technologies practiced in developed
countries to overcome the neurological anomalies are beyond access
to the population of developing countries in general and people of
South Asia in particular."
</P>
<P>
"This congress will act as a forum for sharing of the
experiences gained so far and planning of future strategies for
delivery of effective neurological service, training and research
in the region," it noted.
</P>
<P>
It said neuroscientists from both outside and within the region
shall have in-depth deliberations which will initiate the process
of regional collaboration for the development of all facets of
neurosurgery relevant to the realities of South Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Nepali King Birendra is scheduled to inaugurate the congress,
the organizer said.
</P>
<P>
A doctor said that in Nepal alone, about 700,000 people need
neurological expertise every year and 11,000 of them need major
neurosurgery, but only 10 percent of them receive the service.
</P>
<P>
Nepal lacks trained neurosurgeons with only 15 neuro-doctors,
the doctor was quoted by a newspaper as saying.

<HEADLINE> Journalist in S. Africa Given Top Secret Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) appears to have bungled by giving
a Swiss journalist top secret documents by mistake, South African
Press Association (SAPA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that the documents given to Jean-Philippe
Ceppi by the TRC were in fact top secret and not in the public
domain as originally claimed by the TRC, according to SAPA.
</P>
<P>
The documents were on the apartheid regime's biological and
chemical warfare program.
</P>
<P>
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's office has written to the TRC
seeking clarity on the status of the documents, Mbeki's spokesman
Ronnie Mamoepa confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ceppi was arrested last Friday on military intelligence orders
for possession of confidential documents. He spent the weekend in
jail, but was released on Monday when state prosecutors decided
not to press charges after TRC officials told the court in an
affidavit that the documents had been made public during the
commission's biological and chemical warfare hearings last year.
</P>
<P>
TRC spokesman Mdu Lembede confirmed that the commission's chief
 executive officer, Biki Minyuku, was drafting a report "not
necessarily on the document itself, but on events leading up to
the arrest of the journalist."
</P>
<P>
Lembede was unable to say whether the documents given to Ceppi
were in fact confidential. He said a bundle of documents had been
given to the TRC during last year's chemical warfare hearings, and
that some of them had in fact not been made public because they
were confidential.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted reliable sources as saying that the government had
given the TRC a written submission ahead of the chemical warfare
hearings, and had been assured by a commissioner that its contents
would only be read by the commissioners and the TRC's chief
investigator.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the public hearings, government legal advisers and the
TRC had agreed on which top secret documents would be made public
and which would remain confidential. A list was duly drawn up.
</P>
<P>
However, it appeared that someone at the TRC had slipped up and
given the wrong set of documents to the journalist.
</P>
<P>
Sources have ruled out the possibility that Ceppi will be
recharged. Ceppi is in South Africa investigating links between
the Swiss government and apartheid-era South Africa for Television
Suisse Romande.

<HEADLINE> Interactive Govt Service Directory Launched in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) launched here Thursday its Interactive
Government Services Directory (IGSD).
</P>
<P>
Employment services, road traffic information, investment
services and other information on public services will be at
finger tips after the launching of the innovative project.
</P>
<P>
Through IGSD, the public will be able to obtain selected
government services and information on public services over the
Internet in an interactive manner.
</P>
<P>
The new service will offer a web-enabled directory of telephone
numbers and web site addresses for public services.
</P>
<P>
The public can also access selected interactive services
provided by the Industry Department, Labor Department and
Transport Department.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the innovative project is part of the SAR
government's efforts in promoting the wider use of information
technology (IT) in the community and the adoption of electronic
transactions in Hong Kong under the "Digital 21" IT Strategy.
</P>
<P>
The Telephone and Web site Directory on Public Services
provides a user-friendly directory which categorizes public
services by their nature, rather than by department.
</P>
<P>
It also provides hyperlinks to the homepages of government
bureaus/departments and public agencies for detailed information
on specific types of public services.
</P>
<P>
Through the new service, road users can obtain on-line video
images of traffic conditions on major routes and information on
major road closure and on public transport services to and from
the airport.
</P>
<P>
The Industry Department will through the same system provide
investors with information about making investment in Hong Kong;
present personalized information to investors; and notify
individual investors via e-mail as and when new information of
interest to them has been put on the department's homepage.
</P>
<P>
As for the interactive employment service of the Labor
Department, it will allow job seekers to search for job vacancies
registered with the department based on specific search criteria.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, employers will be able to search for potential
candidates registered with the department based on specified
search criteria.
</P>
<P>
Employers can also submit vacancies to the Department through
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Apart from personal computers with Internet connection, members
of the public can access IGSD through computers for public use in
selected District Offices and public libraries. Some major
telecommunications companies in Hong Kong also provide access
points to the public.
</P>
<P>
K. C. Kwong, secretary for information technology and
broadcasting of the HKSAR, said that through this directory, the
government can promote public awareness about electronic services,
which will pave the way for the launching of the "Electronic
Service Delivery" scheme in the latter half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
In his Policy Address in October last year, Chief Executive
Tung Chee Hwa set the target of building Hong Kong into a leading
city in the world for the development and application of
information technology, especially in electronic commerce and
software engineering.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang announced a 13 billion HK
dollar (1.7 billion U.S. dollar) Cyberport project in his budget
address on March 3.
</P>
<P>
Hongkong Telecom and Microsoft have announced strategic
cooperation to develop high-speed broadband services that will
allow Hong Kong to fully experience the convergence of low-cost
personal computer and telecommunications technologies.

<HEADLINE> Botswana, Namibia Call for End to Angolan War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of Botswana
and Namibia have called on Angola to stop "a senseless war" and
allow Africa and the international community to help restore peace
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Both Botswana President Festus Mogae and his Namibian
counterpart, Sam Nujoma, blamed Jonas Savimbi and his rebel UNITA
(National Union for the Total Independence of Angola) movement for
the renewed conflict, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It is frustrating to see the war in Angola," Nujoma was quoted
as saying on Wednesday at a state banquet in Gaborone.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma is in Botswana for a three-day state visit.
</P>
<P>
"Savimbi must be held to account. Africa must not allow Angola
to slide further into conflict," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mogae said he was seriously concerned about the reversal of the
peace process in Angola. The international community still had a
role to play in bringing peace back to that country, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to Angola not to shut out the international community
and to UNITA to stop this senseless war against the Angolan
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to SAPA, neither leaders mentioned tensions over
borders between their own countries, saying only that they enjoyed
the will and desire for peaceful cooperation and coexistence.
</P>
<P>
"We have worked to broaden and deepen our relationship. This is
 testimony that we are not only neighbors, but members of a
family," Mogae said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are fighting an international court battle
over an island in the northern border.
</P>
<P>
At the banquet, Nujoma said his visit to Botswana would add a
new dimension to their bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders stressed the need for economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said Namibia was looking to diversify its economy from
its almost total reliance on diamonds, as was Botswana.
</P>
<P>
"We have a commitment to work even more closely together,"
Nujoma said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Beijing To Build Five Residential Areas For Migrant Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is to build five
residential areas for migrant workers in Beijing, so as to control
the growing migrant population, and at the same time improve their
living conditions, officials with the Beijing Municipal City
Planning Administration revealed today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 80 percent of the three million migrant
population in Beijing are working people, and that their large
numbers have brought a lot of problems for public security and the
social environment.
</P>
<P>
The residential centers will be located in Chaoyang District,
Haidian District, Fengtai District, Shijingshan District, and are
about one hectare each. They will be made up of one or two-story
buildings, and the construction cost per square meter is estimated
to be about an average of 1,000 yuan ( 120 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The officials said that they will also build kindergartens and
other infrastructure in the neighborhoods to make easier the daily
life of residents.
</P>
<P>
The residential areas will be completed within the year and the
outsiders may apply for the accommodation with their valid legal
documents by the end of June.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Opposes U.S. TMD Plan in S.Korea, Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) is opposed to the U.S. plan to develop
Theater Missile Defense (TMD) systems in South Korea and Japan,
saying that will only lead to a new round of arms race.
</P>
<P>
According to an editorial published Thursday in the newspaper
Rodong Sinmun, the U.S. State Department has recently submitted a
secret report to Congress and recommended establishing the TMD
systems in South Korea and Japan due to missile threats from a
certain country.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK will not stand by with folded arms on this issue, said
the editorial.
</P>
<P>
The editorial also urged the U.S. to give up the TMD plan,
saying it will not work as an umbrella to protect the U.S. troops
in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. withdraws its troops from South Korea and its
peripheral areas, there is no need for it to develop such a costly
TMD system using high and new technologies.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Discovers 80,000 Cases of Smuggling, Commercial Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's anti-smuggling forces
discovered more than 80,000 cases of smuggling and commercial
fraud in more than one year, local press reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's anti-smuggling forces were implementing the prime
minister's Directive 853 on fighting smuggling and commercial
fraud issued on October 11, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The figure was released at a meeting here on Wednesday by
Vietnam's Government Steering Committee for the implementation of
the directive.
</P>
<P>
Goods involved in those cases were worth more than one trillion
Vietnamese dong (roughly 72.5 million U.S. dollars), the meeting
was told.
</P>
<P>
Participants affirmed that the intensified fight against
smuggling and commercial fraud had helped boost domestic
production.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dzung told the
participants that local authorities and party organizations,
especially at the grassroots level, should pay more attention to
the anti-smuggling and commercial fraud fight and coordinate more
closely with anti-smuggling agencies and forces.
</P>
<P>
He said Vietnam's domestic businesses should also improve
production and the quality of their products so as to compete with
imported goods as a way to combat smuggling.

<HEADLINE> Italy Warns to Revise Agreement on US bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'
Alema warned here today that, if responsibility cannot be
ascertained for the Mt. Cermis tragedy in which 20 European
citizens died last February, agreements governing the use of U.S.
and NATO bases in Italy will have to be revised.
</P>
<P>
The twenty were killed when the tail of a U.S. Marine Prowler
electronic warfare plane sliced through the Mt. Cermis cable-way
in the Dolomites in northeast Italy and sent the gondola carrying
the victims plunging into the mountain side.
</P>
<P>
The plane's pilot Captain Richard Ashby was acquitted of all
blame by a court martial at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, on
Thursday, the day before a summit in Washington between D'Alema
and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"If responsibility for the Mt. Cermis tragedy is not
ascertained," D'Alema told parliament Wednesday afternoon that an
updating and revision of the NATO agreements of 1951 would be
necessary.
</P>
<P>
He also said that, if Ashby was not responsible, responsibility
would have to be sought higher up the chain of command and, if it
could not be found there, this would show that the present
regulations governing NATO's presence in its members' territory
are inadequate.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema also confirmed to parliament that he and Clinton agreed
to start bilateral talks to review the agreements governing the
use of U.S. and NATO bases in Italy.
</P>
<P>
In response to D'Alema's statement, the leading spokesman for
the conservative opposition, ex-Foreign Minister Antonio Martino
told the House that the problem at Mt. Cermis was violation of
existing NATO agreements.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister should have told us how come existing
international treaties were not respected," said Martino, saying
that the ascertained facts showed that the plane was flying "
culpably too low" and too fast.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Romano Prodi, who was premier at the time
of the tragedy, said an extensive review of the NATO bases' role
should be used to reconsider Europe's ideas about defense, arguing
that the NATO agreements can only be revised in depth if Europe
gets its own joint defense system.

<HEADLINE> Britain Ready to Assist Nigeria in Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The British government will be
willing to assist Nigeria in tackling its debt problem if the
in-coming O. Obasanjo government demonstrates a responsible
approach to governance, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook has
said.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure for Ghana in continuation of his west
African tour, cook said Wednesday that Nigeria must re-evaluate
its attitude to international creditors before Britain could help
in debt negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The visiting foreign secretary who arrived in Nigeria Monday
told reporters that Nigeria's debt management credential had been
severely damaged by the late Abacha regime which he said refused
to pay its due to international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that it would be important for President-elect
General Olusegun Obasanjo to demonstrate that "they have a
responsible approach to the management of the economy of Nigeria
and a responsible attitude to international financial
institutions."
</P>
<P>
As at the last count, Nigeria is owing international financial
institutions between 28 and 30 billion U.S. dollars and the debt
problem is one of challenges facing the in-coming Nigerian
government.
</P>
<P>
Cook, who announced the monetary donation to the Nigerian army
after a closed-door meeting with President-elect General Obasanjo
in Otta, Ogun State, said that the donation by the British
government was to help in rebuilding the Nigerian army along a
purely pro-civilian orientation.
</P>
<P>
This would help stabilize the Nigerian army for a useful role
in the forthcoming civilian dispensation without threatening the
fragile base of the new democratic venture in the west African
country, he explained.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting with Cook, General Obasanjo restated that his
 government would not be so irresponsible as to withdraw Nigerian
soldiers from Sierra leone without making sure the country's
security situation is reasonably under control.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his government would support the embattled
country more in the area of peace and reconciliation and
emphasized that the solution to the country's crisis could be
found essentially by the Sierra Leoneans themselves.

<HEADLINE> China to Plant More Trees to Ease Timber Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China plans to create more timber
forests of 13 million to 27 million hectares by the year 2000 to
meet the increasing domestic timber demand, according to the State
Administration of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
By then, China will need a total of 180 million cubic meters of
timber, including 110 million for manufacturing and building use,
but the expected supply of timber for such uses will reach only
about 60 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The ban on logging in the upper reaches of the Yangtze and
Yellow rivers following last summer's severe floods worsened the
situation, bringing the shortage to 55 million cubic meters, said
the SAF.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the country will plant 1.2 million hectares of trees
for intensive management, mainly those in short supply such as
China fir, Masson pines and eucalyptus.
</P>
<P>
While planting more timber forests, the country also plans to
strengthen the tending of young timber forest.
</P>
<P>
In the past, China paid attention to planting but little to
tending, which affected the economic returns of the timber forest,
said an SAF's official.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show China now has 60 million hectares of young
timber forests, among which nearly 20 million hectares need
immediate tending.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Strikes New Offshore Oil Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Texaco and Statoil have struck a
new offshore oil well in the offshore prospecting lease of Block
218 in the central Niger Delta of southeastern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
New Nigerian newspaper Thursday quoted the Managing Director of
Texaco Overseas Producing Company of Nigeria, Simone Gregoria, as
saying that the new well was located in the deep waters 70 miles
offshore Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The discovery is the second major deep water oil well
discovered by the company within two months with the first
discovered on Block 216.
</P>
<P>
The Texaco management said that the new oil well is located 50
miles east of the first Block 216 and was spurred on December 11,
last year in 4, 206 feet of water and the well operations were
completed in february this year.
</P>
<P>
"The new discovery is indicative of the high impact results the
company had set to achieve on its long-term production and reserve
growth," Gregoria said.
</P>
<P>
At present, Texaco produces 65,000 barrels of oil per day from
offshore operations in the Pennington and Adjacent fields in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has an estimated oil reserves of over 16 billion
barrels and hopes to raise its oil reserves to 25 billion barrels
by 2000, and foreign oil companies operating in Nigeria are
actively engaged in exploration of oil in deep water areas off
Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Entrepreneurs Urges Disapproval of ILO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican Association for
Enterprise Development (AED) has appealed to parliament not to
approve the series of conventions by the International Labor
Organization (ILO), saying the country's economy does not meet the
conditions required for the approval.
</P>
<P>
AED chairman Egas Mussanhane said Wednesday that his
organization has sent a letter to parliament stating the above
appeal, the Noticias newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique is an under-development poor country which has just
emerged from the civil war. The conditions stipulated in the ILO
conventions far exceed the current capability of most enterprises
in the country, said Mussanhane, adding that except for the
industry of beverage, cigarette and construction materials, the
rest of Mozambique's industries are basically in a state of
paralysis or rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Most countries in the world including the developing, the
industrial and the least developed countries have participated in
the ILO. Due to this diversity, said the chairman, the consensus
reached in the ILO generally reflects the medium level, which can
neither satisfy the developed nor the poor countries.

<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Cao Yasha, a business woman from
the city of Weifang in Shandong Province in east China, was
executed today in Weifang for forging 25 million yuan (about 3
million U.S. dollars) worth of financial notes, according to the
Supreme People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Cao and Liu Jingxiang, a vagrant from Qingdao in Shandong
Province, were identified as having gained 10 million yuan through
forging financial notes in May 1996, and by the same means, Cao
then obtained 15 million yuan in July of that year..
</P>
<P>
The Intermediate People's Court of Weifang City sentenced Cao
to death and Liu to life imprisonment and deprived them of
political rights for life on the charge of fraud.
</P>
<P>
Cao and Liu appealed to the Provincial Higher People's Court,
which sustained the original ruling and submitted it to the
Supreme People's Court for re-examination.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Court held that Cao had brought huge
losses to the country through her fraudulent activities, and must
be punished severely according to law.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jiachen, vice president of the Supreme People's Court, said
Cao is the first person to be sentenced to death for financial
note fraud, and he believes the intensified crackdown on criminal
activity of this kind will be important for maintaining financial
order in the country.

Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The surprising offer of take-over two other major French
banks by the Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) has caused an
upheaval in the banking world. With a merger of BNP with Societe
Generale and Paribas, which is described by BNP president Michel
Pebereau as a ``real industrial project,'' the monopoly of the
French banking industry will begin.
</P>
<P>
-- The French humanitarian group Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF)
said in a report released this week that thousands of Sudanese
people died of hunger in the province of Bahr el-Ghazal in
southern Sudan in 1998. The MSF also criticized the United Nations,
which has been in charge of organizing humanitarian relief
operation ``Lifeline Sudan,'' for failing to take action to stop
the diversion of aid materials from their receivers by both the
Sudanese government and rebels.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The take-over offer by BNP of Paribas and Societe Generale
has triggered a great battle of French banks, as the presidents of
the two coveted banks are preparing for a counter-offensive. The
BNP president Michel Pebereau wants to create the world's biggest
bank in terms of assets through the merger. The French Ministry of
Economy and Finance is following the situation closely.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Ease Visa Process For Foreign Observers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Justice Minister
Muladi Thursday said that the government will ease the visa
achievement process for foreign observers who will attend the
general election on June 7.
</P>
<P>
This government policy was based on the consideration that the
existence of foreign observers is important because this is the
first multi-party election in the country since 1955, Muladi said
after meeting with U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia J. Stapleton Roy
here.
</P>
<P>
"This multi-party condition has a possibility to create a party
which is ready to win the election but not ready as a loser. So
the presence of foreign observers is hoped to avoid the unwanted
reaction from those kinds of parties," he said.
</P>
<P>
Muladi also said there were no special or particular visas for
the observers. On the other hand, they have to respect certain
conditions during their stay as the general election observers.
</P>
<P>
"One of the conditions is the prohibition to give individual
assistance for the presidential candidates or certain political
parties," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the observers have to cooperate with
legal and formal institutions which have been established, like
the General Election Committee.
</P>
<P>
"If they are not respectful of these conditions, the government
will deport them," he was quoted by Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the U.S. commitment to the Indonesian elections,
Muladi said Roy has stressed to him that the U.S. will help
Indonesia from the preparation to the organization of the
election.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Cure May Have Been Found: S. A. Researchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A cure may have been found
for AIDS, researchers at the Medical University of Southern Africa
(Medunsa) in Pretoria said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the results of the first clinical phase of a new
drug developed by an Irish company, the researchers said the ratio
of viable HIV viruses had dropped dramatically in patients tested.
</P>
<P>
Their balance of white blood cells, attacked by the virus, was
also restored.
</P>
<P>
Human immunodeficiency virus or HIV leads to full-blown AIDS or
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
</P>
<P>
"After treatment only one trial patient still showed signs of
living virus in his blood," co-director of the study, Professor
Wimpie du Plooy, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The drug known as Inactivin showed no negative side effects.
</P>
<P>
Although the long-term effects were not known, du Plooy said:
"We may have found a cure for AIDS."
</P>
<P>
Medunsa tested the drug at the request of Irish company
Colthurst Ltd., with the full approval of the Medicines Control
Council.
</P>
<P>
Du Plooy said while the drug did not remove all viral cells, it
would be possible to control the AIDS disease to such an extent
that patients would no longer be terminal.
</P>
<P>
The drug stops the HIV virus from replicating.
</P>
<P>
Du Plooy said Inactivin, a single drug treatment, would be
comparatively inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether it could be on the market by the end of the year,
he said: "There is a chance."
</P>
<P>
Medunsa researchers administered small doses of Inactivin to a
small group of HIV-positive individuals in August last year. A
second group received larger doses in November.
</P>
<P>
"In both sets of tests, consisting of five consecutive days of
drug administration, CD4 (white blood cells) counts increased...
and the number of HIV virus present in circulating while blood
cells decreased to almost zero."
</P>
<P>
The one trial patient still showing signs of living HIV virus
in his blood had a ratio of only one viable HIV virus per
1,000,000 white blood cells, du Plooy said.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Captures 50 Rebel Soldiers in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The west African peace-keeping
force ECOMOG has captured over 50 rebel soldiers in a
cordon-and-search operation in capital Freetown, The Guardian
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted security officials in Sierra Leone as saying
Wednesday that the rebels were rounded up after security
authorities received a number of tip-offs from a woman who had
been abducted by rebels and escaped later.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two rebels were picked up at Freetown's national stadium
in the west end of the capital while more than 20 were arrested at
the Bailor Barre displacement camp in eastern Freetown and in the
city's central neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Security officials said a large quantity of AK-47 rifles,
rocket- propelled grenades, combat uniforms and flak jackets were
founded in a house in the city center.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Wednesday by ECOMOG headquarters, ECOMOG
force commander Maj. Gen. Timothy Shelpidi lauded ECOMOG soldiers
for not only defending Kosso neighborhood resolutely, but also for
professionally containing rebel activities in Freetown as a whole.
</P>
<P>
More than 35,000 displaced people who lost their homes after
rebels invaded the capital in January are living in the national
stadium in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Some 50,000 displaced people in Sierra Leone's northern Kambia
district who fled rebel attacks are facing desperate conditions,
witnesses from the area said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After fleeing violence in Makeni, Magburaka, Binkolo, Kono and
Kamakwie, the civilians set up makeshift camps near the Guinean
border where they are now suffering from rampant mal-nutrition,
dysentery and malaria with five to 10 people dying every day, a
local radio journalist reported.

<HEADLINE> Overpriced Internet-Service Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Many Chinese Internet users are
complaining that service providers are overcharging them while
operating at a snail's pace and failing to provide a full array of
information services.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by the China Computer
Association, nearly one-third of the people polled, or 31.5
percent, consider high charges the major impediment to their
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
Almost a quarter, or 24.6 percent, expressed their
dissatisfaction with the low speed which some called "slow as a
snail."
</P>
<P>
More than one-fifth, or 21.6 percent, complained that there was
a lack of useful information on the 'net.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the first two problems is considered to be the
monopoly held by China's domestic telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China inputs only 0.01 percent and accesses only 0.
05 percent of all information offered on the Internet as a whole.
And much of this information is of no benefit to 'net users.
</P>
<P>
Computer experts point out that the development and use of
information resources are still very weak in China. Thus, the
enthusiasm of Internet users is restrained and Internet servers
are experiencing serious management difficulties, and as a result
on-line information services are declining.

<HEADLINE> China, Israel Trade Sees Rapid Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Trade volume between China and
Israel has witnessed fast growth over the last couple of years,
with bilateral trade volume rising 46.9 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The general volume of bilateral trade hit 523.82 million US
dollars, with China's exports to Israel at 352.79 million US
dollars and imports from Israel at 171.03 million US dollars,
according to figures released by the General Administration of
Customs.
</P>
<P>
China's main export goods to Israel were machinery and
electronic products, footwear, textile goods, garments, foodstuffs
and pharmaceuticals. China's main imports from Israel include
machinery, electronic products, diamonds, medical instruments and
fertilizer, according to a recent report in the International
Trade News.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there were 61 Israel-invested projects in China by
last September. The total investment in contractual volume reached
91.92 million US dollars, and arrived investment hit 38.63 million
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
A major power plant with a total investment of 600 million US
dollars in Rizhao City, in east China's Shandong Province, and a
potash fertilizer plant with a total investment of 4.64 billion
yuan (about 560.48 million US dollars) in northwest China's
Qinghai Province are the two major Israeli-invested projects in
China.
</P>
<P>
China and Israel established diplomatic relations in 1992.
Trade officials of both sides have since exchanged visits
frequently. The two sides have had wide-ranging cooperation in
such fields as agriculture, electronics, telecommunications and
medicine.
</P>
<P>
The International Trade News quoted Zvi Mitlanski, first
secretary of the Israeli Embassy in China, as saying that China is
the only Asian nation that has seen continuous trade growth with
Israel over the past two years. He added that many Israeli
companies are now considering investment in China.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Urges All Parties to Compete Fairly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
Thursday said that all the political parties in the country should
compete fairly in gaining people's support in the coming election
in line with the existing laws.
</P>
<P>
"I call on all the groups to restrain themselves, abide by the
agreed rules of the game, and be ready to receive whatever the
results will be, including if the votes and the election are not
as expected. We should keep away from an apriori stance, even
revenge," he said.
</P>
<P>
After witnessing the oath-taking ceremony of the members of the
General Election Committee (KPU) here, Habibie said the number of
parties should not be seen as an obstacle or a threat to
democratic life, and it even reflects the realization of a true
democracy.
</P>
<P>
"We should leave the past paradigm and view that numerous
parties is an obstacle or threat. Rather, it is the realization of
real democracy which we have agreed to," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the establishment of some new parties should be seen as
the emergence of a better, more open, and democratic hope for
life.
</P>
<P>
Under former president Soeharto's 32-year reign, only three
parties were allowed -- Golkar (Functional Group), the United
Development Party and the Indonesian Democratic Party. Golkar
booked landslide wins in all elections.
</P>
<P>
After Soeharto's downfall on May 21 last year, Habibie launched
a series of sweeping political reforms. These include the
revocation of bans on the formation of political parties.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the verification of 148 political parties which
then resulted in 48 general election participants, Habibie said
the verification was carried out honestly, openly, and without
pressure from any group, including from the government.
</P>
<P>
Parties which cannot participate in the next general election
can channel their aspiration through other parties, he said.
</P>
<P>
The June 7 general election will choose a new House of
Representatives, whose members will be part of the 700-strong
People's Consultative Assembly, the nation's highest legislative
body, which will select the next president.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Identify Obesity Gene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Two teams of U.S. researchers
have discovered a gene mutation in mice that can suppress obesity
caused by overeating -- a finding that could lead the way toward a
drug that keeps people trim, according to reports released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The first team of researchers at Millennium Pharmaceuticals in
Cambridge, Mass., tested groups of mice with normal and mutated
gene, known as Mahogany, or the MG gene. They fed the mice diets
with varying percentages of fat.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Karen J. Moore, leader of the team, said mice with a
mutated MG gene did not gain weight regardless of whether they ate
a high-fat diet or a low-fat one, while mice with normal gene
gained weight on the high-fat diet.
</P>
<P>
In reporting their results of study in Thursday's issue of the
journal Nature, the scientists said they were optimistic that the
gene would play the same role in humans, but cautioned that it has
been demonstrated only in mice so far.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Moore said the findings could show researchers how to
develop a drug to control obesity by mimicking the activity of the
mutated gene.
</P>
<P>
The second team of researchers at Stanford University also
reported in Nature that their "similar discoveries" have led to "
unanticipated advances in drug development.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gregory Barch, leader of the Stanford team, said the gene
has been identified and cloned, and the next step is to discover
how it works.

<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China has to hold population
growth to zero by the year 2030 before it can have sustainable
growth, economists say.
</P>
<P>
In the recently released "Report on Strategies for China's
Sustainable Development," economists of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences said that China also needs to decrease energy consumption
and stop environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
The 2-year study is the first systematic assessment of
sustainability in China's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Niu Wenyuan, the project head, warns that net population growth
in Beijing should not exceed 213,700 from now on, and growth in
Sichuan Province and Chongqing Municipality should not exceed 30.
9619 million if the first strategic stage of the sustainable
growth in the year 2030 is to be reached.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-five percent of China is mountainous and hilly, 55
percent is not suitable for production, and 33 percent is dry or
desert area and the destruction of the environment by human
activities is as much as three to 3.5 times the world average.
</P>
<P>
Over the last 15 centuries, starting in the Sui Dynasty, yearly
natural disasters have increased 6.5-fold, the report says.

<HEADLINE> Scientists: Liver Cancer Increases in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A study released Thursday
said liver cancer is on the rise in the United States because of
spreading of hepatitis B and hepatitis C in the country.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma increased 71 percent
from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, according to researchers at
the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in New Mexico who reported
their study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that hospitalization and death rates for
all types of liver cancer were also increasing at a similar pace.
</P>
<P>
The cancer is often caused by chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis
C, hidden diseases that lead to liver scarring, known as cirrhosis,
which in turn can lead to liver cancer, said the scientists who
believe most of the increase in liver cancer is due to hepatitis C,
a disease discovered a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 4 million Americans are infected with the
hepatitis C virus, but no one knows the exact number because it
can take up to 30 years for symptoms to develop, they said, adding
that there is no vaccine and the only available treatment does not
help the majority of patients.
</P>
<P>
The American Cancer Society predicts liver cancer will strike

<HEADLINE> Legislation Urged to Protect China's Seas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese oceanologists have urged
national and local legislators to work together on a complete
legal system, under which oceanic resources could be tapped more
reasonably.
</P>
<P>
The experts from the China Society of Oceanography have
suggested drawing up a national ocean law as the core of a
comprehensive legal system, instead of the single laws on the
protection of the marine environment and resources.
</P>
<P>
They said the current laws were far from complete or strong
enough to combat ocean pollution, frequent red tides and the
wasting of marine resources.
</P>
<P>
Urgent calls for intensified legislative measures were a result
of the rapid growth of China's oceanic industry, which operates
the biggest seawater aquacultural sector and the third largest
ship-making industry in the world, while drilling 16.87 million
tons of crude oil from the sea each year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Spokesman on Tibet Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The contact channel between the
central government and the Dalai Lama has always been smooth,
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark at a press conference when commenting on
the Dalai Lama's recent remark that such a contact channel has
been suspended.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama's remark does not conform to the fact, Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating China's consistent policy on the Dalai Lama, the
spokesman said that the Dalai Lama must truly abandon his
proposition on the independence of Tibet, stop all activities to
split China, and recognize in public that Tibet is an inalienable
part of China, that Taiwan is a province of China, and that the
government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal
government representing the whole of China.
</P>
<P>
The relevant departments of the central government have met
with the Dalai Lama's representatives many times, and made all
kinds of efforts since 1979, Zhu went on, however, there has been
no response from the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental reason is that the Dalai Lama stubbornly clings
to the position of Tibet independence and constantly puts up
obstacles to contacts and consultations between the two sides, Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Dalai Lama announced the refusal to have
contacts with the central government in the second half of 1989,
and asked the resumption of such contacts in 1992. The relevant
departments of the central government met with the Dalai Lama's
representatives in 1992 and 1993 respectively, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of 1993, the Dalai Lama once again stopped
contacts with the central government and later spread the remark
in the international community that the central government refused
to negotiate with him. Meanwhile, the Dalai clique has plotted
many times the peaceful march into Tibet and attempted to conduct
a referendum, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"The Dalai Lama has never stopped his activities to split the
motherland, " Zhu concluded.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Repossess Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government is to
terminate the contracts with a Malaysian company and to repossess
Uganda Commercial Bank (UCB) soon, a senior official has said.
</P>
<P>
Solicitor General Peter Kabatsi was quoted by Thursday's New
Vision daily as saying Wednesday that the government would
terminate the contracts immediately by which Westmont Land bought
49 percent shares in the bank after a 45-day period recommended.
</P>
<P>
The solicitor general said the government had already taken
steps in this direction.
</P>
<P>
On February 8, Inspector General of Government (IGG) Jotham
Tumwesigye released a report on the suspected purchase of UCB by
Westmont.
</P>
<P>
The IGG recommended that the Westmont management contract with
UCB be cancelled, advising that Bank of Uganda, the central bank,
to provide a plan within 45 days showing how the 40 billion
shillings (40 million U.S. dollars) wrongfully taken out the UCB
under Westmont management would be recovered.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund African Department Assistant
Director Naheed Kirmani announced Tuesday that the government was
to sue Westmont because of the fraud surrounding the sale of the
bank.
</P>
<P>
Kabatsi also said the government would sue the Malaysian
company for damages at a later stage.
</P>
<P>
Westmont bought the mentioned shares in UCB in October of 1997.
 Early this year, Salim Saleh, brother of President Yoweri
Museveni and a major general, admitted under press pressure that
he bought the UCB through Westmont illegally, exposing to light
the biggest scandal in privatization process of the country.
</P>
<P>
Investigations showed that Westmont is not a financial
institution, contrary to the basic requirement for purchasing the
bank.

<P>
YINCHUAN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The GDP growth rate of the
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northwest China reached 8.5
percent in 1998, 1.5 percent higher than the national level, due
to the accelerated infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the region invested record 10.8 billion yuan on
capital construction with the support of the central government to
celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the autonomous
region.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia has a population of 5.3 million, with the Hui ethnic
group accounting for one-third of the total. Over the past few
years, the state increased investment in the region to promote
local economic development.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, construction on 871 new projects started, 122 more
than in 1997. Capital construction involved a total investment of
5.8 billion yuan, up 24 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Investment in agriculture, forestry, fisheries, animal
husbandry and water conservancy totaled 840 million yuan, an
increase of 160 percent over that of 1997, while investment in the
transport, posts and telecommunications sectors amounted to 2.6
billion yuan, up 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
The completion of a batch of key projects has laid a solid
foundation for the healthy development of the local economy.
</P>
<P>
For example, the electrification of the railway, which runs
through Ningxia and links Baotou City in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region and Lanzhou, capita of northwest Gansu Province,
has enhanced the autonomous region's transportation capacity to 18.
75 million tons in 1998, an increase of three percent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
The turnover of posts and telecommunications reached 670
million yuan, up 45.8 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
The region's grain output reached record 2.9 billion kg last
year thanks to the increasing investment in agricultural sector
and advanced farming techniques and mechanization.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's New Subway Line to Complete in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A new subway section passing
through the busiest area of Beijing will be completed by the
country's National Day, which falls on October 1st according to
transport authorities in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The section, which will lighten traffic on the city's east-west
axis, starts from Fuxingmen and ends at Bawangfen, providing a
service for the whole of Chang'an Avenue.
</P>
<P>
It is 13.5 kilometers long with 11 stops including two
bordering on Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the new subway line began on July 15, 1989
and a one-stop section from Fuxingmen, where Chang'an Avenue
starts to Xidan, a major shopping area, started operation in 1992.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the Beijing General Subway Co.,
the laying of track will be completed by the end of March this
year and the stations are currently undergoing interior decoration.
</P>
<P>
He said the construction and installation are expected to be
ready for final tuning in late July or early August.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's motorized and pedestrian traffic is now very heavy,
especially during rush hours. However, many people have shifted to
using the subway due to it's promptness and predictability. The
existing subway handles 1.86 million passengers daily.
</P>
<P>
The two operational subway lines intersect at Fuxingmen. The
existing loop line is in the form of a square running under the
second ring road, except for the section lying between the
southern section of the Second Ring Road and Chang'an Avenue. The
first line runs from Fuxingmen straight west.

<HEADLINE> Romania's GDP Down by 7.3 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Gross domestic product (GDP) of
Romania went down by 7.3 percent to 338.67 trillion lei (about 38.
2 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998, compared with the 6.6-percent
drop of the previous year, according to the latest statistics
released by the government on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The drop in this major economic index, which greatly surpassed
the anticipated target of 5.5 percent set by the government
earlier, was attributed by some experts to the continuous slide in
the industrial and construction sectors. The two accounted for 40
percent of the GDP in Romania.
</P>
<P>
The industrial output decreased by 17.3 percent compared with
that of the previous year, while agriculture went down by 7.6
percent, said the national statistics committee.
</P>
<P>
The deficit of foreign trade reached 3.5 billion dollars, 25
percent of increase from 2.8 billion dollars of 1997. Among them,
export dropped by 1.6 percent to 8.3 billion dollars while the
import increased by 4.8 percent to 11.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the country's inflation rate was 59.1 percent, with
the country's currency, the lei, devaluated by 27 percent.

GUANGZHOU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- An international furniture

<HEADLINE> Scientist Suggests Building Ozone Observation Station in Lhasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese meteorologist has
suggested building an ozone observation station in Lhasa, capital
of the Tibet Autonomous Region, to study the thin ozone layer
above the Qinghai-Tibet plateau.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Xiuji, an academician with the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
has presided over a research group to study the changes in the
total volume of ozone above China. They found an area in the
atmosphere above the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau where the ozone layer
is abnormally thin.
</P>
<P>
The study showed that from 1979 to 1991, the total ozone volume
in an area around Lhasa was 11 percent lower than areas at the
same latitude, and the ozone volume is on a continuous decline,
dropping with 0.35 percent each year, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion has been proved by a research project jointly
conducted by China and Japan from May to October of 1998 on the
total volume of ozone in atmosphere, the vertical distribution of
ozone in atmosphere and the radiation of ultra-violet sun-rays.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that scientists have proved that there is
area with abnormally thinner ozone layer in the atmosphere in the
middle and low altitude areas, where the population is densely
located, said Zhou.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the decrease in the ozone layer will lead to
an increase in ultra-violet radiation, and cause skin and eye
diseases, while also having a damaging effect on the output of
crops.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that by observing the effect of ozone
reduction on the global biological environment, they can learn
more from studies of the low ozone content area in the Qinghai-
Tibet Plateau than the "ozone hole" in South Pole.
</P>
<P>
They said that strong convection in summer, which drives
pollutants in low altitude from the areas around the plateau to
the troposphere above the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, might cause
photochemical reactions which destroy the ozone layer above the
plateau.

KAMPALA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Makerere University, the number
one university in Uganda and even in East Africa region, has
discontinued the Minister of State for Education and Sports
Francis Babu from the Business School for academic
disqualification.
</P>
<P>
A staff member in the Academic Registrar's office told Xinhua
Thursday morning that this was done because the minister does not
have a first degree or its equivalent which is the minimum
requirement under the university's rule to enrol for a Master of
Business Administration (MBA) degree.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the minister, Academic Registrar Hyuha
Mukwanason said Babu enrolled for a MBA in October of 1998 and was
presently in the second semester.
</P>
<P>
Babu had claimed that his flight captainship certificates from
Europe were an equivalent to a first degree, and the Business
School bought the claim, Thursday's Monitor paper quoted a source
in the university as saying.
</P>
<P>
The checking by the Business School was insufficient and that
is how Bubu got enrolled. His friends in the Business School let
this pass until a complaint was lodged with the office of the
Academic Registrar, the source said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Have Huge Consumer Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese farmers, who are
estimated to have something in the region of 800 billion yuan (100
billion US dollars) in cash, are expected to use a lot of their
surplus cash to help boost the domestic sales of household
electrical appliances.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Chinese farmers also have a
further 900 billion yuan in bank deposits, which gives them
enormous consumer power.
</P>
<P>
Many economic pundits believe, that as a result of this huge
cash-cow, the manufacturers of household appliances have a huge
potential market to tap into, because in 1997 there was only an
average of 27 color televisions for every 100 rural households.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that the average number of washing
machines and refrigerators in every 100 rural families in 1997 was
just 22 and eight.
</P>
<P>
Wei Xiangyun, an official with the State Administration of
Internal Trade, said that to meet the demand Chinese manufacturers
will have to make 168 million TVs, 180 million refrigerators and
160 million washing machines, if their ownership of household
appliances is to reach the percentage level of urbanites for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Wei also says it will be favorable for Chinese farmers to
purchase household appliances as electricity charges are to be
lowered. And to grab a share of this huge potential market
manufacturers of household appliances will have to develop
suitable products and improve their after-sales service throughout
the countryside.

<HEADLINE> China to Close Small Thermal Power Plants Ahead of Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China plans to shut down all
thermal power plants with a generating capacity below 50,000
kilowatts by the year of 2004, a year ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the China National Power Corporation,
all such small power plants, with a combined generation capacity
of 14 million kilowatts, will cease operations by the end of 2004
in order to adjust the structure of energy sources and to
alleviate pollution.
</P>
<P>
By the year of 2000, China will complete the shutdown of 7.74
million kilowatts of small power plants, with the rest to be
closed step by step from 2001 to 2004.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman on China's Entry into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua)-- Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu
Bangzao said here today that US trade representative Charlene
Barshefsky's recent consultation with the Chinese side has created
conditions for the final settlement of China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question concerning the issue at today's
routine press conference, Zhu said China and the United States are
now stepping up negotiations in a bid to reach agreement on China'
s access to the organization before the start of another round of
multilateral trade talks.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, China's efforts in this regard need
reciprocal coordination. So long as both sides adopt a practical
and flexible manner, negotiations on this issue can be completed
as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that China has made great efforts in
opening its market since it started bidding for the entry more
than ten years ago. The main reason, or the real reason is that
certain countries, in disregard of the fact that China is still a
developing country, filed excessive demands.
</P>
<P>
China will continue its efforts in this regard, but the parties
concerned should also demonstrate enough flexibility on specific
issues, he added.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank Governor Pledges Against Deflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China's financial authorities are
closely monitoring the development of the national economy and
will take measures to guard against emergence of a deflation,
according to a top Chinese banker.
</P>
<P>
But China's current economic situation can not be
oversimplified as deflation, said Dai Xianglong, governor of the
People's Bank of China, at a press conference sponsored by the on-
going session of the National People's Conference this morning.
</P>
<P>
A deflation usually has two benchmark indications of continued
drops in consumer price and money supply which is compounded by
contracted economic growth for two consecutive quarters, said Dai,
stressing that "These do not tally with China's present realities.
"
</P>
<P>
The banker explained that China's retail price index began
dipping two year ago, but the drop was not directly linked to the
money supply but resulted largely from the drop in farm produce.
</P>
<P>
The money supply was increased by 15.3 percent last year as
against the previous year and the economy grew by 8.8 present in
1997 and 7.8 percent in 1998, Dai said, adding: "Therefore, the
economy is not in a recession."
</P>
<P>
However, China will take various measures including increasing
investment and money supply to expand domestic demand and stem the
negative growth of consumer price, Dai said, adding that the
supply of broad money (M2) for this year will be increased by 15
percent and total credit loans will be around 1,000 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the central bank is working on the plan to
form a asset management company (AMC) to improve the balance sheet
of state commercial banks and recruit financial experts to tackle
the non-performing loans of banks.
</P>
<P>
The AMC will be first initiated in the China Construction Bank
on a trial basis and will be introduced to nationwide later, Dai
said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Reform, Development and Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin called for
properly handling the relationship between reform, development
and stability and better implementing the open policy.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the call today at separate group discussions
attended by Tianjin and Fujian deputies to the Ninth National
People's Congress, in session here since last Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Reform has entered a period when breakthroughs need to be made
and stability faces new challenges," he told Tianjin deputies. "At
a time like this, particular attention should be paid to properly
handling the relationship between reform, development and
stability."
</P>
<P>
The central authorities have decided on three priority tasks
for this year, he said. "First, to stabilize and strength
agriculture; second, to deepen reform of state-owned enterprises;
and third, to do a job in the financial field," he said.
</P>
<P>
The three central tasks have a direct bearing on reform,
development and social stability, said Jiang, who is also general
secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The key to doing a fine job in the three fields, he said, is to
unite with and rely on people.
</P>
<P>
"In the whole process of reform and development, we should
protect people's enthusiasm, bring their initiatives into full
play, and safeguard their interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
Joining Fujian deputies, Jiang said that policies adopted by
the central authorities last year to stimulate economic growth --
expanding domestic demand, implementing a proactive financial
policy, increasing capital spending -- "are entirely correct."
</P>
<P>
"These policies will continue this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Investment by enterprises, collective businesses and
individuals should be encouraged, he said, implying that the
government should not be the only source of investment in fix-
assets.
</P>
<P>
He called for increasing incomes for farmers, doing a good job
of small-town development, manufacturing marketable goods and
agricultural capital goods and developing the rural market.
</P>
<P>
While expanding domestic demand, continued attention should be
paid to expanding foreign trade and attracting overseas funds, he
said. "We must unswervingly adhere to the policy of opening to the
outside world," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for increasing exports this year.
</P>
<P>
"Relevant departments should take effective measures to support
and encourage qualified enterprises to do processing in countries
and regions with market potential to spur the export of Chinese
equipment, technology, goods and labor," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, China should import more advanced technology
and key equipment and improve its ability to digest imported
technology, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's Ministry of Labor
and Social Affairs has urged the executive bodies, organizations
and the society as a whole to act concertedly in the fight against
child prostitution, the Ethiopian Herald reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tedla Direse, head of Children, Youths and Family Affairs
Department of the ministry, told local press that girl children of

cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
Tedla admitted that there are a total of over 10,000 child
prostitutes in Addis Ababa, the capital alone, adding that these
children are being allured by promises of easy wealth in the
hotels and bars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said Mengiste Ayele, head of the team of
children affairs in the department told the press that the
executive bodies of the government should impose heavier penalties
on those causing physical and psychological harm to girl children
through sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
He said most girl children are dragged from schools and their
home localities by financial allurements or fine dresses and
sexually abused at night clubs and bars.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- North China's city of Tianjin has
recently opened the country's first overseas economic zone in
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The 21.85-sq.km zone, named China-Egypt Suez Special Economic
Zone, is located in the northwestern part of the Gulf of Suez, 140
km. from Cairo. The zone is said to have good development
prospects because of convenient transportation and a new deep
water port on the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and Egyptian governments signed a contract on the
deal in April 1997, when the Egyptian Premier visited China. The
Chinese government delegated authority to the Tianjin Economic
Development Zone for construction of the zone in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Chinese Investment Co. was set up in May of 1998,
under an agreement by the Tianjin Development General Company and
Egypt's Misr Bank, National Investment Bank, Arab contractors, and
the Suez Canal Authorities. It is responsible for infrastructure
construction in a two-sq.km. area, its general design and
management of the zone.
</P>
<P>
Total investment in the zone is estimated at 70 million U.S.
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Singer Denies Blasphemy Allegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese famous singer Najwa
Karam has denied an allegation that she had blasphemed Islam by
naming her dog after a prophet, the Daily Star reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference attended by a host of Lebanese
artists Wednesday, Karam said "anyone who has positive proof of
this ridiculous and vicious story about me to come up and say it
out loud."
</P>
<P>
Attacks on Karam came from Qatari and Jordanian politicians,
who claimed she had said during an interview with a leading Arab
satellite station several months ago that her dog was named after
a prophet.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Jordanian weekly Shihan, Jordanian
lawmaker Riyad Daoud called for the singer's death and said she
should be banned from entering Jordan.
</P>
<P>
A media campaign against the singer came after Daoud's appeal,
with reports comparing Karam to British author Salman Rushdie
whose "The Satanic Verses" prompted a fatwa against him in 1989 by
the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini for blaspheming Islam,
which sentenced Rushdie to death.
</P>
<P>
However, Lebanese artists attending the news conference said
the public barrage was an attempt to personally discredit Karam.
</P>
<P>
Privately, this is part of a scheme to undermine the
overwhelming success of Lebanese artists in the Arab world
overshadowing their peers from other countries, they added.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese composer Mansour Rahbani said those behind the rumor
were definitely jealous of Karam's success, adding the hate
campaign was aimed not only at harming the singer herself but
Lebanese art in general.
</P>
<P>
Karam said she had filed a lawsuit against the unknown
disseminators of the rumor, whom she described as "heretics."

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Opens Private Sector to Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai will open its private
sector to overseas investment on a full-scale basis in an effort
to attract more overseas capital, an official source said today.
</P>
<P>
The city of Shanghai, China's largest economic and commercial
center, will soon unveil a new policy whereby overseas investors
are allowed to set up joint ventures with all "standardized"
private firms, a senior official of the Shanghai Municipal
Overseas Investment Commission said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The new policy specifically calls for the equal treatment of
private firms and state-owned enterprises in establishing joint or
cooperative ventures with overseas partners, the official said.
</P>
<P>
All private firms that meet the requirements set forth in the
Corporate Law, have corporate status, retain their investment in
firms other than their own up to 50 percent of their assets, and
have their registered capital in place, will be permitted to set
up joint or cooperative ventures with overseas investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
By these standards, the overwhelming majority of Shanghai's
private firms are qualified, according to industry experts here.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai currently has 99,000 private firms employing 900,000
people, and reported 14 billion yuan in output value last year.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that this latest move on the part of Shanghai,
which has long been a testing ground for China's market economy
reforms, will be followed by other areas of China. This is
expected to give a boost to the country's efforts to attract
overseas capital.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that China has more than one million
private firms nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wang Yaotian, director of the Shanghai Research
Center of the World Trade Organization, said that private firms
are attractive to overseas investors because they are more market-
adaptable and flexible in their operations and have greater
initiative.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation between private firms and overseas companies
in capital, technology, management, and sales networking
facilities is certain to create inspiring vitality," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
According to Shanghai's existing regulations, which were
enacted seven years ago, private firms must have 500,000 yuan in
registered capital, at least one million yuan in annual business
volume, and 100,000 yuan in annual profits for three consecutive
years in order to qualify as partners in establishing joint or
cooperative ventures with overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Under these stiff restrictions, only 400 private firms had been
able to establish partnerships with overseas companies in Shanghai
by the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
Encouraging private firms to become partners with overseas
companies is in line with the trend of China's economic
development and is in the interest of the country's efforts to
attract more overseas capital, said an official of the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation participating at the '99
East China Fair, which began on March 5.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that China's tens of thousands of rapidly growing
private high-tech companies will be most attractive to overseas
investors.
</P>
<P>
"These firms have the right kind of technology and market, but
many of them have been unable to industrialize their research
results and enter the international market because of fund
shortages," the official said.
</P>
<P>
China is the second largest destination for overseas investment
in the world. However, the momentum of the inflow of overseas
funds has slowed down in recent years, with overseas direct
investment in China hitting 45.6 billion U.S. dollars last year,
up 0.7 percent from 1997.

<HEADLINE> Overpriced Internet-Service Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Many Chinese Internet users are
complaining that service providers are overcharging them while
operating at a snail's pace and failing to provide a full array of
information services.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by the China Computer
Association, nearly one-third of the people polled, or 31.5
percent, consider high charges the major impediment to their
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
Almost a quarter, or 24.6 percent, expressed their
dissatisfaction with the low speed which some called "slow as a
snail."
</P>
<P>
More than one-fifth, or 21.6 percent, complained that there was
a lack of useful information on the 'net.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the first two problems is considered to be the
monopoly held by China's domestic telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China inputs only 0.01 percent and accesses only 0.
05 percent of all information offered on the Internet as a whole.
And much of this information is of no benefit to 'net users.
</P>
<P>
Computer experts point out that the development and use of
information resources are still very weak in China. Thus, the
enthusiasm of Internet users is restrained and Internet servers
are experiencing serious management difficulties, and as a result
on-line information services are declining.

<HEADLINE> Developing "Red Industry" In Northwestern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The "red industry" is doing well
in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and is
helping the local economy.
</P>
<P>
"Red industry" refers to tomatoes, safflower, medlar fruit,
chilis, pomegranates, and jujubes. The tomatoes, medlar fruit, and
safflower of Xinjiang are in plentiful supply and are already
pillars of this red industry.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is China's biggest safflower producer, with 26,700 ha.
of land dedicated to the crop, accounting for half of China's
total and 80 percent of China's output. The region says it plans
to increase that area to 67,000 ha. in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Its tomato ketchup output accounted for 80 percent of China's
total and it has 34 tomato processing companies with a combined
annual production capacity of 160,000 tons, or 90 percent of China'
s total.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang has 8,000 ha. of land growing medlar, with an annual
output of 10,000 tons, or half the country's total and it has
become China's largest medlar producer and exports the fruit to
Taiwan, Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The American Standard &AMP; Poor's Co.
has set the credit rating of the China Export and Import Bank (
Eximbank) at BBB plus, the Eximbank said today.
</P>
<P>
The rating of Eximbank accords with its performance and
function as one of China's policy-oriented banks, according to
Standard &AMP; Poor's.
</P>
<P>
Since Eximbank mainly focuses its business on giving credit to
the country's exporters, it will be less affected by the reform in
industrial and financial sectors than other financial institutions,
Standard &AMP; Poor's added.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the support Eximbank gets from the Chinese
government will not weaken now that China is striving to promote
its international trade and exports.
</P>
<P>
Serving as one of the nation's policy-oriented financial
institutions, Eximbank offers key support for exports of machinery
and electronics products as well as complete sets of equipment.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Calls for Constitutional Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel has called for a constitutional change for the
prosecution of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Demirel made the appeal in response to a question over the
European view of Turkey's State Security Courts and the trial of
Ocalan, the leader the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that Turkey should make an exception regarding the
prosecution of Ocalan, Turkish Daily News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was captured by Turkish special agents in Kenya and
brought to Turkey in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to stand trial for leading the PKK guerrillas in
waging a 15-year war for an independent Kurdish state in
southeastern Turkey, which has claimed over 37,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Demirel pointed out that "when we take the criticisms from
Europe into account, we have two options, either to reject any
foreign interference, or to make an exception related to this
case."
</P>
<P>
Some western European countries have called for a fair trial of
the Kurdish leader and asked not to put him to death.
</P>
<P>
Under the Turkish constitution, Ocalan faces a possible death
penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that "if Turkey is a part of Europe and if this
case is a very important case for Turkey, we should not overshadow
the virtue of our cause."
</P>
<P>
He admitted that a change in the State Security Courts is
impossible without a constitutional change, saying that the
parliament should work on this matter after the April 18 local and
parliamentary elections.

<HEADLINE> China Bans Imports of Brazilian Cloven-Hoofed Animals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China has stopped importing
cloven-hoofed animals from Brazil, where there has been an
outbreak of hoof-and-mouth disease since last January.
</P>
<P>
China suspended imports of pigs, cows, and goats and related
products from Brazil as of February 23, according to Import and
Export Commodity Inspection Administration, which said that all
cloven-hoofed animals will be confiscated and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Those brought by ship, aircraft, or train from Brazil that will
stay for a period of time in China will be quarantined.
</P>
<P>
Sheep, goats, and cattle with the disease often show symptoms
in the mouth and on hooves, where blisters and ulcers appear and
their horns will split after the disease develops.
</P>
<P>
Hoof-and-mouth disease affects human beings only if they have
an open sore or wound and come in direct contact with the infected
animal. The disease can also contaminate milk and meat products.

<HEADLINE> Jade Costume Unearthed in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- An ancient jade costume was
recently unearthed in the city of Yongcheng in central China's
Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The costume is 1.82 meters long and is made up of 2,580 jade
slices, sewn together with the gold thread. The costume is divided
into seven parts including a face cover, head cover, upper outer
garment, sleeves, gloves, trousers, and shoes.
</P>
<P>
It differs from three other such garments discovered in China
in that the jade slice for the nose is curves and intact, and eyes
and mouth are engraved on the face cover. The jade slices are made
of high-quality Hetian jade from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, which are still crystal clear and glittering despite its
great age.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists concluded after analysis and study that the owner
of the jade costume might be Liu Jia, ruler of the kingdom of
Liang in the late Western Han Dynasty (200 BC-25 AD). This is the
fourth jade costume unearthed in China since the first was found
in Mancheng in northern China's Hebei Province in the 1970s.

<HEADLINE> China's Bad Loans No More than 10 Percent: Dai (Rpt for Correction) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank governor Dai
Xianglong declared here today that bad loans of major state-owned
commercial banks do not exceed ten percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of 1998, bad loans of such banks accounted for 2.9
percent of the total loans. Of course the overdue loans and idle
loans may turn into bad loans. It is difficult to asses that
amount. But even we include the amount of those loans that may
possibly turn into bad loans, bad loans will not exceed 10 percent
of the total loans," Dai estimated here at a press conference
sponsored by the ongoing Second Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Saying that quality of new bank loans has remarkably increased
with the deepening of the banking reform, Dai said the increasing
bad loans in commercial banks are yet to be checked as a result of
the unsatisfactory performance of the state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has written off a total of 100 billion yuan
in bad loans in the past several years.
</P>
<P>
"The state commercial banks still have good liquidity and
sufficient repayment capacity for the present, because they have
an annual influx of about 700 billion to 800 billion yuan in
savings." Dai said.
</P>
<P>
Dai also revealed that China is to further re-capitalize the
state commercial banks to increase their repayment ability.

Thus far, a total of 11 Chinese trading companies have had

<HEADLINE> China's Theme Park Industry Has Bright Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Though problems exist with the
development of theme parks in China, the industry has bright
prospects, an article carried by China Tourism News pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Lured by the high returns of China's first theme park, the
Splendid China in Shenzhen, Chinese developers have flocked to
build theme parks over the past decade, pushing the total number
to over 30 nationwide. And countless parks with amusement
facilities have sprung up.
</P>
<P>
However, many of them have failed commercially due to
inadequate feasibility studies, poor construction and high priced
entrance tickets.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, most of the facilities are outdated and lacking
novelty compared with international standards.
</P>
<P>
"There is still a long way to go for China's theme park
industry to catch up with the world's standards," the article said.
</P>
<P>
"But it does not mean that the industry does not have hopes for
development, taking into account the increasing demand from China'
s 1.2 billion population," it added.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry believes that the ever widening opening-up
of the country and increase in tourists will provide a huge market
for theme parks in China.

<HEADLINE> Four Foreigners Released in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Four foreigners who had been
arrested by a local administration of Pakistan for illegal
entrance into Pakistan's tribal areas have been released, the News
daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The four foreigners -- two Americans, one Briton and one
Dutchman, were allowed to leave after investigations by the police
and other agencies in Dera Ismail Khan district of North West
Frontier Province (NWFP) showed that they were on a world study
tour and had stranded into South Waziristan district of the
province, said the report.
</P>
<P>
They were escorted to Islamabad and from there they were
planning to reach Lahore to start their onward journey to India,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
A local police officer told the newspaper that the two U.S.
nationals and a Dutch, all male, were students while the British
woman accompanying them was their teacher.
</P>
<P>
He said inquiries revealed that they belonged to a teachers'
training center in Denmark and were on a study tour of several
countries along with a group.
</P>
<P>
The four separated from their group traveling in the bus after
entering Pakistan from Iran and unknowingly traveled to South
Waziristan.
</P>
<P>
The four foreigners were arrested by the political
administration of the South Waziristan district a few days ago
from the tribal area of Toyia Khala and Gulkatch close to the
Afghan border.
</P>
<P>
Foreigner are not allowed to enter tribal areas without prior
permission from the Home Department in Pakistan and none of the
four arrested had permission to visit South Wiziristan.
</P>
<P>
A Pakistani official requiring anonymity said they had been
suspected to be agents of some secret agency and were about to
enter Afghanistan to gather information about Saudi dissident
Osama bin Laden wanted by the United States.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Helps Unemployed Workers Seek New Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Thursday that it is taking steps to help displaced workers seek
new jobs following the realignments made by multinational
companies on their operations here.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Secretary Bienvenido Laguesna of the
Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) said the Estrada
administration's program for these workers will complement the
package of benefits given by the companies which retrenched them.
</P>
<P>
"We are coordinating with the unions to see what we could do to
help the affected workers find new jobs," Laguesna said.
</P>
<P>
He said the programs being readied by the government include
training programs for the workers to help them learn new skills,
aside from assisting them in finding new jobs.
</P>
<P>
To attract more investments and create new jobs, Laguesna said,
the government will strengthen a social accord signed by organized
labor and major employers' groups last year to help maintain
industrial peace.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Joseph Estrada created the Special Task
Force on Labor Policy and ordered it to come up with
investment-friendly and job-generation policies to help prevent
business closures and retrenchments.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the government has implemented several measures to
help attract investments and create jobs, including making
business process simpler and more transparent, releasing funds for
labor-intensive infrastructure and social service projects and
taking job-enhancing measures.

CHANGSHA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A donation from the United
Nations Children's Fund to treat contaminated drinking water in
the Dongting Lake area in central China's Hunan Province, which
was polluted by last summer's disastrous floods, has been fully
utilized and has benefited 730,000 people.

The donation, totaling 820,000 U.S. dollars, was pooled last

earmarked to solve the hygienic problems in six counties of the
province, one of the areas hardest-hit by the floods.
</P>
<P>
With the UN financial aid, a total of 70 tap-water plants were
repaired and put back into use. At the same time, garbage and
sewage discharged into 10,000 wells have also been cleared away,

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Ready to Redeploy troops: FM Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ASMARA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea is ready to implement
redeployment of troops as required by the framework agreement put
forward by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), according to
an official statement from Eritrea available here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea is ready to implement redeployment "in all other
contested areas along the common border within the framework of
demilitarization of the entire common border," the Eritrean
Foreign Ministry said in a press statement late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea accepts the supervision of the demilitarization process
by a group of military observers as provided in the 11-point OAU
framework accord, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea announced this to once again clarify its position
toward the OAU peace plan.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Eritrean troops have since February 27 been
redeployed from Badme and its environs "which are presently
occupied by Ethiopia."
</P>
<P>
"Eritrea has always been committed, and remains unequivocally
committed, to cease-fire and immediate cessation of hostilities,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the Eritrean government has created
a follow- up committee to determine the modalities for the
implementation of the OAU plan. The committee is waiting for the
call of the OAU high-level delegation to begin its work as
required by the plan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Eritrean Foreign Ministry accused the Ethiopian
government of violating the provisions of the framework agreement,
saying, "the Ethiopian government is creating obstacles to the
peace resolution to the conflict."
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia has been consistent in its rejection of both a
cease-fire and cessation of hostilities," it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement accused Ethiopia of preparing for a new
offensive against Eritrea under the pretext that it has grave
doubts about Eritrea's acceptance of the OAU peace plan.
</P>
<P>
What the Ethiopian government is doing "is meant to achieve
other political and military objectives," said the Eritrean
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
However, a report from Addis Ababa Thursday insisted that the
yardstick for Eritrea's genuine acceptance of the framework
agreement is its immediate and unconditional withdrawal from the
remaining occupied Ethiopian territory and the return of the
status quo ante in full, in line with the letter and spirit of the
OAU peace plan.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government blamed the Eritrean troops for
"occupying Ethiopian territory" and digging in to hold positions
in defiance of the OAU peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea accepted the OAU plan on February 27 when the
Ethiopians celebrated a "total victory" in Badme, a rocky
390-square-kilometer patch of land southwest of Eritrean capital
Asmara.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the border dispute erupted in May last year, the
two Horn of Africa neighbors have been accusing each other of
invasion.

<HEADLINE> Over 800-Year-Old Coins Unearthed in Shaanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A huge pile of metal coins dating
back to the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127) were unearthed
recently in Qishan County, northwest China's Shaanxi province.
</P>
<P>
The iron coins, weighing 1.5 tons, were dug out of a two meter
long and 1.5 meter wide cellar at a construction site in Qishan
County.
</P>
<P>
Although the coins are rusty the characters carved on them can
be clearly seen.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists say they were buried some 800 years ago and
postulate three possible theories: the site was a private bank,
they were hidden by a wealthy man before he fled a coming war or
they were stockpiled by an army about to go into battle for future
use.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese coin expert said that the discovery will help the
study of monetary development in the Northern Song Dynasty.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Region Has More Farm Machinery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The grain output of the Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region in northwest China reached record 2.9
billion kg last year thanks to the rapid development of farm
machinery.
</P>
<P>
So far, the region, one of China's least developed areas which
suffered from backward cultivation methods in the past, has an
estimated 300,000 farm machines with a total power of more than
three million kilowatts, an average of 2,400 kilowatts for every
670 ha of farmland, nearly three times the average national level.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, Ningxia had only 70,000 farm machines with a
total power of 1.5 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
According to the Regional Farm Machinery Administration, since
the 1990s agricultural departments introduced advanced machines
from other provinces and developed new ones that are more
applicable to local needs in order to promote the sustained and
rapid development of mechanized agriculture.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, Ningxia had established 291 township
farm machinery management and service stations and 1,600 farm
machinery repair centers at county level.
</P>
<P>
Farm machine owners and households specializing in providing
mechanized farming services reached 190,000 and 30,000
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Even farmers in Xihaigu, the poorest area in the region, are
enthusiastic about buying farm machinery now that poverty has been
eliminated.

NAIROBI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-two people have died of
starvation in Fafi area of Garissa District in Kenya's North
Eastern Province in the past week, according to six members of
parliament from the province.

<HEADLINE> China to Protect Interests of GITIC Creditors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank governor Dai
Xianglong said here today that China would protect the rights and
interests of all creditors of the Guangdong International Trust
and Investment Corporation (GITIC), according to Chinese laws and
international common practice.
</P>
<P>
Dai made the remarks at a press conference sponsored by the
ongoing Second Session of the Ninth National People's Congress,
China's top legislature, this morning.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the debt payment process of the GITIC has
changed from administrative liquidation taken charge of by the
financial authorities to bankruptcy liquidation taken charge of by
the court,
</P>
<P>
The liquidation group has invited world famous accounting firm,
law firm and asset assessment company to assist the liquidation
work. And in April the court will call the first meeting of
creditors, he said.
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether China will give priority to repaying overseas
debts registered at the State Administration of Foreign Exchange,
Dai said that this was the original intention of China's financial
administration authorities.
</P>
<P>
"When we closed down the GITIC on October 6 last year, the
People's Bank of China formed a liquidation committee, which
released a gazette saying that priority would be given to repaying
registered overseas debts," recalled Dai.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, after three months of liquidation work, the
committee found that the actual losses of the GITIC was much
higher than expected.
</P>
<P>
"If we first repay all the overseas debts, it will be
inevitable for us to hurt the interests of other creditors," he
said. "It could even lead to such unreasonable phenomenon: the
Hong Kong branch of a commercial bank gets all its money back,
while the bank's branches in Beijing and Shanghai can get nothing
or only a very small amount of money back," he added.
</P>
<P>
As GITIC's liquidation work has changed from taken charge of by
the financial authorities to bankruptcy handled by court, the debt
repayment will be carried out according to court rulings, he said.
</P>
<P>
"These are two different procedures for handling debts," Dai
stressed, adding "I wish to clarify here that this is not because
the People's Bank of China has gone back on its original promise."
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe that the repayment of GITIC debts will be
carried out in accordance with law and in an open, fair and
equitable manner," said Dai.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor said that Chinese-funded financial
institutions in Hong Kong are operating sound and well as they are
under strict supervision by the central bank. Although some
Chinese-invested industrial and commercial firms in Hong Kong have
some problems but their problems have nothing to do with GITIC's
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
"It's understandable that Hong Kong financial institutions are
reluctant to extend loans to those firms incapable to repay the
loans. But they should support those with temporary difficulties
and to those strong and competitive firms, they should not miss
business opportunities," Dai said.

RIO DE JENAIRO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Fernando Baiano scored
five goals to pace Brazil's Corinthians for an 8-2 win over Cerro
Porteno of Paraguay in the Libertadores Cup in Sao Paulo on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
For the 1998 Brazilian national champions, Baiano virtually
netted in every strike in the first half as he celebrated his hat-
trick between the 10th to 17th minutes with two volleys from
crosses and a looped header.
</P>
<P>
Before half-time break, he drove into the roof of the net after
another shot had bounced off the post.
</P>
<P>
Edilson had fired in the first goal for the Brazilians after
six minutes.
</P>
<P>
Cerro's international striker Mauro Caballero scored a
consolation penalty after 36 minutes, and teammate Delio Toledo
added a second for the Paraguayans by slipping past his marker and
firing low into the corner of net on 85 minutes.
</P>
<P>
But it was Baiano who wanted the last word. He claimed his
fifth goal just before the end with a simple shot from 10 yards.

<HEADLINE> Controlling China's Coal Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China Coal Journal has said that
greater attention needs to be paid to controlling coal production
to stop the oversupply situation from getting worse.
</P>
<P>
In a commentator's article, the paper said that at the end of
February, 13,000 small coalmines had been closed, cutting output
by 50 million tons, but that there was still overproduction, and
output of key state-owed coalmines in the first two months of this
year grew 25.8 percent and that of small state-owned coal mines
grew 33.4 percent, while that of township coal mines grew 44.5
percent from the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
This runaway increase in production has had serious
consequences in increasing stockpiles, falling prices, and bad
returns for producers, the paper said, pointing out that the
situation contrasts with the industry's goals of holding coal
output this year to 1.1 billion tons and of helping coal producers
escape financial difficulties within 3 years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Embassy Denies ties with Arrested Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Embassy in Harare has
said the U.S. government has nothing to do with the three
Americans arrested at the Harare International Airport over the
weekend for allegedly possessing arms of war, the daily Herald
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We categorically deny that the three American citizens under
arrest for weapons smuggling are in any way connected to, or
associated with, the U.S. government," a spokesman said in a
statement issued here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The embassy continues to cooperate with Zimbabwean authorities
in the on-going investigation, and joins Zimbabwe in seeking a
complete solution to the case," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Investigations into allegations of trying to topple the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) government made by the three
suspected saboteurs, found in possession of a large array of
sophisticated weapons and military hardware, are still continuing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, four Britons and an American were put under house
arrest in the DRC on Tuesday for questioning by security
officials. The five were confined to their hotel in Kinshasa,
capital of the DRC, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
A Kinshasa newspaper Le Phare reported that four Americans and
two Britons had been arrested with maps near Ndolo military
airfield in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Although the American citizens arrested in Harare were expected
to appear in court Wednesday, they did not. It is understood that
the government applied for an extension of their detention to
allow for further investigations.
</P>
<P>
"We have received a certificate for further detention for a
certain period of time. We want to establish the authenticity of
the trio's claims that their mission had been to destabilize the
DRC and not Zimbabwe," said a source in Harare Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The source said investigations were also to establish if the
trio were at all linked to those arrested in the DRC. The three
will, however, appear in court soon.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean security agencies, comprising the Central
Intelligence Organization, military intelligence and police, are
working flat out on the case in an attempt to unlock the puzzle of
the recovered arms of war.

<HEADLINE> India to Give Bangladeshi Goods Zero-Tariff Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Zero-tariff access of Bangladeshi
products to Indian market is expected to begin from May this year,
according to visiting Indian Commerce Minister Ramkrishna Hegde.
</P>
<P>
"The number of the products will be finalized at a bilateral
meeting in New Delhi soon," Hegde was quoted Thursday by the
Bangladesh Observer daily newspaper as saying at the end of his
three-day visit to Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Initially, some selective products would be provided
zero-tariff access and the duty on all Bangladeshi items would go
in phases, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has been seeking zero-tariff access of some 1,450
products to Indian market to help reduce a huge trade gap with its
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Official trade gap between the two countries is estimated at
over 40 billion taka (about 825 million U.S. dollars) in favor of
India a year and the amount will be much higher if the unofficial
cross-border trade is brought into calculation.
</P>
<P>
After several meetings between Dhaka and Delhi, India has
withdrawn all non-tariff barriers on Bangladesh's exports and
provided 50- to 60-percent tariff concession on all Bangladeshi
items. But zero-tariff facility has not been provided as yet.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government was in favor of providing duty-free
access of Bangladeshi products to India, but a decision to this
effect was being delayed due to official procedures, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh needed to diversify its exports to reduce its trade
gap with India, he observed, pointing out that at present the
trade gap was the result of huge import of rice from India.
</P>
<P>
"If Bangladesh stops importing rice from India, the trade gap
will reduce. But this will result in the sharp hike of rice price
in Bangladesh as the country will require import of rice from
other countries at a higher price than that of India," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that Bangladesh reduce its trade imbalance with
India by exporting gas and allowing India to use Chittagong Port,
the largest sea port in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has not responded yet to the proposal for using
Chittagong Port, but assured India of considering gas export only
after meeting its own requirements, he added.

The Indian commerce minister came here on Monday on the
occasion of a three-day Indian Trade Show.

German exports fell 5.6 percent in the reported period to 69.2

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tightens Security at Large Airports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) announced Wednesday it plans to scrutinize
access to secured areas at major airports after auditors in a
survey of five airports found inadequate safeguards for keeping
out unauthorized personnel.
</P>
<P>
Officials will look into compliance by the nation's 78 largest
commercial airports and their airlines for controlling secured
areas for the next six weeks, FAA spokesman Eliot Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
At the end of that period, the agency will decide if it needs
to do "red team testing" -- such as sending undercover agents to
try to penetrate security -- to ensure that lapses have been
addressed.
</P>
<P>
"We decided it would be worthwhile to look at the issue of
access to non-public areas of airports on a broader scale,"
Brenner said. Once the larger airports are checked, officials will
then look at smaller commercial airports, he added.
</P>
<P>
The FAA's security crackdown follows tests by federal agents at
five major airports. Testifying before the House Appropriations
Committee's panel on transportation and related agencies, the
auditors reported Wednesday they were able to bypass secured areas
and even board the planes.
</P>
<P>
The agency sets guidelines and establishes procedures for
security, while airports are responsible for controlling access to
secured areas within the facility. Airlines oversee passengers and
cargo. Airports and airlines together have historically been
responsible for maintaining security equipment and systems.

<HEADLINE> Donors Concerned Over Situation in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen development partners of
Bangladesh expressed concern over the confrontation between
political parties in the country and called for "enlightened
leadership" to ensure that the nation can grow and prosper.
</P>
<P>
In a statement delivered Wednesday to the Bangladeshi
president, prime minister and the leader of the opposition in the
parliament, the donors said increasing political confrontation and
polarization in Bangladesh is jeopardizing prospects for the
country's economic growth and development.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued by Australia, Canada, Denmark, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden,
Switzerland, Britain, the United States, the Asian Development
Bank, the Commission of European Communities and the World Bank,
according to press reports here.
</P>
<P>
Political instability in Bangladesh was inflicting a serious
cost on the nation, the statement noted, adding, "This has slowed
down economic growth rate, disrupted export and prevented
livelihood."
</P>
<P>
The real challenge to Bangladesh is the elimination of poverty,
and this requires a whole range of reforms in areas such as
financial and legal sectors, public sector, state-oriented
enterprises and in the development of broad-based and effective
health care and education facilities, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
These issues, and many others, will be examined at the
Bangladesh Development Forum meeting to be held in Paris on April
19 and 20, it said.
</P>
<P>
Political differences should be resolved peacefully in forums
like parliament, not through hartals (general strike) and violent
confrontation, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged the political parties in the country to
work together for the future of the country and its people.
</P>
<P>
The political confrontation between the ruling Awami League and
the major opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP), has been increasing since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The BNP-led opposition parties have held three nationwide
hartals in protest against the municipal election and several
hundred people were injured in clashes between pro- and
anti-hartal people.

<HEADLINE> Tourists to Get Tax Refund in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Visitors to Thailand will be able
to receive value added tax (VAT) refunds when they leave the
country after July when the Revenue Department has the claims
procedures in place, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) said.
</P>
<P>
Upon presentation of receipts for goods purchased at the
international airports in Bangkok, the northern city of Chiang
Mai, the southern cities of Phuket and Hat Yai, departing tourists
will immediately receive cash refunds for the 10 percent VAT, TAT
said in a news release available Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, large amounts will not be reimbursed at the airports,
the news release said.
</P>
<P>
Visitors will be required to show proof of purchase of at least
5,000 baht (135 U.S. dollars) worth of goods with each individual
receipt for at least 2,000 baht (54 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The TAT said the refund scheme would go a long way toward
enhancing the shopping appeal of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Shopping normally constitutes the largest percentage of
expenditure by international tourists. In 1997, it accounted for
34.35 percent of a total revenue of 220.7 billion baht (5.96
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The TAT hopes that the refund will further promote Thailand as
a value for money destination.
</P>
<P>
The biannual Thailand Grand Sales will be held again during the
month of June and between November 15 and December 15, according
to the TAT.

BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank governor Dai

Urging the state commercial banks to improve services and

more flexible interest rate range for such loans considering the
comparatively high risks and high cost for such loans.

<P>
Also, a reserve fund system will be soon started to offer
guarantee for bank loans extended to private and small enterprises,
Dai said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Stock Exchange to Delist Substandard Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Thailand
(SET) is stepping up a campaign to delist substandard companies
this year in a bid to ensure sustainable growth for the market in
the future,  the SET president said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The SET would focus more on enforcing good management and
governance for listed firms and minimizing losses to investors
caused by mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
This is to encourage "quality growth" of the listed companies,
Singh Tangtatswas said.
</P>
<P>
The SET recently suspended trade in 15 listed companies,
raising the total number of firms under rehabilitation to 47.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, the SET suspended share trading of another company
as its auditor revealed that the company's shareholders equity is
in the red.
</P>
<P>
The company, therefore, fell into the category of companies
likely to be delisted and will be shifted to the rehabilitation
group.
</P>
<P>
Companies in the group are required to submit their
rehabilitation plans to the SET periodically, so the authority can
monitor their improvements and determine whether they have the
ability to implement rehabilitation plans.
</P>
<P>
Each company is given two years to improve its performance.
</P>
<P>
There used to be much opposition to delisting low-quality
companies, but the move has gained acceptance now, the SET
president said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China's Central Bank Governor Dai
Xianglong today ruled out a possible devaluation of China's
Renminbi yuan this year, saying he has "full confidence" in a
stable yuan.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference this morning sponsored by the on-going 2
nd Session of the National People's Congress, the governor of the
People's Bank of China said the RMB has appreciated by five
percent since 1994. It has stood stable amid the impact of the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have a sound international payment position with
revenues exceeding expenditures. We have cut the interest rates of
the yuan and raised the export tax rebates, plus the purchase
prices for export goods have remained stable. All these have
provided solid foundation for stabilizing RMB exchange rate," Dai
said.
</P>
<P>
He said China will see a moderate growth in import and export
this year and an increase in overseas investment. Also it will
strengthen the foreign exchange management.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, I have full confidence in a stable yuan," Dai
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Arrives in Guatemala for Central American Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
arrived in Guatemala Wednesday afternoon on the last leg of his
four day Central American tour to meet his counterparts from the
region and the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
Coming from El Salvador, where he held a private meeting with
President Armando Calderon, Clinton touched down at the Guatemalan
Air Force airport before being taken to the National Palace of
Culture for the official reception, hosted in his honor by
Guatemalan President Alvaro Arzu.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president is scheduled to meet on Thursday with his
Central American counterparts, including Arzu, Calderon, President
of Costa Rica Miguel Angel Rodriguez, Honduran President Carlos
Reyna, as well as Dominican President Leonel Fernandez, in the
Guatemalan city of Antigua.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state are expected to focus their discussions on a
range of issues related to economics, commerce, sustainable
development, cooperation and security.
</P>
<P>
Each one of the presidents will speak to Clinton on one theme
from the agenda, which will also include an exhibition on the
severe consequences of Hurricane Mitch at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that Mitch had left a total of 11,
000 dead, about three million homeless and caused losses of more
than six billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
President Calderon, who will be the first to speak at the
Antigua meeting, will offer a comprehensive view of thousands of
Central Americans illegally living in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The second speaker, Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman, will
try to talk Clinton into canceling the region's millions of
dollars of debts to Washington.
</P>
<P>
In his turn, Costa Rican President Rodriguez will emphasize
trade relations between the countries in the region and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said Rodriguez will ask Clinton to extend
the tariff concessions granted to Mexico with the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the U.S., Canada and Mexico,
which began in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
Dominican President Fernandez will speak on the U.S. investment
in the region, while Arzu of Guatemala will speak on drug
trafficking and sustainable development, two key points on the
bilateral agenda between Washington and Central America.
</P>
<P>
The presidents will also examine the utilization of some 6.5
billion dollars provided by a number of countries to aid the
region's reconstruction effort in the aftermath of hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is awaiting the authorization of the U.S. Congress to
add another 960 million dollars to the Central American
reconstruction program.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Urges West to See Iran as Partner for Dialog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami said Wednesday that Europe and the United States should
regard Iran not as an object for study but as a partner for dialog
on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the European University Institute in the Italian
central city of Florence, Khatami said the dialog he envisions
would not be possible with "those who feel they have an exclusive
hold on the truth."
</P>
<P>
Only dialog on an equal basis will allow the West and Iran to
contribute to the construction of peace, security and justice, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that 20 years after the Iranian revolution, he has come
to Europe as the representative of "a civilization" which is
needed in achieving a global balance.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, on second day of the first visit to Europe by an
Iranian leader since the 1979 overthrow of the Shah, also noted
that his call for dialog in his message to Europe was not
unilateral.
</P>
<P>
He praised Italy as a model for tolerance which he has in mind
for underpinning mutual understanding and dialog.

<HEADLINE> Manila Expects Zero Growth in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Socioeconomic Planning
Secretary Felipe Medalla said Wednesday that the country's gross
domestic product (GDP) would register zero growth in the first
quarter of this year with the continued slowdown in investments.
</P>
<P>
Medalla said loan growth which reflects the volume of projects
being implemented by the private sector, shrank in December.
</P>
<P>
"That's the reason why I can't jump up and down yet and tell
you that things are okay already," he was quoted Thursday by
Manila Standard as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, if we do zero (growth) in the first quarter, we can't
reach the target 2.6-percent growth this year," he added.
</P>
<P>
The government has set a higher GDP growth target range of 2.6-
to 3.2-percent growth this year compared with the 1- to 3-percent
growth under the economic program worked out with the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine economy suffered a mild recession last year with
the GDP contracting by 0.5 percent while the gross national
product (GNP) grew by a mere 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
GNP refers to the sum of goods and services produced by a
country, including remittances from Filipinos working abroad while
GDP is GNP minus the net factor income from abroad.

<HEADLINE> China's Non-performing Loans No More than 15 Percent: Dai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank governor Dai
Xianglong declared here today that non-performing loans of major
state-owned commercial banks do not exceed 15 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of 1998, bad loans of such banks accounted for 2.9
percent of the total loans. Non-performing loans, which include
bad loans, overdue loans and idle loans, will not exceed 15
percent of the total," Dai estimated here at a press conference
sponsored by the Second Session of the Ninth National People's
Congress now in progress here.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the gradual climb of non-performing assets in
major state banks as a result of the enterprises' difficulties,
Dai said: "The state commercial banks still have good liquidity
and sufficient repayment capacity for the present, because they
have an influx of savings of about 700 billion to 800 billion yuan
annually."
</P>
<P>
Dai also revealed that China is to further re-capitalize the
state commercial banks to increase their repayment ability.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Insists No Foreign Troops for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 10 (Xinhua) - Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic insisted on Wednesday that he would not agree to foreign
troops in Kosovo following eight hours of talks with U.S envoy
Richard Holbrooke, Yugoslavia's official news agency Tanjug
reported.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic termed as "unacceptable" efforts to "condition a
political accord on Belgrade's acceptance of foreign troops.",
saying that "in Kosovo there is not and there never was a war, but
a fight against terrorism, which is, like anywhere in the world,
the duty and responsibility of the state organs."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Holbrooke told reporters, "We had very engaged, very
intense talks today including every aspect of the situation in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no change of the Yugoslav position and,
needless to say, there has been no change in our position," the
envoy added.
</P>
<P>
The failure to overcome Milosevic's opposition to the
stationing of NATO peacekeeping forces in Kosovo casts doubts on
prospect for international peace talks on Kosovo which are
scheduled to resume on March 15 in France.
</P>
<P>
In the first round of negotiations held last month in
Rambouillet, France, the United States and its European partners
proposed to station NATO peacekeeping forces in Kosovo as part of
the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
But the negotiations were suspended after U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright failed to win either Serbian or ethnic
Albanian approval of the plan, which provides for autonomy for the
Serb-ruled province, but not independence.
</P>
<P>
With both sides rejecting the plan, the United States and its
European partners have not carried out the threatened NATO air
strikes against the Serb-led Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible to reach a fundamental political agreement,
which Yugoslavia has opted for," Milosevic said.
</P>
<P>
"No doubt must be cast on the implementation of such an accord"
as Belgrade "will fully honor all obligations that it undertakes,"
the Yugoslav president said.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said he supported the idea of "a political accord on
autonomy for Kosovo under the framework of Serbia, which will
ensure equality for all (ethnic) communities" living in the
province.
</P>
<P>
The accord provides for a three-year interim period of autonomy
for Kosovo, where 90 percent of the population is ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
But Milosevic rejected any solution that would result in
Albanian domination and "cause a new ethnic cleansing of Serbs,"
an apparent reference to Albanian demands for independence.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav leader also called on the international community
to "cancel" two recent rulings in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
He said the arbitration tribunal's decision making the Serb-
held town of Brcko a neutral district and the dismissal of elected
Bosnian Serb President Nikola Poplasen were setbacks to the
implementation of the 1995 Dayton peace accord that ended the war
in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Never to Give up Territory, Says Envoy to UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia will never give up its territory, nor accept any
foreign troops on its soil, a leading member of the Yugoslav
mission to the United Nations said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, charge d'affaires
Vladislav Jovanovic said his government stands firm against the
separation of Kosovo province from the Republic of Serbia -- the
main republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to give up our territory. We are a sovereign
and independent state, and we are committed to political
settlement," he said, adding that any political solution should be
based on respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Serbia and Yugoslavia as well as equality of all ethnic groups in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Apart from ethnic Albanians, who make up some 90 percent of
Kosovo's 2 million population, the province is also home to Serbs,
Montenegrins, Muslims, Romanies, ethnic Turks, Gorani and ethnic
Egyptians who want to live there "in peace and equality," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav envoy made the statement just days before the
warring Kosovar parties are expected to resume peace talks in
Rambouillet, France, on March 15.
</P>
<P>
At present, Western powers are stepping up pressure on Belgrade
to give NATO the green light to send 280,000 troops into Kosovo to
monitor the implementation of the autonomy plan.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need for foreign military presence, because we
accept the agreement wholeheartedly and in sincerity and we are
strongly interested in overcoming the problems as soon as possible,
" Jovanovic said, noting that the agreement, if signed by the Serb
delegation, will be fully carried out.
</P>
<P>
He warned that any presence of foreign forces in Kosovo will be
seen as "an act of aggression," and that Belgrade will fight back
to defend the nation's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is likely to face a
severe land shortage by year 2001 as a result of increasing demand

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been carrying out a

</P>
<P>
The survey is conducted by the Central Statistical Organization
of the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development in
Tamu, Muse, Kawthoung, Kengtung, Tachilek and Maungtaw bordering
India, China, Thailand and Bangladesh respectively.
</P>
<P>
It covers the calculation of the consumer price index and
inflation rates, the official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the official annual report on economic status,
Myanmar's per capita national income and consumption were 255 and
191 U.S. dollars in the 1997-98 fiscal year, increasing by 2.7
percent and 0.1 percent respectively over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Currency Strengthens With IMF Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's currency, the
real, has bounced back against the dollar after Brazil secured a
new loan deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate, which closed at 1.89 reals to the dollar on
Tuesday, opened at 1.86 on Wednesday, compared with 2.22 reals to
the dollar a week ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the new deal announced on Monday, Brazil may
receive international help of 41.5 billion dollars, which will
come from the multi-lateral organizations and the 20 most
developed countries of the world to back the program of financial
reforms implemented by the government of President Fernando
Henrique Cardosa.
</P>
<P>
The new deal triggered a rapid recovery of the real, as it
indicated that the Central Bank of Brazil had enough funds to
defend the currency and the market began to feel that the strong
devaluation of the real would not continue.
</P>
<P>
The rapid recuperation of the Brazilian currency began last
Thursday, when the new president of the Central Bank, Arminio
Fraga, formally took office and announced various measures to
reduce inflation and the devaluation on the exchange rate. That
day the dollar fell from 2.17 to 2.08 reals.

<HEADLINE> China Works on New Health Program for Urbanites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China's public health authority
is working on a health program which aims to provide direct, low-
cost and convenient health services for urban residents, according
to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The services mainly include disease prevention, medical
treatment, health care and health education for urban residents,
with particular stress on health care for senior citizens, women,
children, and patients with chronic diseases, Wang Yu, Director of
the division of community health department under the Ministry of
Health, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, community health service centers are
required to be established in the subdistricts, and community
health service stations will be set up along streets in areas
where the residents have difficulties going to the doctor's office.
</P>
<P>
The community health service workers mainly include general
practitioners, nurses and other health workers. The general
practitioners are trained to deal with comprehensive medical
problems, including various clinical treatments, disease
prevention, health protection, psychiatric consultations, health
education, family planning and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Currently, urban dwellers can not enjoy full access to health
services because 80 percent of the health facilities are in major
hospitals, with only 20 percent located in the communities.
</P>
<P>
The community health service would be a comprehensive service
which centers on improving the public health instead of only
focusing on the patients in the communities.
</P>
<P>
The ministry was drafting a series of regulations to accelerate
the development of the service network, and would make them public
within the next two years, Wang Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Among 218 major cities of China, 100 have provided community
health services in varying degrees for their residents.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Video compact disks (VCD)
featuring the "Mask" and the "Hero of Swallow Li San" in the
Tibetan language, the first of their kind, were put on the market
here recently and welcomed by local residents.
</P>
<P>
The step of producing VCDs in the Tibetan language was first
taken by the Tibet Film Corporation with the cooperation of the
China Film Exhibition and Distribution Corporation and the Beijing
Film Studio.
</P>
<P>
Junlha, deputy manager of the Tibet Film Corporation, told
Xinhua that they have distributed 2,000 discs at a price of 42.5
yuan each, much higher than the cost of VCDs in Chinese or English
sold in interior areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
"This is an experiment made by the film-making industry of
Tibet to become market-aware," said the deputy manager, adding
that most of the buyers are urban Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
The state allocates 500,000 yuan for making Tibetan-language
films annually, and 25 such films running to 500 copies are
produced each year. The films are mostly shown for free at 9,300
places in Tibet's rural and pastoral areas throughout the year.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Members Urge Stop for Splittist Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Dalai Lama should stop
activities aimed at splitting China and do something for the good
of the Tibetans during the rest of his lifetime, said members of
China's top advisory body, the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
"The Dalai Lama should stop engaging in activities aimed at
splitting the motherland by playing on ethnic and religious issues
right now." Galsang Toinzhub, administrator of the Shannan
Prefecture in Tibet said, accusing the Dalai Lama who asserts that
"the Tibetan ethnic culture is ruined."
</P>
<P>
"Viewing from history, the Tibetan culture is formed on the
basis of absorbing cultures of the Han People, other ethnic groups
and neighboring countries. Religion is only part of the Tibetan
culture. The Tibetans are creating their modern civilization
nowadays, and the feudal serfdom advocated by Dalai Lama can only
lead the Tibetans back to poverty, backwardness and ignorance."
the official stressed.
</P>
<P>
Another CPPCC member, also an exclusive painter for the 10th
Panchen Lama, said the central government has made great efforts
to protect the Tibetan ethnic culture, which has progressed ahead
as a result.
</P>
<P>
The past forty years following the Democratic Reform witnessed
the most radical changes in the Tibetan history, said another
CPPCC member from Tibet. "It is inseparable from the assistance of
the people from the rest of China that Tibet was able to progress
ahead, maintain social stability and the Tibetans could enjoy a
happy life during the past 20 years." he said.
</P>
<P>
Comoinling Daindzim Chilai, vice-president of the Chinese
Buddhist Association, said that Tibet had a weak economic
foundation in the past, but has benefited greatly from the central
government call of supporting Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Member of the CPPCC National Committee You Dexin said Tibet is
an inalienable part of China, a fact that no one can ever change.
"The development of Tibet is inseparable from that of the whole
country, and it is impossible to sever Tibet from the motherland."
he said.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC members here also voiced their unanimous opposition
to the attempt by anti-China forces and the Dalai Lama clique for
"independence of Tibet", and to collusion of the Dalai Lama clique
and the forces advocating the "independence of Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwan compatriots firmly oppose activities aimed at
splitting the motherland, and a collusion of the Dalai Lama clique
and the Taiwan authorities and the forces advocating for the "
independence of Taiwan," said Fan Lenian, vice-president of the
All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Myanmar Rehabilitates Tidal Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has since 1975 been
rehabilitating and conserving tidal forests in the country where
forest products are available and aquatic animals thriving.
</P>
<P>
Reserved tidal forests in some areas of Myanmar's Ayeyawaddy
division such as Bogalay, Labutta and Mawlamyinekyuan have
sustained damage since the 1920s, reportedly due to the supply of
firewood and charcoal to Yangon, extraction of forest products
for the regional people and extension of paddy cultivation to the
damaged forest areas.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics compiled in 1924, the total
tidal forest areas in the division then was 234,692 hectares.
However, in 1990, only 177,390 hectares were existing.
</P>
<P>
With the assistance of the U.N. Development Program, measures
have been taken to protect tidal forests, set up tidal forest
plantations, establish community and private-owned plantations and
parks and improve income generation in some villages in the
Ayeyawaddy division.
</P>
<P>
Despite the measures, undisciplined extraction and extension of
paddy cultivation have reportedly occurred to meet food and fuel
requirements for the growing population in the areas.
</P>
<P>
The country's Forest Department had therefore to set up tidal
forest plantations yearly and succeeded in establishing 1,093
hectares of such plantations in the 1997-98 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, community-owned forest plantations are also being
set up extensively in reserved and non-reserved forests,
state-managed lands, firewood plantation areas and private-owned
lands having prospects for supply of forest produce.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, a group of 20 villages has begun setting up
community-owned forest plantations in the Ayeyawaddy tidal forest
division since August 1998 to recover ecological balance, and help
fulfill food, clothing and shelter needs of the regional populace,
thus contributing to the national economic development.

TIRANA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Greek Foreign Minister
George Papandreou on Wednesday urged the five Balkan states to
coordinate their efforts on the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press conference with his Albanian counterpart
Paskal Milo, he proposed that the foreign ministers of Albania,
Macedonia, Romania, Yugoslavia and Greece issue a joint statement
at the end of his tour.
</P>
<P>
He said Milo had agreed with his proposal.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he said Greece had agreed to a Macedonian proposal for
a regional meeting of Balkan foreign ministers next week.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou said Greece backed the European Union view that
Kosovo should be granted far-reaching autonomy, but remain within
the borders of the Yugoslav Federation.
</P>
<P>
It was a historic chance for Kosovo, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo crisis was not a regional issue, but had a bearing
on the stability of the Balkans and all of Europe, Papandreou told
reporters at the end of a short visit to Tirana as part of a
Balkan tour.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Milo called for ethnic Albanians, especially the
Kosovo Liberation Army, to sign the peace agreement before March
15.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have agreed in principle to an
autonomy deal for the province, where they account for 90 percent
of the population, but Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has
rejected the presence of NATO troops to supervise the deal.

<P>
BONN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
said Wednesday that his country will support Slovakia's EU
membership bid at the EU summit scheduled for this fall.
</P>
<P>
The summit to be held in Helsinki, Finland will be a "good
opportunity" for the EU to decide which of the applicants should
be admitted into the European body, Schroeder told a press
conference after meeting his Slovak counterpart Mikulas Dzurinda.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, however, noted that at the same time Slovakia itself
should make energetic efforts to make preparations for joining the
EU.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU has to reach agreement on the Agenda 2000
about the EU's finance reform before it makes a decision on the
enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
The EU is holding talks with Poland, Hungary, the Czech
Republic, Slovenia, Cyprus and Estonia on their membership
applications, the chancellor said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Dzurinda, the first Slovak prime minister to
visit Germany, said that Slovakia could wait "patiently" till the
EU makes a final decision on new members, but what is important is
that it has asked to be included in the first group of successful
candidates in EU's enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
Dzurinda is visiting Bonn to rally Germany's support for
Slovakia's EU membership bid.
</P>
<P>
The Slovak prime minister also expressed his concern over the
EU debate on the Agenda 2000, but said that Germany, which holds
the rotating EU presidency, could play a positive role in helping
reach a consensus.

BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- State treasury bond (STB) outlets
in China's capital have attracted enthusiasts to buy 50 billion
yuan worth of bonds in this year's first issue that started March

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
on visit in El Salvador, Wednesday pledged to continue to help the
Central American region recover from the aftermath of the
disastrous Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to El Salvador's Legislative Assembly in a keynote
address billed by aides as the centerpiece of his tour of the
region, Clinton also defended U.S. immigration policy against
calls from Salvadoran lawmakers seeking special migratory status
for Salvadoran citizens escaping the aftermath of the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
However, he promised to work with Congress to develop "more
even-handed" immigration laws, recognizing economic need as the
main reason for immigration.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged Central American countries to keep to the path of
democracy and lauded El Salvador's rebirth from the bloody
political strife of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
He looked back on the times of war in Central America in which
Washington was indirectly involved. "We must remember the past,
but repeat it never," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Clinton met with Salvadoran President Armando Calderon
Sol for a private talk that lasted some 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>

more recent than in El Salvador. A peace accord in 1996 ended 36
years of civil war in which 200,000 Guatemalans died or
disappeared.

<HEADLINE> Bombing Suspect Reveals Support From Miami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A Salvadoran man accused of
carrying out a bombing campaign last year against hotels in Havana
said on Wednesday that Cuban-American exiles paid him to plant
bombs to scare away tourists from the island.
</P>
<P>
A court in Havana heard the testimony of Raul Ernesto Cruz Leon,
who was accused of killing one person and injuring 11 others,
including seven foreigners, during five bombings.
</P>
<P>
Interior Ministry investigator Roberto Hernandez also accused
the Miami-based Cuban-American National Foundation of paying Cruz
Leon 4,500 U.S. dollars for each bombing.
</P>
<P>
Cruz Leon, a U.S.-trained army veteran, told a five-member
tribunal Monday that his motivation had been financial, not
political.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the father of an Italian man killed in one of the
bombings in 1997 accused the United States and violent Cuban
exiles of masterminding.
</P>
<P>
The trial comes amid a toughening stance against opponents by
the Cuban government, which sees itself under increasing attack by
the U.S. government and the Miami-based exile community.
</P>
<P>
Present at the court were the family of the accused, diplomats
and Cuban and foreign press representatives.

<HEADLINE> 7 Killed in Renewed Violence in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Military personnel opened fire on
clashing Muslims and Christians in the devastated Ambon, capital
of Indonesia's Maluku Province, killing at least seven people and
wounding dozens more, The Jakarta Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted witnesses and hospital staff as saying the
renewed violence, involving thousands of people armed with crude
weapons, erupted almost simultaneously at six different sites in
and around Ambon on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Clashes were continuing into the night, said Ronny Lewerisa, a
resident of Benteng Atas.
</P>
<P>
"At least 30 people suffering from gunshot wounds were admitted
to hospital, six of them are dead and five are in serious
condition," Nurse Ida of the emergency ward of Haulusi General
Hospital was quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's clashes came only a day after local religious
leaders called for calm and peace in Ambon.
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces (ABRI) Commander Gen. Wiranto dispatched one
battalion of Marines and two battalions of Army Strategic Reserves
Command troops from Java island last week to reinforce Ambon
security personnel.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a special military task force sent by
Wiranto to Ambon on Sunday will set up a communications center in
the riot-torn city.
</P>
<P>
Police said on Wednesday that at least 172 people have been
killed since clashes between Muslims and Christians first erupted
in mid-January. More than 450 others were injured.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people have taken refuge in mosques, churches,
military facilities and other government buildings in Ambon while
thousands of others have fled the city for their hometowns in
Sulawesi.
</P>
<P>
The violence was initially sparked by a dispute between a
Muslim migrant and a local Christian driver of a public minibus on
January 19.
</P>
<P>
It quickly degenerated into full-scale riots involving members
of both communities.
</P>
<P>
Police said they were questioning 23 people suspected of
instigating the riots.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Dwight Yorke scored twice, one in
each half, on Wednesday to help Manchester United clinch an FA Cup
semifinal berth with a 2-0 quarterfinal replay win over Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
Yorke was kept in reserve Sunday against Chelsea which ended 0-
0, but was unleashed in the replay and took just four minutes to
break the deadlock, scored his second in the 59th minute.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the league leaders set up an April 11 Wembley semifinal
against defending league and FA Cup-double titlist Arsenal.
</P>
<P>
In League matches of the day, Aston Villa, which has slipped
from first to fifth in the standings since Christmas, lost to 2-1
to Derby despite the return of keeper Mark Bosnich and striker
Stan Collymore.
</P>
<P>
Two goals within four minutes put Derby in front midway through
the first half with Francesco Baiano scoring the 17th minute and
Deon Burton extending the lead in the 21st minute.
</P>
<P>
Alan Thompson scored for Villa on halftime to reduce Derby's
lead to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
At the City Ground, Dietmar Hamann scored in the 73rd minute to
give Newcastle a 2-1 win over Nottingham Forest.
</P>
<P>
Alan Shearer gave Newcastle a 1-0 lead in the final minute of
the first half but Forest hit back seconds later through Dougie
Freedman to level the score at the break.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, it was just a matter of time before the
Magpies scored the winner after the 50th-minute send-off of Forest
player Mathieu Louis-Jean for his second bookable offense.
</P>
<P>
Leeds created a four-point buffer between the top four teams
and Aston Villa with a 2-0 win over Tottenham.
</P>
<P>
Alan Smith scored in the 42nd minute for 1-0 at halftime and
Australian Harry Kewell clinched the result with a goal in the 68
th minute.
</P>
<P>
At Ewood Park, Everton striker Ibrahima Bakayoko scored a goal
in each half to give the Merseysiders a come-from-behind 2-1 win
over Blackburn.
</P>
<P>
Ashley Ward scored in the second minute to give Blackburn a 1-0
lead but Bakayoko leveled with a goal in the 15th minute.
</P>
<P>
Everton, 4-1 losers to Newcastle in Sunday's FA Cup
quarterfinal at Goodison Park, went ahead in the 65th minute on
Bakayoko's second goal.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Election Committee Holds First Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The first plenary session of
Indonesia's new National Election Committee continued into
midnight Wednesday, but the 53 members had yet to decide on the
chairman and two deputies, The Jakarta Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The National Election Committee, which replaces the old General
Elections Institute chaired by the minister of home affairs,
comprises five government representatives and 48 political party
representatives.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the committee, originally scheduled for March
1, was delayed by 10 days reportedly because the armed forces
insisted that they should have a seat on the committee.
</P>
<P>
"After taking the government's commitment to free and fair
elections and other factors into consideration, it was decided to
exclude the name nominated by the armed forces from the list of
names proposed for the president's approval," a source at the
Ministry of Home Affairs told The Jakarta Post.
</P>
<P>
The committee's tasks will include drawing up rules for the
scheduled June 7 general election, establishing offices in
provinces, regencies and mayoralties and working out an electoral
code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
"Many duties must be carried out in a short time," Ryaas
Rasyid, the Ministry of Home Affair's director general for
regional autonomy and public administration, said.
</P>
<P>
The committee's main challenge is to show the nation and the
world that despite pluralism, the country can hold free and fair
elections, he added.
</P>
<P>
The June general election will elect a new House of
Representatives, whose members will be part of the 700-strong
People's Consultative Assembly, the nation's highest legislative
body, which will select the next president.
</P>
<P>
A total of 48 political parties will contest the election. The
multi-party elections are one of the political reforms launched by
the government led by President B.J. Habibie.

ATHENS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Stelios Yannacopoulos scored twice
and Demis Nicolaidis netted in the winner as Greece defeated
Croatia 3-2 in a friendly exhibition on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With four minutes to go, Nikolaidis, who hit the crossbar once
in each half, dribbled past two defenders and beat keeper Drazen
Ladic for the game winner as both sides are preparing for the
preliminary rounds of the 2000 European Championship.
</P>
<P>
Greece is one point behind Group 2 leader Latvia and is
followed by Norway, Slovenia, Georgia, and Albania, while Croatia
is tied with Yugoslavia, Ireland, Macedonia with six points in
Group 8. Malta also in in the group.
</P>
<P>
In the friendly, Greece pressed from the start and took the
lead four minutes later on a header by Yannacopoulos off a cross
from Costas Constantinidis
</P>
<P>
Croatia was more aggressive in the second half, but
Yannacopoulos doubled the lead off a pass from Nikos Lymberopoulos
in the 54th.
</P>
<P>
Three minutes later, Greek keeper Ilias Atmatzidis denied
Robert Jarni but the Croats narrowed the gap on Goran Vlaovic's

BUDAPEST, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Hungary drew Bosnia 1-1 on
Wednesday as the two met for the first time in an exhibition
soccer match which attracted 8,000 fans here.
</P>
<P>
Hungary dominated the first part of the first half before the
visitors took an unexpected lead in the 39th minute when Meho
Kodro scored after a goal-mouth melee.
</P>
<P>
The hosts led the second half with a series of attacks, most of
them fruitless, until the 65th minute when Bosnian goalkeeper
Mirsad Dedic pulled down Hungarian striker Tibor Dombi for a
penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
"The first half was a good lesson for us that we're not such a
good team that we can win with less than 100 percent ambition. We
have to have 150 percent," Hungary's coach Bertalan Bicskei said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to concentrate much harder on our chances and we
can't afford to miss so many of them on the international level,"
Hungarian midfielder Bela Illes added.
</P>
<P>
Hungary is to play European Cup qualifying matches against
Liechtenstein and Slovakia in the coming weeks.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Plans More Loans From Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Faced with dwindling revenue
collections, the Philippine government plans more foreign
borrowings as it tries to contain a projected 68.4-billion peso
(about 1.71 billion U.S. dollar) budget deficit for the year.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing a very large budget deficit which is why we are
looking at the possibility of going outside for these resources we
need," Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is planning to get more loans from the
World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and "other funds
that we are hoping to tap for our other development projects."
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the planned foreign borrowings will be in addition
to the existing commitments from Japan's Miyazawa Fund, the
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the ADP.
</P>
<P>
As of end-January, the country's foreign debt stood at 17.496
billion U.S. dollars.

team 2-0 in a friendly game Wednesday, as both teams prepare for
European Championship qualifying matches.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis opened the scoring in the 18th minute with Ronen
Harazi's shot from the penalty area catching goalkeeper Bogdan
Stelea on the wrong foot.
</P>
<P>
Israel played strong defense and managed to keep Romania's
strikers from the net in the first half.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Romania pushed forward with a few shots on
goal, but missed them all. In the 55th minute, Adrian Ilie hit the
crossbar with a powerful shot.
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes later, Israel's Walid Badir headed the ball into
the net, following a corner kick.
</P>
<P>
Romanian coach Victor Piturca went all out at the end of the
game, flooding the field with all of his strikers, but the hosts
missed their two other shots.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Jason Kidd from NBA Phoenix
Suns will replace Grant Hill on the U.S. men's Olympic basketball
team, USA Basketball announced it today.
</P>
<P>
Hill, who was among the original nine selections, opted not to
play in this summer's qualifying tournament on July 14-25 in San
Juan, Puerto Rico, because it conflicts with the date of his
scheduled marriage to singer Tamia.
</P>
<P>
This opened a spot for Kidd, who was chosen today. Kidd, the
league leader in assists and one of the flashiest players in the
NBA, gave his commitment late last week.
</P>
<P>
The others for the 2000 Olympics team are Tim Duncan, Kevin
Garnett, Gary Payton, Tim Hardway, Steve Smith, Tom Gugliotta,
Allan Houston and Vin Baker.
</P>
<P>
Houston Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich will coach the U.S. team
in both the qualifying tournament and the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Three non-NBA players will be added later this year to the team
for the qualifying tournament. Three NBA players will be added to
the Olympic team after this season. Shaquille O'Neal is one of
certain choice, Hill, Scottie Pippen and Karl Malone are likely to
fill the other two spots.
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. qualifies, it will use NBA star players in the
Olympics for the third time.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Acquire Rice from Hornets for Jones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Los Angeles Lakers today
acquired All-Star forward Glen Rice, who ranks third all-time in 3-
pointers, along with forward J.R. Reid and guard Armstrong from
the Charlotte Hornets for All-Star guard Eddie Jones and forward
Elden Campbell.
</P>
<P>
Rice has not played this season as he recuperates from elbow
surgery, but is expected to return to the court shortly. He became
available when the Hornets balked at his request for a contract
extension averaging roughly 10 million US dollars per season.
</P>
<P>
The deal represents a major shakeup for a pair of teams moving
in opposite directions. The Lakers and Hornets are the only teams
to have changed coaches this season.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has undergone its second overhaul of the season. On
February 24, the Lakers fired coach Del Harris following a three-
game losing streak, one day after signing rebounding king Dennis
Rodman.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers have won eight straight games since, including the
last seven under new coach Kurt Rambis.
</P>
<P>
The Hornets improved to 5-11 on Tuesday with a victory over the
Boston Celtics in their first game under interim coach Paul Silas.
Silas replaced Dave Cowens, who resigned Sunday, citing
irreconcilable differences with management.
</P>
<P>
Coming off the best year of his career, Rice dropped off a bit
last season. He still led Charlotte in scoring at 22.3 points per
game, shooting 46 percent from the field and hitting 43.3 percent
of his 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Rice spent his first six seasons with the Miami
Heat, and has made 1,212 3-pointers in nine seasons.
</P>
<P>
Jones was a two-time All-Star who may not be in Charlotte very
long. He scored 13.6 points per game while adding 3.8 rebounds and
3.1 assists.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR District Councils Bill Adopted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A bill on the future
development of District Councils was approved early Thursday
morning by the Hong Kong legislators after a 14-hour marathon
debate during the Legislative Council meeting which began
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the District Councils Bill is to establish 18
District Councils in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) and to stipulate their composition, functions and the
relevant electoral procedure so as to provide a legislative basis
for the first District Councils election.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the first District Councils election of the
HKSAR will be held in November this year with the number of
elected members to be determined on the basis of one elected seat
per 17,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
The bill stipulates that a District Council will be established
for each of the 18 districts to replace the corresponding
Provisional District Boards.
</P>
<P>
A District Council is to be composed of 3 categories of
members, namely, elected members, ex officio members and appointed
members.
</P>
<P>
For the first term of District Council members, there will be a
total of 519 members, comprising 390 elected members, 102
appointed members and 27 ex officio members.
</P>
<P>
The term of office of both elected and appointed members will
last four years, beginning from July 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The main function of the District Council is to advise the
government on matters affecting the well-being of the people in
the District, including matters relating to food and environmental
hygiene services.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Legislative Council members had a
heated debate on the provision of the bill concerning appointed
members and ex officio members.
</P>
<P>
Michael Suen, secretary for constitutional affairs, said at the
meeting that the number of elected seats has not been compromised
by the number of appointed seats. The total number of elected
seats will increase from 346 before 1997 to 390.
</P>
<P>
As the number of appointed seats will only be about 20 percent
of the total number of seats in a District Council, it should be
reasonable and acceptable, he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also adopted the Film Censorship (Amendment) Bill
1998.
</P>
<P>
Government officials answered a series of questions raised by
legislators on various policy areas during the meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The first Winter Goodwill
Games will be held at Lake Placid, New York, next February 17-20,
Turner Sports announced it today.
</P>
<P>
The program of the Games will include seven sports -- bobsled,
figure skating, luge, sking, ski jumping, snowboarding and short
track speedskating.
</P>
<P>
Lake Placid, which hosted the 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics,
beat Lillehammer, Norway, for the Games.
</P>
<P>
Previous Summer Goodwill Games have been televised on TBS, but
Turner's other network, TNT, will carry 16 hours of Winter
Goodwill Games programming.
</P>
<P>
A 20 million US dollars renovation project has already begun to
rebuild the bobsled and luge tracks.
</P>
<P>
The Goodwill Games were the idea of Ted Turner, who organized
the event in 1986 after boycotts of the 1980 and 1984 Olympic
Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
"We are excited about expanding the Goodwill Games into a
winter sports franchise," said Harvey Schiller, president of
Turner Sports. "The Winter Goodwill Games are a great addition to
TNT's sports lineup, and they will allow another group of athletes
a chance to compete for Goodwill Games."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Shuttlers Advance in All England Open Badminton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- World junior gold medalist
Chen Gang spearheaded his Chinese fellow shuttlers to advance into
the second round of the All England Open Badminton Championships
after the first day competitions here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Gang, from Zhejiang province, outplayed Roberto Nock 15-12
and 15-3 in the men's singles event, setting up a showdown with
Thomas Stuer-Lauridsen of Denmark on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The smart Chen, national champion at the eighth National Games
in Shanghai, seemed a little bit nervous in the first set, which
gave Nock a chance to rally from 2-7 down to 12-all. Making some
adjustments, Chen Gang recovered to control the court and took the
set with three points in a row.
</P>
<P>
The second set had been a loop-sided one, which witnessed the
Chinese player taking lead at 11-0.
</P>
<P>
With the match in command, Chen Gang relaxed a little bit and
Nock claimed three points at 3-13 before losing the match at 3-15.
</P>
<P>
"I could not find my pace, though I won the match," said Chen
Gang.
</P>
<P>
"With victory virtually in hand, I intended to relax a little
bit and hoped to exchange more strokes. I took the match as a
warm-up for the match against Stuer-Laudrisen,"he added.
</P>
<P>
Chen Gang's namesake Chen Wei also had an easy victory in the
first round, beating Shinji Ohta of Japan 15-1, 15-8 with ease.
</P>
<P>
However, another Chinese Chen failed to surpass the first round
barricade when Chen Hong lost to Rashid Sidek of Malaysia 15-0, 14-
17 and 15-7.
</P>
<P>
"He should have won the match," said his coach Zhong Bo
afterwards. "He was just too nervous from second set and did not
know how to adjust himself against such experienced player as
Sidek."
</P>
<P>
China fielded four men's singles players in the All England
Open. The only other one Xia Xuanze breezed past Indian Pullela
Gochand 15-13 and 15-5 Wednesday afternoon. He will meet three
seed Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen in the second round on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
All Chinese women's singles players have a bye in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
The centenary All England Open, which had been overshadowed by
withdrawls of top names such as defending champions Sun Jun of
China and world champion Peter Rasmusen of Denmark, will end on
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Marcoses Owe Bigger Debts, Says Philippine Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The 23.5 billion pesos (600
million U.S. dollars) of tax debts of the Marcoses is just the tip
of the iceberg, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) said in a
statement published here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The actual unsettled tax obligation of the family of the late
president Ferdinand Marcos, both estate and income, is a
staggering 43.184 billion pesos (1.1 billion dollars), or 50
percent higher than the figure disclosed earlier, BIR head
Beethoven Rualo said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 23.5 billion pesos due from the Marcoses only
represents the unpaid estate taxes of the family.
</P>
<P>
This excludes the family's unpaid income taxes of 19 billion
pesos (487 million dollars), which they had incurred from 1968 to
1989, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rualo said that by adding the 23.5 billion pesos in estate
taxes with the 19 billion pesos of unpaid income tax, the total
amount due the government is more than 43 billion pesos.
</P>
<P>
The 19 billion pesos represent the unpaid income taxes of
former president Marcos and his wife Imelda, he said.

items in leading Australian newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- The chances of the Australian federal government's tax
package passing the Senate have dramatically increased after a
tactical decision by the Australian Labor Party, the biggest party
in opposition, to allow a vote by the government's deadline of
June 30.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Sydney's bid company for the 2000 Olympics paid for
stopovers by up to 10 International Olympic Committee members in
Singapore as well as holidays for a dozen members at luxury
resorts in eastern Australia's Queensland state on their way for
official visits.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- John Elliott, once president of Australian Prime Minister
John Howard's Liberal Party, is now dismissed at the highest party
levels as irrelevant and became the butt of scorn from all sides
of the political spectrum following his widely publicized speech
in which he dismissed Australians as "a very stupid race of
people".
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- The chief executives of Qantas and Ansett, the two major
airlines in Australia, have mounted a last-ditch joint campaign to
try to stop the Australian federal government's reforms aimed at
opening up Australia's aviation market to more competition.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Martina
Hingis of Switzerland was stunned by unseeded Chanda Rubin, losing
her quarterfinal match in straight sets at the Evert Cup women's
tennis tournament in Indian Wells, California on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rubin, in what she called the best win of her career, ousted
Hingis 6-3, 7-6 (7-2) with accurate shots from the baseline.
</P>
<P>
The 26th-ranked woman, 23, who had a 2-1 record against Hingis
in career matches, fought back with two services breaks after
Hingis took leads of 5-4 and 6-5 in the second set, saying "I took
a lot of aggressive hits at her serve."
</P>
<P>
Hingis, who won two of the five events she had played this year,
seemed out of synch, saying "I think she played an unbelievable
match, I was always a step too late and too defensive."
</P>
<P>
Rubin, whose highest world ranking was sixth briefly in 1996,
was sidetracked by an injury to her right wrist early that year.
She underwent surgery on her wrist in August 1996 and seems
finally to be getting her game back in top shape.

<P>
ROME, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States will follow Europe
in recognizing Iran's potential for stability in the Middle East,
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini predicted in the
International Herald Tribune Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Writing on the event of President Mohammed Khatami's ongoing
visit to Italy, the first visit to Europe by an Iranian leader
since the 1979 overthrow of the Shah, Dini said, "I am convinced
that the United States is also beginning to view Iran in a new
light, conscious of the contribution to stability that Iran can
make once its international relations are fully restored."

Iran would not help to foster the emergence of a more open and
tolerant society," Dini said.

<HEADLINE> Much Has to Be Done in Future Rambouillet Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The first round of peace
talks, held in France, produced "initial success" towards a
peaceful settlement of the issue of Kosovo, a Serbian province,
but much has to be done to seek a proper solution to the problem,
a senior Yugoslav diplomat said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Vladislav Jovanovic,
charge d'affaire of the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations,
said that the recent talks, held in Rambouillet in France, has
achieved "initial success" towards a peaceful and political
settlement because the delegation of the Republic of Serbia, a
part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), has called for
unambiguous respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty
of Serbian and the FRY.
</P>
<P>
The first round of Rambouillet "is not a well-prepared meeting,
and it is manipulated," he said, "The Rambouillet talks have been
temporarily discontinued without any concrete results, and a
political agreement has not been adopted and is far from being
signed soon."
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Mission circulated a statement from the Republic
of Serbia here. The statement said, "Unfortunately, over the past
few days we have seen false reports about what has been done and
achieved in Rambouillet."
</P>
<P>
"The United States, including some other Contact Group members,
are deliberately creating confusion claiming that the talks are at
a stage in which, in fact, they are not and also that the
political agreement was practically adopted and only needs to be
signed on March 15, to be followed by a beginning of talks on its
implementation."
</P>
<P>
"The document has not been properly consulted" either within
the six-nation Contact Group, a body in charge of the Balkan
diplomacy, or in the Rambouillet talks, Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO has threatened Belgrade with air strikes if
the military alliance thinks that Belgrade refused to accept the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We are a sovereign and independent state, and we are committed
to political settlement," said the Yugoslav ambassador. "We will
not give up our territory."
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in February last year in Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanians, who make up some 90 percent of the province's
population of 2 million, have been fighting with Serbs for
independence.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Repudiates U.S. Human Rights Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Pyongyang said on
Wednesday that Washington should not take issue with other
countries over human rights, but work toward the prevention of
human rights abuses in its own country.
</P>
<P>
The point was made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) Permanent Mission to the United Nations in a press release
quoting the DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Regarding human rights abuses in the United States, the
spokesman said in the country "the gap between the rich and the
poor is broadened, social vices become unbridled and an unbroken
chain of crimes are committed".
</P>
<P>
All the nations on the globe vary in traditions, national
identity, culture and history of social development, and each
nation is different from one another in the modality of human
rights guarantee and standard of human rights, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Repudiating a recent U.S. State Department human rights report
which slandered the DPRK and other countries, the spokesman said
the U.S. is taking issue with other countries with the "standard
of human rights" of its own making.
</P>
<P>
Such practice "will only give rise to more complicated problems
in international relations", the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> German Trade Surplus Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bonn, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Despite the dropping export,
Germany's foreign trade surplus widened to 8.8 billion marks (4.9
billion U.S. dollars) in January from 5.1 billion marks the same
month of year 1998, the Federal Statistics Office said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
German exports fell 5.6 percent in the reported period to 69.2
billion marks, and the higher surplus was the result of an even
stronger drop of imports, which slumped 11.5 percent to 60.4
billion marks in January from January 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, a price slide of imports accounted for about half of
the drop, the Wiesbaden based office said.
</P>
<P>
Exports to 10 other euroland countries declined only 1.5
percent to 32.2 billion marks as Germany profited from the overall
stable economic situation in the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
German exports to non-Euroland European Union nations decreased
6.6 percent to 9.4 billion marks, while exports to non-E.U.
nations fell 9.7 percent to 27.2 billion marks.
</P>
<P>
Imports from non-E.U. nations declined only 7.1 percent to 25.3
billion marks, while imports from Euroland countries decreased 14
per cent to 29 billion marks, and from other E.U. nations a strong
16.1 percent to 6.2 billion marks.

<HEADLINE> Khatami, D'Alema Urge Juster Relationship Between </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami and Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema Wednesday urged
a "juster relationship" between Europe and Iran.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting here, the two leaders also discussed the
issue of extension of democracy in the world.
</P>
<P>
But Khatami and D'Alema also admitted that there were "some
divergence" in analyzing certain issues.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with press after an hour of talks, Khatami said that
the debate was friendly and "the important thing is to understand
each other."
</P>
<P>
"The world is tired of the self-perpetuation of terrorism and
violence and now needs peace and harmony more than at other
times," said the Iranian president, who will end his
ground-breaking journey after meeting Pope John Paul II tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also voiced the hope that other countries would follow
the Italian example and that his three-day visit will lead to the
promotion of this type of relationship with Iran at the European
and international level.
</P>
<P>
Khatami is the first Iranian president to visit a Western
country, twenty years after the Islamic revolution that ousted the
Shah.
</P>
<P>
His talks here are recognized as an important confirmation of
the more open and moderate policies Khatami has been consolidating
since he was elected almost 22 months ago.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema said he found Khatami "proud of his people's battle for
its independence and dignity and, at the same time, open to
dialogue with other peoples and cultures."
</P>
<P>
The two leaders signed four agreements at their meeting,
including the promotion and protection of investments; cooperation
in the battle against drug trafficking; economic and cultural
cooperation; and scientific and technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema commented that Italo-Iranian relations can climb beyond
the "already positive levels" achieved and increase "in our mutual
interest".

<P>
Berereket-ab said that Eritrea wants to improve trade with
China in the long run. He hopes that more Chinese businesses
will come to invest in various sectors in his country.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between Chinese and Eritrean governments is
developing quite well, but achievement is slow in trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean official attributed the slow trade development to
no direct shipping routes between China and Eritrea. The ships to
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, do not call at Eritrean ports of Massava or
Assab, he said.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea now sells ostrich meal, ostrich eggs and shark fins in
large Chinese cities, he said.
</P>
<P>
The products imported from China included food and livestock,
beverage and tobacco, machinery and transport equipment, and other
manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official statistics, for the first half
of 1998 Eritrea imported goods valued at 2.62 million U.S. dollars
from China.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 , China exported goods valued at 7.06 million dollars
to the horn of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean official also said that the on-going conflict
between Ethiopia and Eritrea has affected the country's trade and
economy.

<HEADLINE> Albright Fails to Persuade Congress not to Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- the Clinton administration on
Wednesday failed to persuade Congress not to debate the deployment
of U.S. troops in Kosovo while negotiations were at a critical
time.
</P>
<P>
Despite Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's begging at a
House subcommittee hearing, indicating the debate would
"complicate" the situation when the United States and its allies
was trying to get the Serbs and Kosovar Albanians on board for a
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
"Some have said we should not have this debate. I disagree,"
Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
"No one should fear the free expression of ideas and the frank
exchange of opinions in a representative democracy. In fact, many
can learn from this debate that a free people can disagree without
violence and bloodshed," the speaker added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Albright told the House Appropriation subcommittee
that any congressional debate would "complicate our efforts to get
Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians on board" for a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
She also urged the Senate not to vote on the same issue, which
is scheduled as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
She warned an actual vote to oppose deployment could be even
more damaging because "it sends a totally wrong signal to
Yugoslavia as well as U.S. NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
"A vote at any time to oppose an authorization would be seen by
both sides (in Kosovo) as a green light to resume fighting," she
told a House Appropriations subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
Republicans who control Congress are divided over the Clinton
administration's plan to deploy about 4,000 U.S. troops as part of
a prospective 28,000 NATO implementation force if a Kosovo peace
deal is concluded.
</P>
<P>
Albright promised to Congress that the administration "will not
make a decision on sending U.S. troops until we have an agreement
in hand and can evaluate whether it meets the conditions President
(Bill) Clinton has outlined."
</P>
<P>
Clinton has said troops will not be deployed in Kosovo unless
both sides sign a peace deal and endorse the NATO peacekeeping
operation.
</P>
<P>
Subcommittee Chairman Harold Rogers, Republican Representative,
voiced skepticism toward any U.S. mission in Kosovo, asking
Albright what was the U.S. interest in being there and whether the
administration would set an exit deadline.
</P>
<P>
In answering the question, the secretary of state said: "We
know instability in the Balkans harms U.S. interests," suggesting
the conflict could easily spread to other parts of the region.
"It's easier to put out a campfire rather than a forest fire," she
added.

<HEADLINE> IFC Invests in Water and Sanitation Concession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) announced on Wednesday that it will invest up to
16 million U.S. dollars in the first privately financed water
project in Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
The investment in Aguas del Illimani S.A. will support a
project to improve water and sewerage services for the residents
of La Paz and El Alto in Bolivia, the IFC said.
</P>
<P>
Aguas del Illimani operates the water and sanitation services
in the area under a 30-year concession awarded by the Water
Superintendency of the government of Bolivia in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Aguas del Illimani concession highlights the vital role of
the private sector in providing future infrastructure services in
Bolivia, said Declan Duff, director of the IFC's Department of
Telecommunications, Transportation and Utilities.
</P>
<P>
The project will enable Aguas del Illimani to implement its
first five-year capital expenditure plan, which is estimated at 68
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The plan will increase the supply of water and install more
than 70,000 water connections, providing nearly total water
distribution to the population of La Paz and El Alto. It will also
install over 38,000 sewerage connections in La Paz and El Alto and
complete the construction of a wastewater treatment plant.
</P>
<P>
IFC's financing consists of a loan of 15 million dollars for
IFC's account and an equity investment of 1 million dollars in the
capital of Aguas del Illimani. The Inter-American Development Bank
and the Corporation Andina de Fomento will provide parallel
financing of up to 25 million dollars.
