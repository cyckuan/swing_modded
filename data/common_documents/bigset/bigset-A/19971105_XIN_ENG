<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Provide Health Facilities to Youth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe National Family
Planning Council (ZNFPC) today said it was implementing a project
to increase access by the youth to reproductive health facilities
and promote responsible behaviour.
</P>
<P>
ZNFPC acting assistant director of information, education and
communication Godfrey Tinarwo said the project came out of a
realisation that the youth were not adequately catered for in the
present health delivery system.
</P>
<P>
He said the promotion of the responsible behaviour project
currently in its pilot phase was scheduled to end in February
next year.
</P>
<P>
"We identified some five pilot sites, and in February we shall
evaluate the results and expand the project across the country,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said a significant number of young people between 10 and 24
years had been infected with sexually transmitted diseases
indluding HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"The message is that the youth should delay sexual activity,
and we are going to provide them with counselling," he said.
</P>
<P>
With at least 10 percent of Zimbabwe's 12.4 million population
estimated to be infected with the AIDS-causing HIV, the
concentration is now on the youth to break the rapid spread of
the virus.
</P>
<P>
Using existing infrastructure such as youth centres, the ZNFPC
would introduce sessional clinics where the young people would
get not only recreation, but also health counselling.
</P>
<P>
"We shall have doctors and nurses running sessional clinics at
the youth centres so that they can counsel as well as treat or
refer the youth," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, ASEAN to Expand Cooperation: ASEAN Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 4 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) and Pakistan will take "concrete and
practical" measures to expand cooperation between the two sides, a
senior ASEAN official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of ASEAN Datu Ajit Singh, who arrived here
today to attend the inaugural meeting of ASEAN-Pakistan Joint
Sectoral Cooperation Committee (APJSCC), said the meeting will
help "evolve concrete and practical measures for future
collaboration between the two sides."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and ASEAN have agreed to establish a Sectoral Dialogue
Partnership in areas including trade, industry, investment,
environment and science and technology, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to set up APJSCC for the purpose of
collaboration in this regard, they said.
</P>
<P>
Given the "very cordial and warm spirit" that prevails on both
sides, the ASEAN Secretary General said he was looking forward to
a very smooth discussion in the forthcoming meeting.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the currency crisis facing the South East Asian
nations, he said, this matter has been addressed at the level of
the ministers and the leaders were concerned about this.
</P>
<P>
"We have been affected by this currency crisis but our
fundamentals remain strong," he said. "We are not going to let
this crisis detract us from the path that we have already set
towards greater economic cooperation."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses UNSCOM of Being US Political Tool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has accused the UNSCOM of
being a political tool that carries out the U.S. intention to
prolong the U.N. embargo against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
This came in an open message to parliaments of Arab and other
countries by Iraq's National Assembly Chairman Saadoun Hammadi,
which was published by Iraqi News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi in the message also accused the U.N. body of working to
change the present regime in Iraq and to threaten the unity,
security and sovereignty of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iraqi parliament speaker voiced the willingness to
continue cooperating with the UNSCOM, on condition of U.S. arms
inspectors' withdrawal from the organization and American U-2
plane stopping hovering in Iraqi airspace.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has ordered all U.S. weapon inspectors working with
the the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction to leave Iraq by
Wednesday, accusing them of engaging espionage activities in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It also said the U-2 surveillance plane was spying on Iraq for
the U.S. instead of working for the UNSCOM. Iraq had last month
suggested substituting the U.S. plane operating in Iraqi airspace
with an Iraqi plane to be put at the disposal of the UNSCOM, or
using an alternative plane from a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
The message called on the international community, especially
parliamentarians of all countries, to support its stance on
getting the U.N. embargo lifted, which was imposed on Iraq after
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The message pointed out that UNSCOM chief Richard Butler's
report to the U.N. Security Council overstates the number of times
the U.N. arms inspection teams have been barred from getting into
some Iraqi sites.

<HEADLINE> Balkan Summit Stresses Regional Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CRETE, Greece, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The first summit meeting
of the Balkan countries ended here today with a joint statement
calling for improved regional cooperation and the use of peaceful
means in resolving differences.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit was attended by leaders and representatives
from Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Turkey,
Macedonia, and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the Balkan leaders vowed to work together to
create favorable conditions for prosperity in the region in "a
framework of peace, security, good-neighborliness and stability."
</P>
<P>
"We aspire to transform our region into an area of cooperation
and economic prosperity and, to that effect, we decided to promote
good neighborly relations and respect for international law," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the leaders agree to strengthen cooperation
in economies, transportation, energy, science, education, culture,
and law enforcement. They also pledge to coordinate efforts in
combating organized crime, illegal immigration, drug and arms
trafficking and all forms of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The statement said foreign ministers from the eight countries
will meet at least once a year to review issues on regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, bilateral as well as multilateral talks were
held.
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis and Turkish Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem described the summit as "useful and very
important". They said it should be seen as a step forward in their
efforts to promote regional cooperation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Canada is Home to More Immigrants, Statistics Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Canada was home to about five
million immigrants in 1996, a 14.5 percent increase since 1991,
Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
The increase was more than three times the growth rate of the
Canadian-born population, according to the statistics agency,
which released today the immigration data from the 1996 census.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Canada's immigrants represented 17.4 percent of the
population, the largest share in more than 50 years. This share
had remained at about 15 to 16 percent between 1951 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the country's immigrant population reflects
higher annual immigration levels during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Between 1990 and 1995, an average of about 235,000 immigrants
were admitted to Canada each year, peaking at 256,000 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
That compares with an average of around 150,000 during the
1950s, and less than 150,000 for the subsequent three decades.
</P>
<P>
The sources of immigration to Canada have also changed greatly.
</P>
<P>
Though European-born continued to account for the largest
proportion of all immigrants living in Canada in 1996, yet for the
first time this century, they accounted for less than half the
total immigrant population, due to a growing influx from Asia and
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In 1981, 67 percent of all immigrants living in Canada were
born in Europe. By 1996, this proportion had declined to 47
percent.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the share of Canada's immigrant population born in
Asia and the Middle East increased from 14 percent in 1981 to 31
percent in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Denmark Helps Zimbabwean Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Denmark has embarked on a
programme to help Zimbabwean companies export internationally
competitive products, the Danish embassy said today.
</P>
<P>
Bent Andersen, counsellor with Danida private sector
programme, told the Zimbabwe News Agency that 11 projects had
been undertaken in the four years since the programme's inception
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"During the pilot phase up to mid-1996, the programme approved
support for 10 business-to-business projects, that is,
cooperation projects between Zimbabwe and Danish companies," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We also had a facility called enabling environment and
approved support computer use and management information system
for the Zimbabwe investment centre," he said.
</P>
<P>
The programme, he said, was aimed at establishing linkages
between Danish and Zimbabwean companies and to ensure new and
environmentally-friendly technology was transferred from Danish
to Zimbabwean companies.
</P>
<P>
Started in 1993, the programme was originally intended as a
three-year pilot programme involving Ghana, India and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Andersen said, the Danish government also decided to
extend the programme for five years to cover Uganda, Egypt and
Vietnam.

<P>
LONDON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair has appealed to the French government to take action to help
British truckers who were caught up in a large-scale French
drivers' strike.
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street source was quoted as saying today that Blair
held a 15-minute telephone conversation with his French
counterpart Lionel Jospin to discuss the issue.

<P>
Blair warned that unless problems facing British lorry drivers
were quickly resolved he would raise the problem at an

Friday.
</P>
<P>
Blair also demanded that British drivers be "treated properly
and helped by the French authorities and the French authorities
have a duty to help them to move on."
</P>
<P>
Earlier today British Transport Minister Gavin Strang held
talks with French ambassador to London Jean Gueguinou in an effort
to ensure the security and welfare of British drivers.
</P>

people, but may not be so surprising to many others as the
country's economy continues to be in a slowdown.

<P>
Chavalit announced his resignation at a time when the country's
currency, the baht, suffered a fresh bout of plunging recently,
hitting a record low of more than 41 baht against the U.S. dollar
last weekend. It seems that the unchecked fall of the baht is the
most direct reason for Chavalit to choose to leave.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Minister Defends Iran's Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi today defended his country's human rights record
and complained that Iran is being unfairly singled out for
criticism, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
"Human rights has become a politicized instrument. They are
very selective about who should be criticized and who should
not," Kharrazi told South African parliament's foreign affairs
committee in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
"Iran has been selected as a goal to be criticized," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi, who is in South Africa for a meeting of the two
countries' joint commission, said human rights issues could not
be tackled only from a Western perspective.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that human rights have to be observed very
carefully and we are trying to do the same," he said in reply to
questions from parliament members.
</P>
<P>
"But one thing has to be clarified that each culture and
religion has its own values and its own perspectives, and when we
talk about human rights that has to be taken into consideration."
</P>
<P>
The main pillar of society in the West was respect for
individuals, but in Eastern culture social responsibility would
be a big factor, he said.
</P>
<P>
He attacked the human rights record of the United States,
saying that the United States claimed it was a promoter of human
rights, but look at prisons in the United States... and how the
situation of the black community is in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
He said Iran, which was accused by the U.S. of backing Muslim
terrorist groups, was itself a victim of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
His country is ready to cooperate internationally to combat
terrorism in all its forms, he said.
</P>
<P>
Terrorism was not going to help solve problems. It was only
through dialogue and collective decision-making that this could
be done, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the death warrant which Iran issued against
British writer Salman Rushdie, the foreign minister said, this
had to do with a "clash of civilizations."
</P>
<P>
Rushdie had insulted Muslims not only in Iran but throughout
the world. "This insult had to have some reaction," Kharrazi
said.

MOSCOW, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev and his visiting British counterpart, George Robertson,
today signed an informal agreement to set up a joint commission to
coordinate military ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also agreed to hold exercises between the
Russian and British navies next year, the Interfax News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev told reporters after the meeting that the commission
will promote bilateral military and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Sergeyev said
strengthening ties between Russia and NATO countries is one of
Russia's priorities, and military organizations between Russia and
NATO will be created by December.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said he realized that Russia was worried about NATO's
eastward expansion. However, the British secretary of state for
defense said his government is confident the alliance's "limited
expansion" to include Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary will
contribute to greater stability in Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
Robertson believed the promotion of Russia's cooperation with
NATO within the framework of the Russia-NATO Joint Permanent
Council would strengthen stability in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "we must regard in parallel the process of
NATO's enlargement and the promotion of Russia-NATO cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Robertson arrived in Moscow on Monday evening for a one-day
working visit. He was expected to meet with Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Defense Council Secretary Andrei
Koshkin and members of the State Duma Defense Committee.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Make Railway Travel Popular </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government is
putting in place mechanism to ensure most Zimbabweans use
railways for travelling, transport and energy minister Enos
Chikowore said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) centenary
celebrations, the minister said most Zimbabweans would opt to
travel by rail by the end of next year as it was the safest,
though slowest mode of transport.
</P>
<P>
"With this current carnage on our roads, which is wiping out a
greater percentage of our population annually, it has become
imperative that the ministry introduces these new demensions that
will make most people opt to travel by rail," he said.
</P>
<P>
Railway service would be popularized by making the trains
travel faster and more efficiently as services in western
countries were doing, he said.
</P>
<P>
NRZ general manager Alvord Mabena said anything which would
stand on the way of efficiency would be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
"The restructuring exercise calls for us to operate
efficiently and effectively on a deregulated industry in order
for us to survive the next century," he said.

<HEADLINE> Total Number of Test Tube Babies Reaches 20,000 in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The total number of test tube
babies in Britain has reached 20,000 since the technique of in
vitro fertilization (IVF) was first developed in 1978 in the
country, an official body reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority (HFEA) said in
its annual report that as a result of growing number of patients
and an increased success rate, test tube births rose more than 25
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
It noted that in the 10 years between 1985 and 1995, the number
of couples seeking treatment rose from just a few thousand to more
than 22,000.
</P>
<P>
The HFEA, which regulates IVF and licenses Britain's 117
fertility clinics, said that new techniques have improved success
rates and multiple birth rate resulting from IVF, which has
increased to 32 percent in the past 15 months, so far the biggest
for the treatment in the country.
</P>
<P>
The IVF technique was first pioneered by obstetrician Patrick
Steptoe and biologist Robert Edwards and they were the first to
succeed in implanting an egg fertilized outside the body back in
the womb.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Underscores Need to Conserve, Recycle Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today underscored the urgency of water conservation and recycling
to avoid water shortage in the face of El Nino whose harsh impact
is already being felt in the country.
</P>
<P>
"I urge everyone to start conserving and recycling water
because any lack of this precious resource can bring about dire
consequences to our daily lives," he said after inspecting an
irrigation project in the southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Weather experts have warned that the El Nino weather
phenomenon, which is expected to last until June 1998, could be
the most devastating in years and will bring drought to the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The local press also reported today that water levels in a
major reservoir in the country have dropped to below ideal level
and that a very dry summer next year may even force water
rationing.
</P>
<P>
Ramos appealed to Congress for the expeditious passage of the
Irrigation and Agricultural Productivity Enhancement Act now
pending before the Bicameral Conference Committee.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the bicameral committee will continue
deliberations during the current recess in order to fast-track the
harmonization so that it can be enacted soon after Congress
resumes its sessions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aside from adopting measures to mitigate the impact of El Nino,
the government is giving top priority to irrigation facilities to
improve food production and enhance the quality of life of
Filipino farmers, he said.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos had directed local government units to help
farmers in building small water-impounding reservoirs to meet the
exigencies posed by the El Nino weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government will fast-track all water projects
during the remaining 8 months of his term to benefit farmers,
fishers and the general public.

youth and women, part of local elections kicked off today
throughout Uganda except in northern district of Gulu due to
rebel activities there, reported Radio Uganda.

secretaries for women, youth, students affairs, labour affairs,
sports and culture and for finance.
</P>
<P>

Some elections officials in the country were quoted as saying
that the elctions will be free, fair and successful.
</P>
<P>
The Uganda Journalists Safety Committee (UJSC) has called upon
journalists to monitor the local elections, the report said.
</P>
<P>
UJSC is one of the non-governmental organisations that have
been accredited to the electoral commission to monitor the
exercise and ensure that it is a free, fair and democratic
process.
</P>
<P>
The elctions will be the last exercise before the year 2000
when a referendum will be held to decide on the political system
to be adopted in the country.
</P>
<P>

while parliamentary elctions were held in June the same year.
</P>
<P>
In November 1996, the Ugandan central government announced
that local government elections are to be held between March and
April 1997, but were postponed several times due to the lack of
election fund.
</P>
<P>
Besides elections of youth and women committees, local
elections in the country include elections of village, parish,
county, sub-county and district executive committees.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges French Authorities to Settle Trucker Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today
urged the French government to quickly settle the dispute between
truck drivers and employers and to stop the blockades that is
biting into the function of the single market.
</P>
<P>
EU officials told the press that they have written to trade
union leaders and the employers union in France as well, appealing
to them to settle their dispute as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
Almost all of France's 300,000 truck drivers are reportedly
involved in the strike that was launched late on Sunday when truck
drivers and their employers failed to reach an agreement on
increased payment and shortened working hours.
</P>
<P>
Blockades widened to some 140 road blocks after about 80 set up
at dawn Monday. Road blocks are targeted at oil refineries and
fuel depots to cut off petrol supplies as well as border crossings
and ferry terminals, closing vital trans-European routes and
trapping foreign truckers in France.
</P>
<P>
A similar move in November last year paralyzed France for 12
days.
</P>
<P>
Spain and Portugal are already being hit hard by the
strike-related blockades in that France is their only land route
to the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish government insisted that France reimburse any
financial losses to Spanish businesses stemming from the ongoing
strike.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation union issued a written statement on Monday
expressing its concern about the blockades that, it claimed, would
risk disrupting international road transit and upsetting the
efficient operation of the single market with serious effects on
firms and workers all over Europe.
</P>
<P>
French truck drivers say that trucking companies failed to live
up to agreements reached after last year's strike. The truckers
are demanding a guaranteed salary of 10,000 French francs a month
for 200 hours of work.
</P>
<P>
But trucking companies say that they already made concessions
including lowering truckers' retirement age to 55 and cannot
afford pay increases.
</P>
<P>
Though striking truckers stopped freight traffic, they let most
of private cars drive through.

<HEADLINE> Campaigners Warn Germans About Addictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Nearly one in every four Germans
has fallen victim to smoking, alcoholism, drug abuse or other
vicious addictions, a German organization campaigning against
unhealthy habits said Monday.
</P>
<P>
About 20 million of the 81.7 million Germans are addicted to
either drinking, smoking, drugs or narcotics. Among them, 17
million are smokers, the anti-unhealthy habits organization said
at its conference in Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
The alcohol dependence rate accounted for 3 percent of the
population, and nicotine dependence hit 7.3 percent, said Anna
Fett, the president of the organization. Meanwhile 1.4 million
Germans were habitual narcotics takers, and 300,000 drug users.
</P>
<P>
Calling addictions a sign of psychological illness, Anna
appealed to the government to draw up a future-oriented policy to
seriously tackle the problems and safeguard citizens' health.
</P>
<P>
One alternative was to tie additional charges to the prices of
cigarettes and alcohol to raise a medication fund for tobacco and
alcohol-linked diseases, she said.
</P>
<P>
Anna Fett also called for a ban on tobacco advertizing within
Europe and urged the federal government to allocate a special fund
to help addicts get rid of their addictions.
</P>
<P>
German President Roman Herzog attended the conference. He
blamed the sharp rise in addictions on mental loneliness
prevailing in ordinary Germans' lives. He called on the country to
pay more attention to human communications.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Chief to Meet S. Leone Junta on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Maj.-Gen. Victor Malu, commander
of the west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG), is to meet the
military junta in Sierra Leone this Friday, Nigerian military
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed a meeting between a six-man ECOMOG
team and the junta last Sunday in Orogoo outside the capital
Freetown on the modalities of a peace accord signed last month to
end the crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first visit of Malu to Freetown since the
crisis was triggered off by the May 25 coup that overthrew the
legitimate government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, said
defense spokesman Col. Godwin Ugbo.
</P>
<P>
To restore peace to Sierra Leone, representatives of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) signed the
peace agreement with the junta last month in Conakry, capital of
Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the junta will hand over power to
Kabbah's government in April next year, while combatants will be
disarmed, demobilized and reintegrated.
</P>
<P>
The junta has agreed to it, saying that the armed forces of
Sierra Leone shall not be disarmed because it is the legitimate
armed forces of the country.
</P>
<P>
Col. Ugbo quoted the junta's foreign minister as saying that
ECOMOG was only to disarm the Kamajors, a group of traditional
hunters fighting to restore Kabbah, and the Revolutionary United
Front, the rebel militia reportedly allied with the junta's
forces after the coup.
</P>
<P>
However, the defense information officer also pointed out that
some members of the junta were preparing fresh attack against
ECOMOG which has been enforcing the economic sanctions and
embargo imposed by ECOWAS and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He said that Steeve Bio, a member of the junta, called a
meeting recently to discuss the issue of attack "because they got
machinery from Ukraine," including jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
"What they are now thinking is different from what they were
really discussing in Guinea. It is very unfortunate that the
junta is thinking different from what the ECOWAS is doing", said
Ugbo, who is director of defense information under Nigeria's
defense headquarters.
</P>
<P>
He therefore called on all parties, including Sierra Leone's
neighboring countries, to respect the peace accord sos to
promote the peace process in that country.

<HEADLINE> Currency Crisis to Increase Number of Poor in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The current currency woes would
increase the number of poor in the Asian-Pacific region, United
Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific
(ESCAP) director Edward Van Roy said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference before the opening of the Fifth
Asia and Pacific Ministerial Conference on Social Development in
Manila, he singled out the currency crisis as the biggest
challenge now for Asian economies as its multiplier effects on
social problems become greater.
</P>
<P>
The poor would be the hardest hit by the crisis as unemployment
is expected to increase, he said, adding the crisis would last one
to five years and "its social implications will stay a lot
longer."
</P>
<P>
He said the financial meltdown will slow down the economic
growth in the region, resulting in more people being thrown out of
employment to the rank of the poor.
</P>
<P>
Another effect of the crisis will be a higher inflation. The
poor people will suffer more from the shooting up of prices of
basic goods, he said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the financial spiral, some governments will also have to
cut their expenditures, including the spending for various poverty
reducing programs, Van Roy said.
</P>
<P>
He added that addressing the problem is one of the major issues
to be tackled during the seven-day ministerial conference here.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the ESCAP, the meeting will be convened in two
parts: a senior officials' meeting from 5 to 8 November and the
ministerial meeting on November 10-11.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, some 300 delegates from 54 member or
associate economies will discuss three core issues: poverty
alleviation, employment expansion and social integration in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Manufacturers May Hike Commodities' Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Manufacturers may increase their
prices should the Philippine currency of peso remains at the
current level against the U.S. dollar, the Philippine News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted leading industrialist Raul Concepcion as
saying that the manufacturers will find it difficult to keep their
commitment to keep prices of prime goods low.
</P>
<P>
Dampened consumer demand and intense competition have
discouraged producers from passing on their higher production
costs brought about by the peso depreciation and high interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
Since early July, the peso has devalued by some 34 percent to
the present level of about 35 pesos to the US dollar. To arrest
further falls, the Central Bank jacked up various interest rates,
which in return raised the manufacturers' production costs.
</P>
<P>
The report said Concepcion blamed the continued fall of the
peso on speculative attacks and rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the peso-dollar rate is stabilized at 30 to 32 pesos to
a dollar and the interest rates are reduced to 20 percent by
yearend, business and industry will grind to standstill," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the currency crisis, prices of basic commodities in the
country were stable and inflation stood at a low level of 4.7
percent when compared with last year's average of 8.4 percent.

PARIS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- France today proposed Jean-Claude
Trichet, the governor of the Bank of France, as candidate for the
presidency of the future European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac had asked Luxembourg Prime
Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, who serves now as the chairman of
the European Union, to "inform other members of the European
Council" about the French proposal.
</P>
<P>
"The economic and monetary union will soon see the day. Euro
will be our money on January 1, 1999," said a communique jointly
issued by the presidential palace and the prime minister's office.
</P>
<P>
This candidacy is firmly supported by both President Chirac and
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted
reliable sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the German Minister of Finance Theo Waigel refused
to comment on the French proposal today.
</P>
<P>
Germany has expressed support several times to the candidacy of
the Dutch Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Monetary
Institute which is the pre-figure of the European Central Bank, as
president for the future central bank.
</P>
<P>
The French announcement was made on the eve of an informal
visit by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to France on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The future president of European Central Bank will be based in
Frankfurt, Germany, and will be in charge of managing the Euro.
</P>
<P>
"In several months, important decisions will be made. It will
be notably necessary to design the future leaders of the European
Central Bank," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
It said that the role of the future European Central Bank for
ensuring the credibility and the success of the single currency
will be crucial and the choice of the leading team of the bank
should be "determined" for launching the Euro in the best possible
condition.
</P>
<P>
"In this perspective, the French authorities decided to present
the candidacy of Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of
France, to the post of presidency of executive board of the
European Central Bank," said the communique.

LONDON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook has postponed a planned visit to several Middle East
countries because of a tight agenda on European Union (EU)
business, according to British government officials.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time Cook had postponed his Middle East tour

<HEADLINE> France Promises Free Circulation of Foreign Trucks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- France today promised that it
will ensure "free circulation" of foreign trucks in France, as
striking French lorry drivers maintained most of their barriers
today across the country jamming traffic, especially in the south.
</P>
<P>
The Elysee presidential palace said that the government should
take measures to ensure the free circulation on French highways,
which serve as key transport transitions for many European
countries.
</P>
<P>
"The issue is followed very closely (at the Elysee presidential
palace) in all its dimensions, including its European dimension,"
said the office of President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Pressure is mounting from France's neighbors, particularly
Britain, for a guaranteeing the free passage of foreign lorry
drivers in France, who were stranded in France last November when
French lorry drivers besieged the country for 12 days.
</P>
<P>
The lorry drivers are staging a strike after the main
organization of owners of trucking companies of France, the Union
des Federations de Transport (UFT), walked out of negotiations on
higher pay demands by the workers.
</P>
<P>
A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the French
government is studying the "most appropriate measures" to prevent
all inconveniences for foreign truckers passing through France.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to inform very regularly our European partners the
evolution of the situation through the channel of our diplomatic
posts. We inform equally regularly the European Commission," said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Talks originally scheduled today between the employers and
union representatives of the trucking companies failed to take
place, but the UFT confirmed that it would return to the talks on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Transport Jean-Claude Gayssot said that the
government is seeking a "profound evolution" of the trucking trade
to avoid further labor conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said that a law toughening
punishment for any breaking of labor legislations in the trucking
industry will be presented to the parliament.

<HEADLINE> German Mail Order Firm Eyes Business Expansion in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The world largest mail order
company Otto Versand today announced plans to bolster business
activities in Asia as part of its efforts to offset shrinking
turnover at home.
</P>
<P>
Despite the unsatisfactory performance in Germany, the
Hamburg-based company managed to increase its worldwide group
turnover by 4.4 percent to 25.9 billion German marks (15.1 billion
U.S. dollars) and achieved a profit of 421 million marks (245
million dollars) in the last business year ended on February 28,
company chairman Michael Otto said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the company's four chief business regions are
Germany, the United States, France and Britain.
</P>
<P>
"In the future, in addition to these four business pillars
there will come a fifth with the buildup and expansion of business
areas in eastern Asia, which now accounts for only two percent of
the company's global turnover," Otto said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the company's activities in China had got
off to a very good start with average order values running ahead
of expectations.
</P>
<P>
As another initiative announced by Otto today, the company
would also expand its "electronic commerce" activities through the
Internet, CD-ROM and on-line services.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot FM Comments on Simitis-Yilmaz Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides said here today that Monday's meeting between
premiers of Greece and Turkey has created a favorable climate.
</P>
<P>
A climate of detente is "probably the only positive development
out of the meeting as far as Cyprus is concerned," Kasoulides said
when commenting on the talks.
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis met with his Turkish
counterpart Mesut Yilmaz in Crete island, Greece, on the sidelines
of a Balkan summit on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides told reporters that in spite that both Greece and
Turkey maintain their positions, "there is a tendency to avoid
tension and there is no refusal for talks."
</P>
<P>
"We have always maintained the view that any reduction of
tension and improvement of Greco-Turkish relations has a positive
effect on the Cyprus question," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot minister said Cyprus advocates improvement of these
relations, "to the extent that Greece considers appropriate."
</P>
<P>
"This however does not revoke the position that Greece and
Turkey can enjoy friendly ties only until after a solution of the
Cyprus problem," Kasoulides stated.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and guarantors of Cyprus' independence under a 1960
accord, have long been at adds because they sided with each of the
conflicting parties in the eastern Mediterranean island's communal
strife.
</P>
<P>
Turkey sent troops and took over the northern third in the
island in 1974 in the wake of a short-lived Greek Cypriot coup in
Nicosia seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Iran Ratifies Chemical Weapons Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran has officially ratified
the International Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), but announced
to reserve the right to withdraw from the treaty on certain
conditions.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA, head of the
Iranian mission to the U.N. Majid Takht Ravanchi Monday delivered
the documents of ratification to the U.N. chief Kofi Annan with a
seven-article note about Iran's basic stand on the treaty banning
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The note said that in accordance with the principles of
Islamic ideology, Iran considers chemical weapons as inhuman and
from the very beginning pioneered international efforts for their
prevention and destruction.
</P>
<P>
It underlined the "vital importance of the full implementation,
as well as unconditional and non-discriminatory observance of all
articles of the treaty." IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the noted voiced Iran's stand to reserve the right
to withdraw from the treaty if signatories to the treaty are
treated unequally with regard to CWC's execution, or if there are
disclosures of secret information contrary to the regulations of
the treaty, or if any limitations, which are not mentioned in the
treaty, are imposed.
</P>
<P>
Iran has called for liquidating the regimes enjoying monopoly
in this field, as well as a check on exports including the free
trading of chemical material and technology needed for producing
chemical weapons, it said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Iran notified the U.N. secretary general that
the sole competent international authority empowered to express
views on the observance of the convention by its members will be
the Hague-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons.
</P>
<P>
Any allegations by a member of the treaty against another
member which passes without any action by the organization will
severely weaken the treaty, the note said.
</P>
<P>
But its implementation should not in any way threaten national
security and (or) solidarity of member governments, it added.
</P>
<P>
The United States and some other western countries accused
Iran of stockpiling chemical weapons and seeking weapons of mass
destruction, and branded Iran as the main source of instability in
the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Tehran repeatedly denied the accusation, saying Iran only
possesses conventional weapons for defensive purposes.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 countries have signed up to the convention while
about half of them have ratified it.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tries to Lure More Arabs into Doha Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A top U.S. Middle East expert
said today that the upcoming Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
economic conference will provide a chance for Arab states to
develop their economies, the Qatari news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Martin Indyk, U.S. assistant secretary of sates for Middle
East and Near East Affairs said that Washington does not think the
MENA conference, to be held in Qatari capital Doha on November
16-18, "a gift for a certain country."
</P>
<P>
However, it is "an opportunity from which the Arab world can
benefit," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Indyk told a press conference in Doha this afternoon that "the
conference will give every country in the region a chance to show
the world (their) investment (opportunities) available for
international trade," he stated.
</P>
<P>
Indyk, former U.S. ambassador to Israel, concluded a brief
visit to Doha today before heading for Kuwait. He is touring Arab
capitals to rally support to the conference, in which Israel will
participate.
</P>
<P>
Indyk told reporters that the Doha conference is "the
substance" of his discussions with Arab leaders and officials
during his visits to Egypt, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Oman and the
United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
He said Washington is trying to attract a large number of
countries to attend the conference to make it successful.
</P>
<P>
The annual conference, aimed at facilitating Israeli
participation in Arab economies, was initiated four years ago as a
result of the Oslo accords between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In protest against the current deadlock in the Middle East
peace process due to Israel's rejection of honoring peace deals
with the Palestinians, some Arab countries such as Syria,
Lebanon, the Palestinian National Authorities, the UAE and Saudi
Arabia have refused to turn up at the conference.
</P>
<P>
However, some others such as Jordan and Yemen decided to attend
the gathering. Most of the Arab countries adopt a wait-and-see
stand and remain hesitant to make their last words.

<HEADLINE> GCC Discusses Projects For Collective Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
states' defense ministers ended a two-day meeting in the Qatari
capital Doha today after discussing the implementation of two
military projects aiming at beefing up their collective security.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the ministers reviewed recommendations on
the two projects on "tightening cooperation and communications
safety", the Qatari news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources in Qatar said that the two projects include
setting up a common radar network for naval and air surveillance,
and an early warning aerial system covering all the GCC states.
</P>
<P>
The projects also include plans for raising the strength of
Penisula Shield, the GCC collective troops from 4,000 to 25,000.
</P>
<P>
The two military cooperation projects was approved by the
GCC Chiefs of Staff earlier last month in Doha after Iran
raised the region's tension by bombing rebel bases in northern
Iraq and holding large-scale naval exercises along its coasts.
</P>
<P>
GCC officials said the projects were proposed in 1983 had been
shelved for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
General al Raken Hamad bin Ali al Attiya, Qatar's Chief
of Staff said in October "the two projects are very important
projects in the framework of the GCC military cooperation
process."
</P>
<P>
Informed sources in Doha said that the GCC defense
ministers today also discussed plans by the GCC chiefs of
staff on holding military exercises between their armies, navies
and air forces.
</P>
<P>
The GCC chiefs of staff proposed in their meeting last month
to hold two joint air force training exercises with one involving
fighter aircraft in Saudi Arabia and another of helicopters in
Qatar.
</P>
<P>
They also planned to hold a bigger joint exercise involving
land, sea and air force of all GCC states in March in the UAE.
</P>
<P>
GCC, a political, economic and military alliance, was set
up in 1980. It groups Qatar, Bahrain, the UAE, Saudi Arabia,
Oman and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
After the 1991 Gulf War, the GCC states began seek ways
of strengthening their self-defense capabilities by purchasing
advanced weapons and holding military exercises.
</P>
<P>
They have also set up the Penisula Shield forces as a major
step to boost their military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
However, due to their relatively limited resources, the GCC
states still remained seriously reliant on a large foreign
military presence to protect their security.
</P>
<P>
The United States keeps the largest group of troops in the
oil-rich Gulf region where some 20,000 U.S. service members and
20 combat and support ships were based.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Parliament Ratifies State of Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Zambian parliament here today
ratified the state of emergency declared by president Frederick
Chiluba in the wake of last Tuesday's abortive military coup.
</P>
<P>
The 150-member parliament ratified the state of emergency by
137 votes in favor, eight against and five abstentions, the
Zambia Broadcasting Corporation television reported.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, President Chiluba declared to implement the state
of emergency with immediate effect throughout the country so as to
facilitate the investigations into the military coup which was staged
by a number of army soldiers in an attempt to overthrow the
government.
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency gives latitude to the police to keep
suspects in detention for longer than the constitutional 24 hours
without being charged.
</P>
<P>
According to Zambia's constitution, once the state of emergency is
declared, parliament should ratify it within seven days of its
declaration and it will be reviewed by the parliament every three
months.

<HEADLINE> Russia Still Helps Iran on Missiles: Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Army Chief of Staff
Ammon Shahak today insisted that Russia is continuing to help Iran
build a ballistic missile arsenal.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Knesset (parliament) Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee, Shahak said Russian aid to the Iranian missile
program is going on without let-up despite the denial of Russian
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Israel last month, Primakov asserted that
"Russia is not doing anything that would advance Iran toward
possession of weapons of mass destruction."
</P>
<P>
Shahak noted that "the pressure that is building up on the
Iranians and on the Russians, particularly on the Russians is now
making it more difficult to monitor what is happening there
because both will try to cover up their moves."
</P>
<P>
He stressed the Iranian missile project is a "very serious
threat" to Israel, but without Russia's help, the Iranians would
not be able to go forward. Israeli experts foresaw that with
Russian aid, Iran will be able to produce long-range missiles
within the year.
</P>
<P>
Also commenting on Syrian Army's buildup, Shahak said Damascus
is continuing to strengthen its defense capability. But he quoted
Syrian intelligence officers as saying that Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad is still going for the political option to settle the
Golan Heights dispute with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel took over Golan from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Shahak pointed out that Syria has received
50 T-55 advanced tanks from Ukraine. The advanced T-55 tank is
equipped with better night vision targeting system.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopians Warned Against Bank Notes Cheats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The National Bank of Ethiopia
today cautioned the public against "cheats" who have cooked up
baseless rumors and urged the public to listen only to information
given by the bank or other official sources.
</P>
<P>
The warn was given by Dubale Jale, Governor of the
National Bank when he was briefing local newsmen.
</P>
<P>
Dubale dismissed as baseless rumor that people who go to banks
to redeem the Birr note will be asked to account for their income.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the rumor has been cooked up and spread by
those he described as "cheats" who are trying to sell goods at
inflated prices by taking advantage of individuals who do not want
to account to the alleged demand by banks to account for their income.
</P>
<P>
He said the scheme is being carried out by businessmen who have
failed to make profit in the free market competition, and as a
result who are trying to make up for their loss by deceiving
unscrupulous customers.
</P>
<P>
Dubale cited instances of such schemes in rural areas where
farmers are being encouraged not go to official redemption centers,
because they will be made to pay back loans which they obtained
from the government for the purchase of fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
Farmers are instead encouraged to redeem their Birr at illegal
places for a lower value than they can actually get at official
centers, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia will exchange its new bank notes beginning on
November 8, 1997. At the same time, Eritrea which has been using
the Birr currency will issue its own new currency "Nakfa".

<HEADLINE> People's Daily: China-U.S. Ties Enter New Stage (Part I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A leading Chinese newspaper
today hailed the successful state visit by President Jiang Zemin
to the United States, saying it marked a new stage in China-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily, in its front-page editorial, said Jiang's
nine-day visit, the first by a Chinese head of state to the
U.S. in 12 years, signaled that bilateral relations have entered a
new stage of development.
</P>
<P>
"Jiang's fruitful America tour has achieved the key objectives
of deepening understanding, broadening common ground, promoting
cooperation and building a future together," the article said.
</P>
<P>
"It will surely exert far-reaching influence on enhancing the
development of China-U.S. ties, and on promoting world peace,
stability and prosperity," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang, who toured the U.S. from October 26 to
November 3, returned to Beijing Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the two sides signed a joint statement
pledging to enhance cooperation and work together to build a
constructive strategic partnership oriented toward the 21st
century, so as to promote the lofty cause of world peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also signed a number of agreements on
economic and trade cooperation and agreed to set up regular
communication links between the two presidents.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the visit came at an historic moment at the turn
of the century, and that Jiang, from a strategic height and a
long-term perspective, discussed with his hosts the objectives and
framework of future development of bilateral ties. Common
understandings were reached.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the world is far from tranquil despite a general
tread toward detente, the editorial said people of all countries
hope that the next century will become one of peace, stability and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
It said both China and the United States wield major influences
in the world. "The orientation of their relations is of vital
importance to both nations and the world at large."
</P>
<P>
"In the post-Cold War era, the two countries' common interests
in some major global issues have increased rather than decreased,"
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"The fields of cooperation between the two countries have
expanded rather than contracted. Their responsibilities in
safeguarding world peace and stability have been increased rather
than lessened."
</P>
<P>
The enhancement of friendship and mutually beneficial
cooperation between China, the largest developing country, and the
U.S., the largest developed country, will give positive impetus to
efforts by countries with different historical backgrounds,
cultures, social systems and levels of economic development in
seeking mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and common
development, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Economic and trade cooperation is a key part of the
China-U.S. relationship. The two countries' economies are highly
complementary and stand to benefit from the great potentials of
cooperation, it added.
</P>
<P>
Through joint efforts, China and the U.S. jump-started the
implementation of a bilateral agreement on the peaceful
utilization of nuclear energy and signed several big contracts and
agreements in economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to expand their cooperation in
environment, energy, science and technology, law enforcement,
education and culture.

<P>
The fresh development of China-U.S. economic and trade
cooperation will not only benefit the two peoples, but will also
breathe new life into economic growth and prosperity in the
Asia-Pacific and the world at large, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Jiang held broad contacts with peoples from
the U.S. political circles, the business, commerce and science and
technology sectors, as well as representatives of the local
Chinese community.
</P>
<P>
In his major speeches delivered in Washington, New York, Boston
and Los Angeles, Jiang briefed the audiences on China's
achievements in its reform and opening up, its independent and
peace-oriented foreign policy and its domestic policies.
</P>
<P>
He also elaborated on China's basic views and consistent
position on democracy, rule of law, human rights, ethnic groups
and religion.
</P>
<P>
"All these will certainly exert a tremendous influence on
helping the American people know more about China," the article
said.
</P>
<P>
"Following a pragmatic style of diplomacy, President Jiang
shows great foresight in seeking common ground on major issues and
making friends with the broad masses of the people. Such a
diplomatic style won acclaim from the public," it said.
</P>
<P>
The building of a constructive strategic partnership between
the two countries is aimed to safeguard world peace, promote
common development and push forward the progressive causes of the
entire mankind.
</P>
<P>
This is not only in the basic interests of the two peoples of
the United States and China, but also in the common interests of
other peoples in the world, the editorial added.
</P>
<P>
It said the China-U.S. constructive strategic partnership is
not a relationship of exclusiveness but one of equality and mutual
respect.
</P>
<P>
"To establish such a relationship does not mean that there is
no difference between two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We have all along held the view that differences between China
and the U.S. should be discussed on the basis of mutual respect
and equality and addressed through appropriate ways, so as to
reduce or resolve them."
</P>
<P>
The editorial said the two sides should seek common ground
while reserving their differences that cannot be ironed out for
the time being.
</P>
<P>
"These differences should not become barriers to the
enhancement of their mutually beneficial cooperation."
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan question, the article said it has always been the
single most important and most sensitive central issue in
China-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
"Strictly abiding by the three U.S.-China joint communiques and
properly handling the Taiwan question hold the key to the healthy
and steady development of China-U.S. ties."
</P>
<P>
The editorial noted Jiang's reiteration of China's position and
principles on Taiwan. "The Chinese government and people will
never allow any forces, under any pretexts, to create 'two Chinas'
or 'one China, one Taiwan'. Nor will it allow any forces to
interfere in China's internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side also reiterated its one China policy, promising
that Washington would continue to stick to the principles
enshrined in the three joint communiques and would not support the
proposals of "two Chinas", "one China, one Taiwan", nor Taiwan's
independence, nor its bid to enter the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that China-U.S. relations would enjoy a smooth
development as long as the United States proceeds from the

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Arrives in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Mideast expert
arrived here today on a two-day visit mainly aimed at persuading
Kuwait to take part in the Middle East and North African Economic
Conference scheduled for November 16-18 in Doha, Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Martin Indyk, Assistant Secretary of State for Middle Eastern
and Near Eastern Affairs, is here "to meet with government
leaders for discussions of regional and bilateral issues,"
according to a U.S. Embassy press release earlier today.
</P>
<P>
But analysts here believe Indyk's main mission is to persuade
Kuwait to participate the Doha conference which also involve the
participation of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has received an official invitation from Doha to attend
the meeting, but it so far still has not publicly taken a stand
regarding whether to take part in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The annual conference, aimed at facilitating Israeli
participation in Arab economies, began four years ago as a result
of Oslo accords between the Jewish state and the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
Several Arab states have already declared to boycott the
meeting for Israel's hard-line policy against the Arabs which
caused the deadlock of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Indyk is currently on a week-long trip to the region that had
already taken him to Egypt, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Qatar on
a mission mainly to persuade the Arab countries to participate the
conference.
</P>
<P>
Before he left Doha for Kuwait, Indyk said the economic
conference is not a gift to anybody (referring to Israel), but it
is a gift that would benefit the Arab world in enhancing its
economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the economic conference serve the primary objectives
that would boost peace and stability as well as an economic
welfare.
</P>
<P>
Washington has been strongly urging its Gulf Arab allies to
go to attend the Doha conference.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is reluctant to damage its ties with the United
States which led an allied force to liberate the Gulf
emirate from Iraqi occupation in 1991. But Kuwait also under
regional and domestic pressure to boycott the event.
</P>
<P>
Indyk on November 2 was in Saudi Arabia trying to persuade the
U.S. most influential Gulf ally to back down from its position to
boycott the conference.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that Saudi Arabia said "we can not" although it
promised not to influence others to do the same.
</P>
<P>
Sources said Indyk had heard during his current tour strong
criticism of what some see as Washington's failure to put enough
pressure on Israel to push the peace process forward.

<HEADLINE> Israel Marks Second Anniversary of Rabin's Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel today marked the
second anniversary of the assassination of former prime minister
Yitzhak Rabin under the shadow of a worsening peace situation
and the deepening division among the society.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by her family members, friends and 500 peace
supporters, Rabin's widow Leah Rabin attended a memorial service
held this afternoon at the graveside of Jerusalem's Mount Herzl
under the dark and gloomy sky.
</P>
<P>
Former prime minister Shimon Peres, Rabin's successor and
co-partner in orchestrating the Israeli-Arab peace process, told
reporters that he believed no one could kill peace or what Rabin
stood for, apparently referring to the bleak situation in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"It was a terrible event in the history of the Jewish people,
but I do not believe that anybody that can kill a person like
Yitzhak Rabin can assassinate his will and hope for peace and
truth... His colleagues and ourselves should do whatever we can
to carry on with the peace process and nobody will stop us or
frighten us," Peres said.
</P>
<P>
Ehud Barak, leader of the leading opposition Labor party,
said that the Israeli society has not yet got over the tragedy
of Rabin's legacy two years after his death. He attacked the
current government leaders for trying to deny their
responsibility for Rabin's killing.
</P>
<P>
"It was a deep shock to the whole society and a lot of
lessons have been drawn, but basically the very appearance of
the attempt to rewrite the history to incite against Rabin's
legacy now is a sign that we have not yet absorbed the meaning
of it," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, memorial services and individual respects were paid
to Rabin for his contribution to the peace process that has
brought so much hope for so many people.
</P>
<P>
In Tel Aviv's Rabin Square where Rabin was murdered, people
lit memorial candles and presented flowers to the monument in
remembrance of Rabin. Tonight, a peace rally will be held there
to pay tributes to Rabin and show support for continuing the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Scores of leftist protesters gathered outside the jail of
Rabin's assassin Yigal Amir in the southern city Beer
Sheeva. Some protesters demonstrated in the same city, where
Netanyahu was paying a visit.
</P>
<P>
In Gaza, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat paid tributes to
Rabin, his peace partner that started together "the peace of brave
according to what we have agreed upon." Asked about the
difference between Netanyahu's government and Rabin's, Arafat said
that Netanyahu government is not respecting the implementation of
what has been signed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the war of charges and counter-charges between the
government and the opposition reached the feverish peak today in
the Knesset (Parliament).
</P>
<P>
Speaker Dan Tichon rejected a petition presented by a group
of Labor and Meretz leaders to request current Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to officially apologize for his role in
Rabin's death before his scheduled speech to remember Rabin next
Wednesday at the memorial service held in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Rabin was killed at a Tel Aviv rally two years ago by Amir,
who claimed he did it in order to prevent Rabin from handing
over land to Arabs. Following the killing, Netanyahu was widely
held for contributing to the atmosphere that led to Rabin's
murder. Netanyahu and other right-wing political leaders were
often seen making strong speeches at rightist demonstrations
during which placards were posted depicting Rabin as a Nazi
dressed in the Nazi SS uniform.
</P>
<P>
Tichon warned that the division between the left and the
right is deepening and worsening. He called on both sides to
take a step back from the brink before it is too late.
</P>
<P>
Leah Rabin, speaking to reporters at Rabin's graveside, also
made it clear that she would prefer that Netanyahu will not speak
at the Knesset memorial service since he has never admitted the
mistake he made.
</P>
<P>
For their part, lawmakers of the ruling coalition
countercharged Barak and the leftists for taking advantage of
Rabin's memory to launch an inciting campaign against Netanyahu
and his government.
</P>
<P>
Likud's lawmaker Noami Blumenthal blasted Barak for inciting
against Netanyahu, warning that he would be held responsible for
any more political assassinations. Avraham Ravitz, a lawmaker of
the Oxthodox party United Torah Judaism, demanded the
cancellation of the Knesset memorial service for Rabin citing
the deep division between the left and the right.

<HEADLINE> German Heavy Industry Giants Agree Mega-Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Germany's two heavy industry
giants, Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch, announced today they had reached
agreement in principle for a full merger, which would be one of
the biggest in the German corporate history.
</P>
<P>
Confirming widespread speculations over past few months,
Thyssen Chairman Dieter Vogel and his Krupp-Hoesch counterpart
Gerhard Cromme said today that they had reach an agreement on the
merger which they would now propose to the companies' shareholders
and supervisory boards.
</P>
<P>
Full details of the merger and the leadership issue of the
joint entity would be clarified by the end of November, they
added.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came just two months after the two companies
merge their steelmaking units into Europe's biggest flat steel
producer on September 1.
</P>
<P>
A full merger of the two would create an industry giant with an
annual turnover of about 62.7 billion German marks (36.5 billion
U.S. dollars) and 192,000 employees worldwide, making it one of
top-10 German industry concerns.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary estimates, the merger would lead to at
least 450 million marks (262 million dollars) in cost savings for
the two companies and would also boost their competitiveness in
areas such as car components and commercial activities.
</P>
<P>
Job losses induced by the merger would not be dramatic and
would be offset by the growth dynamics achieved by the merger in
foreseeable future, the companies said.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for International Protection on Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Governments of all
countries should fulfill their obligations under the 1951
convention and the 1967 Protocol, observe the basic humanitarian
principles and safeguard the institution of asylum, Chinese
delegate Dong Zhihua said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the fifty-second session of the General Assembly,
Dong Zhihua said during the past year, there were no fundamental
improvement in the overall situation of refugees in the world. The
aggregate number of refugees was still as high as 22.7 million.
</P>
<P>
Dong said the situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa was
extremely complex. Repeated occurrences of incidents of
militarization of refugee camps, large scale expulsion of refugees
and attacks on humanitarian personnel seriously hampered and
threatened humanitarian assistance activities.
</P>
<P>
Dong said at the same time, some of the developed countries,
out of the consideration of their own national interests, adopted
harsh border control measures and restrictive asylum policies.
</P>
<P>
Dong said UNHCR could not meet the challenges facing the
institution of international protection alone, therefore it needed
strong cooperation and support from the international community.
Meanwhile, the international community should also join in the
efforts to eliminate the root causes of refugee problems and to
prevent new large-scale refugee outflows.
</P>
<P>
Dong pointed out the vast majority of refugees in the world
today were concentrated in poor countries. Many developing
countries had spent a great deal of human, material and financial
resources on housing refugees. They had made enormous sacrifice in
economic, social and environmental fields, to the extent of even
affecting their normal development.
</P>
<P>
However, Dong said, due attention and support had not been
given to their efforts. The recent years had witnessed a
continuous decline in the concern of the international community
for some protracted refugee problems, as well as decline in
assistance, thus further increasing the burden of developing
asylum countries.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community to fully understand
the difficulties encounted and sacrificed made by the developing
asylum countries, support their efforts with concrete actions,
share their burden and actively seek lasting solutions to refugee
problem.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegate also expressed the hope that UNHCR would
continue to strictly stick to its humanitarian and non-political
nature, and adopt a very careful attitude towards those issues
which were not within the scope of its mandate, so as not to hurt
the prestige it had established through many years of hard work.

<HEADLINE> Russia Satisfied with Russian-Japanese Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia is happy over a
breakthrough in relations with Japan, Sergei Yastrzhembsky,
Russian presidential spokesman told a news conference here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news service, Yastrzhembsky said that
Russia does not discriminate the East in its foreign policy, and
pays due attention to its major neighbors in the East, primarily
to China and India.
</P>
<P>
Refuting the reports that Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
Japanese Premier Ryutaro Hashimoto "argued heatedly" about the
possible timeframe for the signing of a peace treaty between the
two countries when they held informal meeting at Krasnoyarsk,
Yastrzhembsky said "Nothing approaching the word 'heatedly' had
anything to do with the meeting".
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the "no-necktie" summit of the Russian and
Japanese leaders was "unique and unprecedented". It was
unprecedented also for the results as the Yeltsin-Hashimoto plan
opens new opportunities for economic relations between the two
countries, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to another report, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady Tarasov said today at a briefing that the results of the
Yeltsin-Hashimoto meeting in Krasnoyarsk put Russian-Japanese
relations on an entirely new level.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov noted the meeting also vividly showed that those
relations were steadily developing towards true partnership. He
said the two leaders coordinated in Krasnoyarsk an ambitious plan
of the steady development of Russian-Japanese cooperation, which
has already been named "the Yeltsin-Hashimot plan".
</P>
<P>
The two leaders did not evade the most complicated problems,
which is real evidence of the growing maturity of Russian-Japanese
bilateral relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
They discussed problems of a peace treaty and territorial

for half a century, Tarasov said. Yeltsin and Hashimoto agreed to
"exert the maximum joint effort for undoing the historic knot", he

<HEADLINE> Iraq Agrees to Postpone Banning on American Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi Government had
agreed to his request to postpone the Thursday deadline that Iraq
sought to impose for the expulsion of American members in the UN
inspection team, the Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi
Annan said today in a statement issued by his spokesman's office.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the UN chief said Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz had informed him that the Iraqi government would comply
with his request, and also assured him that no members of the team
would be expelled from Iraq while his envoys were in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-general welcomed this action by Iraqi Government
as a positive beginning of the talks that would take place
starting tomorrow, when the envoys would meet Tariq Aziz in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief spoke by phone with Aziz this morning and urged
him to postpone the Thursday deadline that Iraq sought to impose
for the expulsion of American members of the UN inspection team.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of his request is to provide an opportunity for his
three envoys to discuss with the Iraqi Government the importance
of iraq's complying with the Security Council resolutions
governing the work of the UN inspection team.
</P>
<P>
On October 29, the Iraqi Government announced its decision
banning all American nationals in the inspection team of their
activities in the country and order them to leave within a week.

<HEADLINE> King: Jordanians Free to Boycott Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan said here
today that Jordanians have the right to decide by themselves whether
to participate in the on-going parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
His remarks was in response to the boycott of the elections by
some major opposition parties such as the Muslim Brotherhood, the
Islamic Action Front (IAF) and some other opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
About 521 candidates are running for 80 seats of the House of
Representatives in the 13th parliamentary elections, voting of
which began today. The candidates number decreased compared to 559
in the 12th parliamentary elections in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties, other organizations and individuals have
their right to take decisions by themselves whether to attend or
boycott the elections, said King Hussein Tuesday evening when
answering question from Xinhua at a press conference in the Royal
Jordanian Center.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is for democracy now and will be for democracy in the
future too, the king said.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the boycott, there were still 20 percent of
the candidates who were affiliated with opposition groups,
including 32 Islamists.
</P>
<P>
Only 40 percent of the registered voters cast their votes until
Tuesday afternoon. The vote process is expected to be completed
in the evening.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the oppositions boycotted the elections
mainly because they are opposed to the 1994 peace treaty between
Jordan and Israel and the controversial amendments to the Press and
Publication Law introduced last May.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim Brotherhood took an unprecedented decision to
boycott the elections. Later, the IAF, the Professional
Associations and some other opposition parties and independent
personalities also took the same decision.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is one of only two countries in the Arab world that have
signed a peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Most of Jordan's weekly newspapers were forced to close down
after the government adopted the Amendments to the Press and
Publication Law as a temporary law, which was accused of killing
freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian Parliament is made up of the Senate, the upper
house and the House of Representatives, the lower house. All the
40 upper house members are directly appointed by King Hussein and
today's elections are for the lower house.
</P>
<P>
All of those who are above 19 years old in the kingdom's 4.4
million population can register for the elections of the lower
house with 80 seats.
</P>
<P>
The fundamentalists, represented by the Muslim Brotherhood, are
a major part in Jordan's political arena and even won 22 seats
in the lower house in the 1993 elections.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Admits Germany's Slowness in Structural Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
today admitted that the government has been slow in bringing about
needed structural reforms in the German economy and urged the
industry to take their own initiative to help cut the country's
record-high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a banking conference today in Frankfurt, Kohl
conceded that German politicians had been moving only reluctantly
to reduce regulations and cost burdens on employers so as to
improve the framework conditions for investments.
</P>
<P>
Such changes were difficult, because "the Federal Republic is
not a speedboat," Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
But he insisted that a decisive role should also be played by
the private sector where there had been "untapped areas of
enterpreneurial engagement and a neglect for new jobs" for years.
</P>
<P>
He also warned against the illusion that large number of jobs
would be created in the public sector, noting that on the
contrary, it was necessary to achieve a "lean state" in the
future.
</P>
<P>
During the speech, Kohl repeated the government projections of
a 2.5 percent economic growth for 1997 and a three percent growth
next year, adding that the economic upswing is set to bring some
relief to the job market.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed confidence that Germany would be able to join
the planned single European currency, the Euro, in the first wave
on January 1, 1999.

LONDON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A consulate general of the
People's Republic of China was opened today in Edinburgh, capital
of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
This is the second Chinese consulate general in the United
kingdom. The first one was set up 10 years ago in Manchester,

live in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony was presided over by Wang Yingfan,
visiting Chinese vice-minister of foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Wang said both China and Britain want
to see a new chapter in their bilateral relations following the
return of Hong Kong to China on July 1. He expressed the hope that
people from all walks of life in Scotland will visit China and
seek development opportunities there.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people attended the opening ceremony, including
Chinese Ambassador to Britain Ma Zhenggang and Consul General in
Edinburgh Liu Junbao, officials from the British government and

<P>
LONDON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain's ruling Labor Party and
the minority Liberal Democratic Party held a meeting today to
discuss plans for Britian's EU presidency in the first half of
1998.
</P>
<P>
An aide to Prime Minister Tony Blair told reporters after the
meeting that the two parties agreed to cooperate to persuade
sceptical Britains that membership of the European Union was in
their interest.
</P>
<P>
"There was agreement that one of the aims of the presidency was
to start to build a national consensus behind the view that
Britain gains from Europe and Europe benefits from Britain," the
aide said.
</P>
<P>
"The government and the Liberal Democrats have a shared
interest in making Britons less Eurosceptic, and a successful
presidency will help meet that goal by showing people the benefits
of Britain being a leading player in Europe," he added.
</P>
<P>
Blair set up the joint cabinet committee with the Liberal
Democratic Party, the third party in the country, allowing its
president Paddy Ashdown and senior colleagues to become the first
Liberals to attend cabinet meetings since World War Two.
</P>
<P>
The two parties had already cooperated on proposals for
Scottish and Welsh parliaments that were approved in referenda in
September.

<HEADLINE> Airbus Wants Half of World's Aircraft Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A spokeswoman for the European
aircraft production giant Airbus said here today that the company
wanted 50 percent of the world aircraft market in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"The goal is realistic rather than a mere expectation, as
Airbus is developing at a fast pace in these years and eating up
more and more share of the global aircraft market," said Barbara
Kracht, general manager of Press and Information Services for the
Airbus Industrie.
</P>
<P>
The European consortium made up 30 percent of the global plane
market in 1996 and was expected to have a 40 percent share this
year, said the spokeswoman who is here to attend the 53rd general
assembly of the International Air Transport Association.
</P>
<P>
She said that altogether 185 Airbus aircraft would be delivered
to some 20 countries in 1997 in comparison with 126 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States Airways affirmed an order for up
to 400 Airbus Industrie aircraft with the first deliveries set for
the fourth quarter of 1988, according to a press release from the
company.
</P>
<P>
At present, total firm contracts for Airbus Industrie's family
of aircraft stand at 2,639 orders from 140 customers. So far,
1,632 aircraft have been delivered, worth 88.8 billion U.S.
dollars, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Kracht said Airbus Industrie was seeking new ways to lower
maintenance cost and provide training for its customers' staff in
order to enhance its competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about Airbus' totally computer-controlled type of
aircraft ever making disaster for technical reasons, she said
"Sometimes we are criticized because we are innovative."
</P>
<P>
"We are the first to have overall computer-designed aircraft
which was finalized in 1988 and commercially delivered in 1993,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Airbus now boasted a product family ranging from A319, A320
to A321 and from A300, A310, A330 to A340, with which the
company wants to wrestle more market share from the dominating
Boeing Company of the United States.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein: Parliament Elections Impartial, Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan said today
that the Jordanian government is holding "the most impartial and
fair elections in the kingdom's history."
</P>
<P>
The king made these remarks during a sudden visit to the
election press center where low turnout rate was reported at the
end of the 13th parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
Jordan conducted the election in a free and fair way and
would continue to pursue its goal of setting up a model for
those who advocate democracy, pluralism and public participation
in decision-making, the king said.
</P>
<P>
The majority of Jordanians had exercised their rights and
expressed their aspirations through the voting, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hussein underlined that there were many attempts
by small groups who sought to marginalize the parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that he felt relieved when he found a high
degree of public awareness and a feeling of responsibility among
the Jordanians when he toured the country last month.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the press center, until two
hours before the end of the election this evening, 702,636
registered voters, or 47.45 percent of the total, cast their
ballots.
</P>
<P>
The constituency in the Tafilah governorate enjoyed the
highest turnout rate which was 73.24 percent, while the lowest
turnout rate, 26.42 percent, went to the second constituency in
the capital of Amman.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian Parliament is made up of the Senate, the upper
house and the House of Representatives, the lower house. All the
40 upper House members are appointed by King Hussein and the
current elections are for the lower house.
</P>
<P>
Election scandals have been reported long before the voting
day. Forged voting cards were found in some districts and some
civilians registered their names twice. The government was accused
of registering 9,000 people from the military, security and
intelligence services for the elections in violation of the
kingdom's constitution.
</P>
<P>
The fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood, a major force in
Jordan's political arena holding 22 seats in the outgoing lower
house, and nine other left-leaning opposition parties boycotted
the elections in protest of the government's tightened grip on
press and publication.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is ruled by the royal family of king Hussein with the
Constitution. Political parties emerged in 1952 and were soon
banned. The ban was lifted in 1991 to allow the existence of the
multi-party system.

<HEADLINE> British MP Vows to End Foxhunting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- British member of parliament
Mike Foster said today he was confident his campaign to end
foxhunting in the country would be successful despite a setback
from the government.
</P>
<P>
"I know hunting with dogs will be stopped. I have every
confidence that will happen. My bill is the tool to bring that end
about," said Foster, surrounded by around 30 MPs from all parties
backing his campaign.
</P>
<P>
Foster, an MP for the ruling Labor party, has infuriated
gamekeepers, farmers and hunters with his bid to outlaw hunting of
foxes with dogs.
</P>
<P>
But his efforts suffered a setback after the Labor government
decided to make no effort to help his bill to become law. If the
bill passed, it would bring in maximum penalties of fines of 5,000
pounds (8,380 US dollars) and six months' imprisonment for fox
hunters.
</P>
<P>
The government said today it was too busy with its own
legislative program to help Foster.
</P>
<P>
A new MORI poll published today also showed public support for
the move running at 57 percent, a three point rise since the last
similar poll in July.
</P>
<P>
Foster won the chance to put it to parliament when he came top
of the draw for MPs wanting to pilot their own proposals into law
as so-called Private Members Bills.
</P>
<P>
But Roger Gale, a Conservative MP backing Foster's drive, said
the chance to get the bill passed was slim.
</P>
<P>
"A Private Members Bill is an extremely fragile parliamentary
instrument, it's very easy to block," Gale said.
</P>
<P>
In July, hundreds of thousands of people attended a march in
London to protest against the ban on foxhunting. The march was
aimed at showing rural anger at what organizers described as
attacks by middle-class city dwellers on traditional country
pursuits like foxhunting.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: S. Leonen Peace Process Faces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Chang Yong)
</P>
<P>
LAGOS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The peace process in Sierra Leone is
likely to meet a setback as the junta leader Major Paul Koroma today
called for an immediate withdrawal of the Nigerian troops as a
pre-condition to break the political impasse in that country.
</P>
<P>
For the Conakry peace accord to work, the Nigerian soldiers who
have been in Sierra Leone for the past six years should leave
immediately, British Broadcasting Corporation quoted Koroma as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The junta which seized power in the May 25 coup has come under
increasing international pressure. It had to sign the
peace accord with representatives of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) three weeks ago in Conakry, capital
of Guinea, to end the crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the junta will hand over power to the
legitimate government of ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in April
next year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the warring factions in the country will be disarmed,
demobilized and reintegrated, which should be done under the
supervision of the ECOWAS peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Apparently rejecting Nigerians soldiers to monitor the peace
process, Koroma said the ECOMOG contingent in the country comprises
many countries with the same capacity as the Nigerians to accept
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
According to Koroma, Nigeria is bullying his ruling Armed Forces
Revolutionary Council (AFRC) and he does not like such a situation.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the immediate release of Foday Sankoh, leader of
the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) who has been under house
arrest in Nigeria since March this year.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian soldiers first went to Sierra Leone under a military
cooperation agreement between the two governments. After the coup,
they became the the major part of a sub-regional force enforcing
sanctions against the junta.
</P>
<P>
Koroma's statement is seen by observers as placing obstacles to the
implementation of the Conakry accord and may frustrate the peace
process which seems to have been progressing smoothly in the past
weeks.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG Force Commander Maj.-Gen. Victor Malu is scheduled to go to
Freetown to meet the junta on the modalities of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
As Nigerian troops make up the bulk of the ECOMOG contingent, their
withdrawal is but only to weaken the capability of the peacekeeping
force, observers noted.
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that Nigeria is aware of the junta's intention and
has been ready to reject such demand as projected by Koroma.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here today, Nigeria's defense spokesman
accused the junta of not being sincere to implement the ceasefire
between it and ECOMOG as required by the Conakry accord.
</P>
<P>
The junta was preparing fresh attack against ECOMOG, said Col.
Godwin Ugbo, who is director of defense information under Nigeria's
defense headquarters.
</P>
<P>
He said that Steeve Bio, a member of the junta, called a meeting
recently to discuss the attack "because they got machinery from
Ukraine," including jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
"What they are now thinking is different from what they were really
discussing in Guinea. It is very unfortunate that the junta is
thinking different from what the ECOWAS is doing", the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
He therefore called on all parties, including Sierra Leone's
neighboring countries, to respect the peace accord so as to promote
the peace process in that country.
</P>
<P>
Apparently, there is no legal ground that Nigeria has to leave
Sierra Leone before the end of the peace process, not to talk of
Nigeria's willingness to go.
</P>
<P>
Then what Koroma is to do next will be crucial to the peace and
stability of the sub-region since the resolution of the crisis is also
directly connected with the tens of thousands of Sierra Leoneans
taking refuge in neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> US Leading Economic Indexes Edge Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Index of Leading
Economic Indicators edged 0.2 percent higher in September to
104.5, as an indication the economy is headed for continued
growth, according to a private research group report here today.
</P>
<P>
This is its fifth straight monthly increase.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board report of the rise matched analysts'
expectations and followed a 0.2 percent increase in August.
</P>
<P>
The leading index is designed to forecast economic activity six
to nine months in advance, and its string of gains is a sign of no
imminent halt to the economic expansion, already the third longest
in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
Over the six months through September, the index increased 1.6
percent. During the same period, seven of the 10 leading economic
indicators advanced.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board said six of the 10 leading indicators rose
in September, with the most significant gains coming in a decline
in new weekly unemployment claims and the growth of the money
supply. The most significant decline in September was new orders
received by manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board made a major change last year, when it
eliminated two components and added one for a new total of 10.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Coalition Government Partner to Exit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot coalition government
partner, center-right Democratic Party (DIKO), today decided to
end its alliance with the right-wing Democratic Rally Party (DISY)
just four months before the five-year term ends.
</P>
<P>
DIKO President Spyros Kyprianou, who is the current Speaker of
the House of Representatives, said today that the five DIKO
ministers in the 11-member cabinet will hand in their resignations
to President Glafcos Clerides Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not make explicit the reasons for the
withdrawal of the DIKO from the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou, 65, who decided to run for the presidency in the
upcoming elections due February 1998, had threatened that if
President Clerides decides to seek re-election, his party will
withdraw from the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The DIKO's decision, which was made unanimously during a DIKO
Central Committee meeting, will not force the government to call
early elections because Cyprus has a presidential system.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides, 77, said earlier today that he would
announce his final decision whether he will seek re-election on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But Kyprianou, who served as president of Cyprus from 1977-88,
said he was certain that Clerides would run again.
</P>
<P>
Clerides, founder of the ruling DISY, was elected president of
Cyprus in February 1993 with the support of the DIKO, which has
five ministers in the cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Ramos to Seek APEC Cooperation in Battling Currency Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said here today that he will seek greater cooperation from
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies in overcoming
the currency woes buffeting Southeast Asia during the APEC
informal leadership meeting in Vancouver, Canada, later this
month.
</P>
<P>
After all, mutual assistance and support is the very principle
upon which APEC was founded, he said, adding it was imperative
that big players do not take advantage of the problem of the
region.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) are trying to create a momentum to protect their
currencies from speculative attacks and the assistance of other
APEC members would be a major boost to the beleaguered currencies
of the region.
</P>
<P>
Since early July, the peso, among other regional currencies,
has been in turmoil, devaluating by some 34 percent to the current
level of 35 pesos against one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
However, President Ramos said the regional currency problem has
not been "all that bad", pointing out that inflation in his
country was 5.7 percent in October, contrary to projections that
it would soar to 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the first 10 months this year, the country's inflation
rate stood at 4.8 percent, much lower than last year's average of
8.4 percent.

Bangladesh obtained aid commitment of 1.94 billion dollars at
last year's aid club meeting in Paris. But the amount disbursed
was 1.47 billion dollars with an accumulated total of 4.71 billion

<HEADLINE> No Establishment of U.S. Bases in Philippines: Ramos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos said here
today that his country and the United States are holding talks on
defense-related matters, but did not envision the setting up of
U.S. bases in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"The talks do not envision the establishment of U.S. bases in
the Philippines, the permanent stationing of foreign forces in the
country, or access arrangements. The United States, in fact, has
not asked for any of these," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nor do the talks have anything to do with granting the
so-called "immunity" to foreign soldiers who commit crimes when
attending joint military exercises in the Philippines, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Ramos said the two countries are discussing the
elements of a possible agreement on the legal treatment of U.S.
defense and armed forces personnel visiting the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Denounces New US Sanctions, Aggressive Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Sudan angrily denounced newly
imposed U.S. economic sanctions as "an extension of the
U.S. aggressive policies against those who do not submit to its
hegemony."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decision represented one aspect of the injustices
Washington was practicing against numerous countries that pursue
an independent policy, said Sudanese Minister of State for Foreign
Affairs Mustafa Osman Ismail today in a statement.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced Tuesday
new U.S. sanctions against Sudan, which included freezing Sudanese
government assests in U.S., barring most U.S.-Sudanese trade and
banning U.S. investments and most financial transactions between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
She said the tightening of sanctions was prompted by Sudan's
"abysmal record" on human rights and its pro-Iranian government's
support of international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Ismail said the U.S. decision was made out of
its biased policies against the just causes of the Arab nation,
starting with the causes of Palestine, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It was tantamount to U.S. support of the aggressions
perpetrated by the Sudan's neighboring states, he added.
</P>
<P>
Last January Washington sent 20 million U.S. dollar worth of
military equipment to each of Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda to
defend themselves against what it claimed "radical Islamic tide
coming from the Sudan."
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed regret that the announcement came as
negotations were under way in Nairobi, Kenya, between Sudanese
government and the John Garang-led Popular Movement for the
Liberation of the Sudan to end the civil war in southern Sudan and
to establish peace throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was the biggest loser by making such a decision, and
would inevitably give up as it did in several other cases like
Iran, the minister added.

<HEADLINE> British Scientists Make Progress in Brain Damage Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A technique which can repair
damaged brain tissue by injecting embryonic brain cells -- a form
of a brain material transplant -- has been developed by a group of
British scientists.
</P>
<P>
The psychologists team, led by professor Jeffrey Gray, achieved
full success in their experiments on rats.
</P>
<P>
They injected embryonic mouse brain cells into rats whose
brains were damaged by simulated heart attacks. The rats, which
had suffered total amnesia and severe cognitive impairment,
recovered completely.
</P>
<P>
Professor Gray, a fellow in psychology at Oxford University for
almost 20 years, said: "I was overjoyed about the recovery of
function. But what really surprised me was that the (transplanted)
cells moved to the damaged sites."
</P>
<P>
The new treatment, if feasible on humans, may help cure some of
the most tragic brain diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's
and Huntington's, said a report in the Independent newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
It is targeted not only at degenerative diseases but also at
much more common conditions such as strokes and heart attacks,
which can result in brain cell deaths due to lack of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, neurological disorders of the brain have been
practically impossible to combat because dead and damaged brain
cells are not replaced by the body, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Experiments on humans are due to start in three years and a
treatment could be available by early next century, the scientists
said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Assists Kenya in Biological Control of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior World Bank official
said today that the bank would release 2.3 million U.S. Dollars
to Kenya for the water hyacinth control in five years, according
to a Kenya News Agency report today.
</P>
<P>
Greene Donovan, task manager of the bank's Lake Victoria
Environmental Management Program, said the World Bank had
released 140,000 Dollars to the Kenya Agricultural Research
Institute (KARI) for the biological control of the hyacinth in
the Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank official made the remarks when he met with the
Nyanza Provincial Commissioner Wilson Chepkwony today in Kisumu,
west Kenya.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that KARI had already released and would
continue to release beetles in the lake to feed on the fast
expanding weed as a long term control measure.
</P>
<P>
For the short term control of the weed, Donovan said, the Lake
Victoria Environmental Management Program is working for a
mechanical harvester.
</P>
<P>
Donovan who is based in Washington will stay in Kenya's lake
region for a week before proceeding to Uganda which is also
affected by the weed.
</P>
<P>
KARI released the first batch of beetles into the lake last
January. And about 60 million beetles, an acclaimed natural enemy
of the hyacinth, would be released in 150 stations on the Kenya
side of the lake.
</P>
<P>
In a research on the beetles carried out between 1994 and
1996, more than 100 Kenyan plant species were fed to them, but
they only ate the hyacinth.
</P>
<P>
The invasion of Lake Victoria by water hyacinth is a regional
problem which is affecting the three riparian countries of Kenya,
Uganda and Tanzania.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Federation Council (the
upper house of parliament) today approved an international
convention banning the development, production, stocking and use
of chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The vote by the council followed approval for the ban in the
State Duma (the lower house) on October 31.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov described the
approval as a decision made in keeping with Russia's interests.
</P>
<P>
Under Russian law, the draft approved by both houses of
parliament has now to get President Boris Yeltsin's signature
within five days to become law.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has already expressed support for the convention, now
signed by more than 160 countries.
</P>
<P>
Russia is the last of the five permanent members of the United
Nations Security Council to approve the ban, although it was among
the first to signal its approval in 1993 in Paris, France.
</P>
<P>
Signatories to the convention must destroy their chemical
weapons and production plants within 10 years, and provide
detailed information about the production and export of listed
chemicals which could be used to make such weapons.
</P>
<P>
They are also obliged to open their chemical plants to the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for routine
and short-notice inspections.

<HEADLINE> Broad Prospects for Sino-S. African Trade: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Trade and economic links
between China and South Africa will develop even more quickly
after the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two
countries by yearend, a Chinese official said today in Boksburg,
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade has seen rapid growth in recent years, with an
annual increase rate of 60 to 70 percent, said Shi Guangsheng,
deputy minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two sides in 1996 was more than 1.35 billion
U.S. dollars and could be expected to reach 1.5 billion dollars
this year, he said at the opening ceremony of a demonstration
village of Chinese low-cost light color steel houses.
</P>
<P>
If Hong Kong's trade with South Africa were included, China's
total trade volume with South Africa was more than 3 billion
dollars, he added.
</P>
<P>
Shi, who is leading a massive Chinese trade and economic
delegation, arrived in South Africa today for an 11-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The 100-strong delegation, made up of chief Chinese trade and
economic officials and representatives of some 50 leading Chinese
companies, is the biggest Chinese mission and most important one
ever sent to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is an important investment destination for China,
Shi said.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese commodities are wanted by South Africa and China,
in turn, is in need of South African products, such as minerals,
machinery, mining equipment, among others.
</P>
<P>
The visit of his delegation, which is aimed at enhancing
mutual understanding and exchange of views between the business
circles of the two countries, clearly showed that China attaches
importance to developing trade and economic relations, as well as
investment cooperation, with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Johannesburg Mayor Isaac Mogase, who visited the demonstration
village, told Shi that he warmly welcomed the Chinese delegation
and that he appreciated efforts to promote trade in the Gauteng
province, where Johannesburg is located.
</P>
<P>
South African people are grateful for China's long-standing
support during the anti-apartheid era, said the governor.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he is proud of South African President Nelson
Mandela's decision to establish diplomatic relations with China
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Housing is a problem facing all South African local
governments, Mogase said.
</P>
<P>
Millions of South Africans were unable to own their own homes
and the Chinese project is surely welcome, he said.
</P>
<P>
On display in the village are several light steel houses
designed by China's steel giant, Baosteel.
</P>
<P>
The houses, which are suitable for simple homes, schools,
clinics and hotels, could be erected in a matter of hours and do
not require digging foundations.
</P>
<P>
The houses has a duration of 50 years and no service is needed
in the first 15 years, Baosteel designers said.

masses and depend on them to further carry out the measures of
improving public security in a comprehensive way," senior official

WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Los Angeles, which staged
the 1984 Summer Olympics in 1984, launched a campaign to host the
2012 Games again.
</P>
<P>
"I do want to put in the record that we are going to do this the
way we did it in 1984," City Councilman Joel Wachs said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We should make sure our intention is it not only be run by a
private group, but that it be funded privately."
</P>
<P>
The 1984 Summer Olympics is marked as the most successful ever
because of huge profits from the sale of television rights and
corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Olympics in 1996 also gained huge profits, though
the Games were marred by poor transpotation and organisations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Olympic Committee is scheduled to meet with bidding
cities next week to review the application process.
</P>
<P>
Each bidding city must pay a dlrs 150,000 application fee.
</P>
<P>
Other U.S. cities competing for the 2012 games include Baltimore,
Cincinnati, Houston, New Orleans, New York, San Francisco, Seattle
and Washington, D.C.

<HEADLINE> China's Courts Enforce Maritime Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The handling of maritime cases
has become a key part of work in the people's courts, just as they
handle criminal, civil, economic and administrative cases, said Li
Guoguang, vice-president of the Supreme People's Court.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came at a news conference today to mark the fifth
anniversary of the promulgation of the Maritime Law of the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
China is a country with a large shipping business, which
transports 90 percent of its imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
Along with the country's reform, opening up and its fledgling
market economy, China takes an active part in the international
shipping market and has enacted a series of laws and regulations
concerning maritime business, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Maritime Law was passed in November of 1992, laying a solid
foundation for the trial of maritime cases, he said.
</P>
<P>
While strengthening legislation at home, China has signed
international conventions to safeguard shipping, the
vice-president said.
</P>
<P>
Because maritime cases often are complicated and involve
foreign parties, the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress authorized the Supreme People's Court in 1984 to open
special maritime courts in coastal cities.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, maritime courts have opened in nine
cities: Guangzhou, Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin, Wuhan, Dalian,
Haikou, Xiamen and Ningbo. Another maritime court will open soon
in Beihai, a city in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the maritime courts handled nearly 20,000
maritime cases from 1985 to June of 1997, an annual increase of 29
percent.
</P>
<P>
More than 17,000 of those cases were concluded involving 13
billion yuan (1.56 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
All the courts stick to the principle of just law enforcement
and treat Chinese and foreign litigants equally, Li said.

<HEADLINE> Advanced Hydrologic Survey, Information Transmission Means Applied to Mammoth Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 5 (Xinhua) -- Some of the
world's most sophisticated hydrologic survey and information
transmission means have come to the aid of the Three Gorges
project, the world's largest water control endeavor.
</P>
<P>
A surveying ship named after the Great Yu, the legendary hero
and flood fighter some four thousand years ago, particularly draws
people's attention. It has played a leading role in hydrological
survey since October 21, said Ji Xuewu, director of the
hydrological department under the Yangtze River Water Conservation
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The ship, anchored about 50 m from the gap of the cofferdam
upstream to be dammed, is able to receive precipitation forecasts
from Japanese, European and Chinese meteorological satellites,
said Ji.
</P>
<P>
A smaller unmanned survey ship is positioned at the center of
the gap where the two sections of cofferdam will joined up to
block the Yangtze river on November 8.
</P>
<P>
Survey results obtained by the smaller ship are transmitted to
the Great Yu, which will proceed to forward to an information
center onshore after preliminary processing. There the world's
most advanced acoustic Doppler instrument records the changes in
flow speed for three minutes.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 27 water level gauging stations, and 12 points at
flow rate and diversion channel sections to measure sand sediment
build-up have been set up around the gap to be blocked. And more
than 200 hydrologic technicians have been involved themselves in
the upcoming river daming process.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee
for the Red Cross (ICRC) has delivered the first emergency
assistance to flood victims in Somalia's southwestern regions of
Bay and Gedo.
</P>
<P>
More than six thousand blankets and an equal number of plastic
canvases and cooking utensils were distributed to thousands of
families displaced by the floods.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the distribution took place on Sunday and
Monday in villages surrounding the towns of Bardhere, Luq and
Qansahdhere where the flood has been serious.
</P>
<P>
The towns of Luq and Bardhere which are among the worst
affected areas had not yet received any relief assistance and
that both towns are running short of food since they are besieged
by water from rains and floods.
</P>
<P>
The assistance which was transported from Mogadishu by a large
convoy of heavy duty trucks passed through areas controlled by
the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) opposing Hussein Aidid's
faction.
</P>
<P>
According to ICRC workers here in the capital, the militia
commanders of both sides have accepted the safe passage of the
emergency aid convoy.
</P>
<P>
As the heaviest rains in 40 years continue to pour in southern
Somalia, the latest victims are reported from the districts of
Dinsor, Sakow and the village of Birbiriso where a total of 1,238
people have died in the past 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Elders of Sakow district said they have seen planes flying
over their towns, but no assistance has yet been delivered.
</P>
<P>
The rainy Deyr season which still continues has claimed the
lives of nearly hundred people and thousands of animals while
thousands of tons of crops were destroyed and dozens of villages
along the main Jubba River in Gedo, middle and lower Jubba
regions have been washed away.
</P>
<P>
An survey by the World Food Program in the past days estimated
that nearly a hundred thousand of Somalis are now at risk of
famine.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are reports of renewed fighting in the remote
western town of Huddor between the RRA and Hussein Aidid's
militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Ali Aden Qalinle, the RRA spokesman told reporters
that at least ten people were killed and 17 others were wounded
when his guerilla fighters infiltrated into the town last night.
</P>
<P>
Qalinle said his forces also wounded Colonel Abdi Warsame
Issaka, minister of Hussein Aidid who has been currently visiting
the region with a delegation from the Rahanwein elders.
</P>
<P>
However, there's no independent confirmation regarding the
scale of the fighting or the alleged wounds of the minister.

<HEADLINE> Explosives Used to Convert Rocky Hill Slopes to Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- People in southwest China's
mountainous areas suffer from poverty generation after generation
because the limestone plateaus in the areas are unsuitable for
growing crops.
</P>
<P>
But today, with the use of explosives, they are blasting the
rocks and building terraced farmland. The explosives were provided
by the Foundation for Underdeveloped Regions of China (FURC) to
combat hunger and poverty in an area of the world's largest
limestone formations.
</P>
<P>
You Hongbing, deputy secretary-general of the FURC, called the
method miraculous in alleviating poverty.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, You said an investment
of 12,000 yuan can turn one acre of rocky land into viable
farmland capable of feeding 30 people year after year.
</P>
<P>
FURC, a non-governmental organization, is also engaged in
poverty relief in northwest China, another concentration of the
poor.
</P>
<P>
You said that while poverty comes from land shortages in the
southwest, residents of the northwest suffer poverty because of
the dry weather and water shortages.
</P>
<P>
FURC's solution to northwestern China's poverty is build cement
water cellars in residents' yards. The cellars store rainwater
thats flows from slanting roofs and sloping yards. Water is
potable after a year's siltation.
</P>
<P>
This runoff is safe to drink because there is little pollution
in the villages of Gansu Province, an official said.
</P>
<P>
The organization, which was set up in 1989, has built 110 such
water cellars, each capable of containing 40 cubic meters of
water.
</P>
<P>
You said that the organization "helps out 60,000 to 70,000
people a year, only 1 percent of the number of people who shed
poverty under assistance of the government."
</P>
<P>
China's poverty line is 530 yuan per capita per annum, far less
than the standard set by the World Bank of 1 U.S. dollar (8.28
yuan Renminbi) per day per person.
</P>
<P>
"We could have done better had we received more donations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
More than 58 million people still do not have adequate food and
clothing in China, he said, and more than half of them live in the
country's northwestern and southwestern areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Ben Ben, a panda born in the
Beijing Zoo on July 24, is 100 days old today and very healthy,
said experts at the zoo.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ben's mother, Yong Yong, is the only wild panda in the
zoo. She has given birth to seven babies, six of whom
survived. When Ben Ben was born, Yong Yong was nearly 16 years old
and in ill health.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ben was not physically well-developed because of an
insufficient milk supply from Yong Yong, and this year's summer
was hotter than usual, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The baby panda was removed from its mother and raised by
experts at the zoo, who monitored it around the clock.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: G-15 Defines Position on Hot Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the group of 15
developing countries (G-15) today wrapped up their seventh summit
here, defining the grouping's position on a number of prevalent
hot issues.
</P>
<P>
The hot issues deliberated at the three-day summit include the
recent developments in the international financial and capital
markets, the impact of globalization on the future direction of
the world economy and the multilateral system of the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
On the first day of their meeting on November 3, the leaders
came out with a special statement on the prevailing currency
turmoil affecting most Southeast Asian economies including the
grouping's members -- Malaysia and Indonesia, showing their
concern and demonstrating their unity on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 called on the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank to intervene and regulate currency trading to make it
more open and transparent.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also directed their finance ministers and central
bank governors to meet here in December to draft rules and
regulations on currency trading to be submitted to the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), summit chairman and Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad told a joint news conference by
the leaders.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also decided to bring forward their annual summit
next year due to the urgency of the currency trading issue and
rapid changes in world trade, Mahathir said. Next year's summit
will be held in Cairo in May to be followed by another in Jamaica
in February, 1999. The annual summit is held traditionally at the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports described the joint call for regulating
currency trading as "timely" and as a reflection of concern voiced
by the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
On the impact of globalization, the G-15 defined its position
in a joint communique issued today at the end of the three-day
summit, saying many developing countries are at the forefront of
the liberalization process that underlies globalization and they
have contributed significantly to the growth of world output and
trade.
</P>
<P>
"Developing countries represent two thirds of humanity. They
have significant potential in production and purchasing which can
be a locomotive for global growth...Spurring economic growth in
developing countries is therefore in the interest of the global
economy as a whole," they said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they asked for greater access to developed
countries' markets, capital and technology and urged developed
countries to do more to create a supportive, fair and
non-discriminating international economic environment for
developing and least-developed countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
The G15, formed in 1989 as a counterbalance to the G-7
industrialized countries, pledged to pursue a more positive and
productive North-South dialogue, viewing direct, effective and
regular consultations between the developed and developing
countries including between the G-7 and the G-15 on global macro
economic policies as imperative for the sound management of the
globalization process and the fostering of beneficial
interdependence.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the multilateral system of the WTO, the grouping
recognized it as an important framework to facilitate
international trade, but said there was "an inherent imbalance in
this system" as not all countries had the equal capacity to
promote their trade and development interests and to safeguard
their rights.
</P>
<P>
It was decided that the G-15 economic ministers, who met for
the first time here before the summit, will reconvene prior to the
WTO meeting in Geneva next May to form common positions on issues
of concern to the grouping.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also rejected unilateral measures, particularly
those with extra territorial effects, calling on industrialized
countries to refrain from using protectionist measures to resolve
their unemployment problem and to fulfill their commitments to
raise official development assistance to at least 0.7 percent of
their gross national product to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, Kenya was accepted as the 16th member of the
grouping which comprises Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt,
India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru,
Senegal, Venezuela and Zimbabwe, spanning three continents --
Asia, Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir described the summit here as a "great success" because
of the important decisions made and the renewed commitment by the
member countries to the grouping.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges to Add Goalmouth Referees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Italy's football League is calling
to add two referees in a soccer game to watch the goalmouth.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, stirred by the Italian media, broke out following
Oliver Bierhoff's phantom 'goal' against Juventus on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Video footage showed the ball had crossed the line from
Udinese's German striker, just before Juventus defender Ciro
Ferrara cleared it off. But neither referee nor linesman were in a
position to see the incident.
</P>
<P>
The Gazzetta dello Sport called for two new officials for every
football match, one behind each goalmouth, to check whether the
ball crosses the line. The official could also monitor any
infringements -- such as the infamous case here last season of a
player who punched the ball Maradona-styled into the net without
the referee noticing.
</P>
<P>
"Other sports which have far less money, media attention and
mass popularity have more match officials," the paper pointed
out. "There are 12 in tennis, seven in volleyabll and five in
basketball and hockey.
</P>
<P>
"So why can't football introduce a 'goalmouth referee?"
</P>
<P>
The Gazzetta, Italy's biggest-selling newspaper, claimed on
Tuesday that the sport's ruling body, FIFA, is also considering
the idea of extra match officials -- along with a more
technology-based solution to the problem.

<HEADLINE> Dam Project Inspires Play About Three Gorges (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Days before the Yangtze River
is dammed near the Three Gorges, everything in connection with the
project is likely to arouse people's zeal, even a drama or an
exhibition of cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
The drama, "Ships Passing Three Gorges", took Chengdu audiences
by storm when it was staged in the course of the fifth National
Arts Festival in this capital of Sichuan Province. Some people
without admissions sought permission to stand in the rear of the
theater.
</P>
<P>
The drama was presented by the Sichuan People's Art Troupe. It
tells stories of people working on ships that navigate the
Yangtze, China's biggest waterway linking the southwestern and
eastern areas.
</P>
<P>
"It has a strong appeal to me, not only because of the touching
stories but also because I think it's a mirror of the amazing
Three Gorges culture," worker Chen Hongbo said after watching
Monday's full-house performance.
</P>
<P>
Chen's point of view was repeated by many people, including
playwright Li Ting.
</P>
<P>
"It is the vast dam project that has greatly inspired me to
write such a drama, because I know people will be very concerned
about it," she said.
</P>
<P>
The hours-long drama took the playwright several years to
accumulate true stories about the lives of boat people in the
gorges area.
</P>
<P>
Three Gorges is a joint section of picturesque Qutang, Xiling
and Wu gorges in the newly established Chongqing Municipality and
Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
However, the gorges have been honored by Sichuan people as a
symbol of this inland province for centuries.
</P>
<P>
The world's largest comprehensive project for purposes of power
generation, flood-control and navigation will bring a brand new
look to this area when finished in 2009.
</P>
<P>
"It will cause so many changes that nearly every people is
concerned about it," Li said. "Perhaps this is a reason why the
drama is so successful."
</P>
<P>
The drama has won the Wenhua Prize, the highest-honor given to
artists by China's cultural authority.

<P>
During the 12-day festival, scheduled to close today, a
Western-style opera, "The Goddess of The Gorges," also found favor
with audiences.
</P>
<P>
The opera, presented by the Chongqing Opera Troupe, tells of a
tragic love story between a female celestial being and a sailor
plying the waters of the gorges.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that people are interested in everything about Three
Gorges, even fairy tales," said a critic.
</P>
<P>
"Programs featuring the Three Gorges culture are a very
important component we hope to show audiences during the
festival," said an official with the organizing committee of the
event.
</P>
<P>
These activities also aim to raise people's awareness of
traditional culture's value and environmental issues in the gorges
area.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition focusing on protecting cultural relics in the
Three Gorges area has attracted tens of thousands of Chinese and
overseas viewers during the festival.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition displayed more the 160 relics, photographs and
documents.
</P>
<P>
"I do care about whether construction of the dam project will
destroy precious historic relics there," said project worker Chen
after visiting the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
But organizers said people like Chen needn't worry. "The
government will mobilize outstanding experts on relics protection
from the whole country to carry out the work on 1,200 places of
cultural relics in the Three Gorges area in the next 12 years," an
expert said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A three-member United Nations
team held talks with Iraqi government officials here today
to defuse the current crisis between Iraq and the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The team, headed by Lakhdar Al-Ibrahimi, an Algerian serving as
U.N. special envoy for Afghanistan, held talks with senior Iraqi
officials including Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz and some
other ministers. But details of the talk have yet to be disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Iraq last week decided to expel the U.S. weapons inspectors
working with the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) for eliminating
Iraqi mass destructive weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council warned Iraq of "serious consequences"
resulting from its decision, and the United States threatened to
use force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Iraq agreed to suspend its expulsion order and
called for dialogue with the U.N.. Encouraged by this, the U.N.
sent the team to Iraq to persuade Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
to cooperate with the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
On his arrival, Al-Ibrahimi said to the press that he was
carrying a message to the Iraqi government from U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan. But he did not disclose the contents of the
message.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraq barred the U.S. members of the UNSCOM from
entering Iraqi sites for a third straight day today, Iraq News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted an Iraqi official source as saying that
four UNSCOM arms inspection teams headed this morning for an
Iraqi site but they declined to do their duty after the American
members of the teams were not allowed to enter.
</P>
<P>
The source said that two other U.N. arms inspection teams also
decided not to carry out their mission for the same reason.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will become the
first city in the world to provide interactive television (ITV)
services, by which people can choose their favorite movies and
music, go shopping and conduct banking transactions all at home.
</P>
<P>
Hongkong Telecom, who was granted a licence to deliver

<HEADLINE> Two Agreements Signed Between HKSAR, Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) and Britain signed two agreements
here today, with one on the surrender of fugitive offenders and
the other on the transfer of sentenced persons.
</P>
<P>
The agreements, which are the first of their kind to be signed
by the HKSAR since its return to the motherland on July 1, were
signed by the HKSAR's Security Secretary, Peter Lai Hing-ling, on
behalf of the HKSAR Government, and Robert Cornish, British
Consul-General to Hong Kong, on behalf of the British Government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Lai said: "The signing of the
agreements not only signifies our commitment in fighting
international crime. More importantly, it demonstrates the
continuity of the rule of law in Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region."
</P>
<P>
"It serves as another vote of confidence in our law enforcement
bilateral programs, our criminal justice system and the future of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region as a whole," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Agreement on the Surrender of Fugitive Offenders sets out
the conditions for the surrender of fugitive offenders between the
two places, and contains the usual safeguards found in similar
international agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Agreement contains essential
safeguards which are normally found in agreements governing the
transfer of sentenced persons.
</P>
<P>
These two agreements will enter into force 30 days after both
sides notified each other in writing that their respective
requirements for the entry into force of the agreements have been
complied with.
</P>
<P>
During his earlier visit to London in October, the Chief
Executive of the HKSAR, Tung Chee Hwa, announced the HKSAR
Government was ready to sign these two agreements with the British
government under the authorization from the central government of
China.

<P>
HANOI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A tropical storm which hit
Vietnam's southern coast Sunday night killed more than 80 people,
and hundreds are reported missing.
</P>
<P>
The storm, described as the most severe in the past 100 years,
injured another 30 people. Authorities believe the death toll will
rise.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's forecasting bodies had barely warned southern coastal
provinces of a possible storm when it became imminent, making
efforts to recall fishing fleets futile, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Inland areas of the country also suffered great losses with
about 20,000 people made homeless when more than 1,000
thatch-roofed, wooden houses were destroyed or swept away by the
rising floods. The storm dissipated Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The last storm of such magnitude to hit the Mekong Delta was in
1904, the reports said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Macao is to train more local air
traffic controllers for the Macao International Airport as
business of the airport surges, a Macao aviation official said
today.
</P>
<P>
Jose Queiroz, chairman of the Macao Civil Aviation Authority,
told reporters at a seminar on air traffic control which began
here today that Macao wishes to replace all controllers by local
controllers on a short-term plan.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said that the first group of nine local air
traffic controllers have completed their eight-month training by
the Macao Airport Management Company (MAMC) and will start on-job
training to gain experiences "to become future supervisors and
managers."
</P>
<P>
The MAMC will start training of a second group of eight to
nine local controllers sometime so that the whole number of 20 or
so controllers will be replaced by local controllers in the
future.
</P>
<P>
The nine local controllers, all around 20 in their age, were
chosen from Macao universities and schools. They have received
training in English, aviation, telecommunications, navigation and
climate knowledge, among other courses. Their on-job training will
be on simulators using Portuguese technology, Queiroz said.
</P>
<P>
The Macao International Airport started commercial operation
in November 1995, and its business has been growing quite rapidly.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, the airport handled a total of
9,243 landings and take-offs, up about 4,000 from the same period
last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Number of jobless people in
Germany dropped to 4.29 million in October, down 17,800 from the
previous month.
</P>
<P>
The figure in western Germany decreased by 10,500 to 2.92
million, putting the unemployment rate at 9.5 percent, while in
eastern Germany, it was down 7,300 to 1.37 million, an
unemployment rate of 18.2 percent, the federal labor office in
Nuremberg said.
</P>
<P>
However, there were still 423,500 more people out of work
compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The decline of the unemployed number came after a fall of
64,000 in September.
</P>
<P>
The continued reduction was bolstered by a tentative recovery
in the labor market, and was also a result of continued economic
growth in Germany, said Bernhard Jagoda, head of the labor
office.

<HEADLINE> d p s 2298 China-Three Gorges-Design Hydro-engineering Expert on Super Design for Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 5 (Xinhua) -- The design
for the Three Gorges Project (TGP) has stood the test of the
reality, a project official announced today.
</P>
<P>
With the damming of the Three Gorges Project approaching, the
application of a series of key technologies involved in the
project best indicated that the project's designing has been
reliable, said Wang Jiazhu, a hydro-engineering expert and deputy
manager of the China Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
"Three Gorges Project calls for the application of unparalleled
complex technologies to the damming of Yangtze, construction of
two cofferdams, vertical excavation for construction of permanent
ship locks and an annual pouring intensity of 4 million cub m of
concrete work, as well as the concrete pouring for a 90-meter-high
dam during the dry season," explained Wang, who is in charge of
the technologies of the Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang said, the numerous technological problems have
been solved, "We are now fully confident with the successful
damming of the Yangtze, more than 60 percent of the excavation
work for building the permanent shiplocks has been completed, and
all technical difficulties concerning the building of cofferdams
and the concrete-pouring are also tackled," he added.
</P>
<P>
Experts of the management supervisor Yangtze River Water
Conservation Committee have kept a close look on the progress of
the project from the very beginning, together with a strict
self-supervision by the China Yangtze Three Gorges Project
Development Corporation, the TGP's proprietor.
</P>
<P>
Famous hydroelectric and dam engineering experts were also
invited from Canada, Brazil, the United States and Norway to act
as project consultants to help deal with technological
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, according to another project official, more
knotty technical problems will possibly crop up as the project
enters into the second stage construction following the damming of
Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
"And we will continue to invite the world's first-class water
conservation or hydro-electric experts from overseas to give field
guidance at the worksite," said the expert-turned official.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Says He Loses Hope Over Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said today that he has lost hope that the peace process will move
forward, but stopped short of determining Cairo's stance in the
Doha economic conference.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who is in Kuala Lumpur attending the G-15 summit
meeting, said in an interview with an Egyptian TV program this
morning that Egypt's position in regard to the controversial
Middle East and North Africa (MENA) economic conference would be
"left to the last minute."
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the current status of the Mideast peace
process, Mubarak told Good Morning Egypt: "frankly, I have no
hope."
</P>
<P>
He voiced frustration with the Israeli government under Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who he said, has failed to deliver
the promised implementation of previous signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
"Not even one clause of any of the signed agreements was put
into effect as I was promised," Mubarak said, adding that he has
lost hope that the peace process will move forward.
</P>
<P>
"I represent the people of Egypt and I cannot make a decision
that is against their will...any government cannot make decisions
that are against the will of its people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is not one nation that wants to send its leader to the
conference, and I think the Qatari people themselves are
dissatisfied with the situation," said the Egyptian leader.
</P>
<P>
Qatar insists on hosting the fourth MENA economic conference
despite the lack of progress in the Mideast peace process, a
precondition Egypt and the Arab League have hinged to their
attendance.
</P>
<P>
Most Arab countries have either flatly rejected or threatened
to boycott the gathering due to be held in the Qatari capital of
Doha on November 16-18.

<HEADLINE> German Court Rejects Compensation for Auschwitz Slave Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A German court today rejected the
payment of additional compensation to Jewish women who worked as
Nazi slave laborers in the notorious Auschwitz concentration camp,
in 1943-1945.
</P>
<P>
The women, many of them Israeli nationals, had demanded wages
compensation of 3.75 marks (2.17 U.S. dollars) an hour for their
forced labour of 12 hours a day, six days a week at the camp.
</P>
<P>
Bonn's state court rejected the demand, arguing that most of
the women, two of whom died during the five-year court case, had
already received an indemnity from the German government.
</P>
<P>
Only one of the 22 Jewish women had not received the
compensation, but she was granted 15,000 marks, plus four percent
interest dated from April 1992 when the case started.
</P>
<P>
From 1939 to 1945, about 12 million people were forced into
slave labor by Nazi Germany. About 30,000 of them are still alive.
</P>
<P>
Slave laborers were barred by the 1953 London Debt Agreement
from any individual claim against Bonn prior to a final World War
Two peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
The 1990 "Two plus Four Treaty" for German unification, which
was signed by two German states, Britain, France, the former
Soviet Union and the United States, is viewed by lawyers for the
slave laborers as the final peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has made clear its
intention to leave open the issue of Nazi slave laborers. But the
opposition Greens party strongly advocates passing a bill to
create a foundation to compensate the slave laborers.

<HEADLINE> Angola's Daily Oil Production to Reach Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Minister of Petroleum
Albino Assis said today that by early 21st century, Angola's
daily oil production will reach a million barrels from the
present 750,000 barrels.
</P>
<P>
Assis made the statement at a workshop on management of
petroleum resources.
</P>
<P>
The basis for achieving the goal, she said, is to increase
annual production by 10 percent. Therefore, the national
petroleum company must play a major role especially in tapping
onshore oil.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan oil department has made remarkable progress in
recent years, she noted, adding that great challenges facing the
country's oil industry include tapping, production, refining,
selling, environmental protection, regional cooperation,
technological renovation and personnel training.
</P>
<P>
The minister also announced that deep-sea oil exploitation
will soon start with the aid of advanced technology to reduce
costs and increase profits.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she said, Angola will build up a new refinery
factory in its central city of Lobito.
</P>
<P>
Angola has had a 90-year oil tapping history and 50 years of
oil-producing history. The minister believed that under the new
circumstances, Angola's oil industry will obtain more investment
to boost its development.

<HEADLINE> Econict Predicts Indonesia' Economic Recovery To </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Econit, an independent
economic think-tank, estimated that Indonesia' crisis-plagued
economy will take at least a year to recover despite the
International Monetary Fund (imf) bailout package.
</P>
<P>
Speaking here Tuesday at a seminar on "Economic Outlook 1998",
Econit Director Rizal Ramli expressed his optimism that the
Indonesian economy would begin to recover by the end of next year
if the government's reform measures ran as expected.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Indonesian government announced a three-year
reform package, including the measures to further trim its budget
spending, abolish monopolies in several food commodities and
liquidate insolvent banks.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia's sound economic fundamentals would help
speed up the recovery process.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia' economy is poised to slow down to 6.1 percent in
1997 and 5 percent in 1998 following the fiscal and monetary
contraction adopted by the government, he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's economic growth last year was at 7.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Rizal said the slowdown in economic growth would be caused by
lower private consumption growth, which had been the catalyst of
economic growth in the past.
</P>
<P>
Private consumption was estimated to plunge to 5.8 percent this
year from 12.2 percent last year. Next year, it was estimated to
drop to 3 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
A decline in foreign and local investment as an impact of the
credit crunch policy would also cause lower economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Construction, financial and manufacturing sectors would be
among the those hardest hit, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted inflation rate this year would increase to
about 11 percent from last year's 6.4 percent but would be lower
than 12 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The slowdown of economic growth, declining of consumer demand
and increasing socioeconomic gap are the costs that we have to
pay," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, measures by the government to provide more
incentives to boost export-oriented companies would boost the
country's foreign exchange receipts.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian rupiah's value has dropped by about 50 percent
against the U.S. dollar since the beginning of this year due to
speculation attacks in Southeast Asian region.
</P>
<P>
IMF announced on October 31 a 23 billion U.S. dollar
multilateral financial and technical package to Indonesia to help
cope with monetary crisis in the country.

<HEADLINE> Repeat and Correction: Curb of Non-Iodized Salt Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Sale of non-iodized salt is going
on unabated in many places of Bangladesh, and the knowledgeable
circles are calling for strict monitoring and enforcement of law
on the production and distribution of salt, a local newspaper
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The knowledgeable circles also called for extensive campaign to
create awareness among the public of the consumption of iodized
salt.
</P>
<P>
Though the Bangladeshi Parliament passed a legislation in 1989
in favor of universal iodization of salt and banned the
production, storage and sale of non-iodized salt, traders still
sell non-iodized salt to innocent people, especially in the rural
areas, the Bangladesh Observer said.
</P>
<P>
Lack of iodine has caused people to suffer from mental
retardation, physical subnormality, stunted growth, goiter,
still-birth and other physical problems, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
An National Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD) survey carried
out in Bangladesh in 1993 revealed almost 84 million people or 70
percent of the country's 120-million population are iodine
deficient while 56 million people or nearly 47 percent have
visible and palpable goiter.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that 600,000 people have neurological
deficiency syndromes, more than 250,000 people are mentally
impaired, 33,000 infants die in the first month of life and 41,000
still-birth occur every year.
</P>
<P>
Due to the absence of any check by the concerned authorities,
the rural markets of the country have been flooded with
non-iodized salt from bordering countries and most rural people
buy such smuggled salt because it is cheap, the newspaper stated.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh now has 280 salt crushing industries, of which 265
are equipped with iodization plants supported by the United
Nations and the government, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates, Bangladesh needs 600,000 tons of salt
annually. The government has set a target to eliminate iodine
deficiency disorders from the country by 2000.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Call on Govt to Quit C'Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's continued membership
of the Commonwealth attracted demonstrations on Tuesday in
several states of the country with participants calling for the
federal government to pull Nigeria out of the 54-nation body.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators are mainly politicians, students and
businessmen, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
They staged protest walks in front of the British High
Commission in the capital Abuja and the offices of state
administrators where they were given audience by the
administrators who also spoke in support of their demand.
</P>
<P>
In Abuja, demonstrators handed over a letter of protest to an
embassy representative for onward transmission to the head of the
Commonwealth Queen Elizabeth II and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair.
</P>
<P>
The letter accused Britain of double-standard against Nigeria
and condemned what it called the "obvious meddle-someness of the
Commonwealth in a matter that is clearly the internal affairs of
Nigeria".
</P>
<P>
"We are fully aware that the continued suspension of Nigeria
was sponsored on a clearly misinformed platform by Britain and
her triple satellite stooges of Austria, New Zealand and Canada,"
said Maitama Bello-Yuruf, national vice-chairman of the
Democratic Party of Nigeria, who read the letter.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators reminded Britain that the days of
colonization and imperialism were gone, as Nigeria is no longer
under the shackles of British domination.
</P>
<P>
They also handed over a letter to the head of state General
Sani Abacha, urging Nigeria to withdraw from the Commonwealth as
"there is no more relevance" for Nigeria's continued membership
of the association.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Commonwealth membership was suspended in November
1995 following the execution of nine minority activists on
charges of murder.
</P>
<P>
At the just-concluded summit, the Commonwealth decided to
extend the suspension for another year and warned against new
sanctions if there is no progress in Nigeria's transition to
civil rule program scheduled to end in October next year.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has said it would carefully study the communique of
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
As official response is yet to be made, Tuesday's protest
march, which coincided with Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings'
visit to brief Abacha on the decision taken at the Commonwealth
summit, is seen by observers as part of an elaborate preparation
for Nigeria's withdrawal from the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
The words of Col. Ahmed Usman, the administrator of west
Nigeria's Oyo state, might serve as a clear indication to the
official support for the anti-Commonwealth protests.
</P>
<P>
Receiving a group of some 5,000 protesters, Usman said Nigeria
was currently reviewing her membership of the Commonwealth
preparatory to her pulling out of the organization.
</P>
<P>
"The continued membership of the Commonwealth has only
succeeded in making Africans victims of imperialism and Nigeria
cannot continue to be their political, economic and social
slaves," he added.
</P>
<P>
In another such demonstration in Kano state, north Nigeria,
some of the protesters carried placards with inscriptions such as
"To Hell With You USA", "We Want Abacha Back in 1998", "Peace Is
Wealth", "No Foreign Meddlers", "Nigeria Should Pull Out of
Commonwealth", etc.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were made up of traders, members of the Kano
State branch of the Youth Earnestly Ask for Abacha, women,
self-help groups and political activists.
</P>
<P>
Such demonstrations also took place in Enugu, Port Harcourt,
Katsina and Kaduna states.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, four were killed in Kaduna and 18
seriously injured in Oyo in separate motor accidents during the
demonstration.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Hurts in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Of Nigeria's more than 100
million population, half of them suffer at least one episode of
malaria attack in a year, the Nigerian Tribune reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Ibrahima Fall, the UNICEF (United Nations
Children's Fund) representative to Nigeria, as saying on Tuesday
in Lagos that about 60 million Nigerians suffer from malaria
attacks annually.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national symposium on malaria, the official
disclosed that malaria accounts for 20 to 30 percent of under
five deaths across the country.
</P>
<P>
Going by the 1997 Harare declaration on malaria, Fall said the
UNICEF is putting together resources at its disposal to support
the global target of a 20 percent cut in malaria deaths by the
year 2000 in at least 75 percent of affected countries.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the World Health Organization at the symposium
predicted that the negative economic impact of malaria in Africa
would have risen to 3,600 million U.S. Dollars by the year 2000,
from the present 1,800 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted that 70 to 80 percent of malaria cases
receive generally inappropriate treatment outside of medical
services like traditional medicine or unsupervised self
medication.

<HEADLINE> IMF Supports Creation of Asian Funding Cooperative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has expressed support for the establishment of a regional
surveillance group to meet regularly on the current currency
crisis in Asia, the Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
IMF First Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer said in his
letter to Philippine Finance Secretary Roberto De Ocampo which was
released today that the IMF is preparing to send him a proposal on
how to proceed with the regional economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Although the letter did not specifically mentioned that the IMF
is supporting the proposed creation of a "Asian Fund" designed to
help Asian nations cope with the current currency crisis, finance
officials are saying that this is leading to it, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the IMF is finalizing the proposal which will
include extensive consultations to make sure that the regional
initiative effectively meets the broad consensus required for the
establishment of a funding cooperative that is expected to benefit
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the consensus will include among others the
setting up in principles of a regional surveillance group to be
managed by the IMF Tokyo office to serve as the group's
secretariat.
</P>
<P>
But Fischer made it clear that the IMF and other multilateral
agencies are able to finance a country's adjustment program.
</P>
<P>
"However, from time to time a large-scale crisis could develop
that would require supplemental funding," he admitted.
</P>
<P>
Deputy finance ministers from the Asia-Pacific region will
gather here on November 18 to 19 to discuss the creation of the
Asian Fund to cope with the effects of the financial crisis in the
future by providing the affected countries with emergency funds.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Southeast Asian countries proposed creation of the
fund during September's conference of the IMF and the World Bank
in Hong Kong, but the IMF warned earlier the projected fund could
undercut its economic assistance to these countries.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Starts Promotion in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The "Switzerland Greets Hong
Kong" promotion started here today, giving local citizens "a great
opportunity to experience the feeling of Switzerland first hand."
</P>
<P>
Piazza Two of the Times Square here was transformed into a
world of snow, mountains and chalets with a fabulous "Snow in Hong
Kong" pavilion this morning. Featuring real snow, this alpine
entertainment pavilion has an exciting snow slide as well as snow
board simulator, downhill ski simulator and slalom ski simulator.
</P>
<P>
According to an organizer of the event, heaps of snow are
brought in daily so that everyone has a chance to walk, touch and
play with real snow. In other words, visitors can try the slide
and simulators, if they prefer.
</P>
<P>
"With the climate in Hong Kong it never snows, so we thought it
would be a novel idea to bring one of our country's most features
to the Hong Kong people. And it gives them a great opportunity to
experience the feeling of Switzerland first hand," said Rolf
Bodernmuller, consul-general of Switzerland to the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China.
</P>
<P>
A highlight of the launch today was the presence of Canto-pop
star Amanda Lee, who arrived in spectacular style, being swept
across the Times Square on a rickshaw escorted by four snowmen.
She then joined Bodernmuller and SAR Secretary for Broadcasting,
Culture and Sport Brian Chau in breaking down a wall of ice to
reveal the entertainment pavilion.
</P>
<P>
"The Snow in Hong Kong" pavilion is one of the key events in
the "Switzerland Greets Hong Kong" promotion, which include a
prestigious economic forum scheduled for November 13, with
participation of a number of Swiss government and business
figures, a watch exhibition, an art exhibition, music recitals and
gastronomic promotions in several leading hotels here.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held here a few days earlier, the Swiss
consul-general said: "Firstly, we would like to bring Switzerland
and its many faces nearer to the Hong Kong people."
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, we would like to demonstrate to Hong Kong that
Switzerland is an ideal place for a vacation, that we offer a wide
range of excellent consumer goods and that Switzerland is a good
place to do business with. And thirdly, we would like to
demonstrate by our presence here that the Swiss Government and the
Swiss Business Community believe strongly in a prosperous future
for Hong Kong," he added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Withdrawal from S. Leone Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Many Sierra Leoneans today
expressed concern over military ruler Major Paul Koroma's call
for the "immediate withdrawal" of Nigerian troops in the west
African peace-keeping force ECOMOG in his country.
</P>
<P>
"Nigerian soldiers are the initiators of the recent unprovoked
aggression against my country and they must leave immediately if
the six month plan (for the military to hand over to the civilian
government) is to be given any chance to succeed," he said in a
radio and TV broadcast on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Koroma also expressed "strong reservations" about an ECOMOG
group which is to supervise the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said, "such a group should not include any Nigerian soldier
or officer or be spearheaded by Nigeria, and any attempt to force
this will torpedo the six month plan."
</P>
<P>
The broadcast has evoked mixed feelings among many residents
who feel that the peace agreement is now facing its biggest
crisis since it was signed in Guinea nearly three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
According to a former Sierra Leone diplomat, "it is not
possible to talk of ECOMOG without Nigeria and Koroma would have
to live with this. He should remember that who pays the piper
should call the tune."
</P>
<P>
A university lecturer of political science noted that
"although Koroma's contentions are legitimate, it is the timing
that is wrong. He should have raised these either on the return
of the (Sierra Leone) delegation from Guinea or during the
expected visit of the field commander of ECOMOG, General Victor
Malu. To raise them now gives the impression that he wants to
backslide."
</P>
<P>
Koroma's condemnation of the Nigerians came at the wake of a
joint meeting between senior officers of the Sierra Leone army
and Nigerian officers in the ECOMOG group based in Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Curb of Non-Iodized Salt Sale Urged in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Sale of non-iodized salt is
going on unabated in many places of Bangladesh, and the
knowledgeable circles are calling for strict monitoring and
enforcement of law on the production and distribution of salt, a
local newspaper reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The knowledgeable circles also called for extensive campaign to
create awareness among the public of the consumption of iodized
salt.
</P>
<P>
Though the Bangladeshi Parliament passed a legislation in 1989
in favor of universal iodization of salt and banned the
production, storage and sale of non-iodized salt, traders still
sell non-iodized salt to innocent people, especially in the rural
areas, the Bangladesh Observer said.
</P>
<P>
Lack of iodine has caused people to suffer from mental
retardation, physical subnormality, stunted growth, goiter,
still-birth and other physical problems, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
An National Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD) survey carried
out in Bangladesh in 1993 revealed almost 84 million people or 70
percent of the country's 120-million population are iodine
deficient while 56 million people or nearly 47 percent have
visible and palpable goiter.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that 600,000 people have neurological
deficiency syndromes, more than 250,000 people are mentally
impaired, 33,000 infants die in the first month of life and 41,000
still-birth occur every year.
</P>
<P>
Due to the absence of any check by the concerned authorities,
the rural markets of the country have been flooded with
non-iodized salt from bordering countries and most rural people
buy such smuggled salt because it is cheap, the newspaper stated.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh now has 280 salt crushing industries, of which 265
are equipped with iodization plants supported by the United
Nations and the government, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates, Bangladesh needs 600,000 tons of salt
annually. The government has set a target to eliminate iodine
deficiency disorders from the country by 2000.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Denies Opposing Landmine Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has denied media
reports that it opposes a global ban on landmines, saying it
wound sign an international landmine ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Mail today quoted a spokesman from the Foreign
Ministry as saying that Cyprus would be among the 100 or so
countries expected to sign the Ottawa Treaty in Canada next
month.
</P>
<P>
Media reports claimed that six Commonwealth nations, including
Cyprus, opposed the global ban on landmine. The others were
Singapore, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
"We are not opposed to a global ban on landmines," the
spokesman said, "on the contrary, we will be represented in
Ottawa in December and will support the Treaty, which we are in
favour of."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman failed to say, however, whether signing up to
the treaty would mean the Cypriot Defense Ministry and National
Guard would undertake to remove the thousands of landmines still
littering areas of the 180-kilometer-long U.N.-controlled buffer
zone dividing the island.
</P>
<P>
"We are not sure yet on the practicalities of the treaty, but
we are willing to accept its provisions," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to official U.N. reports, there are 39 minefields
and booby-trapped areas inside the buffer zone. It is believed
that there are a total of 17,000 mines in these areas.
</P>
<P>
These landmines have been laid since 1974 when the island was
divided after Turkish troops invaded and took over the northern
third following a short-lived Greek Cypriot coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has repeatedly asked both the Greek and Turkish
Cypriot sides to dispose of the landmines, but so far without
success.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM to Visit Gulf States for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi will start a trip next week to the Persian Gulf states on
a confidence-building mission.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily "Iran News" today quoted reliable
sources as saying Kharrazi's regional visit would be another step
toward unity in the region, adding that Kharrazi would carry
messages of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami to the leaders of
the Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
The trip by the foreign minister is seen as important on the
eve of the 8th summit of the Organization of Islamic Conference
(OIC) scheduled to be held here in December.
</P>
<P>
Local observers noted that Kharrazi's tour to the region was
aimed at encouraging Gulf leaders to attend the OIC summit and
reiterating Iran's foreign policies particularly over issues of
the region.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and most of the Gulf Arab states cooled
down after the Islamic Revolution in 1979 and some Arab countries
regard Iran as a threat to the regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Iran also has territorial disputes with its Arab neighbors
over some islands in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
"If we overcome the differences between Iran and the Arab
countries and also among the Arabs themselves, the OIC summit
will usher in harmony, confidence and peace," Iran News quoted an
analyst as saying.
</P>
<P>
"What we need is a common perception among us, if we succeed we
will leave no room for the discord among us," the source added.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian new government has repeatedly announced that it
would seek close friendly relations and cooperation with Iran's
neighbors, particularly the Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister for Educational Affairs Gholamali
Khoshrou also reiterated in Abu Dhabi Tuesday that his country
would give top priority to ties with Arab world, the Persian
Gulf states in particular.
</P>
<P>
Attending the Conference on the Future of the Arab World,
Khoshrou told the official news agency IRNA that through
cementing cooperation and consolidating friendship with regional
countries, Iran could not only block the way to the
penetration and presence of aliens but also help expansion of
cultural and economic cooperation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Holding a bright prospect for Iran's cooperation with
regional countries, he said Iran can serve as a bridge between
its neighbors in the north and the Arab countries in the
south.
</P>
<P>
Khoshrou also voiced Iran's willingness to hold dialog with
Arab intellectuals, saying that continued debates will help remove
misunderstandings and also strengthen unity, solidarity and power
of the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
The Conference on the Future of the Arab World convened
in Abu Dhabi Sunday with participation of 250 political and
cultural personalities of the Arab world and a number of other
countries.

<HEADLINE> EU's Half-Year Trade Surplus Hits 17.3 Billion ECUs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union registered
a dynamic trade growth in the first half of this year, resulting
in a surplus of 17.3 billion ECUs (19.8 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The figure for the same period last year was 10 billion ECUs,
according to the European Report issued today.
</P>
<P>
The growth was mainly boosted by extra-European Union exports
and imports that increased by 12.2 percent and 10.2 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
EU's exports totaled 336 billion ECUs (384 billion dollars)
while imports grew slightly to reach 318.7 billion ECUs (365
billion dollars) in the six months.
</P>
<P>
Though Britain posted the largest increase of 28 percent in
extra-EU exports, Germany reaped the biggest trade surplus worth
16.9 billion ECUs (19.3 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands, however, suffered the biggest trade deficit of
13.3 billion ECUs (15.2 billion dollars) in the 15-nation union.
</P>
<P>
Single market trade totaled 565.7 billion ECUs (647.9 billion
dollars) in the first six months, accounting for 63 percent of
the EU member states' gross trade value.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
weaker today as the markets were waiting for a statement on
monetary policy by the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia
(RBA) due tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 70.65 U.S. cents, from 70.94
cents previously.
</P>
<P>
During the session it had faded to a low of 70.05 U.S. cents
before moving higher, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Macquarie Bank foreign exchange manager Mark O'Leary said the
local unit had reached up on buying by exporters and U.S.
investment institutions.
</P>
<P>
"Early this morning we got sold down to 70.05 U.S. cents, but
since then we've seen some buying by American names and that has
taken us to a high of 70.68," he said.
</P>
<P>
O'Leary said markets were cautious ahead of tomorrow's key
events.
</P>
<P>
RBA Governor Ian Macfarlane will present tomorrow his
semi-annual statement on monetary policy to federal parliamentary
committee in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Market participants will be trawling the contents for any clues
on the central bank's thinking on monetary policy and keeping an
eye on his outlook for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The RBA has cut the official cash rate five times since
mid-1996 and recently analysts have been debating whether there
might be room for a sixth cut by the end of 1997 or in the first
quarter of 1998. The cash rate currently stands at 5.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
Against the yen, the local unit ended at 86.26, from 86.35
previously, and at 1.2183 from 1.2265 against mark.

ANKARA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- One foreign passenger and four
Turkish policemen were wounded today in armed attacks staged by
a Turkish gunman in Western Turkey, according to the
semi-official Anatolian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that 37-year-old Gunman Ali Buyuk got on a
passenger bus in Tosya town of Kastamonu province near the Black
Sea and opened fire at a Georgian national named Levan Arkayidibe
with a hunting rifle in Kocaeli province near Istanbul early this
morning. Arkayidibe got injuries in the arm and in the foot.
</P>
<P>
After the gunman got off the bus which was on its way from
Tiflis, capital of Georgia, to Istanbul, the largest city of
Turkey, policemen tried to stop him.
</P>
<P>
However, the attacker immediately opened fire at the
policemen, wounding four of them, including a section director of
the Kocaeli Security Directorate. During the armed clash, the
policemen shot dead the gunman.
</P>
<P>
The director and another policeman, who were in serious
conditions, were taken to Florence Nightingale Hospital for
treatment and the Georgian passenger and other two policemen
have been hospitalized in Kocaeli province.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Life-long Commitment of a Woman (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 5 (Xinhua) -- Although Chen
Xiaolin is often admired and eyed with curiosity by her new
acquaintances, she is far too busy to notice it, let alone enjoy
it.
</P>
<P>
For outsiders, it is hard to imagine that the soft-spoken old
lady is one of those who took the command and directs the work of
construction at China's largest civil engineering project since
the Great Wall built some 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
This only woman deputy director of the Three Gorges Project of the
Gezhouba Group has devoted all her life and energy to the cause of
taming the turbulent and mighty Yangtze river, the largest in
China and third largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Since her graduation from college in 1959, Chen has made it her
life-long career to build dams on the Yangtze and its tributaries,
including the Gezhou Dam just 38 km downstream the Three Gorges
site.
</P>
<P>
"Building a facility to keep a tight rein on floods in the
middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze is the long-aspired dream
of several generations of Chinese, especially dam builders,"said
Chen. "I am truly feel honored to participate in such a great
project."
</P>
<P>
The project, expected to cost about 25 billion US dollars, won
approval from the National People's Congress, China's parliament,
on April 3, 1992, and its first-phase construction started in
December 1993.
</P>
<P>
For the 60-year-old Chen, the Three Gorges -- the fifth major
water conservation program she has been involved, poses a
"brand-new challenge" for her and her colleagues though the Gezhou
Dam group where she works has already built a major dam on the
Yangtze mainstream.
</P>
<P>
"With a 185-m tall dam and a reservoir with a capacity of
39.3-billion-cu-m, the Three Gorges project ranks on a higher
level than the Gezhouba Dam in terms of both scale and technical
complexity," Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
When the Gezhouba Dam has a water head of 27 m, that of
the Three Gorges Dam will reach 170 m, "which has been almost
unheard of even elsewhere in the world," according Chen.
</P>
<P>
Ever since construction of the project was launched in late
1993, her figure with a safety helmet on her head has become an
integral part of the worksite, her short figure in sharp contrast
to a line of colossal Caterpilla dump trucks and bulldozers
shuttling around the site.
</P>
<P>
Chen spent a long and worrisome day on October 26, when the gap
between the two sections of the upstream cofferdam was narrowed
from 130 m down to 40 m, which was the most difficult and arduous
stage before the Yangtze is blocked by the joined-up cofferdam.

<P>
Workers began to throw gravels and stones into the turbulent
waters at eight a.m. Two hours later, the flow passing through the
narrowed gap became so swift that rocks weighing about one ton
each were flushed away soon after they were dumped into the water.
</P>
<P>
Then, she consulted Huang Huaping, deputy chief of the
headquaters at the worksite, and her other colleagues, and worked
out emergency measures to overcome difficulties created by swift
current. After 14 hours of intensive rock-filling, the gap began
to close again by two a.m. and was narrowed down to 40 m on seven
a.m. the next morning.
</P>
<P>
"Only then did the stone in my heart finally drop," and she
finally found herself so tired after 23 hours of intense working.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xiaolin braves challenges. Known for her competence and
dedication, she has always taken her career as the most important
part of her life.
</P>
<P>
Yet, she clearly knows that for a woman to have a successful
career, she has to pay an even higher price than a man, as she has
overcome her in-born disadvantage in physical strength.
</P>
<P>
Huang Huaping, who is Chen's mentor, said, "she will never let
anyone, anything beat her. And her careful and meticulous style of
work makes her an invaluable part of the team."
</P>
<P>
In Huang's opinion, Chen's experiences epitomize the dedication
and sense of mission of the Chinese water conservation workers.
For generations, they have made many sacrifices and are working
under the most adverse natural conditions for the benefit of all
people.
</P>
<P>
However, as a wife and mother, Chen feels much indebted to her
husband and children. During the four past decades when she has
spent most of her time, in summer heat or winter cold, at
worksites along the Yangtze and its tributaries. And it is her
husband, a water conservation researcher, who took all
responsibilities at home.
</P>
<P>
"When I was about to have my first baby, I was still on the
worksite, and my family and friends worried a lot," Chen recalled.
After her two children were born, they had little time with their
mommy, and her son was brought up by his elder sister, who is five
years his senior.
</P>
<P>
"My children used to complain about me," said Chen, her face
softened and saddened, betraying her affection and tenderness
toward them.
</P>
<P>
For all this, she treasures all the more the unfailing love and
support of her family over decades. At present, as the mammoth
Three Gorges project which still has 12 years to be build, such
support will be the greatest source of strength for the
extraordinary woman.

JERUSALEM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Israel's state revenues
from taxes and other fees totaled 89.9 billion shekels (about
25.7 billion U.S. dollars) during the first 10 months of the
year, a 2 percent increase over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Local English newspaper The Jerusalem Post today quoted an
Israeli Treasury announcement as saying that Israeli Income Tax
and Purchase Tax Department collected 49.7 billion shekels (14.7
billion dollars) until October, a 4.7 percent increase over last
year.
</P>
<P>
Income tax receipts were up 10 percent due a 23 percent
decline in income tax refunds. However, revenue from purchase tax
was down 22 percent, which the Treasury attributed to a dwindling
real estate market.
</P>
<P>
There was a one percent decline in Customs and VAT
(Value-Added Tax) Department income and an 8 percent fall in
customs duty receipts, said the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
Domestic non-VAT taxes collected by the department increased
9 percent, mainly because of increased taxation on fuel and
tobacco.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Airline Complains Over Israel's Aviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Royal Jordanian Airlines has
issued a complaint to Israeli Civil Aviation Administration over
the limitation on the number of passengers the airline carry from
and to Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post daily today quoted Shaweki Abu-Ghazaleh, the
area manager for Royal Jordanian, as saying that according to the
aviation accord between Israel and Jordan signed early last year,
the limit of 450 passengers per week was only valid for six months
before a further review.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, a year and a half have passed and the
limitation is still in force. He said that the Tel Aviv-Amman
route has a 70 percent occupancy rate, meaning the airline
occasionally has had to turn away large groups that wanted to
visit Jordan.
</P>
<P>
What this meant, he said, is that the tourism ministers of the
two countries try to encourage joint tourism, while Israeli
Transport Ministry discourages it.
</P>
<P>
He added that while Jordanians who want to take advantage of
Israeli Airlines El Al's low fares to New York face no barriers,
Israeli who want to enjoy Royal Jordanian's cheap fares to the
Far East, are sometimes deterred by the limit.
</P>
<P>
Moshe Hananel, Royal Jordanian's representative in Israel, said
the airline has appealed several times to the Civil Aviation
Administration to no avail.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli Transport Ministry spokesman Avner On
said Israel is examining the Jordanian request. However, he
added, since the Royal Jordanian flights are not filled to
capacity, the situation would not appear to warrant a change.

<HEADLINE> Australia Finds Backpackers Most Valued Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- International backpackers and
not camera-laden Japanese tourists were Australia's most valued
visitors, Australian Tourism Minister Andrew Thomson told a
conference in Sydney today.
</P>
<P>
Backpackers spent more, stayed longer, traveled more widely and
created more jobs than any other tourists, the minister told the
Australian Backpacker Industry Conference being held here.
</P>
<P>
"International backpackers are widely known for their careful
management of travel budgets, preferring lower-cost accommodation,
activities, entertainment and transport," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But their casual approach belies the fact that they are our
biggest spending visitors," Thomson said.
</P>
<P>
He said while they made up only 6 percent of international
travelers, backpackers accounted for almost 14 percent of direct
visitor expenditure.
</P>
<P>
"They spent an average 83 nights in Australia compared with the
overall average of 23 nights," he said.
</P>
<P>
Launching a report of the Bureau of Tourism Research With My
Swag Upon My Shoulder, Thomson said backpackers earned an average
of about 573 U.S. dollars during their stays, but the average
amount they spent exceeded 3,150 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The results of the report proved marketing campaigns should be
directed to the backpacker market, particularly in the United
Kingdom, which makes up 20 per cent of the group, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although numbers from Asia might drop off slightly as a result
of recent stock market volatility in the region, it was important
to note that they still represented 60 percent of all tourists, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The report, based on Australia-wide face-to-face interviews
with 1,136 backpackers in airport departure lounges, found 248,000
backpackers spent more than 700 million U.S. dollars in Australia
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Two thirds of them visited two-and-half times more of the
country than regular tourists did.

<HEADLINE> NZ PM-Designate Meets Coalition Party Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand National Party
new leader Jenny Shipley, who is set to replace Prime Minister Jim
Bolger, met New Zealand First party leader Winston Peters for the
first time this evening after Tuesday's leadership change in the
National Party.
</P>
<P>
However, both leaders made no comment after their meeting.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that the meeting was about New Zealand First's
stand toward the coalition after the leadership change in the
National Party, which is now in coalition with New Zealand First.
</P>
<P>
Shipley, minister of state owned enterprises, was Tuesday
confirmed to be the new leader of National Party to replace Jim
Bolger, who was forced to announce his resignation Monday evening
after Shipley told him at a National Caucus meeting that she had
enough support from National Party MPs to challenge his
leadership.
</P>
<P>
Peters, now Deputy Prime Minister, expressed his anger Tuesday
over that New Zealand First was not told earlier about the
probable change in the coalition leadership.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Reuters Financial Television before this
evening's meeting, Shipley had signaled that National Party had
other options than to remain in coalition with NZ First, TVNZ
reported.
</P>
<P>
She issued a veiled threat to Peters, who is now withholding
support for her, that she may take National Party into a minority
government with the support from small parties such as the ACT
party.
</P>
<P>
But she made it clear that her first option would be to hold
firm with New Zealand First.
</P>
<P>
There is speculation that Peters is likely to stay within the
coalition under the leadership of Shipley.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Decides to Stick to Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The opposition National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) has decided to
continue sticking to the peace process under way in Angola, said
a UNITA official on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Isaias Samakuva, head of the UNITA team in the Joint
Commission of Angolan Peace Process, told reporters here that at
a four-day meeting of the UNITA Political Commission held in
Andulo, central Angola, the participants held a heated debate on
U.N. sanctions against UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Although they described the U.N. sanctions as "unfair,
untimely and even senseless", the UNITA Political Commission
still decided to stick to the peace process in accordance with
the 1994 Lusaka accord that ended the two decades of civil war in
Angola, Samakuva noted.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on October 29 passed a resolution of
sanctions on UNITA which include the close-up of UNITA offices in
foreign countries and a ban on UNITA leaders' foreign visits.
</P>
<P>
It frowned on the slow movement of UNITA in implementing the
accord.

<HEADLINE> Traditional Chinese Opera Welcomed at Art Festival (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Audiences attending recent
performances of the Sichuan Opera entitled "Mask" offered
resounding applause as an actor wearing an ancient costume changed
masks six times while moving across the stage.
</P>
<P>
The opera has been performed during the 5th China Arts Festival
in Chengdu, southwest China's Sichuan Province. The festival is
scheduled to end this evening.
</P>
<P>
The festival, which opened on October 25, has featured 23
classical operas staged by various local opera troupes. Related
performances accounted for over half of all plays and operas
staged during the festival.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that the response of audiences serves as a true
indication that the art of traditional Chinese opera, which has a
history of over 2,000 years, has regained its audience appeal.
</P>
<P>
Performances of traditional Chinese opera now feature the use
of caption boards, microphones, laser lighting and western
percussion instruments.
</P>
<P>
Costumes and stage props have also been improved and operas
feature more dialog.
</P>
<P>
Ying Ruocheng, a famous Chinese artist, said that the reform
of traditional Chinese opera should give attention to introducing
advanced aspects of foreign art, a necessary factor in promoting
any national culture.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 genres of opera and classical performances
prospered in China in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
However, traditional Chinese opera has faced great challenges
from rapid economic growth since the late 1980s. Economic growth
has, in fact, offered people more cultural opportunities,
including motion pictures and television, as well as song and
dance halls.

<TEXT>
<P>
Yao Xin, deputy director of the Arts Bureau under the Chinese
Ministry of Culture said that traditional opera has encountered a
number of problems resulting from the influence of the
market-oriented economy. A number of opera troupes formerly funded
by local governments are facing disbandment due to a lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
"However, various opera genres themselves must be improved to
win audience support," according to Chen Ziqian, director of the
Literature Institute under the Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that story lines of traditional local operas develop
slowly and audiences in other areas have difficulty understanding
local dialects.
</P>
<P>
Traditional Chinese operas formerly paid little attention to
lighting and sound effects, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that local operas have a large audience in China's
vast rural areas, and they express the confidence that the
excellent national culture will retain its charm.
</P>
<P>
Chinese governments at various levels have adopted a series of
policies and allocated funds to reactivate and support opera
troupes.
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of opera troupes have reformed their
personnel administration and financial policies in line with
requirements of the market-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
Most traditional operas portray stories of emperors and senior
military officials, gifted scholars and beautiful ladies, with
most portrayals far removed from the daily lives of ordinary
people.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that local operas must add realism by introducing
modern subjects related to the lives of ordinary people.

<HEADLINE> Major Progress Reported in S. African-EU Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Major progress has been
made in the negotiations between South Africa and the European
Union (EU) on a comprehensive future trade and development
agreement, South African media reported today.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy to report that we have made significant progress,"
EU chief negotiator Phillipe Soubestre told reporters Tuesday at
the conclusion of the latest round of talks in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
"This is indeed a turning point on the road to a comprehensive
trade agreement between south Africa and the EU."
</P>
<P>
South African negotiator Bahle Sibisi also said: "We see this
as the beginning of an end. We have been able to reach a new
level of discussion, and we are now at the level of detail."
</P>
<P>
Both parties envisaged a final agreement by the middle of next
year.
</P>
<P>
Initiated in 1994, the talks resumed Monday with both sides
for the first time tabling detailed lists of products on which
tariff reductions are to be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
Soubestre said South Africa had put forward significant
proposals, which he said were the first detailed offer tabled by
the country.
</P>
<P>
"So I think the conditions are right on both sides to proceed
now with detailed discussions. We will look product-by-product at
the proposals of both sides."
</P>
<P>
Sibisi said the tariffs of each product had now been listed,
and the two sides were working toward exactly how those tariffs
were to be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has called for a 12-year transition for a free
trade agreement, but proposed reducing its trade barriers at a
slower pace than the EU.
</P>
<P>
South African chief negotiator Elias Links said his side's
proposals represented the basis of its negotiations with the EU.
South Africa would refine its offer after further consultations,
in time for presentation to the EU in December.
</P>
<P>
Both sides said agreement on a timetable and technical
prerequisites for further negotiations had been reached, bringing
a new dynamism to the talks.
</P>
<P>
The major dispute between the two sides lie in some "sensitive
products", such as textiles, agricultural products, and
fisheries. Both sides complained about protectionism in these
fields.
</P>
<P>
The parties said in a joint statement that separate
negotiations on the wines and spirits and fisheries agreement
were planned before a ministerial meeting scheduled for February
next year.
</P>
<P>
Before the ministerial meeting, two rounds of talks will be
held respectively in Brussels, Belgium next month and in South
Africa at the end of January.

<HEADLINE> Ghanaian President Visits Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry
Rawlings Tuesday paid a one-day working visit to Nigeria and had
a five-hour closed-door meeting with Nigerian head of state
General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
No communique was issued at the end of the meeting, but
Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi said the two leaders
discussed a variety of issues.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the meeting centered mainly on circumstances
of the west African sub-region, the Sierra Leonean crisis and the
outcome of the just-concluded Commonwealth heads of government
meeting in Edinburgh, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Describing the meeting as "very fruitful", Ikimi stressed the
need for the maintenance of peace and stability in the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The meeting coincided with the allegation of the Nigerian
defense headquarters that the military junta was preparing to
attack the west African peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) which is
enforcing sanctions in Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The junta leader, Major Paul Koroma, on Tuesday also called
for an immediate departure of Nigerian troops in ECOMOG as a
pre-condition for the Conakry peace accord to work.
</P>
<P>
According to the accord signed two weeks ago in the Guinean
capital, the junta will hand over power to the legitimate
government it toppled in the May 25 coup in April next year.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also provided for an immediate cease fire
between ECOMOG and the junta on the one hand, and between the
junta and the various warring militias in the crisis-torn west
African country on the other.

<HEADLINE> G-15 Pushes for Regulations on Currency Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Group of 15 developing
countries (G-15) today emerged from its seventh summit on a strong
note with concrete moves to push for international regulations on
currency trading.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 ministers of finance, governors of central banks and
other relevant authorities will meet here early December this year
to draft a set of rules and regulations to be submitted to the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad told a joint news conference of G-15 leaders at
the end of their three-day summit here.
</P>
<P>
The draft recommendations would first be submitted to the G-15
government heads before being forwarded to the IMF, Mahathir, who
were flanked by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and President
Soeharto of Indonesia, said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the urgency of the issue, the leaders decided that their
next annual summit will be brought forward six months and is to be
convened in Cairo in May 1998, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
The currency issue was the hottest question at the news
conference attended by all attendants at the summit.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the summit had deliberated on ways on how the IMF and
the World Bank could regulate currency trading, Mahathir said it
was not discussed in detail as the job had been entrusted to the
financial ministers and central bank governors.
</P>
<P>
On how realistic it was to draw up rules and regulations on
currency trading given that the North was bound to resist, he
said, "Of course we expect resistance, but I think it is normal to
expect some rules when people interact with each other... you
can't interact without any rules at all. But if you don't want to
have them, don't preach to us...keep your mouth shut."
</P>
<P>
He said for some reasons, the North was resisting any
regulation at all with regards to currency trading and yet it was
"very, very keen on openness, transparency and the rule of law."
</P>
<P>
The leaders on the first day of their meeting issued a joint
special statement, expressing deep concern on the recent
developments in the international financial and currency markets
and urging the IMF and the World Bank to study the developments
with a view to appropriately regulating them to make them more
open and transparent.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir denied that the currency issue had side-tracked other
matters at the summit and said all other issues were also
considered.
</P>
<P>
The G-15, which accepted Kenya as its 16th member at the
summit, also comprises Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt,
India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru,
Senegal, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rate on Rise in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Inflation rate in the
Philippines went up to 5.7 percent in October from 5.3 percent in
September of this year, the National Statistics Office said today.
</P>
<P>
The country's consumer price index was estimated at 243.2 in
October, compared with 242.5 in September, according to the data.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate for food, beverages and tobacco rose from 2.0
percent to 2.4 percent, the data released by the office showed.
</P>
<P>
However, inflation rate for fuel, light and water remained at
the September level of 10.3 percent, while housing and repairs
registered a lower rate of 8.7 percent from its September rate of
8.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has revised its original inflation
target of this year twice due to the currency crisis which hit the
country and other Southeast Asian nations in early July.
</P>
<P>
The original inflation forecast for 1997 was between 5.2
percent and 5.7 percent. These figures were revised to 6 percent
to 6.5 percent after the peso tumbled against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
However, the inflation rates of July and August which posted at
4.8 percent and 4.5 percent respectively showed the impact of the
peso depreciation was not as bad as the government had
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
The government therefore reset its yearend inflation target to
5.4 percent in early October.

<P>
SANDOUPING (THREE GORGES), November 5 (Xinhua) -- A large
German multinational corporation has decided to spend 500 million
yuan on building materials and small hydro-electric power projects
in the Three Gorges Reservoir area of China.
</P>
<P>
And an American company recently announced it would spend 80
million U.S. dollars on a large orange-growing and fruit juice-
processing base in the area.
</P>
<P>
These are only two examples of how overseas investors are
competing in investing in the area where the world's biggest Three
Gorges Power Project is being built.
</P>
<P>
In mid-October, the Paris Chamber for Industry and Commerce
sent a large delegation to the Three Gorges area for business
talks, and two New Zealand companies also plan to send delegations.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jianyi, deputy mayor of Yichang city in the area, told
reporters that a number of groups from Hong Kong have inspected
the area or held talks this year. In the first three quarters, 100
million U.S. dollars of overseas investment had come in.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, another city in the area, had used 2.6 billion
U.S. dollars by the end of last year, and many overseas financial
organizations have opened offices in the city in southwest
China.

<HEADLINE> Typhoid Fever Kills 600,000 People Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 600,000 people die
of typhoid fever and some 16 million people are infected with the
disease annually throughout the world, the Daily Nation today
quoted a medical expert as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jean Proust of Pasteur Merieux Connaught, a French
international company, noted that typhoid fever was on the
increase in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He told a press briefing here Tuesday that the typhoid causing
bacteria had become resistant to most old-generation vaccines on
the market and there was a need for new ones.
</P>
<P>
The medical expert pointed out that "we should first vaccinate
school children between ages five and 15 years as they are among
the high risk groups."
</P>
<P>
Nazir Mizra, a consultant microbiologist, was quoted as saying
that typhoid fever was highest among school children in Kenya due
to poor sanitation, according to a recent study done in Bungoma
District, west Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Another consultant micro-biologist in tropical medicine,
Charles Chunge, said that typhoid symptoms had changed with the
disease now manifesting itself like malaria.

<P>
Some business giants from economically-developed east China are
also looking for a chance for investment in the area.
</P>
<P>
These include Wahaha Group in Hangzhou, Baimao (White Cat)
Co. Ltd. of Shanghai, Chundu Group of Henan, Weiwei Group of
Jiangsu, and Wanjiale Group and Gree Group of Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
High-technology companies with high added-value products are
not far behind. By August, more than two billion yuan had been
spent on 1,100 projects in the area, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
"Domestic businesses with strong economic strength have come to
the Three Gorges area to take over, reshuffle, or cooperate with
local factories, thus helping expand the area's
capacity to make arrangements for more re-settled people and
restructure the local industries," Zhang Delin, Party
Secretary of Chongqing Municipality, said recently.
</P>
<P>
Zhang attributed the Chinese-overseas investors competition in
the area to the Chinese government's huge investment in
resettling people there and its preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
The central government earmarked one billion yuan in special
loans for the development of enterprises in the Three Gorges area
each year.
</P>
<P>
And, the central government decided recently that
overseas-funded enterprises in the area can enjoy an annual tariff
rebate of 100 million US dollars in importing equipment for
production.
</P>
<P>
Many places are improving infrastructure. Wanxian, Wushan and
Fuling in Chongqing Municipality, and Zigui in Hubei Province,
part of which will be inundated when the Three Gorges Dam
is completed in 2009, have been accelerating the pace of building
towns for re-settlement.
</P>
<P>
"What interests us most is the rich resources and cheap labor
in the Three Gorges area, as well as the large market in
central and western China," said Wang Zhijian, General
Manager of Wahaha Group Fuling Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Because of its investment in the Three Gorges area, Wahaha has
seen the sales of its products in the southwestern Chinese market
increase eight-fold.
</P>
<P>
"Investing in the area has helped our company find a new
development space," Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Oil City Springs up on China's Taklimakan Desert (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four hectares of desert have been reclaimed, and 63 wind-proof
plants and trees and 40,000 sq.m. of grass planted. In a
greenhouse vegetable garden, scientists have grown more than 70
types of vegetables.
</P>
<P>
"The watermelons here are sweet in the meat and salty in the
rind," notes Dr. He Xingdong, of the Lanzhou Desert Research
Institute, and "tomatoe and eggplant skin is difficult to cut and
doesn't break even when they fall on the ground."
</P>
<P>
Trees and gardens have attracted sparrows, turtledoves and
woodpeckers, He says, adding, "We are still curious about how
those birds got into the vast desert."
</P>
<P>
Seven years ago, a 31-member team ventured into the desert to
look for a highway route, and spent 22 days crossing it.
</P>
<P>
After a 522-km highway was finished in 1995, it reduced the
time it takes to cross from north to south to half a day.
</P>
<P>
A hundred meters on either side of the highway are dried reeds
shoved deep into the sand as an effective way of stopping the sand
from shifting, experts explain.
</P>
<P>
The highway is the oil city's lifeline. More than 300 vehicles
including 10 shuttle buses, use it every day, carrying passengers
and goods needed by the city's residents, and several small inns
have cropped up along the highway.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese economic, trade
and investment observation mission, headed by Vice-Minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng, arrived
here today for an 11-day visit to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The 80-member delegation is made up of officials from the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the State
Planning Commission, and the Ministry of the Metallurgical
Industry. Executives of 50 large companies in China are also
members of the delegation.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, the largest one ever to visit South Africa,
was invited by the country's Minister of Trade and Industry Alec
Erwin.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela announced in November
last year that South Africa would sever "diplomatic relations"
with Taiwan and establish comprehensive diplomatic relations with
the People's Republic of China at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Shi told Xinhua that China attaches great
importance to the development of economic and trade relations
with South Africa, saying the visit by the Chinese delegation on
the eve of normalization of bilateral relations is an approval.
</P>
<P>
Shi expressed the hope that the two countries' government
departments and enterprises will exchange views during the visit
to help expand bilateral long-term economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Shi said China and South Africa have a strong character of
mutual supplement in economic and trade field. He said South
Africa is China's largest African trading partner with the volume
of bilateral trade having registered 1.35 billion U.S. Dollars in
1996.
</P>
<P>
China-South Africa trade was 1.1 billion U.S. Dollars in the
first nine months of this year, up 15 percent from the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 Chinese firms have set up offices and branches in
South Africa, and 100 million U.S. Dollars have been invested in
industry, agriculture, trade, service and other sectors in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Shi said the promotion of bilateral economic and trade
cooperation, which has good prospect and is likely to double
bilateral volume of trade in the near future, is instrumental to
the development of bilateral relations and to the improvement of
peoples' living standard in both countries.
</P>
<P>
Shi said his delegation will sign a number of trade contracts
and investment agreements with the South African side with the
value of hundreds of millions U.S. Dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
-- In January of 1993, the Three Gorges Project Construction
Committee (TGPCC) was set up to represent the State Council in
decision-making and regulating vital issues. Premier Li Peng was
director of the committee. The committee had three executive
bodies: the administrative office, the Bureau of Resettlement and
Development, and the China Yangtze Three Gorges Project
Development Corporation.

plan for the Three Gorges Project, representing the beginning of
the period of construction preparations.
</P>
<P>
-- In August of 1993, the State Council unveiled a set of
regulations for resettlement, adopting a development-oriented
resettlement policy in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, pledging
accelerated economic growth and improved living standards for
those residents to be resettled in the reservoir region.
</P>
<P>
-- On December 14, 1994, Premier Li Peng officially announced

the issuance of one billion yuan in corporate bonds. This was the
first move of the TGPCC to raise funds for construction through
bonds offering.
</P>
<P>
-- In March of 1997, Chongqing's upgrade to a municipality was
approved by the Fifth Plenary Session of the Eight National
People's Congress, a move to ease resettlement and expedite the
progress of the project.

<HEADLINE> S. African Court to Deny Bail for Serious Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- South African courts will
refuse bail for armed robbers and hijackers, serial rapists or
those who kill police officers in terms of a bill to be published
today and debated by the National Assembly tomorrow, local daily
the Citizen reported.
</P>
<P>
Political parties in the country on Tuesday endorsed draft
laws to deny bail to offenders charged with crimes that may carry
an automatic penalty of life imprisonment, or those with previous
convictions for serious offences, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of legislation approved by the National Assembly,
"life imprisonment" will in future mean serving at least 25 years
imprisonment before being considered for parole.
</P>
<P>
Under the new criminal law draft due to be published today, in
future all prisoners must serve at least half their sentences
before even being considered for parole.
</P>
<P>
Two new measures also provide that criminals will in future be
refused bail for serious offences and may also receive an
automatic life sentence on conviction.
</P>
<P>
The Criminal Procedure Second Amendment Bill fine-tuned by the
Justice Committee yesterday, obliges courts to refuse bail to
people charged with violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
The crimes include planned murder, the slaying of a police
officer, killing somebody while committing or attempting to
commit robbery or rape, hijacking, robbery using firearms, and
indecent assault on a child under the age of 16 with grievous
bodily harm.
</P>
<P>
In addition, bail will be refused automatically to any person
who has previously been convicted of murder, rape or other
serious offences, or who commits such a crime while out on bail.

<HEADLINE> G-15 Wants Greater Market Access to Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Group of 15 developing
countries (G-15) today asked for greater access to the markets,
capital and technology of the developed country, according to a
joint communique issued here today at the end of the three-day
seventh G-15 summit.
</P>
<P>
The grouping pledged to pursue a more positive and productive
North-South dialogue at all levels and on all suitable occasions
and fora.
</P>
<P>
Effective and regular consultations between the developed and
developing countries including those between the G-7 and the G-15
on global macro economic policies are imperative for the sound
management of the globalization process and the fostering of
beneficial interdependence, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the impact of globalization on the future
direction of the world economy and the economic fortunes of
nations has been at the top of the international agenda in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that the growth prospects of all countries,
especially developing countries, will largely depend on their
ability to participate positively in this emerging global economic
system," the G-15 leaders said.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that developing countries represent over
two-thirds of humanity and could be a locomotive for global growth
given its significant potential and purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
The communique said, "Spurring economic growth in developing
countries is therefore in the interest of the global economy as a
whole."
</P>
<P>
The grouping asked developed countries to do more for their
developing counterparts to create a supportive, fair and
non-discriminating international economic environment for
developing and least-developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Increased trade and investment between the two sides can
generate new sources of growth in the global economy, the leaders
said.
</P>
<P>
The grouping revoiced concerns at the multilateral system of
the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
While recognizing it as an important framework to facilitate
international trade, they said there was "an inherent imbalance in
this system" as not all countries had the equal capacity to
promote their trade and development interests and to safeguard
their rights.
</P>
<P>
It was decided that G-15 economic ministers, who met for the
first time before the summit, will reconvene prior to the WTO
meeting in Geneva next May to form common positions on issues of
concern to the grouping.

The leaders urged the developed countries to speedily and fully
implement their Uruguay Round commitments, including the provision
in various agreements for special differential treatment to
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also called on industrialized countries to refrain
from using projectionist measures to resolve their unemployment
problem and to fulfill their commitments to raise official
development assistance (ODA) to developing countries to at least
0.7 per cent of their gross national product (GNP).
</P>
<P>
They also rejected unilateral measures and pledged to "shoulder
responsibilities to ensure a mutually beneficial trading system."
</P>
<P>
They pledged to assist each other and continue to be a catalyst
for South-South growth.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to enhance cooperation in trade and investment
by improving existing mechanisms for information exchange,
facilitating business travel and intensifying trade and investment
promotion activities.
</P>
<P>
More emphasis would also be placed on investments in research
and development, human capital and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The leaders decided to hold their eighth summit in Cairo,
Egypt, in May 1998 and the ninth one in Jamaica in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
The G-15, which accepted Kenya as its 16th member at the
summit, also comprises Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt,
India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru,
Senegal, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Oil City Being Built On China's Taklimakan Desert (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, November 5 (Xinhua) -- China's Taklimakan Desert, the
world's second largest, known locally as the the "sea of death",
becomes the site of an oil city being built in conjunction with the
Tazhong No.4 Oilfield.
</P>
<P>
The new city, which is a thousand kilometers from Urumqi,
capital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, is in a place
where the desert swallowed up the ancient city of Niya, known as
the Pompeii of the Silk Road, which was a thriving place about
2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
There are 1,200 people in the new city, which has 33 sq.m. of
green. It is crisscrossed with a dozen asphalt roads lined with
flowers and trees, with hundreds of portable houses.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield workers live in a four-story building with
telephones and heating, and electricity provided by the city's gas
power plant.
</P>
<P>
Drinking water is transported from Korla, a city some 500
kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
An airport, with a 600-meter runway made tens of thousands of
steel plates provides transport plane service.
</P>
<P>
When the oilfield was discovered only five years ago, no one
thought of living in the 330,000-sq.km "sea of death", about the
size of Britain and Austria combined.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, scientists from the Lanzhou Desert Research Institute
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Xinjiang Biology and Soil
Research Institute began to do pilot studies on afforestation in
the desert, and developed a technique of using underground salty
water to cultivate vegetables and other plants. More

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Province Population Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The population growth rate
continues to fall in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The province's total population grew by one million people
between 1992-1996, ending the period at 41.16 million people. The
annual growth rate for the period stood at 0.26 percent, or half
of the rate for the previous four year period. Liaoning's birth
rate fell to 1.215 percent in 1996, the lowest level in history.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has the lowest population growth rate among the
nation's 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions. The
fact that some 90,000 women, mainly rural, gave up the chance to
bear a second child indicates a change in the Chinese traditional
concept that "more children bring more happiness," according to
experts.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has extended great efforts in both population control
and raising education standards. Some 85.55 percent of local
residents above the age of six have received various levels of
education, up 5.6 percent on the 1990s. The adult literacy rate
has also jumped by some 2.65 percentage point.
</P>
<P>
However, experts warn that the province faces problems of an
aging society, with seven percent of its population above the age
of 65.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government adopted the family planning policy in
the 1990s, with related efforts yielding great progress in
population control and raising the overall quality of the
residents.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of
Shanghai residents have expressed a willingness to donate bone
marrow to victims of leukemia.
</P>
<P>
Donors range between 18-40 years of age and come from all walks
of life. The sponsor of the city's special donation hot line
said that an average of 40-50 people call each day, with the
number sometimes rising to as high as 100 callers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the Shanghai's "Chinese Bone Marrow Donor
Bank" pioneered by the city's university students has attracted
over 2,000 willing donors. The bank's goal is to enlist 10,000
volunteers by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Bone marrow transplants provide an efficient method for
treating leukemia. However, a sufficient number of volunteers
will be required to increase the chances of survival for leukemia
victims.
</P>
<P>
The development of China's bone marrow donor banks has remained
somewhat slow, with only 3,000 prospective donors nationwide by
the end of 1996.

SEOUL, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Job applications on the World
Wide Web (Web) are becoming commonplace with over 20 percent of
college-educated job seekers submitting applications online,
according to industry sources.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of college graduates seeking jobs last year on
the Web were between 6 percent and 13 percent of all job seekers.
</P>
<P>
Of the 25,000 plus completing applications for employment with

</P>
<P>
Likewise, the Dongbu Group saw job forms on the web surge from
6.2 percent last year to 22.9 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The surge in applications on the Web stems from the growing
number of Internet users and the ease with which job candidates
can submit various certificates, including copies of diplomas and

session.

<HEADLINE> India Facing Dilemma in Currency Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Continued depreciation of
Southeast Asian currencies and, more recently, of those in
competing neighbors like Pakistan is posing a serious policy
problem for exchange rate management in India, an official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The government is in dilemma: whether the rupee should be
allowed to seek out its "true" value or should the Reserve Bank of
India (RBI) persist with its aggressive market operations and keep
the rupee pegged at the current levels, he said. At present, both
schools of thought seem to be equally represented within the
government.
</P>
<P>
Under the current circumstances, the RBI has decided not to
intervene aggressively in the foreign exchange market except for
containing strong U.S. dollar inflows or outflows. The RBI will
use measures such as checking rates or banks' overnight positions
at the close of trading to calm the kind of day-to-day volatility
witnessed over the past couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
The RBI has taken this stand partly on account of the impact of
intervention in the foreign exchange market on money supply and
partly due to the growing acceptance in the market that some
measure of volatility is becoming part of everyday life, the
official said.

India managed to block the U.S.'s first request to set up a
dispute settlement panel under the World Trade Organization (WTO)
on October 16 this year. The U.S. wanted to make a second request
for the panel to break its deadlock with India on the BOP issue,
which is stuck over India's refusal to give a year-by-year
commitment for lifting quantitative restrictions on imports.
</P>
<P>
In its offer, India has listed the items which would be freed
from import curbs, without specifying the years in which the curbs
would be lifted. India has also not agreed to the U.S.'s demand
that it renounce the balance-of-payments waiver.
</P>
<P>
India is keen to settle the issue with the U.S. in as
"non-confrontational" manner as possible, yet the country can not
compromise on her own interests beyond a point, Indian officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Submitting its first request, the U.S. had pointed out that the
issue had been discussed for over 18 months. While the U.S. would
continue consultations with India, it also wanted a panel to be
established. India had objected on the ground that it was engaged
in "promising consultations" with the U.S. and setting up a panel
at that stage would prove counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
Since it was the U.S.'s first request, the WTO's dispute
settlement body decided not to form a dispute settlement panel.
Under the WTO rules, the admission of a second plea is mandatory.
</P>
<P>
The European Union and Australia are also likely to follow
suit.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Press Publishes News About Alleged Plot to Kill Castro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban press today released
news from international news agencies about an alleged plot to
kill Cuban President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
The media reportedly said four Cuban-Americans living in Miami,
the United States, were accused of being involved in the possible
plot. Some of those involved are supposedly connected with the
Cuban-American National Foundation (CANF).
</P>
<P>
The Cuban official newspaper, Granma, quoted international news
sources as saying today that four Cuban-Americans were captured
last week by the U.S. Coast Guard when their boat belonging to a
CANF head ran into trouble off Puerto Rico. The boat, "Esperanza",
is registered to Nautical Sports, Inc. of Miami.
</P>
<P>
U.S. customs agents seized heavy weapons, including
high-powered Barrett assault rifles and 70 rounds of ammunition
from the boat.
</P>
<P>
One of the four reportedly claimed the weapons were to be used
to assassinate Castro during the 7th Ibero-American Summit
on November 7-9 in Margarita Island, Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Miami's media said the four were seized near the coast of Cabo
Rojo, Puerto Rico, in the Caribbean Sea. U.S. Coast Guard agents
were in the process of helping them after their boat broke
down. The U.S. customs agents demanded to see the original
certificates of boat ownership and navigation permits, but only
copies were shown. The customs agents also found a false bottom in
the boat where heavy weapons were concealed.
</P>
<P>
The men were charged with arms smuggling and released on 50,000
U.S. dollars bail. The FBI and federal prosecutors are still
investigating the case and may file conspiracy charges.

<HEADLINE> Drought Menaces Grain Production in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Persistent drought and a water
shortage is threatening the sustainable development of China's
agriculture, particularly in the arid northern provinces, today's
China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
This threat has been caused by the extension of farming and the
changing climate.
</P>
<P>
More than 26 million hectares of farmland have been subject to
drought in the 1990s, more than double that of two decades
perviously, said Zhang Chunyun, vice-minister of water resources
at a national working conference on water-saving irrigation this
week.
</P>
<P>
In North China this year, a record 33.3 million ha of farmland,
about 25 percent of China's total sown areas, have suffered from
the worst drought since 1972, Zhang said. As a result, some 4.7
million ha of farmland had no harvest, or planting for the next
harvest is impossible. Grain loss amounts to more than 42 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
To date, water-saving irrigation has been successfully
introduced to 19 million ha of grain-producing land, but this only
accounts for 37 percent of China's total effective irrigation
grain-yielding land. This amount of land is capable of producing
over 75 percent of China's total grain.
</P>
<P>
China uses 380 billion cubic metres of water annually for
irrigation, about 80 percent of the country's total annual
consumption of water. About half of this is lost because of major
leaks from existing ditches, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Some rivers, lakes and reservoirs in the north have dried up
while the groundwater table has dropped.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River, China's second longest waterway, has been dry
for 188 days in a 700-kilometre section of the lower reaches, the
longest dry period in its history.
</P>
<P>
Only 36.7 billion cubic metres of water are stored in North
China's 500 large reservoirs, 33 percent less than that of the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
In the North China Plain, the groundwater level has dropped to
2.5 metres, reducing groundwater reserves by 24 billion cubic
metres, Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Fish Return to Huaihe River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Fishermen have been spotted
catching fish along the Fuyang sector of the once badly polluted
Huaihe River recently, thanks to treatment of the waste water from
factories in the Huaihe River Basin, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities have taken resolute measures to push toward
the treatment of pollution in the Huaihe River and to close down,
merge and transfer enterprises which cannot be cleaned up.
</P>
<P>
Factories along the Huaihe River are being urged to meet new
requirements to limit the discharge of pollutants into the river
by the end of this year. Those failing to meet the deadline will
be shut down without exception.
</P>
<P>
Huainan, east China's Anhui province, has included competence
in pollution-control as a necessary criterion for personal
promotion in State enterprises.
</P>
<P>
An official inspection carried out in mid-October shows, among
the 1,562 factories discharging 100-plus tons of waste water
daily, 662 have completed the installation and adjustment of
relevant facilities, accounting for 42.4 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Faced with financial difficulties, local governments have taken
great pains to finance waste-water treatment projects in
State-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Special funds for protecting the river from being polluted have
been set up in Jiangsu and Anhui.
</P>
<P>
In Jiangsu, factories involved in waste-water treatment
projects are exempt from local taxation. In addition to the
introduction of advanced foreign technology, overseas funds have
been solicited, supplementing the governments' environmental
protection funds.

<HEADLINE> Chronology of Three Gorges Project (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Yangtze,
the world's third largest river after the Amazon and the Nile,
will be blocked on November 8 to allow construction of the mammoth
Three Gorges Dam.
</P>
<P>
The following is a chronology of major events leading to
construction of the world's largest water control project compiled
by the Xinhua News Agency today on the basis of the data provided
by the State Council Three Gorges Project Construction Committee
(TGPCC), the Yangtze River Water Conservation Committee:
</P>
<P>
-- During the more than 2,000 years between the Han Dynasty
(206 BC-AD 220) and the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), floods occurred
on the Yangtze River nearly once every ten years. During the last
300 years, severe floods breached the Jingjiang Dam 60 times, and
disastrous floods struck twice in the past 100 years. Floods have
been a persistent problem for residents and businesses along the
Yangtze and for the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
-- In 1919 Dr. Sun Yat Sen, forerunner of China's democratic
reform, proposed construction of a dam at Three Gorges to make
better use of the rich water resources of the Yangtze and improve
navigation.
</P>
<P>
-- In 1944, American dam expert John Lucian Savage was invited
to do field research at the Three Gorges by the resources
committee of the Republic of China. Savage drafted a preliminary
report on the water control project.
</P>
<P>
-- In May of 1946, the resources committee of the government of
the Republic of China, which was in power then, signed an
agreement with its U.S. counterpart to jointly design the dam
project.
</P>
<P>
-- In May of 1947, the government of the Republic of China
ordered the project dropped because of runaway inflation and an
economic crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
-- In 1949, severe flooding again devastated the region along
the Yangtze, prompting new China at birth to attach importance to
flood control on the middle and lower reaches of the river. Three
years later, the Jingjiang flood diversion project was completed
on the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
-- In 1953, Chairman Mao Zedong was presented with an outline
for building reservoirs on the river. He urged that a dam be built
at Three Gorges to control flooding.
</P>
<P>
-- In the flood season of 1954, the Yangtze Valley suffered the
most severe flooding of the century, serving as another warning
that permanent measures were required to harness the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
-- In the ensuing four decades starting in 1955, China began
the arduous job of planning, prospecting, researching and
designing the Three Gorges project. Serious discussions began on
the project's feasibility.
</P>
<P>
-- In March 1958, late Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a report on
the Yangtze Valley and the Three Gorges Project at a CPC Central
Committee conference held at Chengdu, the capital of the
southwestern China's Sichuan Province. In August of the same year,
he presided over a meeting concerning the Three Gorges Project
held at the north China resort city of Beidaihe to study the
project's designing and other relevant preparatory work.
</P>
<P>
-- In 1970, the central government decided to kick off the
Gezhouba Dam Project as a part of the Three Gorges Project to cope
with the growing demand for electrical power in central China.

<P>
-- In January of 1993, the Three Gorges Project Construction
Committee (TGPCC) was set up to represent the State Council in
decision-making and regulating vital issues. Premier Li Peng was
director of the committee. The committee had three executive
bodies: the administrative office, the Bureau of Resettlement and
Development, and the China Yangtze Three Gorges Project
Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
-- On July 26, 1993, the TGPCC approved a preliminary design
plan for the Three Gorges Project, representing the beginning of
the period of construction preparations.
</P>
<P>
-- In August of 1993, the State Council unveiled a set of
regulations for resettlement, adopting a development-oriented
resettlement policy in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, pledging
accelerated economic growth and improved living standards for
those residents to be resettled in the reservoir region.
</P>
<P>
-- On December 14, 1994, Premier Li Peng officially announced
the official launching of construction of the Three Gorges
Project.
</P>
<P>
-- In 1995, the resettlement program was kicked off.
</P>
<P>
-- In August of 1996, two major transportation projects,
including a Xiling Bridge across the Yangtze and an airport in the
city of Yichang, were completed and went into service.
</P>
<P>
-- In January of 1997, the State Planning Commission approved
the issuance of one billion yuan in corporate bonds. This was the
first move of the TGPCC to raise funds for construction through
bonds offering.
</P>
<P>
-- In March of 1997, Chongqing's upgrade to a municipality was
approved by the Fifth Plenary Session of the Eight National
People's Congress, a move to ease resettlement and expedite the
progress of the project.
</P>
<P>
-- In mid-September of 1997, most of the first wave of
residents in the reservoir region were relocated.
</P>
<P>
-- On October 1, 1997, the Qinjiatuo Bridge opened to traffic,
concluding construction of transportation facilities for the dam
project.
</P>
<P>
-- On October 6, 1997, navigation opened along a 3.5-km
diversion canal on the southern bank of the Yangtze, another
preparation for blocking the main channel.
</P>
<P>
-- On October 14, 1997, a decision was made at the 63rd
Executive meeting of the State Council to block the Yangtze on
November 8, which signals the completion of the first-phase
construction of the Three Gorges Project and the beginning of
its second-phase project.

-- In 1979, the Ministry of Water Resources submitted a
proposal on the project to the State Council, and recommended an
immediate decision by the central government.
</P>
<P>
-- In 1980, late leader Deng Xiaoping inspected the proposed
dam site at Sandouping in the Xiling Gorge. Two years later, Deng
Xiaoping pledged to proceed with the Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
-- In April of 1984, the State Council authorized the Yangtze
Valley Planning Office to draft a feasibility report on the Three
Gorges Water Control Project.
</P>
<P>
-- In June of 1986, the central government demanded a
re-examination of the project and more feasibility studies. For
the next three years, the Ministry of Water Resources organized 14
expert groups for a large-scale, thorough review of the project.
</P>
<P>
-- In 1989, the planning office revised the feasibility report
and proposed starting the project as soon as possible. A basic
building was also prepared for the project.
</P>
<P>
-- In July 1990, a supervisory committee was set up for the
project, with Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua being the director. The
committee approved the feasibility report in August 1991 and
submitted it to the State Council for final deliberation at the
Seventh National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
-- On April 3 of 1992, the Fifth Plenary Session of the Seventh
National People's Congress approved a resolution to proceed with
the Three Gorges Project, with 1767 deputies for, 177 against, and
664 abstaining. The project was included in the Ten-Year Program
for National Economic and Social Development, and the State
Council was authorized to carry out the project at an appropriate
time.

"We support the worldwide trend toward multi-polarization and the
establishment of friendly and mutually beneficial relations
between world powers, and are firmly opposed to continuing
conflicts," said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of Jiang's successful visit to the United
States, saying it was a major event with great international
significance. Rogachev expressed great pleasure at hearing China's
voice even louder on the international stage.
</P>
<P>
Rogachev said that the Chinese and Russian leaders have decided
to place greater impetus on the development of bilateral relations
in their forthcoming summit, and that the two sides are expected
to issue several statements with historical significance.
</P>
<P>
He said the summit will be a major step to further strengthen
mutual trust and solve problems left over by history.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador noted that Russia and China, which
share the world's longest common border, enjoy complimentary
economies and their abundant resources
and vast potential markets will enable them to profit from
long-term stable cooperation on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
This will create good conditions enabling the two nations to
enjoy wide-ranging economic, trade, investment, scientific,
technological and cultural cooperation, according to Rogachev.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that coordinated cooperation between the two
countries will be an important factor guaranteeing the healthy
development of the international community.
</P>
<P>
Rogachev also addressed problems in the development of
bilateral relations. He said that problems related to bilateral
economic and trade ties are the result of objective factors
centered on the fact that the complexity of the Russian reform
process restricts bilateral cooperation in areas such as
production and investment.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that China's major banks and companies
will adopt an even more active attitude concerning economic
cooperation between the two nations.

<HEADLINE> Aid Group Meeting Issues Joint Statement in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing two-day Aid Group
meeting today issued a joint statement in Dhaka asking
Bangladeshi political parties to shun violence and intolerance in
order to create a favorable environment for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement was signed by the heads of delegations from
15 countries and organizations -- Australia, Belgium, Canada,
Denmark, European Community, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, the
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Britain and the USA. It
was circulated among the 27 members and observers of the Aid Group
present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The delegation leaders said in the statement that the future
prosperity of Bangladesh depended on the actions and attitudes of
the leaders of all political parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
If the parties in Bangladesh allowed intolerance, violence and
instability, they all would bear the responsibility for the
resulting damage to the future prosperity of the nation, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The donors warned that under circumstances like intolerance and
violence, it was almost inevitable that external aid flows would
be adversely affected. Potential foreign investors would also be
discouraged and would look elsewhere for business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern over the growth of political intolerance,
violence and intimidation in the country, the development partners
expressed the hope that the members of all political parties would
respect the call of President Shahabuddin Ahmed for tolerance and
accommodation in the interests of the country as a whole, and
settle their differences in Parliament and not by violence.
</P>
<P>
prolonged political confrontation between the previous
governments and the opposition resulted in economic and
developmental stagnation in 1994-1996, the statement pointed out.
The present confrontation appeared to be ushering in a new cycle
of violence, intimidation and instability.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the formidable development challenges faced by the
country, the statement said the vision of poverty reduction and
economic growth (of the country) was possible with effort and
reforms. Achievements of these goals would bring new life and hope
to the many millions at present living in deepest poverty.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that achievements of the goals of poverty
reduction would need the sustained cooperation and commitment of
the government, all political parties and citizens, in partnership
with external donors. But such cooperation and partnership would
not be possible in a climate of instability fueled by intolerance
and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
The Aid Group meeting, which is scheduled to end today, will be
followed by an investors' conference tomorrow on the prospects of
investment opportunities in Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Informal Summit Takes Russian-Japanese Ties to New Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The just-concluded informal
summit between President Boris Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto brought ties between the two countries to an
entirely new level, a senior Russian official announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Tarasov, a spokesman for the foreign ministry, said
Yeltsin and Hashimoto held wide-ranging exchanges on a variety of
issues and discussed new ways to strengthen ties in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
He added that their first informal summit had deepened their
understanding of each other, and the results demonstrated that
Russian-Japanese ties are developing toward real partnership ties.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov stressed that neither of them did not avoid the most
difficult questions and contradictions.
</P>
<P>
They made a strong effort to agree on a peace treaty by the
year 2000. The treaty would be based on the 1993 Tokyo Declaration
that agreed to work to normalize diplomatic relations by resolving
disputes on the basis of "the principles of law and justice."
</P>
<P>
The leaders finally agreed to resolve the historic territorial
dispute over the Russian-held islands of Etorofu, Kunashiri,
Shikotan and the Habomai group of islets. The dispute has
prevented the two countries from signing a peace treaty for more
than five decades.
</P>
<P>
The two-day no-neckties summit that started last Sunday in
Krasnoyarsk, eastern Siberia, also reviewed the Yeltsin-Hashimoto
Plan in the political, economic and financial fields.

<HEADLINE> People of Shanghai Eating Less, but Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey by a
municipal social and economic investigation team has found that
the people of Shanghai now consume less staple foods and more
vegetables and aquatic products, and spend more but use less time
dining.
</P>
<P>
It found that monthly grain consumption is 5.7 kg, or 1.1 kg
less than last year, and only 46 percent of 1980's figure. Also,
6.2 kg of fish and shrimp on average are consumed per person each
month, 3.3 times the 1990 figure.
</P>
<P>
Local people are eating more nutritious food and are more in
line with national standards in protein and vitamin intake,
nutrition experts say. And expensive foods like imported seafood
are more common on ordinary folks' tables, and vegetables bought
from the market have saved people a lot of time, even though they
cost a bit more.
</P>
<P>
A new phenomenon in Shanghai is ordering a home banquet from a
local restaurant, which will send the ingredients and the chef to
the home to prepare the dishes on the spot.
</P>
<P>
Some local analysts attribute the changes in the people's diets
to the improved standard of living and increased income as well as
to the government's effort to increase the supply of non-staple
food.

BANGKOK, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Senior Asian and European
officials, unable to settle on new countries to join the
Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), have handed off the issue to their
leaders to decide, Saroj Chavanaviraj, permanent secretary of the
Thai Foreign Ministry, said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Saroj led the Thai delegation at a senior officials' meeting of
ASEM members last Thursday and Friday in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted today by local press as saying that the leaders,
who are to meet in London next April, would consider only
countries which had already applied for membership.
</P>
<P>
That means Myanmar and Laos will be excluded from the meeting
because they have not yet officially applied, Saroj said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Laos became new members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in July, but that does not give
them automatic entry into the one-year-old ASEM Forum.
</P>
<P>
ASEM includes ASEAN - without Myanmar and Laos - and the
European Union, plus China, Japan and South Korea.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Strategic readjustment is now
an urgent need of China's state economy and foreign experience
should be adopted to change the present situation of state-owned
assets, a top official said at a recent seminar.
</P>
<P>
The problems with China's state properties are the extensive
coverage of state-owned assets, the lack of investment focus and
the low quality of the assets, said Liu Guoliang,
secretary-general of the China Academy of State Property
Administration. The academy is affiliated with the National
Administrative Bureau of State-Owned Assets.
</P>
<P>
Liu suggested that state investments be concentrated in such
industries as transportation, energy, postal services,
telecommunications and important raw materials that have a vital
bearing on the national economy and public-service fields.
</P>
<P>
In regard to light industry, retailing and the hospitality
industry, Liu said, state property should be cut or erased except
for enterprises with good performance.
</P>
<P>
Liu called for attention to measures by foreign countries such
as planned allocation of state resources to vital sectors,
"bottlenecks" in transportation and energy, promotion for
high-tech industries and influence on employment, income, prices
and economic restructuring.

<P>
YANGON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A Myanmar senior official has
stressed at a seminar, sponsored by the Fuji Bank of Japan, that
his country would not neglect the current Asian currency
turbulence.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the seminar on current Asian currency issues here
Tuesday, Win Tin, Minister for Finance and Revenue, said, "While
Myanmar is endeavoring for all round economic development in the
transitional period, maintaining sustained economic growth with
macro-economic stability, We can not disregard this currency
turbulence in some Asian countries as they result in negative
impact on the region as a whole at least in the short run."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the currency destabilization in some
countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
goes beyond the realm of economic fundamentals and can be
attributed to ill-intentioned speculators, official paper The New
Light of Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Southeast Asian countries will tide
over their currency crisis as they enjoy strong economic
fundamentals and success in maintaining a high degree of savings,
high investment rate and liberal financial policies.
</P>
<P>
The current Asian currency turbulence greatly affected the
market exchange rates between Myanmar and foreign currencies.

<HEADLINE> Latvia Rejects Russia's Offer on Security Guarantee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Latvia today officially rejected
a Russian offer to guarantee the security of Baltic nations,
saying it is not in keeping with the spirit of a new Europe.
</P>
<P>
Russian leaders have proposed more than once to provide
security guarantee to the Baltic region, a Foreign Ministry
statement was quoted as saying by an Itar-Tass new agency report.
</P>
<P>
However, said the statement, the best guarantee for the
region's future should be the buildup of good-neighborly relations
and the willingness to shoulder up international responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Latvia's rejection, from Riga, the country's capital, came four
days after Lithuania made a similar policy statement.
</P>
<P>
The latest Russian offer, for Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia,
was contained in a document presented by President Boris Yeltsin
to his Lithuanian counterpart Algirdas Brazauskas on October 24.
</P>
<P>
The move was believed to be a fresh Russian attempt to dissuade
the three Baltic countries -- all former Soviet republics -- from
seeking entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
On Latvia's part, the foreign ministry said its policy goals of
joining the European Union (EU) and NATO, and maintaining friendly
ties with Russia and other neighbors will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
As Russia is actively working on regional cooperation and
promoting its relations with Europe and NATO, the ministry said,
Latvia is willing to continue dialogue with the eastern neighbor.

world with a market worth more than 700 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Fisheries is one of the fastest-developing sectors in China,
with a gross annual production growth rate of 13.6 percent in the
past decade. It accounts for a quarter of global fisheries
production.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, Chinese gross fisheries production aims to reach 41
million tons, compared with 28.13 million tons last year.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal, the Chinese Government will actively

Eighth Congress, which opened Monday.
</P>
<P>
But he did not rule out the possibility that some other firms
will participate because financial authorities encourage firms
applying for insurance licenses to form teams to ensure they have
adequate financial backing for such a business.
</P>
<P>
Stakes in financial institutions have become something keenly
pursued by many Chinese firms.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the shareholders of the five insurance companies set
up last year are state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Orient Group, a private company based in Harbin, capital city of
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, obtained a 10-percent
share in the New China Life Insurance Co., one of the five. Other
private firms eyeing the country's promising insurance market were
eager to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The new insurance company, if established, will be the second
financial institution launched by ACFIC. The federation plans to
initiate more institutions to provide services to the non-state
firms, Jing said.
</P>
<P>
"We will recommend the best firms in the private sector," he
said. "Our intention is to inspire other firms to learn from
the listed ones to strive for higher standard and modernization."

<HEADLINE> Thailand Trains Tourism Staff on Airport Reception </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Airports Authority of
Thailand (AAT) and the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) have
joined hands to train their staff on receiving tourists at the
country's four main airports in an effort to boost the tourism
industry.
</P>
<P>
The move will complement the Thai government's Amazing Thailand
1998-99 tourism campaign and the idea is to receive foreign
visitors with extra warmth and give them a taste of the Thai
culture and hospitality so that they will have happy memories of
Thailand, a local press report said today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted ATT Governor Chanin Chantharubeksa as saying
that the tour airports are Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Hat Yai and Phuket
which are connected by international flights.
</P>
<P>
The Att and TAT will conduct a four-day seminar in Bangkok
starting November 11 to train the staff for Bangkok airport
reception. Similar seminars will be held next month in cities
where the other airports are located.
</P>
<P>
Some 7.3 million tourists visited Thailand last year.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Cities Expected To Use Rail Tansportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- In the next century, more
Chinese cities are expected to build subways and light railway
transport to improve traffic conditions, according to a recent
symposium on rail-based transport in urban areas, held in
Changchun, capital of China's Jilin province.
</P>
<P>
The gathering was sponsored by the China Railway Society and
the Changchun Locomotive Plant, a large-scale manufacturer of
locomotives.
</P>
<P>
Only Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou have subways,
but Nanjing, Qingdao, Shenyang, Chongqing, and Shenzhen have
gotten approval from the central authorities to build their own,
while 20 other cities are considering similar moves.
</P>
<P>
China has 35 cities with a million or more people. Buses and
trolleys are the major means of transportation in Chinese cities,
which lag far behind in urban development.
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, public transportion moved at an average speed of
40 kmph, but that has dropped to 10 kmph now. And, Chinese leave
their home 2.5 times daily on average, a frequency similar to that
of developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Traffic bottlenecks have hampered economic development.
Shanghai, it is estimated, loses 2.5 billion yuan, or 12 percent
of its GDP, annually because of this problem. And, the entire
country may suffer greater economic losses of more than 100
billion yuan or more as a result of the same problem.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Hires Laid-Off Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The rapidly expanding private
sector in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province,
has emerged as an important channel for reemploying workers
laid-off from state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Yun, deputy-director of the Guangzhou Labor Department,
said private businesses in the city hired over 3,000 laid-off
workers during the first half of this year, with the figure
accounting for 12.2 percent of the total number of people laid-off
during the period.
</P>
<P>
She said the government expects the sector to provide
employment for even more laid-off workers during the second half
of the year.
</P>
<P>
The private sector hired 16,900 laid-off workers during 1996,
or 21.7 percent of the total number of people laid-off during the
year.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou has introduced extensive mechanisms to encourage
private businesses to hire laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
For example, a private company can receive government subsidies
of between 600-1,000 for each laid-off worker it hires. In
addition, private companies which mainly employ laid-off workers
also enjoy preferential policies such as tax exemptions.
</P>
<P>
The city has also introduced measures to reduce burdens on
private businesses hiring laid-off workers, with social insurance
and welfare benefits of said employees paid by their former
employeers.
</P>
<P>
Related efforts have also helped laid-off workers regain
confidence in themselves. A recent job fair for private businesses
attracted about 50 percent of the city's laid-off workers, with
many asking for minimum monthly salaries of 1,000 yuan, compared
to their former salaries of only 600 yuan.

<HEADLINE> State Enterprises in North China City Hot for Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TANGSHAN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Ninety-four state-owned
enterprises with overseas funds in Tangshan, north China, have
become operational. Their production accounts for half the volume
of the overseas-funded enterprises in the city.
</P>
<P>
Now Tangshan has attracted 58 million U.S. dollars from
overseas to its state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Some world-renowned corporations such as Mitsushita and
Marubeni of Japan, and the Bank of China Group of Hong Kong have
become partners in the city's large state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned enterprises which are short of funds have
benefited from funding and advanced equipment contributed by
their overseas partners.
</P>
<P>
The Eighth Porcelain Plant of Tangshan, for instance, earned
1.5 million U.S. dollars of foreign exchange last year after it
set up a joint venture with a Hong Kong partner, who contributed
500,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
No state-owned businesses with overseas investments are losing
money, according to Xin Zhichun, deputy director of the Commission
of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade of Tangshan.

MANILA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank will
tap before the year end 800 million U.S. dollars of lion loans to
shore up its gross international reserves.
</P>
<P>
About 344.3 million dollars would come from the last tranche of
an International Monetary Fund (IMF) facility and 300 million
dollars will be sourced from the Japan Export-Import Bank,
according to Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson.
</P>
<P>
Another 160 million dollars would come from the state power
firm, the National Power Corp., which will sell the proceeds of a
syndicated loan to the bank, local press reports today quoted
Singson as saying.
</P>
<P>
This will serve to boost the country's gross international
reserves to 11.3 billion dollars from the current level of around
10.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country's gold and dollar reserves have fallen to the
current level following a failure in defending the peso against

BUENOS AIRES, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Electoral authorities in
Paraguay announced today that the presidential election will be
held on May 10, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Electoral Superior Court said in a communique that a new
president will be elected to replace the incumbent President Juan
Carlos Wasmosy.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's Electoral Law, political parties will have
to choose their candidates before March 4.
</P>
<P>
The ruling National Republican Party (RNA) has been in a
difficult situation since its candidate, retired General Lino
Oviedo, was accused of offenses against the president.
</P>
<P>
Oviedo was selected to be the ruling party's candidate for the
presidential race in 1998. But last week President Wasmosy issued
an order to arrest Oviedo on the charge of "offenses against the
president."
</P>
<P>
The retired general managed to escape from his home and
reportedly said that he has the support of the army and the police.
</P>
<P>
The situation became more complicated for Oviedo when
U.S. Ambassador to Paraguay Robert Service said the selection of
Oviedo was not a democratic decision.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Yangtze River More Navigable in Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Three
Gorges Project is located at the juncture of the upper and central
reaches of the Yangtze River, the world's third longest.
</P>
<P>
The unique location of the project can better adjust the
waterflow in either the upper or central reaches of the Yangtze in
dry season, greatly improving the navigational conditions between
Chongqing, the country's largest municipality, and Hankou, a key
commercial hub in central China.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, the river section between Yichang and
Chongqing will become a deep-water channel, where the current 109
dangerous spots which have been barriers to smooth navigation,
will be submerged deep under the water.
</P>
<P>
Also, as the river widens and the turn-around space for ships
is enlarged, the 10,000-tonnage ships can directly reach Chongqing
from Hankou for at least half of a year. The downstream transport
capacity, thus far, can increase from the current 10 million tons
to 50 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The problem of mountain slides impeding or even blocking the
Yangtze riverbed will be resolved. The cost of navigation is

<HEADLINE> Inter Advance but Liverpool Bump out of UEFA Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Inter Milan overturned their
deficit against Lyon to move into the UEFA Cup third round but
Liverpool failed to get through despite their second leg victory
over Strasbourg on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Inter Milan erased their 2-1 home defeat two weeks ago with a
3-1 victory over Lyon thanks to two goals from Francesco Moriero
and one strike from Inter's Frenchman Benoit Cauet.
</P>
<P>
In Liverpool, Strasbourg successfully maintained their 3-0 lead
from the first leg to advance on a 3-2 aggregate as the English
club only managed a 2-0 victory at Anfield.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool found the net in the 63th minute with a penalty from
Robbie Fowler before German veteran Karlheinz Riedle blasted a
second in the 84th.
</P>
<P>
Another English club Aston Villa fared better as they moved
into the third round on 2-1 aggregate after a 2-1 victory over
Athltico Bilbao at Villa Park.
</P>
<P>
German international Thomas Hassler contributed two spectacular
free-kick goals in two matches to help Karlsruhe stay on with a
3-1 aggregate despite their 1-1 draw with Metz of France.
</P>
<P>
France's Auxerre scraped through to the third round as they
lost 3-2 away to OFI Crete of Greece but still managed to advance
benefitting from their 3-1 win in France two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
But another French side Bastia had the opposite fate when they
won 3-2 at home to Steaua Bucharest but still went out as Steaua's
1-0 home saw them through on away goals.
</P>
<P>
In other games, Pierluigi Casiraghi, Roberto Mancini and
Guiseppe Signori found the net for Italians Lazio as they beat
Russians Rotor Volgograd 3-0 to beat them by the same aggregate
score.
</P>
<P>
Croatia Zagreb thanked Robert Prosinecki for his two goals as
they beat MTK Budapest 2-0 on the night and 2-1 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Other teams to go through include Holland's FC Twente Enschede
and Ajax, Portugal's Braga and Austria's Rapid Vienna.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank to Open New Loan Window </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank and
the Bankers Association have drawn up measures to bring down
interest rates, including the opening of a long-term lending
window for banks.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will open up 30-day lending facility where
banks can borrow money using their special series Treasury Bills,
local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
But the central bank is opposed to the proposal of the
association for the creation of a lending window with a longer
tenor.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson as
saying that the bank could only agree to a maximum 30-day lending
facility to prevent the funds from being tied up for a long
period.
</P>
<P>
Association President Deogracias Vistan said that the banks had
been pushing for at least a 120-day lending facility.
</P>
<P>
At least 17 billion pesos (485.7 million U.S. dollars) of
liquidity would be freed into the financial system should the
Monetary Board, the highest policy-making body of the central
bank, approve the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Vistan added the move was a compromise to improve liquidity as
banks preferred to hold onto the government securities they
acquired with the increase in liquid reserve requirement after the
central bank refused to buy these bills at face value.
</P>
<P>
"So, the central bank instead of buying the securities will
just lend against them," he said.
</P>
<P>
He estimated prime lending rates would be slashed by three to
four percent to between 18 and 20 percent "sooner than December."
</P>
<P>
The central bank will adopt other proposals to further bring
down interest rates, which include a cut in the bank's overnight
lending rate from the current 16.125 percent and a longer time
frame for the implementation of the two percent loan loss
reserves.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project And Flood Control (16) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Three
Gorges Project is expected to have immense flood control benefits
on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, one of the
most prosperous areas in China.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Reservoir, when completed in the year 2009,
will have a capacity of 22.15 billion cu.m. at the highest water
level -- 175 meters.
</P>
<P>
The reservoir will make flood-control easier on the Jingjiang
river section (from Zhicheng in Hubei province to Chenglingji in
Hunan province), and be able to handle floods that occur once
every century instead of every decade.
</P>
<P>
During flood season, it will help reduce the amount of water
and soil entering Dongting Lake, one of China's three biggest
freshwater lakes and it will control the water level around Wuhan
city, meaning more reliable and flexible flood control on the
middle and lower reaches.
</P>
<P>
The project will help prevent flood casualties, interrupted
railway service, spread of epidemics and soil erosion, and to
solve the re-settlement problems of flood victims.

<HEADLINE> East China's Economic Zone Bolsters Industry, Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Growth in industrial
enterprises and specialized markets have been made a priority in
the Economic and Technological Development Zone of Jinhua.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the total industrial output value of the development
zone in east China's Zhejiang Province reached 1.54 billion yuan. This
year's figure is expected to exceed 2.4 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The zone had attracted 2.7 billion yuan of investment by the end of
1996, according to Wang Zhigang, director of the Administrative
Committee of the zone. Overseas investment in the zone was 69.2
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Of the 4,000 industrial enterprises with a total registered
capital of 2.3 billion yuan, 70 percent are private.
</P>
<P>
Currently, a dozen specialized markets for such products as
synthetic fabric, electrical appliances, clothing, furniture and
second-hand goods are located in the zone.
</P>
<P>
The business volume of these markets in 1996 was 1.34 billion
yuan. Ten billion yuan of that total came from the Jinhua
Commercial Center, the leading market in the zone.
</P>
<P>
The leading private business, the Sunshine Tourist Article Company,
one of the top 500 largest private enterprises in China, earned
150 million yuan in industrial output last year.
</P>
<P>
The development zone, which was established in July 1992, "will
make every effort to realize the transition from focusing on the
service sector to industry," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Toward this end, the zone has set up special areas majoring in
high-technology, export-oriented and private industries. Ten
processing plants primarily for export have become operational
within the year.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the administrative committee will upgrade the markets
by trying to improve the shopping environment, telecommunications
and services such as insurance and banking.

BRASILIA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The latest international
financial turmoil has made Brazilian authorities to expect less
foreign investment in the country over the next two years as well
as lower national economic growth.
</P>
<P>
According to government projections, foreign capital inflows
that were to enter Brazil for 1998 and 1999 should be worth 20

turmoil, the Brazilian Society for Studies on Economic
Globalization said today.
</P>
<P>
The society said that capital inflows for direct investment in
the country are expected to reach 15 billion dollars in 1997.
During the first 10 months of this year, a total of 14.2 billion
dollars entered the country.
</P>
<P>
The society said that due to the financial turmoil, the Gross
National Product of Brazil is expected to grow 1.5 percent 1998,
instead of the formerly expected 2.5 percent.

CARACAS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela registered an
inflation rate of 3.8 percent in October and an accumulated rate
of 30.5 percent for the first 10 months of this year, the Central
Bank of Venezuela has reported.
</P>
<P>
Price increases in October were the highest in the last 12
months, but the accumulated inflation rate was significantly lower
than the level of 91.5 percent in the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the bank said the inflation rate during the first
10 months was fueled by consumer expenses like education, school
transportation, health and medicines.
</P>
<P>
Rises in services and household expenses, including electric
power and telephone charges and gas and water supplies, also
fueled inflation.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Leadership Change Raises Uncertainty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The change of leadership in
the New Zealand National Party is likely to strain the party's
relations with its coalition partner NZ First, at least so for the
time being.
</P>
<P>
In a "coup" yesterday, the National replaced its leader Prime
Minister Jim Bolger with fifth-ranked cabinet member Jenny
Shipley. Shipley will take over as New Zealand's first woman prime
minister at the end of this month after Bolger returns from an
overseas trip.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister-designate will first face the task of
building a good relationship with National's junior partner NZ
First, its leader Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters in
particular.
</P>
<P>
Peters is reported to feel angry over National's leadership
change, saying he had not been informed about the matter
beforehand. The NZ First caucus is now meeting to assess the
consequence of the change.
</P>
<P>
"This is a matter of which we were given no notice whatsoever,
and that's the reason why we will need some time to discuss it,
both as a caucus and as a party," Peters said.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that his party would probably make a decision
early next week about whether to support National's new leader.
</P>
<P>
But Shipley said National and NZ First had total autonomy in
their selection of leaders. It is "a matter which requires
understanding and connection between those two parities, or indeed
other parties, at future dates in order to form governments," she
said.
</P>
<P>
However, she has repeatedly reaffirmed her commitment to the
coalition accord signed by her predecessor and Peters, describing
it as "an enduring document."
</P>
<P>
Despite Peters' displeasure at the oust of Bolger, whom he got
on quiet well in the past year, NZ First ministers seem to be
happy to work with Shipley.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out National's leadership had nothing to do with
them, and they would have no problem in working with another
National leader.
</P>
<P>
But for Shipley, the work is not easy. If she wants to hold the
coalition together, she must secure the support from NZ First to
ensure a government majority, and that support largely depends on
the attitude of Peters.
</P>
<P>
Her predecessor was toppled because many National MPs thought
that under Bolger's leadership, the party had lost direction. They
hope Shipley will chart a new direction for the National Party and
the coalition as well.
</P>
<P>
The question now is whether Peters is willing to sacrifice his
party's identity to go along that line with National.
</P>
<P>
This may be the biggest difficulty Shipley will have to address
for the next two years, if the coalition can survive that long.

<HEADLINE> Germany Wants to Be World No.1 Provider of Solar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Germany today announced its plan
to considerably expand its production capacity of solar cells and
modules in a bid to replace the United States as the world No.1
provider of solar technology.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed today by German Research Minister
Juergen Ruettgers and local governments of two western German
states, the German federal government would provide financial
support to set up a large solar cell factory in Gelsenkirchen in
the Ruhr industrial area.
</P>
<P>
Large capacity expansion is also planned at an existing solar
cell factory in the state of Bavaria.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the new production capacities, Germany would
be able to cover about one third of world demand for solar
technology in the future, Ruettgers announced.
</P>
<P>
Under a study conducted by the German Shell company, solar
energy is likely to cover 40 to 50 percent of the world energy
demand in about 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The current expensive production costs of solar energy are also
expected to be halved within five years through the application of
new technology and mass production of solar cells and modules.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Delegate on Reservations to Treaties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Vienna Convention on
the Law of Treaties should be applicable to all categories of
treaties, a Chinese delegate said here today.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Gao Yanping, representing the Chinese Delegation to a
meeting of the Sixth Committee of the current U.N. session, said
there is no need to make a specific distinction between human
rights treaties and other treaties and have a special regime of
reservations for the former.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was discussing the International Law Commission's
"Preliminary Conclusions on Reservations to Normative Multilateral
Treaties, Including Human Rights Treaties".
</P>
<P>
She said the Chinese Delegation agrees with the Preliminary
Conclusions that the regime of reservations established by the
Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties "is suited to the
requirements of all treaties".
</P>
<P>
The regime should not be simply discarded, nor should human
rights treaties be excluded from the Vienna regime for
reservations to treaties, as it is advocated by certain
organizations, she said.
</P>
<P>
Gao described some organizations' position as deviating from
the generally recognized position of international law. These
organizations stress the uniqueness of human rights treaties and
want a total prohibition of any reservations that states may make.
</P>
<P>
"In actual fact, it is a position that may well hinder some
states from becoming parties to these treaties and thus be harmful
to the protection of fundamental human rights through
international conventions," Gao said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the Preliminary Conclusions, Gao said the Chinese
Delegation agrees that its Paragraph 12 should be deleted as
suggested by some members of the Commission.
</P>
<P>
The paragraph could be understood that regional rules can be
different from the Vienna regime thus raising various
misunderstandings, she said.
</P>
<P>
The paragraph states that "the Commission emphasized that the
above conclusions are without prejudice to the practices and rules
developed by monitoring bodies within regional contexts".

<HEADLINE> US Buys Fighters From Moldova to Keep Them From Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States had bought
21 advanced Russian-made MIG-29C warplanes from the Republic of
Moldova and brought them to the U.S. to keep them away from Iran
and others, the Pentagon announced today.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen told reporters Iran had sought
to obtain the advanced fighters -- capable of launching nuclear
arms -- from the former Soviet state.
</P>
<P>
"Over the last two weeks, we have been transporting these MIGs
in C-17 transport aircraft from Moldova to Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base in Ohio," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Washington had agreed not to reveal the price tag
of the high-performance jets, among the world's most advanced
warplanes and the first "C" models of the MIG-29 obtained by
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Cohen praised Moldova's government for selling them to the U.S.
and said the cash-strapped country would receive surplus U.S.
military equipment and humanitarian aid funds from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Iran had actively attempted to get the jets, Cohen
said this had been the case. "Our understanding is that such an
approach was made. It was on their shopping list," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the United States would re-assemble the MIGs and
test them for capability, but that the main purpose in obtaining
them was to keep them away from states which might use them to
threaten America and its allies.
</P>
<P>
"This is a joint effort by both governments to ensure that
these dual-use military weapons do not fall into the hands of
countries that might use them against us or our friends or
allies," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Warns Iraq Not to Make "Big Mistake" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton
warned Iraq today that it would be a "big mistake" to try to shoot
down U.S. U-2 spy planes flying over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remarks when reporters gathering in the Rose
Garden at the White House asked how the United States would
respond if Iraq targeted unarmed U-2 scheduled to fly over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"That would be a big mistake," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton also stressed he wanted diplomatic solution to the
stalemate over Iraq's refusal of allowing Americans to take part
in U.N. weapons inspection teams, and he urged Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein to let the inspectors go on with their work.
</P>
<P>
"I believe at this moment we should do everything we can to
resolve this diplomatically," Clinton said. It was Clinton's first
public comments on the dispute since it arose last week.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Saddam had no valid reason to oppose the presence
of Americans in the U.N. weapons inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
"If he has nothing to hide, if he's not trying to hide weapons
of mass destruction, then he shouldn't care whether Americans or
anyone else are on the inspections team. This may be another
dodge," Clinton said.

WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
decided to impose new economic sanctions on Sudan for its
continued support for "terrorism," Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright announced today.
</P>
<P>
"We take these steps because the government of Sudan has failed
to respond to repeated expressions of concern or to the imposition
of lesser sanctions," Albright said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
She said President Clinton Monday signed an executive order
under the International Emergency Powers Act that calls for all
Sudanese assets in the United States to be blocked and imposes a
ban on bank loans and all U.S. exports to the country. Imports
from Sudan are also banned.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Endorses Clinton Fast-track Trade Authority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate today gave
green light to President Clinton's proposal for enhanced powers to
negotiate trade agreements, thus cleared a major hurdle.
</P>
<P>
The senators voted 69:31, which was nine more than the 60
needed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he appreciated the vote, and said it underscored
his argument that extending his trade negotiating authority is
necessary for upholding the United States' standing among world
nations.
</P>
<P>
"An America-last strategy is unacceptable," Clinton told
reporters in the White House Rose Garden. "If we fail to lead on
trade, our influence will suffer in other areas."
</P>
<P>
It is expected that prospects for passage of Clinton's
"fast-track" trade authority this fall appeared to be gaining in
the House as well.
</P>
<P>
The Senate passage came after the administration in an effort
to woo wavering Democrats offered expanded environmental and labor
protections. The president met with several senators Monday
evening at the White House and planned more meetings with
lawmakers today.
</P>
<P>
Clinton faces considerable difficulty in persuading Democrats
in the House to line up behind the plan, due to some criticism
they received for approving the North American Free Trade
Agreement in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Later this week, the administration also was expected to unveil
a program to assist workers affected by international trade
agreements or by changes in technology.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the White House said Monday it would support a
Senate bill calling for the U.S. trade representative to identify
countries where U.S. agricultural products are not offered in the
market, so that steps can be taken to remove the trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
The fast-track legislation would allow Clinton to present trade
agreements to Congress for simple yes-or-no votes, and deny
lawmakers the chance to amend them. Every president since 1974 has
had this power, but Clinton's renewal has been hung up in a
dispute over labor and environmental provisions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government also pledged to try and heighten awareness
of "core labor standards" within international organizations, and
vowed to pay particular attention to child labor.

ANKARA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel today called on Turkish citizens to donate more organs
to save more lives.
</P>
<P>
In his message to "organ transplant" week here, Demirel said
that not enough organ-transplants have been carried out in
Turkey and he urged people to cooperate in spreading the concept
of organ donation.
</P>
<P>
The president said that with progress made in medicine and
technology many diseases which have taken human lives for decades
have either been eradicated or became curable. He hoped organ
donation could succeed in saving more lives in the future.
</P>
<P>
Medical science in Turkey is following the latest
international scientific developments and can apply the methods
and techniques to its citizens, said Demirel, adding, "Turkey
has adequate technology to undertake organ transplants."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the legal framework for organ
transplants in Turkey had been prepared long ago and urged
people to become more aware of organ donation in order to
save lives.

<HEADLINE> More Interventionist Approach to Export Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 4 (Xinhua) - The British government should
take an active role in pulling together consortia of UK companies
to bid for large overseas contracts according to a report
published here today.
</P>
<P>
The report by the Export Forum calls for the government to move
towards a more interventionist approach to export promotion.
</P>
<P>
The Forum, a working party of business leaders and civil
servants, believes the government should select key markets and
sectors on which to focus the limited export support budget.
</P>
<P>
It expects that there may be some opposition to the government
picking export winners. But the Forum argues that business would
welcome the move.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that the Forum is not proposing that
the government should go as far as the Japanese Ministry of
International Trade and Industry in putting together consortia for
overseas projects.
</P>
<P>
But it recommends government be prepared to get more involved,
they said.
</P>
<P>
"If it is clear that there is a particular partnership that
would stand a good chance, the government ought to try to bring
the companies together and then throw its full diplomatic weight
behind them," said one forum member.
</P>
<P>
The Forum was set up in May immediately after the Labor Party
won the election, to review government export promotion efforts.
</P>
<P>
Bringing together business leaders and civil servants from the
Department of Trade and Industry and the Foreign Office, the Forum
has examined the effectiveness of trade promotion, trade fairs and
other export services.

<HEADLINE> US Warns Iraq of Consequences of Shooting Down U-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States warned
Iraq today that it would risk "serious consequences" if it tried
to shoot down U.S. U-2 spy planes scheduled to fly over Iraq this
week.
</P>
<P>
"Should there be any effort to attack that aircraft or put it
in any danger, we would view that as a very grave matter and with
serious consequences," Defense Secretary William Cohen said at a
Pentagon news conference. "Beyond that, I wouldn't care to
comment."
</P>
<P>
It was the first warning from the Clinton administration
against Iraq when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein vowed to gun down
any high-flying U-2, expected to conduct its next flight over Iraq
this week for the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) charged with
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the U-2 flight should go forward. It should
proceed safely to carry out its mission of inspection and we
expect the Iraqis to observe that requirement," Cohen told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
A three-man U.N. mission is on its way to Baghdad in an effort
to defuse the recent crisis following Iraq's refusal of allowing
three American arms inspectors of the UNSCOM to enter the country.
</P>
<P>
"We would hope that they (Iraqis) will listen very carefully to
the message delivered by the U.N. team that is on its way to Iraq,
that they would see the wisdom of abiding by the current
inspection regime and that a failure to do so obviously carries
consequences," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the next U-2 flight would be "this week" but
declined to say exactly when or whether it would be escorted by
armed U.S. attack planes. Some sources said the flight might take
place Wednesday or Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He also refused to say what military action, if any, the United
States might take if Iraqi missiles targeting radar "locked on" to
the U-2 in preparation for a possible attack.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Department spokesman James Rubin said at a
regular briefing that even to threaten to shoot down a U-2 would
be an "irresponsible escalation" of the recent tension, let alone
make good on the threat.

<HEADLINE> GCC Denounces Iraq for Withholding POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) states today blasted Iraq's imprisonment of prisoners of
war (POW) and urged the international community to press Baghdad
to set them free, the Qatari news agency said.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued today in the Qatari capital Doha,
the GCC defense ministers expressed their "criticism and anger"
on Iraq's withholding POWs and citizens who were seized by Iraqi
troops during the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The GCC ministers called the international community to make
efforts to assure the release of the prisoners and citizens and
they also urged Baghdad to implement international regulations.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers made the statement after a two-day
meeting which concluded in Doha today. During the meeting,
they discussed military cooperation and the region's security.
</P>
<P>
The GCC countries, which include Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the
UAE, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman claimed that after the 1991 Gulf
War, hundreds of Kuwaiti and Saudi Arabian service members and
citizens were still kept in Iraq's custodies.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has denied the claim, saying it had submitted all the
names of the prisoners and citizens held by Iraqi troops
during the Gulf War.

<P>
Organized by the Swedish Organization of Children Welfare and
the Yemeni Committee on Promotion of Awareness Against Mines, the
symposium was attended by 23 Arab countries and a number of
international and non-governmental anti-mines organizations.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, termed as the "Sanaa Declaration," the
symposium supports the elimination of planted mines, within the
framework of international and regional humanitarian cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The participants appealed to the international community,
foremost the countries that produce and export personal mines, to
bear the humanitarian responsibility of helping the inflicted
states, Yemen in particular, to rid themselves of this grave
danger to human kind.
</P>
<P>
They asserted the importance of continued international
humanitarian efforts which were initiated by a world appeal issued
in Ottawa in 1996 for an overall ban on mines.
</P>
<P>
They also called upon the international community to extend
further cooperation and make effective contribution in this
direction in order to put a complete end to the sufferings and
tragedies of innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the annual landmine victims in the world
are around 26,000, 90 percent of whom are civilians.

<HEADLINE> British Supporters Protest as Woodward's Ruling Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of people flocked in
British nanny Louise Woodward's home village of Elton in northwest
England today to watch the court proceedings relayed live from
Massachusetts of the United States on television.
</P>
<P>
They groaned when U.S. Judge Hiller Zobel said he would
postpone the ruling on an application by Woodward's lawyers for a
review of the murder verdict and pledged to keep protesting
Woodward's innocence.
</P>
<P>
The campaign to release 19-year-old Woodward, sentenced last
Friday to life imprisonment for the murder of eight-month-old
Matthew Eappen, has drawn the world's media to this small town of
3,500 people.
</P>
<P>
"When something is not right it can take many attempts to get
it right. We will fight on to the end and that means when Louise
is free," local press quoted a woman supporter as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to believe Zobel knows she is innocent and is
looking for a way to satisfy all sides in the case," she said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of supporters marched around the village earlier
demanding "Justice now" for their fellow villager.
</P>
<P>
Woodward's conviction has also sparked protests in America and
brought the wrath of British newspapers down on the U.S. legal
system.
</P>
<P>
Many supporters said they hoped the judge would overturn the
original verdict of second degree murder and acquit Woodward.
</P>
<P>
The "Louise Woodward Campaign for Justice" has so far raised
over 100,000 pounds and donations and letters of support are being
delivered by the sackload.
</P>
<P>
The donations will be used to allow Woodward's parents to stay
in Boston near where their daughter is being held at Framingham
women's prison.

<HEADLINE> Britain Issues Invitation to Argentine Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 4 (Xinhua) - The British Government has
invited the Argentine President Carlos Menem on an official visit
to Britain next year in a bid to boost bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The invitation was extended during a meeting here today between
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and his Argentine counterpart, Guido
di Tella.
</P>
<P>
A foreign Office spokesman said Menem's visit would focus on
bilateral relations between the two nations. It will be the first
visit to Britain by an Argentine head of state since the 1982
Falklands war.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have recently improved
after a period of decline after the war. Some 1,000 servicemen
died in the 10-week conflict.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Cook and di Tella had discussed trade and
investment and cooperation on fisheries and oil exploration in the
South Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
Argentina is Britain's second largest market in the area.

<HEADLINE> US Awaiting UN Team's Results Over Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
awaiting the results of a U.N. team's effort to break an impasse
over Iraq barring American inspectors from entering the country
before deciding whether to take any unilateral action, the White
House said today.
</P>
<P>
"We will await the results of Secretary-General (Kofi) Annan's
delegation and it is en route to Baghdad right now," White House
spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
White House officials said the United States remained firm that
Iraq must back down and allow American inspectors to take part in
the activities of U.N. weapons inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
They said President Bill Clinton's foreign policy advisers had
reviewed the situation and discussed ways it might take over the
next several weeks. The foreign policy advisers, including
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary William
Cohen and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, were said to
have met at the White House Monday night.
</P>
<P>
They had "discussed a wide range of scenarios that might play
themselves over the next several weeks," the White House officials
said.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said Clinton would update Congressional leaders on the
situation later today during a meeting at the White House to
discuss a number of foreign policy issues.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Cohen warned Iraq that any move to endanger or attack
a U-2 spy plane scheduled to fly over Iraq this week would trigger
"serious consequences."
</P>
<P>
"Should there be any effort to attack that aircraft or put it
in any danger, we would view that as a very grave matter and with
serious consequences," he said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein should "listen very
carefully to the message delivered by a three-man U.N. team" that
is on its way to Baghdad, trying to defuse the stalemate caused by
Iraq's prevention of American inspectors from entering the country.
