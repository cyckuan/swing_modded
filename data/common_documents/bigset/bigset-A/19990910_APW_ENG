<HEADLINE> Frank Thomas To Undergo Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago White Sox slugger Frank Thomas will  
undergo season-ending surgery on his injured right ankle Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was made Friday after consulation with Thomas, team  
podiatrist Dr. Lowell Scott Weil, White Sox general manager Ron 
Schueler and trainer Herm Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was not at the ballpark Friday to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	``We decided it was in everyone's best interest to go ahead and  
move Frank's surgery up instead of waiting until after the season 
ended,'' Schueler said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the surgery, Weil will remove a bone spur from Thomas'  
ankle and the corn from his small toe, and perform several other 
minor podiatric procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas finished with a .305 average, 15 home runs and 77 RBIs.  
It's the first time he has not driven in 100 RBIs or hit at least 
20 home runs since 1990, his first full season in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, 31, has been bothered by the corn on his toe for much of  
the season and returned to Chicago on Monday from the team's road 
trip to undergo tests Tuesday. X-rays confirmed a significant spur 
on his right ankle and an ultrasound confirmed tendinitis in the 
ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	He has not played since striking out as a pinch-hitter Sept. 6  
in the first game of a doubleheader at Texas. He last started on 
Sept. 3 before leaving in the third inning with a bruised ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was batting .271 since the All-Star break with just three  
homers and 20 RBIs. After stating in spring training that he 
intended to play about 100 games at first base, Thomas changed his 
tune and insisted he was strictly a designated hitter. In 50 games 
at first, Thomas hit .346, and he batted .281 as the designated 
hitter.

<HEADLINE> Ads Explain V-Chips to Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With at least half of all new television sets  
equipped with v-chips, new public service announcements starring 
Kermit the Frog are trying to get over one of the biggest 
challenges of the technology: Parents don't know how to use the 
v-chips. 
</P>
<P>
	The service announcements being developed by Odyssey, a Hallmark  
&AMP; Henson network, and The Jim Henson Co., will feature Kermit 
explaining the v-chip's purpose, its practical applications and the 
rating system that works with the device. 
</P>
<P>
	The public service announcements, to be completed in a few  
months, will be made available to system operators that carry 
Odyssey to 29 million subscribers. Others would be able to use the 
spots as well. Radio spots and education materials featuring Kermit 
are also in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators welcomed the effort from the industry to get the word  
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents need to have information on how to use the v-chip to  
protect their kids from violent or sexually explicit programming,'' 
said Federal Communications Commission Chairman Bill Kennard. 
</P>
<P>
	V-chips work with an electronically coded ratings system to  
allows parents to block objectionable programming from their 
children. A 1996 telecommunications law requires all new TV sets 13 
inches and larger to come with the technology by 2000.

<HEADLINE> Vasser Rolling on Racetrack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTEREY, Calif. (AP) -- Jimmy Vasser has watched rookie teammate  
Juan Montoya wipe out the competition most of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into Sunday's Shell 300 at Laguna Seca Raceway, the 1996  
CART FedEx Series champion is doing some wiping up himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Vasser has no shot at his second title, he is looking  
at the possibility of finishing in the top five after scoring 60 of 
his 94 points in his last five start. 
</P>
<P>
	After a terrible early season, Vasser has had top-five finishes  
in his last four races, including back-to-back thirds at Chicago 
and Vancouver. He has scored PPG Cup points in six consecutive 
events and 13 of 16 overall this season, tying him with Dario 
Franchitti for the series lead in that department. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both Juan and I are benefiting from an experienced team that  
is communicating and performing at a very high level,'' Vasser 
said. ``It's inspiring to have those kinds of guys around, who are 
dedicated to doing all they can to win races and championships. You 
can see the results on the track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's certainly true of Montoya, a 23-year-old Colombian who  
has turned the championship race into a rout with four of 20 races 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	There are still three drivers who can catch The Great Juan in  
the standings, but only runner-up Franchitti is less than a 
longshot. And the Scotsman understands how difficult catching 
Montoya will be. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't make any mistakes,'' said Franchitti, who trails  
Montoya by 23 points. ``It's as simple as that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Andretti, a distant third in the standings, has failed  
to score a point in the last two races -- crashing last month in 
Chicago and costing himself a shot at victory last week in 
Vancouver when he spun on a wet track. 
</P>
<P>
	After heading into Chicago just 27 points behind Montoya,  
Andretti now trails the youngster by 70, with a maximum of 88 
points still on the table. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel terrible about spinning in Vancouver, but we have moved  
on and take each race at a time,'' the two-time Monterey winner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti said he is hopeful that Sunday's race on the  
picturesque 2.238-mile permanent road course, nestled in the hills 
of Northern California's Monterey Peninsula, will jump-start his 
title chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had the best race weekend of my career here in 1991,'' he  
said. ``I won the pole, led every lap, won the race and clinched 
the championship. I could really use that kind of a weekend right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Tracy, fourth in the standings, just two points behind  
Andretti, is the last driver with a mathematical chance to catch 
Montoya. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy, Franchitti's teammate and another two-time Monterey  
winner, has suffered much the same fate as Andretti in the last two 
races, crashing and failing to score any points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team hasn't tested at Laguna Seca this season, but I don't  
see that as a disadvantage,'' Tracy said. ``We've got plenty of 
good data on the circuit and the cars. We've shown we are as fast 
as anybody on the road courses. Now it's up to us to execute a 
mistake-free weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the others have to play catch-up, Montoya knows he simply  
has to remain consistent to give Target/Chip Ganassi Racing a CART 
record fourth consecutive championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Vasser started the championship run in 1996, clinching the title  
in Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
	Vasser's then-teammate Alex Zanardi, who won championships each  
of the past two seasons, also clinched last year at Laguna Seca. 
</P>
<P>
	``This points race has been so intense that I wish I could  
clinch it in Monterey like Jimmy and Alex did,'' Montoya said. 
``But I'm having fun and expect to race well here, and hopefully 
increase my points lead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don't bet against the kid.  
</P>
<P>
	He arrives in Monterey for the start of practice and qualifying  
today with six poles and seven victories, including the second of a 
pair of three-race winning strings. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory on Sunday would give the fearless youngster with the  
amazing car control a CART record four straight wins, matching the 
mark set in 1990 by Al Unser Jr. in 1990 and equaled last year by 
Zanardi. 
</P>
<P>
	It would also match the CART record of eight victories in a  
season, set by Andretti in 1991 and equaled by Unser in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Addresses Baptist Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The next civil rights battle is for the  
classroom and the pocketbook. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what GOP presidential hopeful Steve Forbes told one of  
the nation's largest black denominations, whose members were 
gathered for the annual meeting of the National Baptist Convention 
USA. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine publisher, speaking Thursday to an audience of  
about 7,000, said he would promote educational freedom through 
faith-based schools and school choice grants and would reform 
Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know something about creating wealth, and let me tell you:  
One way we could help every American family create personal wealth 
is to give younger workers the freedom to have the majority of 
their Social Security taxes directly deposited into their own 
personal individual retirement accounts,'' Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The money could be put in a variety of investment possibilities  
-- mutual funds, government bonds or bank CDs. And the holder would 
have to be a certain age to get the money. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan could lift millions of Americans out of poverty, he  
said. A person earning $36,000 a year who could retire with a nest 
egg of more than $1 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When a person dies, that money would go tax-free to a spouse,  
children or grandchildren -- not back to the government as it does 
under the present Social Security setup. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes also sounded his recurring theme of a flat tax.  
</P>
<P>
	On education, the 52-year-old Forbes said he would block federal  
education grant funds and send them back to states and local 
communities to let parents choose where and how to school their 
children -- whether it be public, private, charter, or home school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not long ago, certain politicians stood in the school house  
door to keep children out of good schools,'' Forbes said. ``Today, 
we find big government politicians standing in the school house 
door to keep children trapped in dangerous, failing schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the convention delegates were also in Tampa to elect a  
successor to the Rev. Henry J. Lyons. Lyons resigned in disgrace in 
March and is serving state and federal prison sentences for 
financial misdealings growing out of convention business. Forbes 
was the only presidential candidate to address the influential 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	Convention board member the Rev. Charles Noble said while the  
group does not endorse any candidate, many black Baptists would 
stand behind Forbes in his quest for the Oval Office.

<HEADLINE>  Greece Rescuers Scale Back Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Rescue crews were gradually scaling back  
the search for survivors today amid the mounds of crushed concrete 
and twisted metal from buildings that collapsed in Greece's 
deadliest quake in more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite working round the clock, emergency crews said they had  
found no more signs of life amid the rubble, as the death toll rose 
today to 97. More than two dozen people were still missing. 
</P>
<P>
	International crews concentrated their searches, using  
ultra-sensitive listening equipment and sniffer dogs, on six sites, 
including a cleaning products factory where a 31-year-old woman was 
rescued Thursday after nearly 46 hours under the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulldozers and other heavy equipment were kept away from areas  
with any hope of a survivor from Tuesday's 5.9 quake. After last 
month's massive quake in Turkey, a 4-year-old was saved after more 
than six days. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always hope,'' said Panaghiotis Fourlas, deputy chief  
of the Greek Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
	At the flattened factory, crews periodically asked for silence  
to allow microphones to pick up any encouraging sounds from below. 
But since Thursday's rescue, there's been only silence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope someone is still there alive. I hope they've fainted or  
something,'' said Grigoris Angelopoulos, a 34-year-old computer 
programmer heading a 16-man Red Cross rescue crew picking carefully 
through all that's left of a four-story apartment block in the 
northern Athens suburb of Metamorfosi. 
</P>
<P>
	The Athens quake is the deadliest to hit Greece since 1953, when  
a magnitude 7.2 temblor flattened the Ionian island of Cephalonia, 
killing 476 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people left homeless crowded into tents, indoor  
sports stadiums and local hotel rooms provided by authorities, 
while others slept in their cars or hastily erected tarps outside 
their damaged homes, fearing looters could show up if they left 
their apartments unattended. So far, there have been few reports of 
looting. 
</P>
<P>
	About 8,000 police officers have been assigned to patrol the  
hardest-hit areas in an attempt to convince residents it was safe 
to leave their homes for the camps, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ano Liosia, an impoverished town north of Athens that was  
among the heaviest hit, a camp of some 200 people has sprung up in 
front of the Panagia Kanala monastery. The Greek Orthodox monks had 
to haggle for tents from local officials, and promised aid has not 
appeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``People come to me every morning asking for tents and help. We  
do what we can,'' said the monastery's head, Father Dorotheos, who 
was also rendered homeless by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said 12,000 tents were  
being erected to accommodate more than 70,000 people who could be 
homeless ``for a few months'' -- well into the season when the 
weather can turn raw and rainy. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers toured the worst-struck areas -- mainly poor immigrant  
and Gypsy neighborhoods -- spray-painting a red X on buildings to 
mark the more badly damaged for demolition. A yellow mark meant 
temporarily uninhabitable, while green signifies the building is 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, more than 1,000 buildings have been marked for  
demolition. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has announced a wide range of aid and benefit  
packages for quake victims, including cash donations and 
interest-free long-term loans to finance the rebuilding of homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have launched investigations into whether building  
shortcuts were used to circumvent Greece's strict anti-quake 
standards.

<HEADLINE> Wendy's Sues Over Web Site Names </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Wendy's International is suing a Dallas  
company for registering Web sites in its name and then allegedly 
trying to sell them back to the fast-food restaurant chain. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks a permanent injunction prohibiting alleged  
``cyberpirate'' Brenan Hofstadter and his company, Beswick Adams 
Corp., from using any Wendy's trademark names on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit alleges Hofstadter devised a scheme to extort payments  
from Wendy's and at least 10 other major U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendy's, which is based in Dublin, Ohio, filed the suit this  
week in U.S. District Court in Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	Hofstadter allegedly registered the names of Web sites with  
Network Solutions Inc., a Virginia company that registers Internet 
addresses. In recent months, Network Solutions reportedly has been 
cracking down on people who register domain names they hope to 
resell at a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendy's claims Hofstadter registered Web sites under the names  
www.Wendys.org; www.WendysRestaurant.com; 
www.WendysRestaurants.com; and WendysIntlInc.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendy's has registered its Web site at www.Wendys.com.  
</P>
<P>
	The company says an officer of Beswick Adams sent a letter on  
March 14 to Gordon F. Teter, Wendy's president and chief executive 
officer, asking the company to buy the Web names. 
</P>
<P>
	Without court intervention, Wendy's fears Hofstadter and his  
company could sell the Web names to someone else, the suit said. 
Also, the Dallas company might establish Web sites on the Internet 
under the four addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	That ``could greatly harm Wendy's and its reputation,'' the suit  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Hofstadter could not immediately be reached to comment today.  
There is no phone listing for Beswick Adams Corp. in the Dallas 
area. A telephone message was left at a home listing in 
Hofstadter's name. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wendy's suit says Beswick Adams also has registered Web  
sites in the names of Miller Brewing, Taco Bell, State Farm 
Insurance, Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, McDonald's, Ameritech, Sony 
Corp., Subway restaurants and Burger King. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies have been successful in similar disputes.  
</P>
<P>
	In February, a federal judge in Houston ordered two Texas men to  
turn over 11 Internet domain names to Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft had filed a federal lawsuit against the men, claiming  
trademark infringement after the men registered such domain names 
as microsoftwindows.com and microsoftoffice.com. 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1998, a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled  
that ``cyber piracy,'' or registering a company's name as your own 
Internet domain name, then trying to sell it back to the company, 
violates federal trademark laws.

<HEADLINE> Online Auctions Feature Odd, Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Used, dirty underwear. A healthy human  
kidney. A young man's virginity. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucked among the Depression-era sherbet glasses and aging Sonny  
and Cher albums on Internet auction sites are an amazing array of 
items -- some of them illegal, and other simply just cranks. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for the jokesters and criminals, an online auction  
is one of the least anonymous places to try to pull a fast one. 
</P>
<P>
	``If an investigator calls, we tell them don't bother with a  
subpoena. We give them names, addresses, telephone numbers, credit 
card numbers, whatever we can,'' said Robert Chesnut, a former 
federal prosecutor who now works for eBay. 
</P>
<P>
	Toy kidneys can be sold, but real ones are illegal. So are  
babies, child pornography and dirty underwear. Clean underwear, 
however, is legal, Chesnut said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's reporting has led to several fraud prosecutions,  
and eBay has worked with Secret Service agents, postal inspectors, 
New York Police Department detectives and other investigators 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's leading Internet auction site, eBay hosts thousands  
of legitimate auctions daily. It's one of the most popular sites on 
the Internet, with people gathering to bid on assorted items or to 
chat with other members of the personal trading community. 
</P>
<P>
	But eBay's high profile also lends itself to a number of crank  
proposals, which can often generate a few bids before being 
discovered by eBay officials and pulled. 
</P>
<P>
	One recent example: an auction for a young man's virginity. (The  
seller did not respond to an Associated Press e-mail query). 
</P>
<P>
	And earlier this week, more than 75 human kidneys and several  
babies were posted for auction at eBay after one seller's hoax made 
national news. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has suspended all of the kidney and baby dealers  
from their site, and referred them to law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly there's room for people to be funny on the Internet,  
but I think people need to exercise good judgment. There are 
transplant patients waiting years for a kidney. To them, this is 
not a joking matter,'' said Steve Westly, eBay's vice president of 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the would-be kidney sellers contacted by The Associated  
Press said they were joking. However, Ian Thomas of Pass Christian, 
Miss., said he wasn't kidding when he posted an auction that began: 
``Health conscious, fully functional kidney, 30's male with daily 
intakes of springwater, vitamins and exercise.''

<HEADLINE> Life Insurance Scheme Is Faulted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The companies promised investors  
their money would go to buy life insurance policies of the 
terminally ill, providing the patients with much-needed cash and 
the investors with a lucrative opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the companies swindled more than $115 million from at  
least 5,000 people, many of them elderly, and used the funds to 
support lavish lifestyles, according to a federal indictment 
unsealed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A meager $6 million of the $115 million was used to buy  
legitimate policies, the indictment alleges. Much of the rest was 
spent on two dozen homes, 34 cars, two helicopters -- even on a Fort 
Lauderdale burrito shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Frederick Brandau, 54, of Davie; an in-house attorney; a nurse  
and two of Brandau's companies -- Financial Federated Title &AMP; Trust 
Inc. and Asset Security Corp. -- were charged with 44 counts of wire 
and mail fraud, money laundering and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment, returned Aug. 13, was unsealed hours after  
federal agents arrested Brandau at Miami International Airport 
after he was denied entry into Bogota, Colombia, according to the 
FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	``For two years, the defendants preyed upon investors who were  
naive, unsophisticated and in many instances senior citizens who'd 
invested their life savings,'' said FBI senior supervisory agent 
Alan Sadowski. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors planned to write letters to between 5,000 to  
6,000 investors who are potential victims of the alleged scheme, 
which ran from 1996 to August of this year. Many of them may not 
know they've lost money because they didn't expect to see a return 
for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The investors were told their funds would be used to buy  
discounted life insurance policies of the terminally ill. In what 
is known as a viatical settlement, the investor would receive the 
full value of the policy upon the patient's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial Federated, of Fort Lauderdale, and a related company,  
American Benefit Services Inc., of Lake Worth, and their employees 
have been under investigation by various federal and state agencies 
for allegations ranging from deceptive marketing to selling bogus 
viaticals. 
</P>
<P>
	American Benefit is fighting an order to turn over its records  
to state insurance fraud investigators. It earlier reached a 
settlement with the state comptroller's office which was 
investigating American Benefit for selling unregistered securities. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the federal indictment unsealed Friday, Brandau,  
along with attorney Garland Hogan, nurse Mary Anne Billinghurst and 
possibly others induced people to send checks, wire transfers or 
money orders to Financial Federated, enticing them with false 
representations of how the money would be used. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandau and Hogan were being held in the Palm Beach County Jail,  
and authorities were looking for Billinghurst, said Assistant U.S. 
Attorney Ellen Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, authorities said they'd arrested Gary J. Pierce,  
48, of Studio City, Calif., in connection with a criminal complaint 
related to the same scheme. He has been charged with mail fraud and 
conspiracy with his role operating CSI Ag Ltd., an offshore 
multinational mining company that bought Financial Federated's 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandau's lawyer, Thomas Sclafani, did not immediately return a  
call for comment Friday. However, he has said his client was not 
running a scam and that CSI would cover all investors' assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents already have begun seizing the homes, automobiles  
and other items they claim were purchased with funds from investors 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors seeking more information can call the Miami office of  
the U.S. attorney, 1-800-379-4643.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Urges Safer Cargo Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two recent incidents show the importance of  
adding collision-avoidance systems to cargo airplanes, the National 
Transportation Safety Board said in a letter to the Federal 
Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The board wants the FAA to expand an order currently requiring  
such systems on passenger planes also to cover cargo jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though cargo companies are working on a new  
collision-avoidance system, the board said, the availability of 
existing technology makes its immediate installation advisable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hundreds of air cargo flights use the air traffic system every  
day, sharing airspace with passenger flights and other users,'' 
board Chairman Jim Hall wrote Thursday in a letter to FAA 
Administrator Jane Garvey. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA typically takes time to review the board's safety  
recommendations before responding formally. 
</P>
<P>
	However, agency spokesman Alison Duquette said: ``We are in the  
process of developing a proposal to install collision-avoidance 
equipment on cargo airplanes.'' She could not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall pointed to two incidents in recommending  
collision-avoidance technology on cargo planes: 
</P>
<P>
	--On Feb. 6, a FedEx DC-10 and an Air Canada Airbus A-320 almost  
collided over Lincoln, Neb. The accident was avoided when the Air 
Canada plane, equipped with collision-avoidance equipment, detected 
the FedEx plane and plotted out a path out of its course. 
</P>
<P>
	--On March 2, another FedEx DC-10 and an American International  
Airways L-1011 almost collided about 30 miles west of Salina, Kan. 
Both planes lost contact with air traffic controllers, and neither 
had collision-avoidance systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA ordered installation of collision-avoidance systems on  
passenger planes starting in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Defend Banking Secrecy Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Switzerland's economy minister and  
banking industry officials said Friday the country's bank secrecy 
law should remain in place and vowed to resist any pressure to 
weaken it. 
</P>
<P>
	The obligation for bankers to be discreet is an  
``extraordinarily important component of the Swiss legal system,'' 
Economy Minister Pascal Couchepin told business leaders at a 
conference in Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
	While Switzerland has adapted its secrecy laws to help foreign  
investigators combat tax fraud, that doesn't apply to tax evasion, 
which isn't a criminal offense in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has  
been firing ``poison arrows'' and demanding the abolition of 
banking secrecy in tax matters, Swiss Bankers Association president 
Georg Krayer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts by the OECD and the European Union to eliminate  
international tax competition could create additional pressure on 
Switzerland to give up its secrecy law, Krayer added. 
</P>
<P>
	Couchepin stressed that bankers must avoid using the secrecy  
obligation as a cover for criminal activity, but said the Swiss 
cabinet ``is opposed to efforts to weaken banking client secrecy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A change to the law in April 1998 requires bankers and other  
money managers to report suspected money laundering and freeze the 
assets in question. Authorities say such reports have quadrupled 
since the change. 
</P>
<P>
	The change, which brought Switzerland up to basic international  
standards for dealing with money laundering, came after a series of 
embarrassing episodes involving assets deposited in the country by 
former foreign rulers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the country's high court ordered the transfer of assets  
belonging to the late Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos to the 
Philippines, saying it was against Swiss interests ``to serve as a 
safe haven'' for flight capital or criminal proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Also frozen in Switzerland pending legal action are assets  
belonging to the former Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.

<HEADLINE> Schott Seeks To Bar Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott asked a  
federal judge Friday to bar lawyers from questioning her about her 
racial opinions as part of a civil lawsuit concerning a 
minor-league baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott's lawyers filed a motion in U.S. District Court asking  
Judge Walter Rice to prevent any inquiry into her religious beliefs 
or practices, ethnic background, or opinions on racial relations 
and racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott is to be questioned in private later this month by  
lawyers for Baseball at Trotwood Inc., which tried unsuccessfully 
to bring a minor-league team to the Dayton area. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds ultimately granted territorial rights to the Dayton  
Professional Baseball Club, allowing that group to bring a Class-A 
Reds affiliate to Dayton next spring. The team will compete in the 
Midwest League. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dayton Professional Baseball Club and Schott have been sued  
by Baseball at Trotwood, which alleges it was the victim of racial 
discrimination. One of Baseball at Trotwood's investors was former 
boxing promoter Rock Newman, who is black. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott twice has been disciplined by Major League Baseball for  
making inflammatory remarks. She was suspended by baseball's 
executive council for the 1993 season because of ``racially and 
ethnically offensive'' remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott agreed to turn over daily operation of the Reds to John  
Allen in 1996 rather than accept another suspension for additional 
inflammatory remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	The request by Schott's lawyers said she played no part in the  
Reds' decision to grant territorial rights to the Dayton 
Professional Baseball Club because she had been suspended from 
making such decisions at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her own background and views have no relevance to any  
decisions being challenged by the plaintiffs as being 
discriminatory,'' the motion said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said any questioning of Schott would be designed only to  
``annoy, embarrass or oppress'' her and waste her time. 
</P>
<P>
	Anne Frayne, lawyer for Baseball at Trotwood, said her client  
would oppose Schott's motion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears the defendants don't want us to get to the real  
issue at hand, which is racial discrimination,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Charlotte Schools Integrated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A federal judge today ordered the  
Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system to stop using race as a factor 
in all of its programs and ended 30 years of race-based classroom 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	The school system ``is enjoined from assigning children to  
schools or allocating educational opportunities and benefits 
through race-based lotteries, preferences, set-asides, or other 
means that deny students an equal footing based on race,'' U.S. 
District Judge Robert Potter said in his 115-page decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Luke Largess, a lawyer for two black families who sued the  
school district 30 years ago, said Potter overstepped his authority 
and his clients would appeal. He joined the school district in 
defending against the current lawsuit, brought by a groups of white 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he's saying is you cannot use race in any aspect of  
operating the educational system,'' Largess said. ``It's an 
interesting legal question whether he can do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Potter's ruling allows assignments for the 1999-2000 school year  
to remain in place ``in the interest of stability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven white parents had asked Potter to declare the  
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools integrated. The Charlotte school 
system is the state's largest, with 100,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was watched by legal experts and educators nationwide  
because the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case, Swann vs. 
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, led to busing to achieve 
desegregation nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	At a trial of the parents' lawsuit earlier this year, Charlotte  
school officials opposed removal of court supervision, favoring a 
new plan that allowed parents to choose the schools their children 
would attend. 
</P>
<P>
	A school district spokesperson said school officials wouldn't  
comment on the court decision until after a hastily scheduled 
midday school board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Parks, an attorney for one of the plaintiffs, said he hadn't  
had a chance to read the decision in detail but was pleased with 
the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Potter said in his decision that the district met the test of  
whether it has remedied past segregation problems ``quite some time 
ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is telling that CMS' current superintendent was unable to  
articulate any benefit from continued active-court supervision,'' 
Potter wrote, referring to Superintendent Eric Smith's testimony 
during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Potter declared the school system ``unitary,'' meaning three  
decades of court supervision would end. Other districts that have 
been declared unitary, such as those in Cleveland, Denver and 
Norfolk, Va., were released from court-ordered desegregation plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit began in September 1997, when Bill Capacchione sued  
the Charlotte school board after his daughter Cristina was twice 
denied entrance into an elementary school's communications magnet 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Cristina, who is half white and half Hispanic, fell into the  
``nonblack'' category that the school system uses to allot magnet 
seats. Capacchione said Cristina's constitutional rights were 
violated when she ``was not permitted to compete equally with 
similarly situated black people because she is not of a preferred 
race under CMS policy.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women's Beach Team Wins Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A two-hour drive down the freeway for a major  
tournament sure makes life easier for the world's top young women's 
beach volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenny Johnson Jordan and Annett Buckner Davis needed just 19  
minutes to rout sisters Rebekka Kadijk and Deborah Schoon Kadijk of 
the Netherlands 15-1 Friday in the opening round of the Oldsmobile 
Alero Beach Volleyball Series, which is part of the inaugural U.S. 
Olympic Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Their cheering section included Jenny's father, 1960 Olympic  
decathlon gold medalist Rafer Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the third stop in the Alero Series, designed to help  
young teams like Johnson Jordan-Buckner Davis face top teams on 
U.S. sand and make decent money to help defray the cost of 
competing internationally. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. teams must play in a minimum number of Alero tournaments  
this year and next to be nominated into international tournaments, 
where they earn points toward qualifying for the Sydney Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the five Olympic Cup sports, only beach volleyball has prize  
money. The winning men's and women's teams each get $20,000 out of 
a $150,000 purse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a blessing for the American players not to have to travel  
12 hours in a plane to get to international competition,'' said 
Johnson Jordan, who like her teammate is from the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
	Which is why Johnson Jordan and Buckner Davis, seeded No. 1  
here, wonder why the men's Association of Volleyball Professionals, 
in a dispute with Alero organizers, would bar its two eligible 
teams from playing here. No AVP teams means no Karch Kiraly, who 
won the inaugural Olympic beach volleyball gold medal with Kent 
Steffes at Atlanta in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to have a team win in the Olympics on the men's  
side, I think they need to play as much as they can,'' Buckner 
Davis said. ``I think they need to see the international guys, 
because that's who they're going to play once they get to the 
Olympics. I think it's sad they're not here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. teams that replaced the AVP teams of Kiraly-Adam  
Johnson and Dain Blanton-Eric Fonoimoana were quickly eliminated 
Friday with two losses apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, it wasn't a good day for the United States, which lost  
six of nine head-to-head matches with international teams. However, 
the United States is guaranteed at least one women's team in the 
medal round: either Johnson Jordan-Buckner Davis or the No. 3 duo 
of Lisa Arce-Barbra Fontana, who meet in the second round on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Arce-Fontana scored an opening 15-7 win over Australia's Natalie  
Cook-Kerri Pottharst, the 1996 Olympic bronze medalists. 
</P>
<P>
	The top U.S. men's team of Robert Heidger-Kevin Wong beat  
Argentina's Esteban Martinez-Martin Conde 15-7 to advance to the 
second round. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 2 American men's team of Sinjin Smith-Carl Henkel  
bounced back from a 15-10 loss to Canada's John Child-Mark Heese to 
eliminate the No. 4 USA team of Mike Mattarocci-Devin Poolman. 
</P>
<P>
	In a loser's bracket match, the No. 4 USA team of Linda  
Hanley-Nancy Reno eliminated the No. 2 American team of Liz 
Masakayan-Elaine Youngs 15-13. 
</P>
<P>
	In boxing, newly crowned world champion Brian Viloria of  
Honolulu stopped Russia's Ali Omarov at 1:56 of the third round to 
win the light flyweight gold medal. Referee Vasyi Kugayer halted 
the bout after Viloria concluded a series of body blows with a left 
hook to the kidney. 
</P>
<P>
	Viloria, 18, had an 18-4 edge in blows landed, including a hard  
right that forced Omarov to take a standing 8 count to end the 
first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that I'm the world champion, it makes me feel I have to  
train even a little harder,'' Viloria said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the five U.S. boxers to reach the finals won gold  
medals in a competition limited to the eight lighter weight 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Flyweight Gabriel Elizondo, of San Antonio, Texas, used a strong  
finish for a 22-18 decision over Mexico's Daniel Ponce after 
trailing 16-5 starting the third round. Lightweight Mahlon Kerwick, 
of Spokane, Wash., scored an 18-13 decision over Russia's Makhach 
Nouroutdinov. 
</P>
<P>
	Bantamweight Clarence Vinson, of Washington, D.C., lost to  
Ukraine's Eduard Lutsker 11-9 and light middleweight Darnell 
Wilson, of Lafayette, Ind., fell to Ukraine's Sergiy Kostanko 
17-12.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise As Inflation Fears Ease / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices rose Friday on mild  
inflation news that appeared to lessen the possibility that 
interest rates would be raised again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 11/16  
point, or $6.87 1/2 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which 
moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.04 percent from 
Thursday's 6.09 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The market rose early after the Labor Department reported the  
Producer Price Index, a widely used measure of inflation at the 
wholesale level, rose 0.5 percent in August. 
</P>
<P>
	While that surpassed economists' expectations for a 0.3 percent  
increase, the report was taken as a benign indicator. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the so-called core rate of inflation, which  
excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, actually fell 0.1 
percent in August, after being unchanged in July. Analysts had 
forecast a slight rise of 0.1 percent for August. 
</P>
<P>
	The core index figures provided confidence to bond traders that  
the Federal Reserve may not need to raise interest rates for a 
third time in 1999. The Fed raised rates last month and in June in 
an attempt to slow the economy to a sustainable, noninflationary 
growth rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasurys also received a boost from a slightly stronger dollar,  
which gained ground on the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasury securities were up 3/32 point to 1/8  
point, and intermediate maturities were up 1/4 point to 15/32 point, 
reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.73 percent as the  
discount fell 0.07 percentage point from Thursday to 4.61 percent. 
Six-month yields were 5.08 percent, as the discount fell 0.05 
percentage point to 4.88 percent. One-year yields were 5.22 percent 
as the discount fell by 0.04 percentage point to 4.96 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 5.12 1/2 percent from 5.25 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 1/4 point to 113 15/16. The average yield 
to maturity fell to 5.81 percent from 5.82 percent.

<HEADLINE> Mets Activate Pitcher Bobby Jones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- New York Mets pitcher Bobby Jones, limited to  
nine starts this season because of a strained rotator cuff, was 
activated from the 15-day disabled list a few hours before Friday 
night's game with the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander will work out of the bullpen for now, pitching  
long relief. Manager Bobby Valentine said he will use him early in 
the game if the starter is struggling, or at the start of an inning 
so that he'll have plenty of time to get loose. Extra innings also 
are a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really fine with me. I totally accept it,'' said Jones,  
who has been on the DL since May 24 and has worked only 52 2-3 
innings. ``I know I'm a starter and I've never been in the bullpen 
before, but it's really not fair for one of the six guys who are 
doing such a good job to be kicked out of there just because I'm 
coming back. I was the one who was on the DL all year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 29, has a 3-3 record and a 5.81 ERA. He has never had a  
losing record since becoming a full-time starter for the Mets in 
1994. He had his best season in 1997, going 15-9 with a 3.63 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, I just want to get back in there and start pitching  
again,'' Jones said following his 10-minute pregame meeting with 
Valentine and GM Steve Phillips. ``It's not going to be for long. 
It's not going to be next year. It may be the rest of this year, 
but who knows? It could change in a week, it could change in two.''

<HEADLINE> Racer Jarrett Looking To End Slide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Two bad weeks in a row have cut Dale  
Jarrett's once-enormous NASCAR points lead almost in half. But the 
mishaps and mistakes aren't viewed as setbacks by Jarrett and his 
team members. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 34-race Winston Cup season, they're inevitable, Jarrett  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The season is so long and various situations pop up. You can't  
expect a team to go the entire 34-race schedule without 
experiencing some type of problem,'' the Ford driver said this 
week. ``For us, we have to get back in the mental frame of mind of 
doing the things that got us to the point where we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The effort begins today in first-round qualifying for Saturday  
night's Exide 400 at Richmond International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	``The past two races, it seems that where our problem has  
started is in qualifying. I haven't been doing the job I've needed 
to do,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago at Bristol, Jarrett started slowly and then got  
into an accident. He later took the blame for taking himself out of 
contention. 
</P>
<P>
	And last weekend at Darlington, another poor time trial found  
him pitting on the backstretch, presenting a huge handicap whenever 
he stopped for service. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett has won twice and finished second in his last four  
visits to the Richmond, but in this race a year ago he started 
seventh and finished 16th. 
</P>
<P>
	No problem, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We know what went wrong then and we want to get back to those  
opportunities of having a chance to win, which we have had a number 
of times there,'' he said. ``It's definitely a good place for us to 
try and gain some points back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richmond has been a good place for many drivers, and two who are  
essentially out of title contention this season arrived with high 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Rusty Wallace always comes to Richmond brimming with  
anticipation. He has six career victories here, the most among 
active drivers -- and all of them since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I get to go to that race track I always feel like I'm  
going to win and, if I can't, it's like `Why? Why didn't I win? 
What happened?''' Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 31 career starts on the D-shaped oval, Wallace also has two  
poles, 23 top-10 finishes, including the last 14 races in a row, 
and 17 top fives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a wonderful car,'' the short-track specialist said.  
``I've got a great engine combination and I'm going (to Richmond) 
to win the race. I feel like I can win the race, so I've got a lot 
of confidence going into this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Earnhardt used to feel the same way. But before he ran  
eighth here in June, he'd been out of the top 10 in seven straight 
events on the three-quarter-mile oval, and he hasn't been to 
Victory Lane since the spring of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been disappointed with our performance at Richmond the  
last couple of years,'' said Earnhardt, who has five victories in 
41 starts at Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ran very well for so many years and then it seems the last  
couple we couldn't do anything right,'' he said. ``It felt good to 
finish in the top 10 in June and I'm looking for a top five or even 
one better, a win, this weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top 25 spots will be set in time trials tonight.

<HEADLINE>  Chelsea, Clinton Attend APEC Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- They have no fancy titles and their  
names do not appear on the official delegation list of Americans at 
the annual summit of Asia-Pacific leaders. But you can bet they'll 
get the full VIP treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Chelsea Clinton and her grandmother, Dorothy Rodham, accompanied  
President Clinton on Air Force One to New Zealand for the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum and an official state 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Chelsea was at her father's side as he stepped off Air Force One  
and was greeted by New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley. First 
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, gearing up for a Senate race from New 
York, stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
	Young Clinton and her grandmother do not have an official  
schedule but are expected to go sightseeing with Shipley's 
daughter, Anna. The president said Chelsea came along because her 
classes at Stanford University begin late. 
</P>
<P>
	Chelsea drew attention in Hawaii when Air Force One stopped for  
refueling at Hickam Air Force Base. She posed for photographers 
with a few soldiers, and she and her father had their pictures 
taken with other servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was met in Auckland by a group of spear-carrying,  
barefoot and barechested Maori warriors, staring fiercely and 
grunting in unison in what is known as a ``challenge party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Maoris are the ethnic group that first settled New Zealand  
1,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Challenge parties traditionally greeted visitors to ascertain if  
they were friendly, in which case they were welcomed, or hostile, 
in which case they tried to kill them. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton appeared bemused as the warriors, clad in grass skirts  
and their faces adorned with the ``moko'' tatoos that are a symbol 
of status and strength, chanted and waved their spears. 
</P>
<P>
	The warriors divided into two sides and let Clinton pass between  
them. The president mouthed ``thank you'' as he passed through. 
</P>
<P>
	Government immigration minister, Tuariki John Delamere, greeted  
Clinton with a traditional hongi, or touching of the foreheads and 
noses. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton then was entertained by chanting and drum-beating groups  
of South Pacific island people, including Cooks, Tongans and 
Samoans. He smiled broadly as they beat open wooden drums and blew 
into conch shells. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton even showed a bit of rhythm, bouncing slightly up and  
down before he was led into a black limousine to be whisked away. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	One question on the minds of fashion-conscious APEC  
participants: What will be this year's emblematic article of 
clothing? 
</P>
<P>
	Last year in Malaysia, the leaders wore batik shirts. The year  
before in Canada, it was leather bomber jackets. This year, the 
pick reportedly is yachting Windbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
	What the powerful will wear -- from the tall President Clinton to  
the not-so-tall Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi -- at the 
economic conclave has been a closely guarded secret. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Shipley decided to go with the Windbreakers after  
studying a range of options selected by a committee, The New 
Zealand Herald of Auckland reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yachting Windbreakers seemed fitting. Team New Zealand captured  
the sport's prized America's Cup from the Americans four years ago 
and will defend the championship next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Line 7, the Auckland firm that designs and supplies clothing to  
Team New Zealand, signed a confidentiality agreement not to 
disclose details of the jackets, the Herald reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton started the photo-op routine when he dressed his fellow  
leaders in plaid flannel shirts at rainy Blake Island, near 
Seattle, Washington, in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Democrats, Republicans Target Seats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican Rod Grams of Minnesota seems to  
live a charmed political life, a conservative from a reliably 
Democratic state elected to the House in 1992 and swept into the 
Senate two years later in a GOP landslide. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, after watching Grams jettison key staff aides,  
Republicans are fretting that his luck will be tested in a big way 
in next year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Grams recently fired his chief of staff and allowed his top  
campaign consultant to leave. Several Republicans, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity, said the dismissal came after the two men 
clashed with Grams over the role of Chris Gunhus, a longtime 
adviser to the senator said to have a personal relationship with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene seemed odd by Washington standards -- Grams returned to  
the Capital during the August break, called his top aide into the 
office and fired him. 
</P>
<P>
	Capitol police had been summoned in the meantime, according to  
numerous GOP sources who spoke on condition of anonymity, and the 
aide, Sam Dawson, was escorted from the premises. A Senate computer 
technician had also been called and made adjustments that denied an 
assistant access to her computer files, according to some of these 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Behm, Grams' spokesman, said, ``There was a difference of  
management style between Sen. Grams and Sam and Dave'' (Carney), 
the campaign consultant who also departed. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the police and computer technician, Behm declined to  
confirm their presence, and added, ``these administrative acts are 
in the past and the senator has moved on to address concerns of 
Minnesotans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson minimized his dismissal, saying, ``We just had some  
differences of opinion on the direction in the Senate office and 
the campaign and I wish him all the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carney, who remained as an adviser for a few days after Dawson's  
firing, said there were ``no hard feelings or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 

</P>
<P>
	Behm would not say whether there was a romantic relationship  
between Grams and Ms. Gunhus, who is currently on the campaign 
payroll and was previously chief of staff in the Senate office. 
Both Grams and Gunhus are divorced. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, Dawson and Carney have helped Grams in the past.  
Longtime GOP strategists, they were dispatched to Minnesota in 1994 
by campaign officials in Washington to help Grams win election to 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years later, they came back to try and help what campaign  
officials believed was a troubled enterprise. Grams fund raising 
was lagging, his poll numbers poor. His fund raising, at least, has 
been turned around, and his June 30 campaign report showed nearly 
$1 million cash on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 

</P>
<P>
	Incredibly, the Democratic field of challengers against Grams  
has been slow to firm up -- so much so that at one point, Democratic 
officials sought to persuade Republican State Auditor Judy Dutcher 
to switch parties and make the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Democrats, Rep. David Minge is exploring the race, but has  
yet to make up his mind. David Lillehaug, a former federal 
prosecutor, is an announced candidate, but had raised only $82,000 
through the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Rep. Tim Penny has toyed with making the race, as have  
Mike Cerisi, a trial lawyer and Richard Moe, party leader in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent public opinion poll showed Grams ahead in theoretical  
matchups against all challengers, but with weak support. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 

</P>
<P>
	The political dynamic is quite the reverse in Nevada, where  
Democrats have been struggling mightily with recruitment since an 
incumbent from their own party, Sen. Richard Bryan, decided to 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest blow came last week, when Frankie Sue Del Papa, the  
attorney general and only Democratic contender, quit the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Attention has now turned to Ed Bernstein, a wealthy trial  
lawyer. Bernstein is due in Washington this coming week to meet 
with Democratic campaign officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are hungrily eyeing the seat, and former Rep. John  
Ensign, who narrowly lost a Senate race last year, has been running 
hard since shortly after Bryan's retirement announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said  
Del Papa's unhappiness with the demands of fund raising led her to 
withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 

</P>
<P>
	Republicans hold a 54-45 majority in the current Senate, with  
one independent who sides with Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats need a pick-up of six seats to gain a majority in  
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	They got some good news last week, when New Jersey GOP Gov.  
Christie Whitman abandoned a promising Senate campaign. They are 
looking for more good news in the next several days, when they hope 
two-term Delaware Gov. Tom Carper will announce his candidacy 
against veteran GOP Sen. William Roth.

<HEADLINE> CEOs Discuss 'Digital Divide' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Regulation and costs may be slowing the pace  
of offering high-speed Internet access and other advanced 
telecommunications services to rural communities, say some of the 
industry's top leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives from companies both big and small had the ear of  
regulators and lawmakers Thursday as they spelled out some of the 
obstacles they face in serving sparsely populated or remote areas 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel convened by Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of  
South Dakota and moderated by the head of the Federal 
Communications Commission highlighted the so-called ``digital 
divide'' created when high-speed Internet capabilities are not 
readily available to certain parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't do this right, we will have a nation of haves and  
have-nots,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard urged the chief executives assembled  
to ``get beyond the rhetoric of blaming the Congress, the FCC or 
each other'' and focus on ways to tackle the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	But industry heads raised both regulation and economic  
incentives as hurdles they sometimes face in bringing their 
advanced services to areas with low volumes of customers and large 
distances to cross. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West chief Sol Trujillo said current regulatory policy has  
encouraged business decisions that focus on investing in bigger 
cities and serving large-business customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If outdated regulatory barriers were removed, we could do more  
and would do more,'' Trujillo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Public policy does effect the level of investment that goes  
into developing technology,'' said Ivan Seidenberg, head of Bell 
Atlantic. His company and some other regional Bells are seeking to 
enter the long-distance market -- a move which they argue will 
enable them to make greater investments in rural areas at lower 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Newer telecommunications businesses say they are willing to  
expand their reach to underserved areas, but it cannot be cost 
prohibitive for them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a little help in making sure the cost of entry is  
conducive to making investments,'' said Robert Knowling of COVAD 
Communications. ``I'm poised to go anywhere I can if it makes 
sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the smaller companies described how they have  
successfully introduced high-speed Internet services even to the 
sparsely populated areas they serve. 
</P>
<P>
	Averaging about a customer per square mile, Valley Telephone  
Cooperative Inc. of Texas began offering Internet access over 
high-speed digital phone lines several years ago to serve just a 
few dozen customers 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives from the wireless industry say using that  
technology to deliver Internet services may provide a way around 
the distance problems posed by offering them over traditional 
landlines.

<HEADLINE> Court To Consider Oil Tanker Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide  
whether Washington state can set rules for staffing and operation 
of oceangoing oil tankers, even though the government says they 
conflict with national and international standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said it will hear arguments by the Clinton  
administration and an international association that say the 
state's rules are pre-empted by federal standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers said a lower court ruling that upheld the  
state rules ``gravely impairs the Coast Guard's longstanding 
authority to adopt uniform national rules'' and the government's 
ability to comply with national standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington state officials in 1994 adopted standards for  
training, language, staffing and drug-testing of oil tanker crews. 
The state also required tank vessels to have certain navigation and 
towing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules were challenged in federal court by the International  
Association of Independent Tanker Owners, known as Intertanko. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge upheld the rules, relying on a 1990 federal law --  
enacted after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska -- that set 
federal liability standards for oil spills and said states could 
impose additional requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government joined Intertanko's appeal to the 9th  
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeals court decided the 
state's rules on navigation and towing equipment were pre-empted by 
federal law, but it upheld the state rules on staffing and 
operation of oil tankers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1990 law showed Congress' willingness to allow state action  
on oil spill prevention and liability, the appeals court concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the appeals acted on today, Justice Department lawyers  
said the state's rules differ from national and international 
standards, and that the government has received diplomatic protests 
from 14 nations and the European Community. The 9th Circuit court's 
ruling would let other states set their own rules, government 
lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Intertanko's lawyers said the 1990 federal law allows states to  
impose their own fines for oil spills but not to set prevention 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Washington state said Congress intended to let  
states impose stricter prevention requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases are U.S. vs. Locke, 98-1701, and International  
Association of Independent Tanker Owners vs. Locke, 98-1706.

<HEADLINE> Women Take Hold of N.H. Statehouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- For years, the New Hampshire Legislature  
has resembled the state's most popular landmark, the granite 
mountain profile known as the Old Man of the Mountain -- male, 
mature and sometimes craggy. 
</P>
<P>
	Not anymore.  
</P>
<P>
	With Sen. Beverly Hollingworth's election as Senate president  
last week, New Hampshire became the first state to have a female 
governor, a female Senate president and a female House speaker all 
at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Statehouse trifecta started with Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, 52, a  
Democrat who was elected the state's first female chief executive 
in 1996. A month later, 10-term Republican Rep. Donna Sytek became 
the first woman to lead the House. Both were re-elected in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	After last year's elections, Arizona became the first state to  
have an all-female elected line of succession: governor, secretary 
of state, attorney general, treasurer and superintendent of public 
instruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollingworth, 63, a Democrat, came to power after a lawmaker  
died while serving as Senate president. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the fact that she joins two other women in charge is  
irrelevant -- but that she served with Sytek in the House and with 
Shaheen in the Senate is significant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps us,'' she said. ``We all know each other and how the  
process works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sytek, 54, agreed that the women will work well together because  
of their experience as lawmakers, not because they are women. ``I 
think it's an interesting historical footnote, but I don't think it 
changes anything,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sytek pointed out that women have led legislative committees in  
New Hampshire since the 1970s. ``It was only a matter of time until 
we'd have presiding officers,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Iva Deutchman, a professor at Hobart and William Smith Colleges  
who has done extensive research on gender and state legislatures, 
said she doesn't find it surprising that New Hampshire's top three 
leaders are women, given the size and makeup of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	The House's 400 members make it the third-largest parliamentary  
body in the English-speaking world. Thirty-two percent are women, 
the seventh-highest proportion in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would think at some point where women passed the token  
status and reached a critical mass, they would reach into 
leadership,'' Deutchman said. ``It would be odd if they didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaheen makes about $90,000. But the House speaker and Senate  
president are paid just $125 a year; other lawmakers get $100. That 
prompted Sytek to joke: ``Women are in low-paying jobs all over the 
country and in New Hampshire, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest issue the three women face is finding a way to make  
up a $100 million shortfall in the state's new education funding 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Sytek is a fiscal conservative who wants to fill the gap by  
restraining spending in other programs. Shaheen is pushing for a 
capital gains tax. Hollingworth still believes an income tax -- 
something New Hampshire doesn't have -- is the best solution, 
despite Shaheen's promise to veto it. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their philosophical differences, all three are known for  
their ability to reach across party lines to find solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think gender has anything to do with it,'' Sytek said.  
``It's more a matter of your approach to the Legislature.''

<HEADLINE> Thrashers Downplay Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The Atlanta Thrashers won't be concerned  
about the score when they play their first game Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion Thrashers, who have been training in Orlando, will  
move closer to home to meet the 1-year-old Nashville Predators in 
the exhibition opener at the Columbus Civic Center, about 120 miles 
southwest of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether we lose by five goals or win by five goals, it's not  
going to affect our season,'' general manager Don Waddell said. 
``The first four exhibition games are all about evaluation, who 
makes our hockey club. The last four games, we will try to put a 
team together for the regular season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers, whose season opener is Oct. 2 against the New  
Jersey Devils, will carry 30 players on their first road trip. 
After Saturday's game, Atlanta will travel to Grand Rapids, Mich., 
to meet the St. Louis Blues the following night. 
</P>
<P>
	As if to demonstrate the purpose of these games, the squad won't  
include some of the team's most prominent players, including center 
Ray Ferraro and goalie Damian Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Kevin Dean, another top player who won't play this  
weekend, said the team is drawing closer together. A Thursday night 
dinner outing included 19 players. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys are starting to know each other and joke around a  
little bit,'' Dean said Friday. ``It's looser than it was a week 
ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although comparisons are inevitable between Nashville and  
Atlanta -- Southern cities entering the NHL one year apart -- Waddell 
insists that he won't look to the Predators (a respectable 28-47-7 
in their first season) as a measuring stick. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not at all,'' he said. ``No one has got the same playing  
cards. No one comes into the league under the exact same 
conditions. We will use all of the expansion teams as a benchmark 
for the things we want to do and not to do. No doubt, everyone else 
will be measuring our success against Nashville's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Curt Fraser, who has at least 32 players in camp with a  
legitimate chance of making the 23-man roster, looks forward to his 
players performing against real competition after a week of 
practices and scrimmages. 
</P>
<P>
	``The play will step up. It will be more physical. I want to see  
how they react,'' Fraser said. ``A lot of skill guys look good in 
the four-on-four drill. But when you get someone chasing you, it's 
a lot different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 7,300-seat Columbus Civic Center, which opened in 1996, is  
home of the Cottonmouths, an independent team in the Central Hockey 
League that has strong fan support in the city of 250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great facility,'' Waddell said. ``This also gives us an  
opportunity to spread the word around the state of Georgia and our 
TV markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cottonmouths have sold about 5,000 advance tickets for the  
exhibition game and officials are hopeful of approaching a sellout, 
even though it's a busy football weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want to play our first game in front of 2,000  
people,'' Waddell said.

<HEADLINE> Kafelnikov Faces Agassi at Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- From the start, Yevgeny Kafelnikov figured that  
only three men had a chance to win the U.S. Open -- himself, Richard 
Krajicek and Andre Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
	First, he took care of Krajicek. Now he gets his shot at Agassi.  
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's contrasting semifinals at the Open pair favorites in  
one match and longshots in the other with the third-seeded 
Kafelnikov against No. 2 Agassi, and No. 7 Todd Martin facing 
unseeded Cedric Pioline. 
</P>
<P>
	In a tournament marred by the early withdrawals of two-time  
defending champion Patrick Rafter and top-seeded Pete Sampras, 
Kafelnikov and Agassi kept up their part of the bargain, advancing 
to the semis. 
</P>
<P>
	Both of them have impressive resumes. Agassi completed a  
personal Grand Slam by winning the French Open this summer. 
Kafelnikov, who won the French in 1996, is the Australian Open 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner will leave this tournament as the world's No. 1  
player, regardless of what happens in Sunday's final. The center 
court showdown excited Kafelnikov. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure it's going to be lightning,'' he said. ``The fans are  
going to go (crazy). Having the No. 2 and No. 3 seeds in the 
semifinal ... it's going to be wonderful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi had the expected easy advance through his bracket, never  
facing a seeded player and dropping only one set. 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov had a tougher time, dropping sets in his first two  
matches against Max Mirnyi, a last-minute replacement in the field, 
and Jonas Bjorkman. Then came a tremendous quarterfinal victory 
when Kafelnikov survived a record 49 aces to defeat Krajicek in a 
match that stretched to a fifth-set tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was over, Krajicek wondered why he wasn't in the semis  
instead of the Russian. 
</P>
<P>
	Krajicek had the statistical edge. Kafelnikov had the points  
edge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doesn't happen too often,'' Krajicek said. ``I broke him more  
times. I basically did everything more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Except win.  
</P>
<P>
	Martin has twice been stretched to draining five-setters. In his  
first-round match, he needed a fifth-set tiebreaker to beat 
qualifier Stephane Huet. Then he made a remarkable comeback to 
overcome Greg Rusedski in a five-setter that left him dehydrated 
and hooked to an IV. 
</P>
<P>
	He had another four-setter in the quarterfinals against Slava  
Dosedel and seemed exhausted when it was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired,'' he said. ``I felt better than I thought I would.  
Not as well as I'd like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he was anxious to take his shot against Pioline, who won  
three tiebreaker sets in his quarterfinal against Gustavo Kuerten, 
which may have been the most entertaining match of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I've had 29 shots,'' Martin said. ``I think that's  
how many tournaments -- Grand Slams -- I've played. Sometimes the 
opportunities get better as the tournament goes along. That's the 
case here. Still, there's four guys that can play great tennis. I 
have to worry about one of them Saturday. Hopefully, I'll get to 
worry about another one Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First, Martin must deal with Pioline, who just keeps winning.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's an interesting matchup,'' Martin said. ``We're both  
aggressive in different ways. He's probably the prettiest player to 
watch on the Tour -- the athleticism and the grace ... I'm probably 
at the other end of the spectrum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pioline was happy that Martin reached the semis.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a nice guy, so I like to play him,'' he said. ``Sometimes  
he's too nice on the court, so maybe it's better. It's going to be 
good ambience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And probably good tennis, too.

<HEADLINE> MTV Sets Ratings Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MTV's Video Awards held at the Metropolitan  
Opera House drew the highest rating ever for an entertainment 
program on cable television, the music channel said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 12 million people watched Thursday night's awards.  
</P>
<P>
	``Coming to the Met had such a great buzz,'' Van Toffler, MTV's  
general manager, said. ``We've never been to such a wonderful, 
classy environment. The expectations were high that we might trash 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They didn't, but the Met hosted performances by Kid Rock and  
Snoop Dog, a dozen male Madonna impersonators and a lip-sync song 
by teen dream Britney Spears. Hip-hop star Lauryn Hill was the big 
winner with four video awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Toffler credited a strong year in music, particularly with rap,  
teen-aged pop and hard rock, and stars who were accessible to the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Thursday, the highest-rated entertainment show on cable  
was USA's airing of ``Moby Dick'' two years ago, MTV said. The 
most-watched MTV Video Awards show came in 1990. This was its 16th 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratings for the show were up 37 percent over last year's show  
held in California.

<HEADLINE> Poland Lawmakers Ban Cigarette Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Poland's powerful lower chamber of  
parliament on Friday passed a ban on all cigarette advertising in 
one of the smokiest countries in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The amendments to other legislation bring Polish law in line  
with the European Union, which Poland wants to join by 2003. They 
represent a dramatic change of attitude in a country that formerly 
had one of the highest smoking rates in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	By a vote of 374-11 with 12 abstentions, the Sejm chamber  
approved the ban on cigarette advertising on billboards and in 
newspapers, according to the parliament legislative office. The 
amendments now require approval from the Senate chamber and 
President Aleksander Kwasniewski's signature. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the amendments take effect, cigarette advertising on  
billboards would be banned after one year and in newspapers after 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polish Association of Tobacco Producers has warned that  
cigarette producers will lower prices to attract clients once the 
ban is introduced. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an anti-smoking law passed in 1995, cigarette  
advertisements were prohibited on television and radio, in movie 
theaters, and in youth magazines, schools, sports stadiums, clinics 
and hospitals. The amendments passed Friday expanded the ban.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Delays La. Execution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANGOLA, La. (AP) -- For the sixth time, the execution of a man  
convicted in a 1991 murder has been delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, less than 30 minutes before Feltus Taylor was to be  
executed by lethal injection, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay 
so the justices will have time to determine whether his 
constitutional rights were violated at his trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, 38, received the news as he was eating his last meal of  
seafood, french fries and cheesecake. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very relieved,'' said Taylor's attorney, Michele  
Fournet. ``He put his head on the table and cried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fournet claimed in an appeal to the nation's highest court that  
her client was given anti-psychotic drugs during his trial on an 
irregular schedule without his attorneys' knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor had been scheduled to die by injection at about 6 p.m. at  
the Louisiana State Penitentiary for the March 27, 1991, killing of 
Donna Ponsano at a restaurant in Baton Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Clark, the former manager at the restaurant, survived the  
attack after being shot four times in the head, but is now 
paralyzed on his left side. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark had traveled to Angola with his mother and father and  
planned to witness the execution. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all disappointed,'' Clark said after the execution was  
stayed. ``It was a shock. We really thought it was going to go 
through. I am looking forward to the next time.''

<HEADLINE> Oil Cos. Settle Royalty Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUFKIN, Texas (AP) -- Chevron Corp., BP Amoco PLC and Conoco Inc.  
reportedly have agreed in principle to pay about $155 million to 
settle charges that they underpaid oil royalty payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron would pay about $95 million and BP Amoco PLC and Conoco  
Inc. would pay about $30 million each, The Dallas Morning News and 
the Wall Street Journal reported in Friday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlements would resolve charges made by two whistleblowers  
in a 1996 lawsuit against 18 large oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In the lawsuit filed in federal district court in Lufkin, the  
whistleblowers alleged that the companies knowingly undervalued oil 
they extracted from federal and Native American lands beginning in 
1988 to reduce the royalties they owed. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is scheduled for trial in March, but several companies  
have been negotiating settlements. Mobil Corp., based in Fairfax, 
Va., agreed last year to pay $45 million, and Los Angeles-based 
Occidental Petroleum Corp. agreed last week to pay $7.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the newspapers, a document was expected to be filed  
as early as Friday in federal court in Lufkin, asking the court to 
end discovery against San Francisco-based Chevron, Houston-based 
Conoco and London-based BP Amoco because the government has reached 
preliminary agreements with the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron spokesman Michael Libbey declined to comment directly on  
the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The settlement isn't signed, and we don't think it's  
appropriate to comment until it is finalized,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco said it has an ``understanding in principle'' to  
settle. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspapers cited people close to the negotiations as saying  
Chevron and the Justice Department must still agree on the language 
of a final agreement, expected in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Department has billed the oil companies more than  
$400 million in alleged underpayment of federal royalties 
stretching back two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	In their lawsuit, the whistleblowers charged that the companies  
paid royalties based on a posted wellhead price rather than the 
fair-market value. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department entered the case against Conoco, Amoco,  
Burlington Resources Inc,. Shell Oil Co., Occidental Petroleum, 
Texaco Inc. and Unocal Corp. The government is seeking about $5 
billion from all the companies combined, including actual damages 
multiplied three times.

<HEADLINE> Track Called Safe After Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POMONA, Calif. (AP) -- The death of jockey J.C. Gonzalez on  
opening day of the Fairplex Park horse race meeting was a tragic 
accident, with track safety and rider error not involved, a steward 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, there was some question concerning the way accidents  
are handled at the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds, but jockey Corey 
Black said riders were assured the track's first-aid station had 
qualified people to deal with such emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	And, Black added, other issues related to on-track mishaps were  
quickly resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	The fairgrounds is a much smaller facility than well-known  
Southern California tracks like Santa Anita, Hollywood Park and Del 
Mar. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Marten, the public information officer for the California  
Horse Racing Board, said in the future, a jockey will get to choose 
where he or she wants to go after an accident -- to the jockeys' 
room, the first-aid station, or the nearest hospital, located about 
two miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're not lucid, they'll automatically go to the  
hospital,'' Marten said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez was pronounced dead due to head injuries at the  
first-aid station. 
</P>
<P>
	Racing resumed Friday -- a day after Gonzalez was killed -- with  
the flag flying at half staff. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a moment of silence was observed after the third  
race, with the jockeys gathering in the winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
	Many could be seen weeping openly.  
</P>
<P>
	Service Term, the horse Gonzalez was scheduled to ride in the  
third race, won under substitute jockey Iggy Puglisi, and paid 
$13.60. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough game, you deal with this stuff,'' Black said.  
``Everybody deals with things in different ways. I think the 
hardest thing for me to do was call my wife. It's something she 
definitely fears. 
</P>
<P>
	``You definitely saw some grown men cry. Martin Pedroza and  
David Flores chose not to ride today. I felt I needed to get our 
here and do what I do. This is what I do right now in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black called Gonzalez ``a likable young man.''  
</P>
<P>
	``He was 23 years old, he had a nice future,'' Black said. ``You  
don't expect these things to happen, but it's a possibility in what 
we do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez was killed following a two-horse spill in Thursday's  
fifth race. He died after being tossed from his mount, a 4-year-old 
named Wolfhunt, and trampled by the trailing horses. 
</P>
<P>
	The remainder of Thursday's 12-race program was canceled.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is something where you try and be as stoic as you can,  
but it hits home very hard,'' said Tom Ward, a steward since 1971 
who has served at almost every track in California. ``It was just a 
very, very unfortunate accident related to the sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The death was the first at Fairplex Park since Burleigh Turetski  
was killed in a workout accident in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first fatality during a Southern California  
thoroughbred race since Alvaro Pineda was killed in 1975 in the 
starting gate at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	``The horse suffered catastrophic injury and fell, and  
unfortunately Mr. Gonzalez was struck by a trailing horse,'' Ward 
said. ``Many times, we see accidents similar to this where the boys 
get up and walk away from it. Unfortunately in this instance, Mr. 
Gonzalez wasn't lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Marten: ``This is the thing that we all fear the most.  
That's why we work so hard to avoid it. Despite our best efforts, 
this was one tragedy we could not avoid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Baze, the western regional manager of the Jockeys' Guild,  
met with the jockeys before Friday's program. 
</P>
<P>
	``When something like this happens, it's important I'm on hand  
to answer any questions anyone might have,'' Baze said. ``I'm just 
basically taking notes, trying to get everybody's story concerning 
what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, it appears there was nothing anyone could do. It's  
extremely disturbing, right now it's a very emotional time for 
these riders. He was a friend of theirs, it shook them up pretty 
good. 
</P>
<P>
	``Horse racing is a very dangerous sport, things happen quickly  
out here. It's unfortunate when something like this happens, it 
shakes everyone up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services for Gonzalez, a native of Jalisco, Mexico, are  
scheduled Monday in nearby Reseda.

<HEADLINE> Forgotten Prisoner Adjusts to Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- He never got to father children. He missed  
seeing his mother before she died. Yet David Marshall Brown says 
he's not bitter about being stuck in prison 19 extra years because 
of a paperwork error. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, 54, was convicted of murder in 1965. He was freed last  
week after his lawyer found a copy of a missing seven-page plea 
agreement that made Brown eligible for release no later than 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have a social life, I missed that,'' Brown told The  
Philadelphia Inquirer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of my life I always thought about having children. And my  
mother, I felt really bad that I couldn't see her before she died. 
I remember she came to the prison and she didn't know who I was, 
she had Alzheimer's. At the time I thought, maybe it was better she 
didn't know,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said he had faith he would be released.  
</P>
<P>
	``I knew the truth would win out,'' he said. ``I always believed  
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown was 19 when he was charged with two other men in the  
murder of Eugene T. Jordan, a 62-year-old delicatessen owner. He 
was accused of accompanying the gunman into the delicatessen; the 
third man drove the getaway car. 
</P>
<P>
	He and the driver pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and  
robbery in exchange for a deal that stipulated that the District 
Attorney's Office would not dispute parole after 15 years, despite 
their life sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1980 onward, a series of attorneys representing Brown filed  
motions seeking his release under the terms of the plea agreement. 
But no reference to the agreement had been entered into the court 
record, and the prosecutor at the time could not recall any deal. 
Brown's original lawyer is dead. 
</P>
<P>
	His current lawyer, Sharon Meisler, found a copy of the deal in  
the file of the driver, who was freed in 1976. The gunman continues 
to serve a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with his adoptive parents dead, Brown is staying with  
friends while he tries to adjust to the sometimes baffling life of 
a free man. 
</P>
<P>
	He tried to apply for a state identification card with $9 cash  
borrowed from friends, but the state Bureau of Motor Vehicles takes 
only checks. 
</P>
<P>
	He was stymied by a pay telephone and had to ``survey'' a  
washing machine before he could do laundry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like culture shock,'' said Brown, wearing a tan cotton  
shirt, olive shorts and new sneakers donated by friends. ``I felt 
strange. I tried to keep calm but it is still so overwhelming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown will be on probation until 2004. Michael Hamel, chief  
adult probation officer for Montgomery County, said authorities 
will keep an eye on him during the transition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because he has been in prison for so long, we will have to  
hook him up with agencies that can give him life skills,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Web May Reconnect Young </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many young adults don't follow politics or  
vote, but a new poll suggests one of the best ways to connect them 
to civic affairs may be at their fingertips -- the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll focused on political attitudes of young adults ages 18  
to 25 and found that seven of 10 considered the Internet a useful 
way to get information on issues important to the country. They 
were more likely to look to the Internet than to more traditional 
sources of information like TV and newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	The most popular information sources for people over age 26 were  
newspapers and television -- chosen by two-thirds as useful sources 
of information. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised that such a dramatically large group of young  
people use the Web to find such information,'' said Richard Kimble, 
national director of Project Vote Smart, a co-sponsor of the poll 
with the Pew Charitable Trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimble called their interest in learning about issues on the Web  
``a bright light of hope'' in the battle to turn around young 
adults' declining interest in civic matters. 
</P>
<P>
	A top priority for young adults was finding reliable information  
on candidates and positions on the issues, he said. And they were 
likely to look for such information on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can get these two things coming together, we could turn  
a corner,'' Kimble said. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,326 people taken from July 12 to Aug. 10 said  
younger adults paid less attention to government at all levels than 
older respondents did, a result documented in several studies 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer than a third of adults between 18 and 20 reported that  
they voted in the 1996 presidential election, according to census 
figures, and that percentage was progressively higher among older 
groups of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	While 64 percent of older adults said they plan to vote in 2000,  
only 45 percent in the younger group said they planned to vote. The 
error margin for the poll taken from July 12 to Aug. 10 was 3.5 
percentage points for the 872 adults 26 and older and 5 percentage 
points for the sample of 454 adults from 18 to 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Top issues for the younger adults were jobs and the economy.  
They showed less interest than older voters on such issues as 
health care, Social Security and moral concerns. Their levels of 
interest in crime and education were similar. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though younger adults weren't as focused on issues such as  
health care and Social Security, politicians usually tailor their 
issues toward people who vote more often. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is doing what they think they should, but it's  
perpetuating a growing problem,'' said Michael Delli Carpini of the 
public policy program at Pew. ``How you break out of that cycle is 
not clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Project Vote Smart plans to pay even more attention to the Web  
in its efforts to increase young voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
	But Alison Byrne Fields, campaign director with Rock the Vote,  
said the Internet is only one way to encourage younger people to 
vote. Focusing too much on the Internet could miss many young 
people, she said, noting the key is to reach all young adults with 
the message that voting can make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier surveys have shown young people are interested in  
volunteering to help with problems in their own communities, 
despite their lack of interest in politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't make the connection between those issues and  
influencing them through voting,'' Fields said.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Move Ahead on HMOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Opting to move ahead without an endorsement  
from GOP leaders, a group of House Republicans introduced patients 
rights legislation and said the leadership must accept the 
``political realities'' of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican lawmakers expressed frustration with their  
leaders, who have yet to offer a strategy on patient rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an issue that can hurt us politically,'' said Rep.  
Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. ``I hope our leadership got the message. Do 
the math. They're losing control of this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Further delaying action, GOP leaders canceled a meeting on the  
issue scheduled for today with Reps. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and John 
Shadegg, R-Ariz., who put together the Republican package. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Coburn, Shadegg and their allies suggested they  
would sign on with Democrats to force the issue to the floor if 
Republican leaders do not agree to support the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to happen whether the leadership decides they like  
this bill or not,'' said Coburn, whose bill allows new lawsuits 
against HMOs but only under certain circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans hold a slim majority in the House and are struggling  
to develop a strategy for addressing patient rights in the era of 
restrictive health maintenance organizations and other managed care 
plans. If just five Republicans join with all the Democrats, the 
GOP would lose a floor vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, 20 Republicans have signed onto legislation  
co-sponsored by Reps. John Dingell, D-Mich., and Charles Norwood, 
R-Ga. That bill is backed by Democratic leaders and President 
Clinton, and appears to have more than enough support to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Searching for an alternative, House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., asked Coburn and Shadegg to write a Republican bill and 
promised to bring it to the House floor in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair expected Hastert to endorse that bill, which they  
introduced Thursday. He has not done so and has not articulated an 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	Coburn and Shadegg had planned to meet today with Hastert and  
other GOP leaders, but the leadership canceled, said Michael 
Schwartz, a Coburn aide. And there was clear frustration Thursday 
that after a month's recess, Hastert was not with them at their 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Coburn said he planned to use today's meeting to explain the  
``political realities'' to the party leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's spokesman, John Feehrey, responded that the speaker is  
``still committed to working on this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The speaker has been working on this issue for many years,''  
he said. ``It's a difficult issue that requires a delicate 
balancing act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coburn and Shadegg said they have about a dozen GOP co-sponsors  
and suggested that Hastert is withholding his support to appease 
the chairmen of the House's health panels, who have failed to move 
legislation of their own through the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certain egos have to be addressed,'' Coburn said.  
</P>
<P>
	The proposal by Coburn and Shadegg tries to offer something for  
those wanting to allow patients to sue HMOs who deny them care and 
those concerned that more lawsuits will drive up the cost of health 
care. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would allow lawsuits, but only in federal court and  
only if a patient first has gone through the health plan's review 
process. Patients also would have to take their cases to another 
panel of doctors who would determine whether a patient had been 
injured and whether a decision by the plan had caused that injury. 
The bill also would cap the damages patients could collect. 
</P>
<P>
	It also includes a variety of provisions in virtually every HMO  
bill: allowing easier access to emergency rooms and specialists, 
and giving patients access to more information about how their 
plans work.

<HEADLINE> 3 Los Alamos Officials Disciplined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The mishandling of a three-year spy  
investigation has prompted a written reprimand to the former 
director of the Los Alamos weapons lab and sanctions against two of 
the lab's former security officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The University of California, which manages the lab for the  
Energy Department announced the disciplinary action Friday, 
although not naming any of the individuals because of privacy 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who had strongly recommended  
the disciplinary actions, said the sanctions by the university 
``could have been a little stronger.'' Still, he said, the 
university did a ``thorough job'' in its review. 
</P>
<P>
	The three are likely to be the only individuals to face  
discipline in connection with the widely criticized handling of the 
Los Alamos case and broader criticism that the Energy Department 
for years has largely ignored security and counterintelligence 
matters at the weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	An Energy Department review last month found ``systematic  
problems'' in counterintelligence activities in the department's 
nuclear weapons program, especially the research labs. But it 
concluded there was insufficient evidence to single out any senior 
department officials for specific failures. 
</P>
<P>
	According to two sources familiar with the actions, and the  
general description in the university's announcement: 
</P>
<P>
	--The lab's former director, Siegfried ``Sig'' Hecker, was given  
a letter of reprimand, but no additional sanctions were taken 
against him. Hecker, who headed the lab from 1986 to 1997, 
continues as a Los Alamos lab researcher. 
</P>
<P>
	--Terry Craig, a former counterintelligence officer at the lab,  
received a letter of reprimand, had his salary frozen and 
unspecified restrictions placed on his job. He continues to work at 
the lab. 
</P>
<P>
	--Robert Vrooman, a former chief of counterintelligence at the  
lab, who has been a part-time consultant to the lab since his 
retirement, was barred from doing consulting services for at least 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The actions stem from missteps in the three-year FBI  
investigation of a Taiwan-born Los Alamos scientist, Wen Ho Lee, 
who as early as 1996 was the prime suspect in the alleged theft by 
China of nuclear secrets in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee was fired last March for violating security rules, but has  
not been charged with a crime. He has denied providing China any 
secrets. But critics in Congress and elsewhere have questioned why 
Lee was allowed access to top secret information for nearly three 
years while under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Energy Department's inspector general found that  
the failures of three individuals at Los Alamos warranted 
disciplinary action, prompting the university's action Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Atkinson, president of the University of California,  
said in a statement an independent panel reviewed the case and that 
the actions taken ``in each case were more severe than those the 
panel proposed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A metallurgist by profession, Hecker, was widely respected as  
lab director for 11 years until stepping down in 1997, but was 
found by investigators to have contributed to failings in the Lee 
investigation. Specifically he was faulted for not following 
through to ensure that Lee was transferred to a less sensitive job 
and away from top-secret warhead information. 
</P>
<P>
	Hecker ``will receive a letter from the UC president regarding  
his responsibilities at Los Alamos during the security 
investigation,'' the university said, although not naming Hecker. 
</P>
<P>
	Vrooman was singled out in a Senate report -- and again in the  
department's IG report -- for failing to remove Lee from his 
position after being told by an FBI agent in 1997 that such a move 
no longer would jeopardize their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig allegedly failed to adequately search records that showed  
in early 1995 that Lee had given a written waiver to have his 
computer searched. That contributed to reluctance by the Justice 
Department to approve a computer search which would have aided the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We worked hard to ensure this process was as fair as  
possible,'' said John Browne, who succeeded Hecker as lab director 
in late 1997. ``... The actions we have taken are consistent with 
the factual information available to us.''

<HEADLINE> Opening Game Is Big for Redskins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- How big is Sunday's game for the Washington  
Redskins? 
</P>
<P>
	Consider:  
</P>
<P>
	--It's the first game of the Dan Snyder era, the first test of  
whether the new owner's pressure-to-succeed philosophy will 
translate into victories. 
</P>
<P>
	--It's the first game of the Brad Johnson era, the Redskins debut  
of the talented quarterback with the suspect knee. First-round 
draft pick Champ Bailey also makes his first NFL start. 
</P>
<P>
	--It's the first game of Norv Turner's last chance. If the coach  
doesn't make the playoffs this year, he's gone. 
</P>
<P>
	--It's the season opener. Every team has one, but the Redskins  
have fresh memories of falling apart in last year's opener against 
the New York Giants. Gus Frerotte threw two quick interceptions and 
had Marvcus Patton yelling in his face on the sidelines. Confidence 
was shattered, and the Skins went on to lose their first seven 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	--In addition, it's a home game against the team's most hated  
rival, the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as you sign with the Redskins, you immediately start  
hating the Cowboys,'' running back Brian Mitchell said. 
``Everywhere you go, people will tell you, `We don't care who you 
beat -- just beat Dallas twice.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys-Redskins rivalry isn't as big in Dallas as it used  
to be, but it's still very strong in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dallas is a big game to our fans,'' receiver Michael Westbrook  
said. ``But to us, this Dallas game is the beginning of our season, 
and we want to make a statement with them coming into our house. We 
know they want to beat us because they don't think too much of us, 
but we're all going to be ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fullback Larry Centers already knew about the rivalry when he  
signed with the Redskins in July but was concerned more with last 
year's 0-7 disaster. He approached several returning veterans to 
launch his own inquiry into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had some lengthy discussions about what went wrong,''  
Centers said. 
</P>
<P>
	And what was the diagnosis?  
</P>
<P>
	``The diagnosis was that things just went sour so early that the  
mentality shifted to a catch-up mentality,'' Centers said. ``We 
need to do whatever we can this season to hang together through 
good, bad and indifferent, and try to continue to fight hard each 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fragile Redskins are trying to keep the attitude that a win  
Sunday would provide a much-needed boost but that a loss wouldn't 
mean the end of the season. No one is calling this a ``must-win,'' 
as Turner did when Dallas visited last year. The Cowboys won that 
one, 31-10. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those feeling the big-game atmosphere for the first time  
will be Bailey, who has quietly avoided making any rash predictions 
for himself. That's because his mentor, 39-year-old Darrell Green, 
has been teaching him well. 
</P>
<P>
	``We let him know that he hasn't played in an NFL game yet,''  
Green said. ``There's only so much you can make him aware of. I 
couldn't explain to you the difference in the crowd, in the 
electricity, in the intensity, the speed, the competition, from 
preseason to the regular season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And what was it like for Green, 16 years ago?  
</P>
<P>
	``Huge,'' he said. ``And they had told me the same thing. And I  
told them, `You are crazy; I've started in two preseason games.' I 
thought, `I'm straight. I'm ready to go.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't understand what they were talking about until the old  
RFK started rocking. Once the ball is snapped, they're playing for 
keeps.''

<HEADLINE> Report Faults Indian Affairs Bureau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal agency responsible for most  
programs serving American Indians is so badly mismanaged it often 
breaks the law, according to an outside report released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bureau of Indian Affairs ``has been unable to meet the basic  
requirements for administrative systems within the federal 
government,'' said the report from the National Academy of Public 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lack of credible management at BIA appears to impair its  
capacity to represent Indians within the administration and before 
Congress,'' the report said. ``Its administrative problems are real 
and must be corrected for BIA to meet governmental requirements and 
regain management credibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BIA head Kevin Gover had asked for the report to provide a  
blueprint for reforming the often-criticized agency, which has a 
$1.7 billion budget and oversees programs for 1.2 million Indians 
in 558 tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are deserved criticisms of the bureau,'' Gover said at a  
news conference where the report was released. 
</P>
<P>
	The report is the latest to criticize BIA management. A group of  
Indians also is suing the agency over mismanagement of about $500 
million in accounts benefiting individual Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge in that case held Gover and his boss, Interior  
Secretary Bruce Babbitt, in contempt of court for repeated delays 
in handing over documents. At a trial in part of that lawsuit this 
summer, Gover and Babbitt admitted the funds had been mismanaged 
for decades but said they were working to fix those problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Examples of BIA management failures cited by the NAPA report  
include: 
</P>
<P>
	--Recordkeeping is so incomplete and haphazard that the Interior  
Department's internal watchdog cannot fully document BIA spending. 
</P>
<P>
	--Money management is so lax that the BIA routinely violates  
federal laws governing agency finances, including rules on loan 
costs, debt collections and prompt payments. 
</P>
<P>
	--Systems for buying goods and services have been flawed for  
decades and are getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
	--Job manuals either are out of date or missing entirely.  
</P>
<P>
	Gover and Babbitt blamed much of the problem on the BIA's  
chronic lack of adequate funding, especially budget cuts in 1996 
that hit administrative employees the hardest. For years, the BIA 
cut administrative staff to focus on providing services, Gover and 
Babbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden, they're looking around and saying, 'Hey,  
there's nobody here,''' Babbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gover, who was appointed in 1997, said he plans to follow  
several of the report's suggestions immediately. Chief among them 
is creating a policy, management and budget office to focus on 
correcting the management problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Gover said the BIA would likely need as many as 250 new  
management employees to fix the problems, though he added that 
estimate was just a guess. The report said fixing the management 
problems could cost between $10 million and $15 million for new 
staff.

<HEADLINE> Court To Decide Air Bag Liability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court will decide whether millions  
of Americans who own cars built before air bags became mandatory 
can sue automakers for not installing the safety devices. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is whether federal regulation of automobile safety  
pre-empts, or blocks, lawsuits in which people who say air bags 
could have saved them from injuries accuse manufacturers of 
negligence. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices said Friday they will consider reviving the lawsuit  
of a District of Columbia woman who suffered serious head injuries 
when she crashed her 1987 Honda into a tree. Her lawyer told the 
court its eventual decision, expected sometime in 2000, also could 
affect lawsuits over car windshields and manual lap belts. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting a head start on its 1999-2000 term, which does not begin  
until Oct. 4, the nation's highest court added a half-dozen cases 
to the 29 it previously granted full review. Dozens more cases will 
be added through the fall and winter, and decisions in each will be 
announced by late June. 
</P>
<P>
	In the air-bag case, Alexis Geier and her parents sued American  
Honda Motor Co. over a 1992 accident in which her car went out of 
control on a curve and struck a tree. Geier, 17 at the time, was 
injured even though she was wearing a seat belt and shoulder 
harness. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 1995 lawsuit said her Honda Accord was defective because it  
did not have a driver's side air bag. Cars manufactured at that 
time were not required to have one. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning in September of 1989, carmakers had to protect the  
driver with ``either an air bag or an automatic seat belt that 
would signal ... if the belt became unhooked.'' A lengthy phase-in 
period ensued, and cars made since September of 1997 must have air 
bags for the driver and front seat passenger. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda fended off Geier's lawsuit by arguing in lower federal  
courts that a 1966 National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act 
and a federal regulation shielded them from liability. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court ruled that federal car-safety  
regulations that existed in 1987 implicitly blocked lawsuits filed 
under state law. Allowing the lawsuits would ``interfere with the 
federal government's decision to make air bags only one of federal 
options'' for automakers, the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Five federal appeals courts and the highest courts of two states  
-- Pennsylvania and Mississippi -- have barred such lawsuits. But the 
highest courts in five states -- New Hampshire, Indiana, Arizona, 
Ohio and New York -- have allowed them. 
</P>
<P>
	Geier's lawyer, Arthur Bryant of the Washington-based Trial  
Lawyers for Public Justice, cited the 1966 law's language in 
contending that Congress never intended to shield carmakers from 
lawsuits like the one against American Honda. The law says 
compliance with federal standards would ``not exempt any person 
from any liability under common law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The time has come for the Supreme Court to make clear that  
Congress' words mean what they say,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for American Honda said allowing such lawsuits ``would  
conflict with the federal government's regulatory policy of 
encouraging the gradual introduction of air-bag technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They noted that ``all major auto manufacturers have faced  
similar claims for more than a decade,'' and every federal appeals 
court that ruled on the issue has sided with the manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	In other matters Friday, the court:  
</P>
<P>
	--Said it will use a case from Washington state to decide how far  
states can go in regulating oceangoing oil tankers. Clinton 
administration lawyers said state rules conflict with federal 
regulatory efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	--Set the stage for a significant Freedom of Information Act  
ruling by agreeing in another case from Washington state to clarify 
when the government is obligated to release communications from 
foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
	--Agreed to use a case from Alabama and Mississippi to decide  
what federal trial courts have the authority to resolve disputed 
arbitrations. 
</P>
<P>
	--Said it will decide whether a runoff election is needed to  
determine Guam's governor. 
</P>
<P>
	--Voted to decide in a Michigan case whether the time convicted  
criminals must spend on supervised release begins when they are 
released from prison or, instead, the day they should have been set 
free.

<HEADLINE> Bill Gives Federal Staff Pay Raise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal civil servants would receive a 4.8  
percent pay raise under a compromise reached by House and Senate 
bargainers. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase would be federal employees' biggest since 1981,  
when they also got a 4.8 percent boost. It would let civil servants 
receive the same raise that military personnel are to receive next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The boost is part of a House-Senate compromise $28 billion  
measure financing the Treasury Department and several smaller 
agencies for fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators from the two chambers completed the bill Thursday.  
Members of both parties said they expect it to clear Congress and 
get signed by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In his budget submitted in February, Clinton had recommended a  
4.4 percent increase for federal civilian and military personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Sen. John Warner, R-Va., began pushing for a 4.8  
percent raise for the military, Reps. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., Frank 
Wolf, R-Va., and others began campaigning for a similar increase 
for civilian workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall bill would also double the next president's salary  
to $400,000. And it clears the way for members of Congress to get 
$4,600 increases in January to $141,300.

<HEADLINE> Marlins Call up Two players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Florida Marlins called up infielder Amaury  
Garcia and outfielder Julio Ramirez from the minors Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia made his major league debut July 5 and was hitless in two  
pinch-hitting appearances. He hit .317 with 17 homers and 53 RBIs 
in 119 games for Triple-A Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez has never played in the majors. He hit .261 with 13  
homers, 64 RBIs and 64 stolen bases in 138 games at Double-A 
Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins have lost three players to injury in the past week.  
Todd Dunwoody broke his left thumb when he was hit by a pitch 
Wednesday and is out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Castillo is out for at least two weeks after dislocating  
his left shoulder while diving for a ball Wednesday. Danny Bautista 
had surgery Thursday to repair a broken nose suffered during 
batting practice last weekend.

<HEADLINE> Cards' La Russa Mulls Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Tony La Russa likely will wait until the St.  
Louis Cardinals' season is over to decide whether to accept a 
two-year, $3 million contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa said Friday he's always preferred to do it that way,  
although he once signed an extension with the Chicago White Sox in 
May. The deal with the Cardinals has been on the table since June. 
</P>
<P>
	``I prefer to keep things in the proper perspective,'' said La  
Russa, who's winding up his fourth season with the Cardinals. He 
said he would clear up his future ``when our team and the season is 
not more important than an individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, he said his status was the furthest thing on his  
mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``You make a list of what's important today, and the top of the  
list is the Cardinals and the Pirates,'' La Russa said. ``Where 
does the manager's contract fit in? It's so far down on the bottom 
that it's not worth talking about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa led the Cardinals to the NL Central title in 1996, his  
first season with the team, but finished fourth in '97 and third in 
'98. They were 67-74 and in fourth place entering Friday night's 
game with Pittsburgh, making him 311-316 overall with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa, 54, is 10th on the career managerial victory list with  
1,631. In 19 seasons he has led six teams to the postseason and 
three to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries, primarily to the pitching staff, have kept the  
Cardinals from contending the last few seasons. This year they lost 
starters Donovan Osborne and Matt Morris early in the year, and 
then the bullpen collapsed under the weight of the extra workload. 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa said right-hander Alan Benes, out since July 1997 with  
shoulder woes, almost got in the game Wednesday at Atlanta. Benes 
was warming up with the Cardinals trailing 5-2 before he decided 
against it.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Against Yen, Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen in New  
York Friday but off its highs reached in Tokyo, where the Bank of 
Japan intervened in markets to cap the rise of the Japanese 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 108.81  
Japanese yen, up from 107.78. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar had risen as high as 110.00 yen in Tokyo after  
Japan's central bank bought dollars in an effort to rein in the 
yen, which had risen to a three-year high Thursday on a report 
showing that Japan's economy grew at an unexpectedly fast rate of 
0.9 percent in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	After its initial rebound against the yen, the dollar fell back  
as investors took profits and downplayed the effects of the 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has been alarmed by the recent surge in its currency,  
which hurts profits at Japanese companies that rely on earnings in 
other currencies from exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro fell against the dollar as weak German economic growth  
figures dampened enthusiasm for European securities. A report from 
the United States showing relatively tame inflation in August 
helped ease concerns that the Fed may raise rates, making U.S. 
securities, and thus the dollar, more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0364, down from $1.0544 late Thursday.  
It was the lowest level for the euro against the dollar in seven 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5514 Swiss francs, up from  
1.5185, and 1.4761 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4786. The British 
pound fell to $1.6184 from $1.6356. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8866 German 
marks, up from 1.8549; 6.3277 French francs, up from 6.2211; and 
1,868 Italian lire, up from 1,836.

<HEADLINE> Dems Said To Push Hard for Lists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic organizations sometimes  
aggressively pursued names of members and donors from public 
television and radio stations, the Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting's inspector general said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Konz was expanding on a study he released Thursday that  
showed station lists were rented or exchanged exclusively with 
Democratic organizations. Stations received lists from Republican 
groups as well. And virtually all transactions went through 
third-party brokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Why weren't Republicans also on the receiving end of the lists?  
Konz said they simply didn't go after the station names in the same 
way the Democrats did. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can say I saw several organizations out there, Democratic  
organizations, apparently, that had approached brokers about 
obtaining lists from public television,'' Konz said in a telephone 
interview. He turned up no evidence of similar efforts by 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is whether stations, which get federal funding through  
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, violated tax law by 
providing their donor lists to political groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax experts have said that such activities would not constitute  
violations so long as all parties or candidates received equal 
access to the lists. 
</P>
<P>
	Although trading lists is a legitimate business practice done  
daily by countless organizations, the CPB is a private, nonprofit 
entity considered a charity for tax purposes. As such, it is barred 
from direct or indirect interventions in political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenny Backus, a Democratic National Committee spokeswoman,  
wouldn't comment on why the Democrats went after lists from the 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our decision on who we want to mail to is an internal  
political strategic consideration,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committee spokesmen, meanwhile, couldn't  
explain immediately why GOP groups didn't ask for such lists except 
to note the potential conflict for stations. The report notes that 
the RNC uses lists recommended by brokers for ``affinity to the 
Republican message,'' among other criteria. It said neither the RNC 
nor the DNC has a written policy on exchanges with nonprofits. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when Democrats aggressively pursued lists, as they did with  
Boston's WGBH-TV, Konz said he found no intent of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Because transactions go through third parties, lists are  
routinely bundled together and list names are sometimes changed by 
marketers, it's often unclear just who is being asked for names. 
</P>
<P>
	At WGBH, the first station to admit in May that it provided  
names to the DNC, a list broker conveyed a request in January 1996 
from the DNC for 20,000 names, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first, WGBH denied the request, indicating that their  
ownership policy was to not rent names or to exchange with 
political organizations,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broker told the station the DNC ``understood their desire to  
decline,'' it said, but was still owed 12,000 names in exchange for 
names previously provided to the station. 
</P>
<P>
	``After efforts to seek an alternative were unsuccessful, and  
concluding that the station was obliged to fulfill this 
pre-existing obligation, WGBH reluctantly released 12,000 members' 
names,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more requests from the DNC for name exchanges were denied. A  
1999 DNC request for another 20,000 names from the station was 
fulfilled due to error, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Konz and WGBH vice president Jeanne Hopkins said the  
station also offered the initial 12,000 names to the RNC to ensure 
that the activity would not appear partisan. The RNC declined, they 
said. Mark Pfeifle, an RNC spokesman, said he was unfamiliar with 
that particular WGBH incident.

<HEADLINE> Wendy's Sues Over Web Site Names </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Wendy's International has other successful  
Internet trademark lawsuits on its side as it sues a Dallas company 
for a type of trademark violation known as ``cybersquatting,'' the 
company's lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendy's has sued Beswick Adams Corp. of Dallas for registering  
Internet domain names involving Wendy's trademarks, then offering 
to resell the names to the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks a permanent injunction prohibiting alleged  
``cyberpirate'' Brenan Hofstadter and his company from using any 
Wendy's trademark names on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit alleges Hofstadter devised a scheme to extort payments  
from Wendy's and at least 10 other major U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendy's, which is based in Dublin, Ohio, filed the suit this  
week in U.S. District Court in Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	Hofstadter allegedly registered the names of Web sites with  
Network Solutions Inc., a Virginia company that registers Internet 
addresses. In recent months, Network Solutions reportedly has been 
cracking down on people who register domain names they hope to 
resell at a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendy's claims Hofstadter registered Web sites under the names  
www.Wendys.org; www.WendysRestaurant.com; 
www.WendysRestaurants.com; and WendysIntlInc.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendy's has registered its Web site at www.Wendys.com.  
</P>
<P>
	The company says an officer of Beswick Adams sent a letter on  
March 14 to Gordon F. Teter, Wendy's president and chief executive 
officer, asking the company to buy the Web names. 
</P>
<P>
	Without court intervention, Wendy's fears Hofstadter and his  
company could sell the Web names to someone else, the suit said. 
Also, the Dallas company might establish Web sites on the Internet 
under the four addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	That ``could greatly harm Wendy's and its reputation,'' the suit  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Hofstadter could not immediately be reached to comment today.  
There is no phone listing for Beswick Adams Corp. in the Dallas 
area. A telephone message was left at a home listing in 
Hofstadter's name. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wendy's suit says Beswick Adams also has registered Web  
sites in the names of Miller Brewing, Taco Bell, State Farm 
Insurance, Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, McDonald's, Ameritech, Sony 
Corp., Subway restaurants and Burger King. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies have been successful in similar disputes.  
</P>
<P>
	In February, a federal judge in Houston ordered two Texas men to  
turn over 11 Internet domain names to Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft had filed a federal lawsuit against the men, claiming  
trademark infringement after the men registered such domain names 
as microsoftwindows.com and microsoftoffice.com. 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1998, a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled  
that ``cyber piracy,'' or registering a company's name as your own 
Internet domain name, then trying to sell it back to the company, 
violates federal trademark laws.

<HEADLINE> Plane's Landing Gear Breaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Forty-eight people aboard a DC-9 escaped  
major injuries after part of the plane's landing gear collapsed, 
causing the left wing to drag along the runway as the plane touched 
down at Nashville International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people on board TWA Flight 600 were hospitalized with back  
pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane, arriving from St. Louis, was landing around noon  
Thursday when there was ``a slow collapse'' of the left rear 
landing gear, airline spokesman Jim Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Pierce, of Sioux City, Iowa, said after the plane stopped,  
pilot John Hulett apologized for the ``flat tire,'' earning a few 
laughs from the passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was afraid the wing would catch and we would just flip ...  
The pilot did a nice job to keep it square,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said it was unclear what caused the accident. TWA  
mechanics were sent to examine the plane, and the National 
Transportation Safety Board was investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	In airline another incident Thursday, a 737 departing from San  
Francisco International Airport was forced to turn around after the 
pilot reported smoke in the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the 66 passengers aboard the 737 was injured.  
</P>
<P>
	Continental flight 152 took off from San Francisco about 8 p.m.  
Thursday and the pilot reported the smoke about 15 minutes later. 
Airport officials said the pilot was able to land the Newark, 
N.J.-bound flight about a half hour later. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't known what caused the smoke.

<HEADLINE> 1934 Ship Fire Still a Mystery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sixty-five years of speculation have not  
resolved all the mysteries of the deadly fire aboard the Morro 
Castle during a ``Forget the Depression'' cruise to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	But after 15 years of work -- much of it in litigation with the  
U.S. government -- researchers have shed new light on the Sept. 8, 
1934, disaster that killed 134 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers say evidence points to arson and to George  
Rogers, the chief radio operator long suspected of killing the 
captain, Robert Wilmott, and causing the fire aboard the passenger 
ship off the New Jersey coast. 
</P>
<P>
	They suggest Rogers set the fire not to cover up the death of  
Wilmott -- found slumped across his bathtub hours before the fire 
broke out -- but at the behest of the ship's owner, the now-defunct 
Atlantic, Gulf and West Indies Steamship Corp., which may have been 
seeking an insurance payout. 
</P>
<P>
	And they say the captain died of natural causes, probably heart  
failure. The proximity of his death to the setting of the fire 
might mean that Rogers saw in the resulting confusion a chance to 
set his plan in motion, the theory runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are always going to be loose ends, because of the  
passage of time,'' said Robert McDonnell, a former photojournalist 
who lives in Belmar, N.J. But he and his research partners -- Susan 
Lennox Robbins of Freehold and Fred Rasmussen of The Baltimore Sun 
-- say previously secret government files tie up many questions. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonnell, who wants to publish the results of the research,  
said, ``We want this to be a book that puts the mystery to rest 
forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Morro Castle disaster led to congressional hearings and an  
overhaul of maritime safety guidelines. But it is remembered, too, 
for the sheer drama: a raging fire on a ship being tossed by 
gale-force winds, more than 500 passengers and crew aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Flames broke out around 2:20 a.m. According to McDonnell, the  
acting captain, William Warms, did not send an SOS message until 
about an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
	By sunrise, thousands along the coast saw the ship cast an eerie  
glow as it drifted toward Asbury Park. After it ran aground in the 
surf, more than a million people flocked to the shoreline for a 
look before the smoke-blackened hulk was towed away. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors claimed the crew did little to help the panic-stricken  
passengers. Lifeboats that arrived on shore were filled mostly with 
crew members and few passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation and mystery about the disaster long has focused on  
Rogers, the radio operator who acted heroically as the fire raged. 
He had a criminal record before he worked on the ship and, years 
after the fire, was convicted of trying to kill a new boss, who 
suspected Rogers of setting fire to the ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Paroled, he was then sentenced to life in prison for the  
bludgeoning deaths of his neighbors. He died in prison in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonnell, Robbins and Rasmussen call Rogers ``a career criminal  
since his teens and an expert in electricity and fire.'' They say 
the FBI files of the disaster -- which they obtained by filing a 
lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act -- ``contain more 
investigative material concerning him than any other person aboard 
the vessel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So why was he not charged?  
</P>
<P>
	One possible answer: the researchers say Rogers was an informant  
for both the FBI and the Navy during World War II. And McDonnell 
said that during the investigation after the fire, Rogers was 
``being protected.'' He promised that the identity of the protector 
will be revealed when the book comes out. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, experts and a few Morro Castle survivors will  
gather at the State University of New York's Maritime Museum to 
discuss and remember the Morro Castle. A newly remodeled Morro 
Castle exhibit will be unveiled. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonnell said his meetings through the years with survivors  
inspired him to press on with the frustrating effort to loosen the 
government's grip on information. 
</P>
<P>
	``We promised them that the truth will (come) out,'' he said,  
``and a promise is a promise.''

<HEADLINE> Brown Acquitted on Threat Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A jury acquitted football Hall of Famer Jim  
Brown of a charge that he made a terrorist threat to kill his wife 
by snapping her neck, but convicted him of a lesser charge of 
vandalizing her car. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury of eight men and four women returned their verdict  
Friday afternoon after 10 1/2 hours of deliberation over two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, his wife Monique, and several Brown supporters were in  
the courtroom when the verdicts were read, but none of them reacted 
to the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown was charged with making a terrorist threat against his  
25-year-old wife and vandalizing her car by smashing the windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take full responsibility for all of this,'' Brown told  
reporters later. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the main charge I was found not guilty,'' he said. ``The  
other charge was a technicality based on ownership. There was never 
any word on my part that I did not break the windows of the car. I 
said that to the police that night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said when he gets angry in the future, ``I should take  
10 steps back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, 63, has a history of domestic violence charges, but had  
never been convicted. Jurors heard testimony during a seven-day 
trial about his relationship with Monique Brown and a 911 call on 
the night of June 15 when she reported that her husband had 
threatened her life and there was a gun in the house. 
</P>
<P>
	Monique Brown later recanted her allegations, but the city  
attorney's office decided to prosecute without her cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown lashed out at prosecutors after the verdicts were  
returned, saying ``I think they ruthlessly took advantage of my 
wife.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown also told reporters: ``I'd like to thank my wife for being  
strong and being with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said his wife did not want to talk after the verdicts were  
read, although ``maybe in a couple of days we'll have a press 
conference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During closing arguments, defense lawyer William Graysen called  
Monique Brown a mentally disturbed, unstable woman who liked to 
create ``firestorms of drama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy City attorney Grace Kim Lee said Monique Brown was  
browbeaten into recanting claims that he threatened to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said: ``I am very pleased with the verdict because it  
clearly shows the jury found the defendant guilty of a crime of 
domestic violence against his wife.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Municipal Court Judge Dale Fischer scheduled sentencing for  
Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	At that hearing, Brown faces a maximum sentence of six months in  
county jail, city attorney spokesman Mike Qualls said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said because domestic violence was involved, other  
conditions could be imposed, including probation, restitution and 
domestic violence counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, Graysen relied heavily on the testimony of a  
psychiatrist who said Monique Brown suffered from a ``borderline 
personality disorder'' which would cause her to falsely accuse her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
	He accused her of ``crazy, outrageous behavior'' and called her  
allegations fabricated and sensational. He maintained she felt 
rejected and used the 911 call to get back at her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy City Attorney Del San Juan claimed Monique Brown was  
trying to save her life when she fled her home, ran to a neighbor's 
house and called for help. 
</P>
<P>
	``For that brief moment, she didn't care about humiliation or  
what might happen to Jim. For that brief moment, she was herself,'' 
the prosecutor said. ``She was thinking for once about herself.''

<HEADLINE> Yankees Honor Catfish Hunter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Looking down at a black armband around his left  
sleeve, New York Yankees coach Chris Chambliss spoke fondly Friday 
of the last time he saw his friend and former teammate, Catfish 
Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mostly, he talked about the old times,'' Chambliss recalled of  
the March visit in spring training. ``About the years we played, 
the World Series we played in. 
</P>
<P>
	``He still had his sense of humor. He always had that,''  
Chambliss said. ``But it was difficult. He was a man who was losing 
strength in the very arm that won so many games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease last September, Hunter died  
Thursday at home in Hertford, N.C. The Hall of Fame pitcher who 
helped the Yankees win championships in 1977 and 1978 was 53. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew it was coming, eventually,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre  
said. ``But we didn't expect it so soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees paid tribute to Hunter in several ways. There was a  
moment of silence before New York played Boston, with 
public-address announcer Bob Sheppard telling the sellout crowd, 
``Jim Hunter was more than a Hall of Fame pitcher. He was a Hall of 
Fame human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black armbands were placed on the uniforms, right below the  
``5'' that honors Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio, who also died this 
year. Flags at the ballpark were flown at half-staff, and the 
marquee outside Yankee Stadium read ``Catfish Hunter, 1946-1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the first pitch, highlights of Hunter's career were  
shown on the video scoreboard. Chambliss and coach Willie Randolph, 
who also played with Hunter, applauded from the top step of the 
dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Thursday, Yankees owner George Steinbrenner planned to  
attend the funeral Sunday in Hertford. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL East-leading Yankees have been beset by illness and death  
while trying to defend their World Series championship. Torre 
underwent surgery for prostate cancer during spring training and 
outfielder Darryl Strawberry spent time recovering from colon 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, a lot of these things make the team come together  
stronger,'' Chambliss said. ``The club has overcome a lot of 
tragedies in that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter pitched for the Yankees from 1975-79, joining the club  
after leading Oakland to three straight World Series titles. 
</P>
<P>
	When Torre took over as manager in 1996, Hunter helped the team  
during spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was there with Ron Guidry, and I named two of the  
intrasquad teams after them. It was Catfish versus Gator,'' Torre 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, who said he once popped up against Hunter in an All-Star  
game, also warmly remembered the former pitcher's visit this spring 
in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he made everybody feel comfortable around him,'' Torre  
said. ``I think that was his goal -- not to have people feel 
uncomfortable because of his condition.''

<HEADLINE> Black Men Hold Conference in D.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An estimated 30,000 men, most of them black,  
gathered here for a three-day spiritual conference aimed at 
reaching out to those in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	With some 100,000 prisoners watching via satellite hookup, the  
men at the MCI Center sang, shouted and prayed on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell those men they will never be the same again,'' Bishop  
T.D. Jakes said of the prisoners. ``There are some brothers out 
here praying for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conference, dubbed Manpower, is the brainchild of Jakes, a  
nationally known evangelist, who pastors the 22,000-member Potter's 
House Church in Dallas and is the author of several popular books 
and tapes. His CD, ``Woman Thou Art Loosed,'' was nominated for a 
Grammy and a Dove Award last year. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the scheduled speakers today includes Surgeon General  
David Satcher. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference had a special significance for black men, who  
have been plagued by incarceration and other social ills. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference also comes at a time when more politicians --  
including Vice President Al Gore, Democratic front-runner in the 
presidential race, and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the leading 
Republican in the race -- have promoted faith-based institutions 
that address social ills. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our focus will be on the principles that our nation's  
historical documents declare,'' Jakes said. ``If we do not broaden 
our focus to embrace the contribution of faith-based entitites 
addressing society's ills, we will squander this climate ripe for 
real change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conference was interactive with inmates in three men's  
maximum security prisons -- the Hughes Unit at Gatesville, Texas; 
Northeast Ohio Correctional Unit in Youngstown, Ohio and California 
Rehabilitation Center in Norco, Calif., while more than 100 other 
prisons broadcast the program live.

<HEADLINE> GOP Leaders Won't OK Budget Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican leaders are trying to make the  
protection of Social Security's surpluses their party's chief 
message as they gird for this fall's budget fight with President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and others joined  
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., in all but writing off 
the chances for a major tax cut this year, top Republicans drew a 
new political line in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert and others said they would not engage in wide-ranging  
budget negotiations with Clinton because the president would use 
the talks to insist on more spending in exchange for the GOP's 
coveted tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not mixing the spending and taxes,'' Hastert told  
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``No way,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the House's No. 3 GOP  
leader. ``Extra spending means spending the Social Security 
surplus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks partly reflect Republicans' distaste for high-level  
budget bargaining with Clinton and their distrust of him. Many 
Republicans think Clinton has outfoxed them in past talks, and 
there is resentment about decisions being made by a handful of GOP 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments also spotlight the GOP's goal of casting this  
autumn's budget battle as their desire to protect Social Security 
vs. Clinton's plans for higher spending. Republicans say they will 
win the public relations war if voters view the budget fight that 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing this session's dwindling time, Hastert and House Majority  
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said it would be tough to pursue a tax 
cut after Clinton's virtually certain veto of the GOP's 10-year, 
$792 billion tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our one chance to do that,'' Hastert said.  
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, Clinton said he would be flexible in trying  
to reach a tax cut deal with Republicans. But he said the results 
are up to the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're saying, 'Well, it's our way or no way,' then that  
is evidence that this has been pretty much about politics all 
along,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the tax cut veto, GOP leaders said they would concentrate  
on sending Clinton the 11 remaining spending bills for fiscal 2000, 
which begins on Oct. 1. So far, they have sent him just two of the 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants well above $20 billion in more spending than  
Republicans do. Because many lawmakers of both parties also want 
more spending, the GOP will have to find nearly that much just to 
push most of the bills through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	To do that, Republican leaders plan to use all $14 billion of  
next year's expected non-Social Security surplus to beef up the 
spending bills. This would mean busting legally mandated spending 
limits, which until recent weeks they had insisted they would not 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	They are also looking at a list of $14 billion in possible  
savings from various benefit programs, and other possible spending 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're using everything available to us to get these bills done  
and onto the president's desk'' -- except for Social Security 
surpluses, DeLay said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one thinks the budget showdown will cause a shutdown of  
federal agencies, as occurred in 1995 and 1996. But it is unclear 
where GOP leaders will find enough money to push all the bills 
through Congress, let alone get Clinton's signature. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile:  
</P>
<P>
	--The House by 235-187 approved a $92 billion measure financing  
housing, veterans and environmental programs. The White House has 
promised to veto it because of insufficient spending. 
</P>
<P>
	--Senate Democrats blocked a GOP effort to cut mass transit aid  
to New York and California as part of a $49 billion transportation 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	--Facing Democratic opposition, Senate Republicans set aside an  
effort to prevent the Clinton administration from raising royalties 
paid by oil companies drilling on public lands. 
</P>
<P>
	--House-Senate bargainers agreed to a compromise $28 billion  
measure financing the Treasury Department and smaller agencies that 
would double the next president's salary to $400,000 and give 
members of Congress a $4,600 pay boost next January to $141,300. 
</P>
<P>
	--The House approved a compromise bill providing $429 million for  
the District of Columbia's budget by 208-206. The White House has 
threatened a veto because the measure would forbid the city to 
provide hypodermic needles to illegal drug users.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Sets Record, Dow Loses 50.97 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index soared to a new  
record Friday as investors snapped up shares of Internet companies 
and software makers. The swing toward technology stocks came at the 
expense of industrial stocks, which finished mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq rose 35.01 to close at 2,887.03, easily surpassing  
its previous closing high of 2,864.48, set July 16. For the year, 
the Nasdaq has gained 31.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average couldn't match that performance  
on Friday, falling 50.97 to close at 11,028.43 after giving up a 
gain of 62 points. For the week, the Dow lost 50.02, or 0.5 
percent, but it is still up 20.1 percent so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 4.00 to 1,351.66.  
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq's strength came from hefty gains by online auction  
house eBay, up 13 9/16 to 158, and Internet search provider Yahoo!, 
which rose 7 13/16 to 170 1/2. Software companies also gained ground 
with Microsoft gaining 15/16 to 95, and Oracle, a maker of business 
software, picking up 2 5/16 to 46 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	``Technology is back,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst  
at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``This is a group that had been battered in 
recent weeks, and it's nice to see money coming back into the 
group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traders suggested Thursday's unoffical test run for Year 2000  
computer glitches may have alleviated concerns about 
computer-related companies. Some programmers had feared that the 
string of nines in Thursday's date -- 9-9-99 -- would cause computer 
programs to fail. 
</P>
<P>
	But with no major problems reported, programmers and Wall Street  
professionals alike gained confidence that Jan. 1, 2000, will pass 
without difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks also benefited from a government report of a drop in  
wholesale prices, which eased investor concerns about higher 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said rising energy costs pushed wholesale  
prices up a higher than expected 0.5 percent during August. But 
when the volatile energy and food categories are excluded, 
wholesale prices actually fell 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets tend to set aside food and energy price  
changes and focus on the figure known as core inflation. The 0.1 
percent drop in core inflation last month was better than 
economists expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets have been uneasy lately amid concerns that the  
Federal Reserve, which has already raised interest rates twice this 
year, would push rates higher a third time because of the economy's 
continuing strength. Friday's report helped ease some of those 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was pretty much the icing on the cake,'' said David Orr,  
chief economist at First Union Capital Markets Group in Charotte, 
N.C. ``The market is correct to now relax, at least temporarily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But while most stocks rose, the big industrial companies that  
dominate the Dow fell. Caterpillar tumbled 2 to 56 3/4, and Chevron, 
which rose throughout the week as crude oil prices improved, fell 1 
13/16 to 95 3/4 as investors took profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Maytag plunged 14 9/16 to 42 after the appliance maker said its  
third-quarter earnings will miss Wall Street analysts' estimates 
because of weak sales of its lower-priced goods. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the market came through this week fairly unscathed,''  
Hogan said. ``But until we hear from the Fed, there's still 
resistance against taking the entire market to new highs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.42 to 441.19.  
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Volume totaled 802.51 million shares, 
compared with 766.94 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.19 percent.  
European indexes were mixed, as Germany's DAX index rose 0.9 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 
ended 0.6 percent higher.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Throw Money to Campaigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ness, Motley, Loadholt, Richardson &AMP; Poole  
wrote a $250,000 check to the Democratic Party in June -- more money 
than the South Carolina law firm gave during the entire two-year 
period of the last presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm isn't alone. Upset over proposals in Congress to limit  
lawsuits and restrict how much their clients can collect, trial 
lawyers across the country have nearly doubled their campaign 
contributions this year. Democrats have been the overwhelming 
beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	With GOP lawmakers still pushing liability limits and the GOP  
presidential front-runner, George W. Bush, an advocate of such 
lawsuit caps, the trend is likely to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly will fight back,'' said Joseph Rice, a partner in  
Ness, Motley, which contributed $303,000 overall during the first 
six months of 1999. That total compares with $248,650 during all of 
1995-96. ``We're not going to sit back and let them put us out of 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Republicans traditionally outraise their Democratic  
counterparts, GOP strategists increasingly worry about trial 
lawyers becoming a financial force on par with unions, which 
historically have been the Democrats' biggest backers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have that much money coming in, it obviously creates  
a major problem,'' Republican consultant Eddie Mahe said. ``They 
can get it in the hands of candidates, party committees, issue 
advocacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A computer analysis of contributions during the first six months  
of 1999 shows trial lawyers gave $4.1 million, with $3.7 million, 
or 90 percent, going to Democratic committees and candidates. 
During the first six months of 1995, the last presidential election 
season, trial lawyers contributed $2.2 million, with $1.7 million, 
or 77 percent, going to Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The increased giving is evident everywhere. From January through  
June, the Association of Trial Lawyers Political Action Committee 
contributed $959,000 to federal candidates -- more than three times 
the $277,100 it gave during the same period in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties see the 2000 election as critical, with the White  
House up for grabs and Democrats needing to pick up just five seats 
to wrest control of the House from Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP-leaning business groups are planning ways to counter the  
lawyers' efforts, including contributions of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about millions and millions of dollars,'' said  
Jim Wootton, executive director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's 
Institute for Legal Reform. ``You can't play in this game at the 
national level without very significant money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican officials said they will make the lawyers a campaign  
issue, perhaps using advertising to tie lawyers to the Democratic 
Party in voters' minds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows which party is going to be the captive of the trial  
lawyers, who are preying on all of us,'' said Mike Collins, a 
Republican National Committee spokesman. ``These are the people who 
are making health care unaffordable, who are wreaking havoc with 
our courts, and who are making life impossible for everybody from 
dentists and doctors to small business people and schoolteachers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican strategists believe it could be a winning issue. A  
January Harris poll found that only 10 percent of respondents had a 
``great deal of confidence'' in law firms, compared with 23 percent 
for major companies and 30 percent for Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Trial lawyers say they -- and their clients -- are unfairly under  
attack on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody who lost his legs in a tragedy is not in a position  
to compete with corporate America,'' said trial lawyer Stanley 
Chesley, whose Cincinnati law firm is a big giver to Democrats. 
``There has got to be somebody there for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Congress passed legislation designed to cap  
damages and otherwise curb lawsuits from the Year 2000 computer 
bug. And Congress has tried unsuccessfully to restrict product 
liability lawsuits, including limiting punitive damages for small 
businesses. President Clinton, himself a lawyer, vetoed a 
Republican-backed bill with such limits in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The race for the White House also is drawing attention from the  
legal community. Bush has boasted that he enacted lawsuit limits in 
Texas, ``despite strong opposition from the state's powerful 
personal injury trial lawyers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The number of attorneys who have become involved in the  
political process has broadened greatly and will be larger during 
this cycle than in any previous cycle, because of the vicious 
attacks that have been made on the civil justice system,'' said 
Fred Baron, a lawyer with the Dallas firm of Baron &AMP; Budd. 
</P>
<P>
	His firm boosted its donations from $10,500 during the first six  
months of 1995 to $150,750 during the same period this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Baron said articles in legal publications have alerted lawyers  
to the threat. In addition, members of some law firms are urging 
their colleagues to join the fight.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Wheat Lower at Open / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures opened slightly lower  
in trading this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade as prices 
were pressured by a bearish crop production report in corn. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures were lower after the U.S. Department of Agriculture  
pegged corn output slightly above analysts' expectations. The U.S. 
harvest is moving ahead and market participants see prices lower 
for the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.D.A. reports on soybeans and wheat were seen as neutral,  
but prices fell in both in sympathy with corn. 
</P>
<P>
	The soybean did receive support from the government's 80  
million-bushel cut to U.S. new-crop carryout. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 1/2 cent to $2.84 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn fell 2 3/4 cents to $2.16 1/4 cents a bushel; December oats 
fell 1 1/4 cent to $1.15 a bushel; November soybeans fell 3 1/4 cents to 
$5.04 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures were mostly higher at the open today on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while pork futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle rose .10 cent to 67.07 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle rose .35 cent to 79.32 cents a pound; October 
lean hogs fell .50 cent to 42.80 cents a pound; February pork 
bellies rose .60 cent to 53.70 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE>  Andy Reid Tries To Resurrect Eagles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- For a rookie coach, Andy Reid understands a  
lot about pro football. He even understands writing about it; Reid 
was a sports columnist while at Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours away from his first game as coach of the Philadelphia  
Eagles, Reid has a clear idea of how he'd like this story to turn 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, the second-youngest coach in the NFL at 41, is a Mike  
Holmgren clone who has been groomed to coach since his days as an 
offensive lineman at BYU during the late 1970s and early '80s. In 
charge of turning around the dismal recent history of the Eagles, 
he has one of the toughest rebuilding jobs in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like losing,'' said Reid, whose Eagles open the season  
Sunday at home against the Arizona Cardinals. ``I know there are a 
lot of sports psychologists who can coach you on how to lose. But 
losing is not a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's also a reality. Deep down, I understand that we can't  
win every game. I'll handle it the best way I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Handling losing might be the toughest test Reid faces in the  
rare transition from position coach to head coach. Reid, whose 
highest position in 16 years of coaching was offensive coordinator 
at San Francisco State, spent the past seven years coaching the 
offensive line, tight ends and quarterbacks at Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles, 3-13 last season, needed upgrades at nearly every  
position. They still do. They were dreadful on offense while going 
1-3 in exhibition games, an ominous start to a new era. 
</P>
<P>
	There is hope. There is a young coach and a young quarterback,  
No. 2 overall draft pick Donovan McNabb, who have turned the eyes 
of this suffering franchise to the future. The recent past is too 
painful to look at. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you going to think that everything that is bad is  
happening to us?'' Reid said. ``Or do you say, `There's no better 
time than right now to change this thing?' 
</P>
<P>
	``You better think positive on it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Reid draws his attitude from many sources, the most prominent  
among them being Holmgren. The former Packers coach now in Seattle 
urged Reid to learn the intricacies of the West Coast offense and 
placed the supervisory tag on him in 1996. If unknown among fans, 
Reid quietly became a prominent figure among the rising young 
assistants in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia Inquirer recounted a story in which Reid was  
introduced to Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie in February 1997 by Reid's 
predecessor, Ray Rhodes. This occurred at the scouting combine in 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid was a little embarrassed when describing how he tried to  
arrange such meetings. In addition to studying the football 
schemes, Reid spent hours compiling a list of coaches and contacts 
he felt were important to know. 
</P>
<P>
	``As corny as it may sound, I did keep it on my computer and  
when I was at the Senior Bowl or the scouting combine,'' Reid said. 
``I'd make sure to delete guys as I got to know them a bit. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got back to Green Bay, I broke out the media guides and  
went through them and added about everyone I knew. When I got done, 
I realized I knew more people than I thought. ... Over seven or 
eight years, that evolved into the list I used for hiring a 
staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid first impressed the Eagles by showing up for the job  
interview with a binder as thick as the New York City phone book. 
It was filled with notes and diagrams from his diligent offensive 
studies under Holmgren. 
</P>
<P>
	``Andy's a perfectionist,'' Packers tight end Mark Chmura said.  
</P>
<P>
	Even players who were fiercely loyal to Rhodes appreciate Reid's  
strict attention to detail and discipline. Fans appreciate it, too, 
displaying a sign at Veterans Stadium recently that read, 
``Finally, a man with a plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the attitude is a lot different this year,''  
linebacker James Darling said. ``We have a lot more confidence in 
ourselves. That comes from coach Reid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A defining moment in Reid's brief tenure occurred when offensive  
lineman George Hegamin left practice after learning he'd been 
demoted to the second team. Reid punished him by making him push a 
blocking sled 100 yards after practice -- with the 300-plus-pound 
Reid standing on it. The coach also insisted that television 
cameras film it. Hegamin was soon released. 
</P>
<P>
	What sort of column would Reid have written about that?

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Center Offers Free Concert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's not only a free concert that the National  
Symphony offers this Sunday. Kids -- and adults, too -- can come 
through the stage door and pet the instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the chance to talk to the musicians and see -- and touch  
-- their violas, trumpets and so on, visitors can hear American 
music by George Gershwin, Leonard Bernstein and Samuel Barber. 
There will also be a new work by Stephen Paulus in honor of the 
200th anniversary of George Washington's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, members of the Washington Opera company will perform  
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-hour program takes place on 12 separate stages in and  
around the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the offerings are oriented to youngsters. From Britain,  
for example, comes the Neighborhood Watch Stilt International, 
consisting of 25 stilt dancers, ``inflatablists,'' drummers, 
artists and musicians. 
</P>
<P>
	More conventionally, the program offers a Nigerian band,  
``smooth jazz,'' a gospel singer and a Washington area cabaret.

<HEADLINE> Natural Gas Found Off Gaza Strip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The search for an ancient shipwreck turned up  
an unexpected find -- a large undersea natural gas field off the 
coast of Israel, Gaza and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	Marine geologist Robert Ballard was studying the remains of  
ancient Phoenician vessels when he made the discovery, the National 
Geographic Society announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A seafloor natural gas reservoir had previously been found in  
the Mediterranean near the Israeli city of Ashdod, north of Gaza. 
It is estimated to be able to produce 30 million cubic feet of gas 
per day. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ballard's discovery indicates the gas field extends south,  
along the full length of the Gaza Strip and also along the coast of 
Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was just one hole,'' Ballard said of the Ashdod well.  
``If you were to exploit this field you would have many rigs ... so 
clearly it's sizable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But politics could complicate development of the field's natural  
gas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gaza Strip, along the coast of southern Israel adjacent to  
the border with Egypt, is jointly administered by Israel and the 
Palestinian Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard said he has not been in touch with either the Israeli or  
Palestinian officials about the find, but noted that an Israeli 
observer was on board his research vessel, along with Palestinian 
crew members. 
</P>
<P>
	Moshe Friedman, spokesman for the Israeli Infrastructure  
Ministry, said Thursday that he had not heard of the natural gas 
fields and would not be able to comment without more details. 
</P>
<P>
	On the same research trip Ballard located the wrecks of two  
ancient Phoenician ships, the oldest vessels ever discovered in the 
deep sea, dating from about 750 B.C. It was that search that led to 
the gas discovery, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	``It turned out that the Phoenician ships have a particular  
sonar signature,'' Ballard explained. ``We were using sonar to get 
what we call an acoustic signature and ran around the ships at 
different angles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said they would find a depression in the sea floor and  
something hard within the depression -- the hard object turned out 
to be the ships. 
</P>
<P>
	After the researchers finished their work on the Phoenician  
ships, they steamed along the coast to look for other sunken 
vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	The sonar detected what appeared to be hundreds of ships.  
</P>
<P>
	``We said, 'That can't be true,''' Ballard recalled. ``So we  
sent the Jason vehicle down, which can actually see, and in these 
depressions were deposits caused by seepage coming in contact with 
ocean and rising from deposits was gas. I realized what we had 
found because I'm a geologist,'' Ballard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The long narrow depressions were probably associated with cracks  
in the earth that create a way for the gas to escape from 
underground reservoirs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard also reported finding concentrations of tube worms and  
beds of clams surrounding the vents. These were similar to those he 
found surrounding hydrothermal vents near the Galapagos Islands in 
the Pacific, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Galapagos worms marked the first discovery of living things  
that used chemical energy rather that relying on the sun for 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard, president of the Institute for Exploration in Mystic,  
Conn., is a longtime ocean explorer, probably best known for 
locating the wreck of the Titanic in the cold, dark waters of the 
North Atlantic.

<HEADLINE> Britain-Ireland Ready for Amateurs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIRN, Scotland (AP) -- The Americans might already have three  
strikes against them in this year's Walker Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined Great Britain and Ireland (GBI) amateur golf team  
will have the home-course advantage when play begins Saturday on 
this seaside Scottish links, hard by the Moray Firth. 
</P>
<P>
	GBI also has Luke Donald, the 21-year-old Englishman who won the  
NCAA championship this season as a sophomore at Northwestern 
University in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Strike 3 could be the wind, as gusts off the firth ranged  
between 25-45 mph for Thursday's practice, troubling the Americans 
and tickling the Britons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it (the wind) is unusual for here, but for us  
it's very unusual,'' said Matt Kuchar, the 1997 U.S. Amateur 
champion and top amateur in the 1998 Masters and U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is looking forward to a little bit of wind, but this  
level or higher -- I don't think people are hoping to see that,'' 
added Kuchar, who could only hit a 4-iron 132 yards into a westerly 
gale. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nairn Golf Club is probably the most seaside layout in  
Britain. Half the fairways border a stone-strewn beach, and the 
firth -- whitecapped on Thursday -- is visible from every hole. 
</P>
<P>
	The first seven or eight holes go due-west. And the back nine  
heads back east, usually with a tailwind. ``Links golf and the wind 
blowing is a great equalizer,'' Kuchar admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some four- or five-club winds out there today,''  
said American David Gossett, the '99 U.S. Amateur champion. ``If 
you get it up in the air and out to the right just a little bit, 
the wind will take it into the merry firth. You'll be swimming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The forecast calls for high winds into the weekend -- and then  
maybe a bit of relief in the form of always-present Scottish rain. 
</P>
<P>
	For one of the few times in the Walker Cup's 77-year history,  
everything seems to favor the combined British--Irish side in this 
biennial match-play event. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has won 31 of 36, with one draw. Two years ago  
at Quaker Ridge in Scardsdale, N.Y., it was an 18-6 American 
landslide, again prompting some to call it the ``Walkover Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not this time.  
</P>
<P>
	``If it blows like this, it favors us,'' Donald said. ``A lot of  
our amateur tournaments are played on links courses where it does 
get windy. I've never played in a tournament in America where the 
wind has been this strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donald, who has faced seven members of the U.S. team in college  
golf, said his NCAA title ``has to play on their minds a little and 
give us a psychological boost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lorne Kelly, a 25-year-old Scot who also honed his golf in  
college in the United States -- the University of Coastal Carolina -- 
is praying for the winds to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly wouldn't mind if it blew like this for the match,  
even as strong as this,'' he said. ``I don't think we get as 
agitated in the wind as the Americans. We're a little more 
patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Kuchar and Gossett, 20, the Americans are led by  
three ``seniors'' -- John ``Spider'' Miller, 49, Tom McKnight, 45, 
and Tim Jackson, 40. 
</P>
<P>
	In a youth-age theme for Saturday, Yates paired Miller with  
Hunter Haas, 22, and Jackson with Gossett. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller joins Kuchar sitting out afternoon singles

<HEADLINE> Alleged Killer Must Take Medication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russell Weston Jr., charged with killing two  
Capitol police officers, can be forced to take medication that 
could make him mentally fit to stand trial, a federal judge ruled 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan authorized the Bureau of  
Prisons to administer anti-psychotic medication to Weston despite 
his objections. Sullivan postponed execution of his order until 
Sept. 16 to give Weston's lawyers time to appeal, which they said 
they intend to do Monday or Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Weston, 42, is charged with killing Officers John M. Gibson and  
Jacob J. Chestnut after forcing his way into the U.S. Capitol on 
July 24, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Weston, who is being held at the Federal Corrections Center in  
Butner, N.C., has spent 20 years in and out of hospitals. He has a 
variety of behavioral problems and has been diagnosed as a paranoid 
schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview taped six months after the shootings, Weston  
said he had been murdered and cannibalized a few times while in 
prison and that he was trying to reach a computer in the building 
that would make him immortal. 
</P>
<P>
	Weston also said on the tape that the judge in his case ``was  
involved with black-market racketeering, murder and cannibalism.'' 
The tape aired on CBS' ``60 Minutes II.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weston has not entered a plea in the case and has not yet been  
arraigned.

<HEADLINE> Debate Over 'Bible Code' Renewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An international team of statisticians is  
attacking ``Bible code'' theory, which claims the Old Testament 
contains secret references to 20th century events. 
</P>
<P>
	Television documentaries, fast-selling books and numerous  
articles have popularized the idea, which originated with a 1994 
article in the academic journal Statistical Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Next week the same journal, published by the Institute of  
Mathematical Statistics based in Hayward, Calif., will publish a 
study by three researchers challenging the theory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite a considerable amount of effort, we have been unable  
to detect the codes,'' the study stated. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Bible code proponents, the Hebrew text of the Old  
Testament refers to events that were thousands of years away when 
the text was written. 
</P>
<P>
	The hidden references are revealed by turning the text into a  
string of letters without spaces and looking for words formed by 
equidistant letter sequences. For instance, computers might select 
every ninth Hebrew letter and register a ``hit'' when a ``coded'' 
word intersects with a Bible verse containing related words. 
</P>
<P>
	The technique has been used to claim encoded biblical  
predictions of everything from the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin 
in 1995 to a Los Angeles earthquake in 2010. 
</P>
<P>
	Major Bible scholars have ignored the code, noting that no one  
has a letter-by-letter version of the Bible as originally written. 
The oldest surviving manuscripts include slight variations. The new 
article makes the same point. 
</P>
<P>
	The theory was put forward in a 1994 article in the Institute of  
Mathematical Statistics, in which three Israeli scholars reported 
on tests using the Book of Genesis that produced intersections 
between names of famous rabbis and their birth or death dates. 
</P>
<P>
	That experiment is re-tested in a new article in the same  
journal written by Dror Bar-Natan and Gil Kalai, who teach 
mathematics at Jerusalem's Hebrew University; Maya Bar-Hillel, a 
psychology professor at the same school; and Brendan McKay, a 
computer scientist at Australian National University. 
</P>
<P>
	Such letter configurations can be found in any long text, the  
article says. 
</P>
<P>
	They repeated the 1994 experiment, using other spellings and  
assumptions and applying the rabbis' names to other biblical books. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparison tests using the Hebrew translation of Tolstoy's ``War  
and Peace'' were just as successful as those with the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
	Bar-Natan said the 1994 article was based on research that  
offered ``enough wiggle room to produce whatever you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Michael Drosnin, author of ``The Bible Code,'' stood by the  
theory. He said a retired code-breaker for the U.S. National 
Security Agency has proven the code works. 
</P>
<P>
	Eliyahu Rips, a co-author of the 1994 article and professor in  
the same department as Bar-Natan and Kalai, issued a statement 
promising a ``detailed reply'' soon. He called the new article's 
examples ``mathematically meaningless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Kass, head of the statistics department at Carnegie  
Mellon University in Pittsburgh, edited Statistical Science when it 
published the 1994 article. In a recent interview he said that the 
1994 data ``involved a lot of latitude'' and skewed the findings.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Upgraded to Hurricane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Tropical storm Floyd strengthened today to become  
the fourth Atlantic hurricane of the year, churning with top 
sustained winds of 80 mph and bringing rain to the Leeward Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	``The center is still in the formative stage, but it has  
intensified,'' said Richard Pasch, a hurricane specialist with the 
National Hurricane Center in Miami. ``We think it could continue to 
strengthen and become a major hurricane in three days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 a.m., Floyd was centered about 210 miles east-northeast of  
Barbuda in the northern Leeward Islands, and its outer rain bands 
were over the islands. It was expected to continue moving toward 
the west-northwest at near 12 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Tropical storm force winds extended outward up to 175 miles from  
the storm's center. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane was expected to pass just north of the Leeward  
Islands, but could threaten the northeastern Caribbean if it shifts 
at all to the south, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
	``During these coming three days we think it will stay north of  
the islands in the Caribbean,'' Pasch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the island governments of Antigua, Barbuda, Anguilla,  
Dutch Saint Maarten, French St. Martin and St. Barthelemy all had 
issued tropical storm watches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now the focus is on the Leeward Islands,'' hurricane  
specialist James Franklin said. ``Any potential threat to the U.S. 
would be several days down the road.''

<HEADLINE> Former NY Giant, CCSU Coach Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW BRITAIN, Conn. (AP) -- Henry W. Majlinger, a former pro  
football player who spent 30 years as baseball coach at Central 
Connecticut State, died after a lengthy battle with cardiac and 
respiratory problems. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Majlinger, who died Wednesday, coached the Blue Devils from  
1949-1978, compiling a 351-166 record. He was later inducted into 
the American Association of College Baseball Coaches Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	He also coached the CCSU football team from 1953-1958, leading  
them to an undefeated season in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	Majlinger played football at New York University in the 1940s  
and had a brief career with the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the staff at Central, then known as Teachers College  
of Connecticut, in 1949, where he became known as an innovator. 
</P>
<P>
	Using parts from a tennis ball return machine and an old washing  
machine, he fashioned a batting practice device that fired pingpong 
balls at batters at speeds of up to 100 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Eleanor, and two daughters, Susan  
Cort, of Sarasota, Fla. and Ivy Doyle of Alexandria, Va.

<HEADLINE> APEC Leaders May Wear Windbreakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Last year in Malaysia, they wore  
batik shirts. The year before that in Canada, it was leather bomber 
jackets. This year, the 21 Pacific Rim leaders gathering in New 
Zealand for their annual informal summit will reportedly wear 
yachting Windbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
	What the powerful will wear -- from the tall President Clinton to  
the not-so-tall Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi -- at Monday's 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conclave has been a closely 
guarded secret. 
</P>
<P>
	New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley decided to go with the  
Windbreakers after studying a range of options selected by a 
committee, The New Zealand Herald of Auckland reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Yachting Windbreakers seemed fitting. Team New Zealand captured  
the sport's prized America's Cup from the Americans four years ago 
and will defend the championship next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Line 7, the Auckland firm that designs and supplies clothing to  
Team New Zealand, signed a confidentiality agreement not to 
disclose details of the jackets, the Herald reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton started the photo-op routine when he dressed his fellow  
leaders in plaid flannel shirts at rainy Blake Island, near 
Seattle, Washington, in 1993.

<HEADLINE>  French Troops Hurt in Kosovo Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo Serbs and ethnic Albanians  
clashed in the tense town of Kosovska Mitrovica, injuring 15 French 
soldiers and police trying to separate them, NATO officials said 
today. One ethnic Albanian was reported dead and at least nine 
others were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO spokesmen said the clash occurred late Thursday, drawing in  
French peacekeepers and police who tried to separate the two ethnic 
groups. Of the 15 French injured, five soldiers were wounded by an 
exploding hand grenade, and the others by stones thrown by the two 
sides, said Maj. Ole Irgens, a spokesman for the peacekeepers. He 
said no injuries were critical. 
</P>
<P>
	Several ethnic Albanian residents of Kosovska Mitrovica, who  
spoke by phone on condition of anonymity, said one ethnic Albanian 
was shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials said those reports were being checked. One  
spokesman, Maj. Roger LaVoie, said it was possible that several 
Serbs were injured as well. 
</P>
<P>
	At least nine ethnic Albanians were shot and wounded. They were  
in Pristina's hospital Friday. One man with a chest wound said 
French soldiers wounded him. 
</P>
<P>
	A French spokesman in Kosovska Mitrovica, Capt. Bernard Bonneau,  
did not comment directly on that claim but said: ``It was 
impossible to avoid intervention because the two sides were close 
to each other and we wanted to prevent further escalation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he could neither confirm nor deny the reported death,  
pending continuing investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	LaVoie said seven French peacekeepers were injured Thursday  
while demining an area south of Kosovska Mitrovica, apparently 
after one of the mines blew up. None of the injuries were 
life-threatening, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovska Mitrovica has figured prominently over the past months  
as an example of the ethnic hatreds blocking international efforts 
to establish normality in Kosovo in the wake of a Serb crackdown 
and prolonged NATO bombing of Yugoslavia to force a pullout of Serb 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The town is split into Serb and ethnic Albanian sectors, divided  
by the Ibar River. Hundreds of ethnic Albanians have demonstrated 
sporadically over the past two months, demanding the right to 
return to their homes in the Serb sector. French peacekeepers 
patrolling the region have prevented most from doing so, fearing 
bloodshed otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Like previous confrontations, Thursday's clash began with crowds  
of Serbs and ethnic Albanians forming on the two ends of the bridge 
over the Ibar. The violence was sure to fuel ethnic tensions and 
lead to further retributory bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
	Minority Serbs still in Kosovo blame the rebel Kosovo Liberation  
Army for the rash of attacks on their ethnic group since Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic accepted Western peace terms and 
pulled his troops out of the province after NATO bombing ended in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, NATO announced that eight KLA members had been  
arrested in the western city of Djakovica in an apartment where 
peacekeepers found a machine gun, ammunition, 30 cluster bombs, two 
85-mm anti-tank weapons and several anti-personnel mines. 
</P>
<P>
	KLA leaders deny wrongdoing, as they push to establish authority  
in a Kosovo administered by the United Nations and policed by NATO, 
so as to be in a dominant position once the international presence 
ends. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA's military leader, Gen. Agim Ceku said Thursday his  
organization, which is to disarm and disband by Sept. 19, had won 
the right not only to transform into a civilian corps but to play a 
role in all other governmental institutions in Kosovo, including a 
defense unit of at least 5,000 members to respond to natural 
disasters and ``defend (ethnic Albanians) from aggression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO and U.N. officials confirmed that the KLA will form the  
basis of a uniformed corps, although its mission and tasks have not 
been finalized. Russia, however, has expressed opposition to any 
plan that falls short of the complete disarmament and disbanding of 
the former rebel army. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeating Russian criticism, Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandar  
Avdeyev said in Macedonia on Friday that U.N. plans for the KLA 
will result in ``a conservation of ... this military formation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a military police official with the NATO-led  
peacekeeping force said today that six of 11 bodies discovered in 
July near the eastern Kosovo village of Ugljare were those of 
Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	The other five bodies remain unidentified and their ethnicity or  
identity is unlikely to be established, said Col. Ian Mitchell. He 
said the victims were shot, stabbed or clubbed at different places 
and times -- but all after the peacekeepers arrived in June -- and 
then brought to the grave site. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said one ethnic Albanian was in custody after  
confessing to kidnapping three Serbs whose bodies were found at the 
site. He gave no further details.

<HEADLINE> Final Claims Made in Microsoft Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. used its final written legal  
brief Friday to attack the government's broad antitrust case 
against it, arguing its widely used Windows software doesn't afford 
it monopoly power over the high-tech industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The government, in its written summary of the 76-day courtroom  
battle, responded that Microsoft's software runs more than 90 
percent of the world's personal computers, and said no candidate 
capable of displacing it is likely to emerge for years. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had given the two  
sides until Friday to file their final written versions of the 
facts in the landmark case. The dictionary-size documents ran 
hundreds of pages each. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's exchange was expected to be the last before the first  
phase of the judge's two-part ruling. That could come as early as 
late October. Courtroom arguments were set for later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The government criticized as ``bizarre assertions'' Microsoft  
Chairman Bill Gates statement in a deposition before the trial that 
he wasn't closely monitoring activities by rival Netscape 
Communications Corp. during the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, for its part, said the government's earlier summaries  
of the case were ``rife with internal consistencies and contain 
stunning concessions that undermine the claims alleged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said the government wrongly interpreted statements by  
computer makers when it told the judge that Microsoft's control was 
so great that reasonable alternative to its Windows software was 
available to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said it faces fledgling competition from an array of  
new technologies, including the upstart operating system called 
Linux, which is freely available on the Internet. An operating 
system controls the most basic functions of a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it shows instead is that if consumers express a desire  
for operating systems other than Windows, (computer makers) will 
promptly meet that demand -- as they have started to do with 
Linux,'' Microsoft said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said Microsoft was pointing to an array of  
technologies, ``presumably with a straight face,'' that never will 
actually challenge the dominance of Windows, such as new hand-held 
computers and other high-tech devices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even Microsoft's economist concedes that the speculation that  
the future may bring a competitive alternative to Microsoft's 
captive customers is no more than speculation,'' the government 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft urged the judge to note that, after testimony in the  
trial ended, Dell Computer Corp. agreed to sell Linux pre-installed 
on some desktop and notebook computers. It said Linux and another 
niche operating system, from Be Inc., ``remain serious threats to 
Windows' category leadership and well could displace Windows over 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyers also argued that the government was wrong in  
repeatedly asserting that other companies face unusually steep 
barriers to compete with Microsoft products. 
</P>
<P>
	They noted the announcement last month by Sun Microsystems Inc.  
that it would begin distributing free on the Internet a package of 
business software programs -- including a word processor and 
spreadsheet -- called ``Star Office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first phase of the judge's ruling, called his ``findings of  
fact,'' is expected to telegraph in many ways the eventual second 
part of his verdict, which probably will come early next year 
unless the sides settle. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's factual findings also are particularly important  
because appellate courts rarely challenge a trial judge's decisions 
on the facts of a case, but typically focus on his application of 
the law in the second phase.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets ended generally mixed  
Friday, with the key index in Jakarta surging more than 4 percent 
despite the violence in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta market was hit by bargain-hunting, with the  
Composite Index surging 24.761 points, or 4.6 percent, to close at 
562.776. 
</P>
<P>
	However, traders remained skeptical whether share prices can  
sustain the rally, which began Thursday after investors moved in to 
snap up bargain stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	They warned that the market could come under renewed pressure  
next week if the political uncertainty over the Indonesian 
government's handling of the East Timor crisis deepens.

<HEADLINE> Timber Co., Nature Group Cooperate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Westvaco Corp., a major timber company, is  
letting the Nature Conservancy environmental group inspect its 
entire 1.3 million acres of U.S. forests in an unprecedented 
arrangement aimed at restricting logging in fragile areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts from the group and Westvaco will identify lands that  
contain endangered or rare plants and animals, and suggest ways to 
protect them, such as avoiding clear-cuts of forests. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties declined to estimate how many acres might be  
protected, and the deal, announced Thursday, will not change 
Westvaco's tree-cutting practices in the vast remainder of its 
holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the arrangement is one of the most sweeping examples to  
date of how business and the environmental communities increasingly 
are shedding traditional adversarial relationships to try to change 
specific, criticized practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Home Depot, the nation's largest retailer of lumber,  
agreed not to sell any wood from endangered forests, capitulating 
to several years of protests from environmental groups. Two U.S. 
subsidiaries of Mitsubishi reached an agreement last year with the 
Rainforest Action Network to use wood and paper products produced 
under ecologically sound conditions. In exchange, the group dropped 
a long-running U.S. boycott against the units. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Nature Conservancy has agreements with other forest  
products companies, the size of the Westvaco deal is unprecedented, 
said the group's chief executive, John Sawhill. The group has 
previously protected 11 million acres in the United States through 
hundreds of arrangements with landowners and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope this will set a precedent for others in the  
industry,'' Sawhill said. 
</P>
<P>
	But like some other cooperative arrangements, Thursday's deal  
provoked a mixed reaction within the environmental movement, where 
critics worry that positive publicity could help companies deflect 
criticism about less sound areas of their operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good piece of a bigger puzzle, (but) the overall the  
picture isn't pretty,'' said Christopher Hatch, director of 
campaigns for the Rainforest Action Network, another environmental 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said the deal won't keep Westvaco from clear-cutting trees  
and conducting other potentially harmful practices in the vast bulk 
of its U.S. holdings, and doesn't address the company's 200,000 
acres outside the United States, including land in Brazil and 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not setting a policy against using old growth wood  
and pulp anywhere,'' added Hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists are particularly focused on trying to stop  
companies from logging so-called ``old-growth'' forests, 
undisturbed habitats that are home to a wide diversity of plants 
and animals. Only 20 percent of the world's original forests 
remain, mostly in Brazil, Russia and Canada, amid intensive logging 
and population pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Westvaco, through a spokesman, said it does not  
log any old-growth forests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Far from trying to hide things, we are reaching out in a  
voluntary manner to demonstrate we are a very good steward to the 
forest,'' said spokesman William Fuller. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, Hatch said, the move ``signifies a change in the  
marketplace'' reflecting demand from both business customers and 
individuals for better environmental practices. 
</P>
<P>
	One indication in the trend is seen by a big increase in the  
number of acres owned by timber companies that adhere to 
international standards for environmentally sound tree-cutting, 
which are set by the Forest Stewardship Council, a Oaxaca, 
Mexico-based group.

<HEADLINE> Colleges Launch Anti-Drinking Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- It may be advertised in some of  
today's largest newspapers, but don't expect to find a bottle of 
``Binge Beer'' at your local store. 
</P>
<P>
	The full-page ads with a sarcastic tone are actually a  
tounge-in-cheeck attempt to curb binge drinking among college 
students. They appear in today's editions of The New York Times, 
The Wall Street Journal, USA Today and more than 100 other papers. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads feature a beer bottle under a headline that reports,  
``Hitting college campuses this fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough being a college kid today,'' the text reads.  
``That's why we've developed Binge Beer. At Binge, we understand 
that sometimes you just need five or six drinks the night before 
that big test. ... Who says falling off a balcony is such a bad 
thing? And what's an occasional riot? Or even a little assault 
between friends?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant  
Colleges sponsored the campaign, and 113 college presidents signed 
the ads. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads, coordinated by Penn State, appear at a time of  
high-profile drinking deaths, drunken riots, and rising 
drinking-related emergency-room visits. 
</P>
<P>
	``While drinking in college has always been with us, the  
difference today is that more young people binge drink, and those 
who engage in high-risk drinking do so more often,'' Penn State 
President Graham B. Spanier said in an appearance at the National 
Press Club two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A Harvard study in 1997 found that 43 percent of college  
students reported being binge drinkers. Binge drinking is 
considered five drinks a sitting for men, four drinks for women.

<HEADLINE> Chile Marks 1973 Coup Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Chileans are marking the anniversary of a  
1973 military coup this weekend for the first time without the 
coup's leader, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who remains in custody in 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, police in Santiago used water cannons to scatter a  
group of communists trying to lay a wreath at the presidential 
palace as a tribute to Salvador Allende, the elected Marxist 
president toppled in the coup. Four people were detained. 
</P>
<P>
	The clash came as Chile prepared to mark the coup's 26th  
anniversary on Saturday, for the first time without it being a 
national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet is being held in London at the request of Spanish judge  
Baltasar Garzon, who wants to extradite him and try him for human 
rights abuses during his 1973-1990 dictatorship. Allende committed 
suicide before he could be captured in the coup. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were on alert Friday for violence between leftists who  
claim the legacy of Allende and rightist supporters of Pinochet. 
The coup anniversary typically sparks violence between the two 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Before flying to New Zealand for an Asia Pacific Economic  
Cooperation summit, President Eduardo Frei warned Thursday that 
police had orders to use ``maximum energy'' to maintain the peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, one man was killed and 51 people were injured when  
police used tear gas and water cannons to scatter leftist 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sept. 11 anniversary will not be a legal holiday for the  
first time, after Pinochet agreed to replace it with a ``day of 
national unity'' to be observed the first Monday of September. 
</P>
<P>
	But the debut of the new holiday apparently has done little to  
enhance unity, with sporadic violence breaking out ahead of the 
coup anniversary in working-class neighborhoods and on college 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, meanwhile, relatives of three Chilean dissidents who  
disappeared after Pinochet's coup asked Scotland Yard on Friday to 
begin a criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The request was hand-delivered to Scotland Yard's reception desk  
by the relatives, members of the Chile Committee for Justice.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Bilker Had Ultimate Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Sitting in his German prison cell,  
alleged swindler Martin Frankel is reduced to having to ask for his 
own private toilet, a change of clothes and a soft toothbrush for 
his sensitive gums. 
</P>
<P>
	Just four months ago, Frankel was lord of a Greenwich manor  
where servants catered to his every oddball whim, where more than a 
dozen young women competed to become his favorite, and where he had 
established the ultimate home office. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, 44, fled the United States in May after allegedly  
bilking insurance companies out of hundreds of millions of dollars. 
His arrest last weekend in a Hamburg, Germany, hotel ended a 
four-month international manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
	A picture of the money manager's operation emerged over the past  
few months from interviews with acquaintances and others. 
</P>
<P>
	In Greenwich, he had two adjacent mansions, bought for $5.6  
million in cash, in an exclusive wooded section of town, and 
converted one of them into a brokerage house, with a maze of 
offices stocked with satellite equipment and lined with more than 
80 trading terminals, computers and TV monitors. 
</P>
<P>
	To the annoyance of the neighbors, BMWs and limousines came and  
went at all hours, armed bodyguards were posted outside and young 
women roamed the estate. Floodlights, a 6-foot fence and 
surveillance cameras made the estate look like a fortress. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel sometimes strolled around outside in his pajamas.  
</P>
<P>
	Frankel's former housekeeper, Vera Mironova, recalled a man so  
obsessive that he routinely threw away soap because he insisted on 
having a new bar every time he washed his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	He kept two piles of socks -- old and new. When he was in a good  
mood, he wore the new socks; when he was in a bad mood, he pulled 
out the old ones, Ms. Mironova said. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a bevy of women living in one of the mansions. Some were  
former lovers who, once relegated to ex-girlfriend status, stayed 
on to do office work at the securities brokerage Frankel ran out of 
the other mansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The women vied to become his favorite, a status that usually  
brought expensive gifts, beautiful clothes and chauffeured 
limousines from Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	As he awaits extradition in Hamburg's Holstenglacis prison, a  
gritty place filled with drug suspects awaiting trial, Frankel has 
already complained to a U.S. consular officer about conditions 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a report by the officer, Frankel asked for kosher  
meals -- served hot only -- English-language reading material and 
extra clothing. He also asked for a toothbrush and toothpaste for 
sensitive teeth, saying he has gum disease. He was given his own 
cell, with bath and toilet, to accommodate what he said was a 
chronic prostate infection. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel's fall from grace may have stunned the insurance  
companies he allegedly scammed, but it did not surprise some people 
who knew him more than a decade ago in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	It was there, working out of a bedroom in his parents' Toledo  
home, that Frankel first cultivated an image as a brilliant trader. 
Those who knew him then remember a gangly, pasty-faced man with 
thick glasses who looked like Woody Allen but talked trades like 
Warren Buffett or Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nothing cool about this guy at all, but he had an  
incredible knowledge of the markets,'' said Ted Bitter, a Toledo 
tool-and-die maker who hired Frankel as his broker in 1985. ``He 
genuinely thought himself to be a genius and he wasn't at all shy 
about telling you what a genius he was at the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bitter and two other investors sued Frankel in 1989. Shortly  
thereafter, Frankel gave up his trading license in a settlement 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Being banned from trading didn't stop Frankel. In 1991, he swept  
into the wealthy New York City suburb of Greenwich. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mironova, a Russian immigrant who worked as Frankel's  
housekeeper for six years, said he had a string of girlfriends from 
places such as Russia, Asia and Switzerland. His former bodyguard 
David Rosse told police Frankel met women over the Internet and 
through personal ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel was a semi-regular at The Vault, a New York City  
nightclub that caters to sadomasochists. He collected a riding 
crop, ropes and sadomasochistic literature and pornographic videos. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mironova said Frankel was an eccentric who had strict rules  
about how his household should be run. 
</P>
<P>
	But he could also be warm and generous. One day, he caught her  
drinking a glass of red wine and dancing to rock music. Instead of 
scolding her for not working, he laughed and danced along with her. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, he put on Tchaikovsky as she was cleaning. ``He  
said, 'The rock music is fine, Vera, but you have to learn to 
appreciate other music,''' she recalled.

<HEADLINE> Small New Mexico Town Faces Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Raymond Dominguez and hundreds of  
fellow copper workers lost their livelihoods as a smelter shut its 
doors, dooming the company town of Playas to a grim future. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phelps Dodge plant cast its first copper in 1976. Departing  
employees said their goodbyes at the front gate Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many residents of the tiny town in New Mexico's Bootheel, as the  
southwestern corner of the state is known, fear Playas will fade 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Of 500 employees, 450 lost their jobs. There is little other  
employment in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominguez and his wife, Debbie, are staying so their children  
can finish the school year. But if nothing changes, they will be 
forced to leave in search of work. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominguez started work at the plant in 1978. Four of his five  
children have graduated from Animas High School 22 miles west. 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes to find work as a ranch hand to pay the bills until his  
youngest daughter, Valerie, a 16-year-old senior at Animas High 
School, can graduate in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot take that away from the baby,'' Dominguez said.  
</P>
<P>
	The closing's financial effect on the area will be immense.  
Phelps Dodge paid Hidalgo smelter employees $21 million in wages 
last year. Children of employees accounted for 70 percent of the 
enrollment in the Animas School District. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant paid about $3 million a year in taxes and $25 million  
to other New Mexico business and services in the area. After 
everyone is gone, the payroll will drop to $1.6 million, Phelps 
Dodge spokesman Richard Peterson said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In about a month, a skeleton crew of 50 will remain, monitoring  
environmental compliance, performing maintenance, providing 
security and taking care of some clerical duties, Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The employees took pride in producing a copper product --  
800-pound rectangular copper anodes -- from copper mined in Arizona. 
After processing at an El Paso, Texas, plant, the copper was used 
to make wiring for cars, electric motors and homes. 
</P>
<P>
	There are plans to keep operating the Phelps Dodge Mercantile,  
the only grocery store in Playas, even after the copper workers are 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
	The mercantile is likely to end up being the hub of activity in  
what is left of Playas, said manager Patsy Burk, who has lived in 
Playas since the plant opened. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like we're going to stay open because of enrollment  
in the schools,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dominguez works at the mercantile. She says Playas is a  
peaceful place where parents don't have to worry about gangs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sad thing is we have to be boxed up and ready to move out  
the day after,'' the graduation, she said. ``That's the hard 
thing.''

<HEADLINE> Girl Sentenced in Half-Brother Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANDAN, N.D. (AP) -- A 15-year-old girl was sentenced to 10 years  
in prison Friday for strangling her 4-year-old half brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Randee Sailer of Beulah pleaded guilty to manslaughter in June  
in the death of her half-brother, Jarret Sasse. She will serve her 
sentence at a youth facility until she is 20, then go to an adult 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Jonathan Byers said a harsh sentence was needed  
because the girl had not shown self-control nor expressed remorse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we can hope for change that she will someday have  
(remorse) ... I don't think that this court or society is willing 
to trust that that's going to happen at this point,'' Byers told 
the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	But the girl's attorney, Tom Tuntland, said she was sorry for  
her actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Randee does not express remorse very well, but she does feel  
remorse,'' Tuntland said.

<HEADLINE> Tiny MRI Offers Inside Body Images </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government has approved sale of a tiny MRI  
probe that doctors can thread into a patient's throat to provide 
extra-clear images from inside the body instead of the standard 
outside-the-body MRI. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgi-Vision Inc.'s miniaturized ``endo-esophageal MRI coil,''  
invented by researchers at Johns Hopkins University, was approved 
by the Food and Drug Administration on Friday. The Columbia, 
Md.-based company said it will begin selling the coil to doctors in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	While nestling in the esophagus, the tiny probe gives an image  
of the aorta -- the body's largest artery -- that is nine times 
sharper than the standard MRI provides, said Dr. Ergin Atalar, a 
Hopkins radiologist. Cardiologists are studying whether that 
clearer image will help doctors in determining who is at risk for 
heart disease before they get sick, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	MRIs, or magnetic resonance imagers, have coils on the machine  
that act as antennae to pick up electromagnetic signals from the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	But if doctors could get such an antenna inside the body, closer  
to the organs they're trying to see, the MRI would produce a 
clearer image, Atalar explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies have created internal MRI probes for use in the  
prostate. But Hopkins researchers designed a much tinier version to 
be threaded down a patient's esophagus, allowing doctors to view 
the esophagus and the nearby aorta. Surgi-Vision's goal is to 
eventually create even tinier versions to squeeze into other parts 
of the body.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- An encephalitis outbreak that killed three  
elderly residents in two New York City boroughs has prompted an 
aggressive citywide pesticide dusting to kill disease-carrying 
mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more dead mosquitoes, the better,'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani  
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, only senior citizens have died from the outbreak of  
mosquito-borne encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine other people have been infected, and 60 other possible  
cases are being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	Phase one of the pesticide plan was to have begun Thursday  
night, but bad weather limited spraying from helicopters then and 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani said the city would spray sporadically in the evening  
and morning for the next several weeks, until frost sets in, and 
again in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The encephalitis, which has claimed two lives in borough of  
Queens and one in the borough of Brooklyn, is New York's first 
confirmed breakout of the disease, a strain known as St. Louis 
encephalitis. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease was first detected in Queens, where the first sprays  
began. As the number of suspected cases grew to 60 on Thursday, 
officials said that for the first time, there were three suspected 
cases in Manhattan. There, air spraying is impractical because of 
the density of the buildings and the crowds outdoors, so the 
borough is to be sprayed from the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Research entomologist Roger Nasci of the Centers for Disease  
Control said it was ``exceedingly rare'' for the disease to hit a 
northeast city, and blamed the outbreak on ``bad luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the confirmed cases remain in single digits, Nasci  
expressed concern that ``a very large population'' was at risk 
among the city's 7.4 million residents. Children, the elderly and 
anyone with immune system problems could find the disease fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease, named for the city where the first cases were  
identified in 1933, is often treatable but can kill people with 
compromised immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Although a hotline has fielded more than 13,000 calls since word  
of the illness broke last week, some in Queens' Flushing Meadow 
Park seemed unconcerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was meant to die by a mosquito, I would have died  
already,'' said sunbather Anthony Ferro, 35. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors at Flushing Hospital reported the outbreak on Aug. 24  
after identifying four patients with symptoms of the disease. The 
incubation time for the disease is five to 15 days after the bite 
of a carrier mosquito, and its symptoms include a slight fever, 
headaches or a high fever. 
</P>
<P>
	Blood from the potential victims is flown to a CDC lab in Denver  
for testing to determine if they have the illness.

<HEADLINE> 87-Year-Old Woman Said Soviet Spy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- An 87-year-old British woman now living quietly in  
the suburbs spied for the Soviet Union, passing along secrets used 
in the development of nuclear weapons, The Times newspaper said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, unidentified except for the code-name Hola, allegedly  
was recruited in 1937. The newspaper claims her reports to the 
communists accelerated the development of Soviet nuclear weapons 
immediately after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The report alleged she acquired the information while working as  
a secretary for the British Non-Ferrous Metals Research 
Association, whose work was critical in the development of the 
British nuclear deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said Hola photographed key documents on a  
top-secret project that was a cover for the nuclear weapons program 
and handed the photos to her Soviet controller. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times quoted her as saying that ``in general'' she did not  
believe in ``spying against one's country'' but that she wanted to 
prevent the defeat of a new system that helped ordinary people and 
that she would do the same thing again. 
</P>
<P>
	The report did not say where her home is, except that it is in  
one of the ``Home Counties'' -- the counties surrounding London in 
southern England. 
</P>
<P>
	The information in the Times report comes from a book, ``The  
Mitrokhin Archive,'' by Christopher Andrew, which the newspaper is 
to serialize. The original source of the information was reported 
to be files supplied by dissident KGB officer Vasili Mitrokhin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Home Office, responsible for security matters, would not  
comment on the report except to say that its long-standing practice 
was not to discuss individual cases nor to confirm or deny whether 
an individual is subject to a security investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times quotes Hola as saying, ``I am 87 and my memory is not  
what it was. I did what I did not to make money, but to help 
prevent the defeat of a new system which had at great cost given 
ordinary people food and fares which they could afford, a good 
education, and health service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought perhaps that some of what I had access to might be  
useful in helping Russia to keep abreast of Britain, America and 
Germany.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hola would be of the same generation as modern Britain's most  
famous spies, Cambridge University students who were recruited by 
the Soviets in the mid-1930s -- Kim Philby, Guy Burgess, Donald 
MacLean and Anthony Blunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Burgess, MacLean and Philby escaped to the Soviet Union. Blunt,  
an eminent art expert, traded information for immunity before his 
role was made public in 1979. All are now dead.

<HEADLINE> Danforth Vows Thorough Waco Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As he delves into the FBI's actions in the  
1993 Branch Davidian tragedy, John Danforth will hope for 
cooperation, but if he doesn't get it, the former senator can 
always pull Plan B from his back pocket: an unlimited supply of 
grand jury subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The attorney general has armed me with all the authority under  
the law necessary to get to the facts, including, if necessary, the 
power to empanel a grand jury,'' Danforth said Thursday as Attorney 
General Janet Reno named him to head an independent investigation 
of the FBI's actions at the end of the Branch Davidian standoff 
near Waco, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigating what he calls the ``dark questions'' of Waco,  
Danforth's mission is to delve into whether anyone in the 
government lied or withheld evidence regarding the fatal April 19, 
1993, fire that destroyed the Branch Davidian sect's compound. The 
government has always maintained the Davidians set the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth and the FBI agents who are the focus of his  
investigation could face some difficult choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents who cooperate voluntarily -- a path Danforth says he would  
prefer -- could be placing themselves in legal jeopardy by talking, 
depending on whether they're supplying evidence that touches on any 
criminality. 
</P>
<P>
	If an agent refuses to answer, Danforth must decide whether to  
immunize the witness to compel his cooperation, a step that 
probably would preclude Danforth from prosecuting the person later 
if Danforth concludes the agent engaged in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	While saying he'll wield the legal tools necessary to get the  
facts, Danforth says his goal is to give the American people the 
information they need to answer some key questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``How did the fire start? Were there shootings?'' Danforth said  
Thursday. ``The thing that really undermines the integrity of 
government is whether there were bad acts, whether there was a 
cover-up and whether the government killed people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has been under fierce criticism since revelations that the  
FBI, contradicting a position it had taken for six years, had used 
some potentially incendiary devices on the last day of the 51-day 
standoff. The devices, however, were fired at a bunker, not at the 
building where the cult members were under siege. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth also will investigate whether there was any illegal use  
of the armed forces in the final assault. Delta Force commandoes 
were at Waco the day of the FBI assault on the compound, but the 
Pentagon says the military team had no operational role. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything I've read, everything that I've seen leads me to  
believe that everything'' the Defense Department ``did in support 
of the Department of Justice during this operation was both legal 
and in accordance with the guidance that they had been given,'' 
Army Gen. Henry H. Shelton told the Senate Armed Services Committee 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A retired CIA official, Gene Cullen, claims he has information  
that members of the Delta team were actively involved in the Waco 
siege. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth refused to place a time frame on his probe.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he planned to finish the inquiry by the time the  
Clinton administration leaves town a year and a half from now, 
Danforth did say, ``I certainly hope so. That would seem a long 
time from now to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the former senator made a round of courtesy calls on Capitol  
Hill, congressional leaders said they envision Congress' own Waco 
investigations will be more wide-ranging than Danforth's. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to know it all,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey,  
R-Texas, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said  
Congress should not defer to the executive branch in delving into 
Waco because ``after all, Congress was misled by the executive 
branch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope that they would do it in the broadest possible  
way,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said of 
congressional probes.

<HEADLINE> Mirror-Image QBs Meet Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Mark Brunell doesn't know Steve Young  
very well. And rarely does he consider that his game and Young's 
game are near carbon copies of each other. 
</P>
<P>
	When they play on the same field Sunday, however, the  
similarities will be hard to deny. 
</P>
<P>
	A pair of left-handers, both wearing No. 8, both mobile and both  
with great arms will meet when the San Francisco 49ers play the 
Jacksonville Jaguars in the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Some might consider it a chance for Brunell to wrest away the  
title as the best left-hander in the league. Brunell doesn't quite 
see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, I admire Steve and consider it a compliment to be  
compared to him,'' Brunell said. ``He's a fine quarterback. But I'm 
just here, doing my own thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although they won't spend a second on the field together, the  
judgment this week will be made on the final statistics and the 
final score. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the kind of stage Brunell needs to shine and take his  
game to the championship level. 
</P>
<P>
	Young is already there, with more than 32,000 yards passing, one  
Super Bowl title and a 97.6 career quarterback rating, the best in 
NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has something to prove this year, as well. When people  
say the 49ers are old, past their prime, they're including the 
37-year-old quarterback, who is a year older than Jerry Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Young's age, the 49ers haven't toned down anything in  
their offense to accommodate him. That impresses Jaguars coach Tom 
Coughlin as much as anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gets hit a lot,'' Coughlin said. ``He runs out there wide  
open on the corner. He's in the pocket, out of the pocket. They run 
the naked reverses, run the bootlegs. They do everything in their 
power to take advantage of his skill, and he takes the shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither quarterback likes to make much of the Young vs. Brunell  
debate, although both concede there are valid reasons for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't watched Mark extensively enough to know what the  
comparisons are,'' Young said. ``I just know he's efficient, he 
makes plays, he's accurate. He can throw the deep ball. That's what 
you need to have in the NFL to be successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Niners coach Steve Mariucci was quarterbacks coach at Green  
Bay, he worked out Brunell during his senior year at Washington. 
The Packers weren't in the market for a quarterback, but when 
Brunell was still available in the fifth round of the 1993 draft, 
they felt they had to take him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was, by far, the best athlete available,'' Mariucci said.  
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, the Packers traded Brunell to the Jaguars,  
where he has flourished. He has thrown for 12,512 yards and has an 
86.3 quarterback rating, listed as the fifth-best in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hated to lose him because we knew he was going to be a  
starting quarterback fast,'' Mariucci said. ``We had a tearful 
farewell. I told him I'd see him at the Pro Bowl, because I knew he 
was going to be there. And I knew I'd be playing against him sooner 
or later.''

<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Junie Donlavey and the Wood Brothers, all  
Virginia racing icons, were recognized for their achievements in 
and around racing as the recipients of the Spirit of Ford Award, 
the auto maker's highest racing honor. 
</P>
<P>
	In a ceremony at Richmond International Raceway, site of  
Saturday night's Exide 400 Winston Cup event, Donlavey and Glen 
Wood were presented with Steuben crystal eagles by Edsel B. Ford 
II, the great-grandson of Henry Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Donlavey, whose Winston Cup team is still based in Richmond, has  
been an owner in the premier series since 1950 and has employed 
drivers such as Joe Weatherly, David Pearson, Harry Gant, Buddy 
Baker, Benny Parsons and Ricky Rudd. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of NASCAR Winston Cup's true gentlemen, he has won over  
the entire NASCAR family with his dedication, his honesty and the 
opportunities he has provided for more than 160 drivers during the 
years,'' Ford said in honoring Donlavey. 
</P>
<P>
	Only once in nearly 800 races has Donlavey's car made it to  
Victory Lane, that coming when Jody Ridley won in 1981. The team 
has been second five times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always felt good about being a part of Ford and running  
their products,'' said Donlavey, whose teams have raced Fords for 
four decades. ``They really didn't have to do anything for me, but 
I feel good about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wood Brothers -- Glen, Eddie and Leonard -- have been owners  
since 1953, employing drivers such as Junior Johnson, Curtis 
Turner, Cale Yarborough, David Pearson, Neil Bonnett and Dale 
Jarrett. In more than 950 races, their Fords have been to Victory 
Lane 96 times, the last with Morgan Shepherd in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``As people, they showed the racing world that you can win with  
dignity and perseverance, and the respect they have earned in the 
NASCAR garage is enormous,'' Ford said, adding the Woods have won 
more races than any other Ford team. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

	 *SICK RICK:* Ricky Rudd awoke early Friday morning feeling ill  
and went to the infield medical care center at Richmond 
International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	He was eventually released and returned to his trailer to rest,  
but became sick again and was taken to Chippenham Medical Center 
for further evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudd was still sick Friday night, the team said, and remained in  
the hospital overnight. His status for the Exide 400 was to be 
determined in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Trickle drove the car in qualifying and turned a fast lap  
at 123.389 mph, 31st among the 48 cars and safely in the field for 
the night race. 
</P>
<P>
	If Rudd can start the race Saturday night, he'll do it from the  
back of the field because he didn't qualify his own car. And if 
Rudd can't make it into the car, his streak of 564 consecutive 
races -- the third longest -- would end. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<P>
	 *PIT STOPS:* Dale Earnhardt's victory in the Goody's 500 at  
Bristol two weeks ago made him the 10th different winner in the 
last 10 short-track races in the Winston Cup Series. ... In the 
first 24 races of the season, Ford won 61 of the 120 top five 
finishing positions, or 50.8 percent. Chevrolet has 31 top 5s, 
Pontiac 28. ... Tony Stewart has been the top finishing rookie in 
23 of 24 races this season. Buckshot Jones was 29th to Stewart's 
36th in the third race of the season at Las Vegas. ... Rick Mast 
qualified 16th and will make his 300th career start in the Exide 
400. He's still seeking his first Winston Cup victory.

<HEADLINE> Judge Delays Florida Smokers Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A judge rejected mistrial motions Friday and  
delayed the damage phase of a landmark Florida smokers trial for a 
month to allow for a possible rehearing of a recent appeals court 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Robert Kaye delayed the next phase of the first  
smokers' class-action trial until Oct. 12 while their attorneys 
pursue a request for reconsideration of the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3rd District Court of Appeal ruled last week that the jury  
must decide punitive damages one smoker at a time instead of a 
setting a single dollar amount covering up to 500,000 sick Florida 
smokers, eliminating prospects for a blockbuster award. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the same jury decided the industry produced a defective  
product that causes emphysema, lung cancer, heart disease and other 
ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	The delay gives the smokers' lawyers 20 days to substitute the  
husband of a woman who died of lung cancer as a class 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
	The first two plaintiffs due for determination of damages are  
Angie DellaVecchia and Mary Farnan. Mrs. DellaVecchia, 53, died 
July 25, and the smokers' attorneys want to substitute her husband 
Ralph as her survivor. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaye also ruled on more than a dozen motions by both sides.  
</P>
<P>
	He denied three mistrial motions by the tobacco industry and  
rejected their requests to drop Mrs. Farnan and Mrs. DellaVecchia 
as the opening plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	One mistrial motion argued jurors must have been biased by  
publicity about their verdict even though they had been instructed 
to avoid news coverage of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaye granted an industry motion to split the damage phase into  
two mini-trials: one on compensatory damages to be followed by one 
on punitive damages for the two women. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury heard eight months of testimony and was given thousands  
of industry documents garnered over decades of tobacco litigation 
before ruling against Big Tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants are the nation's five largest cigarette makers --  
Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco, 
Lorillard Tobacco and the Liggett Group -- and two industry 
associations, the Council for Tobacco Research and the Tobacco 
Institute Inc.

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian To Display Cloth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's rare for the Smithsonian Institution to  
put together a show that focuses just on lengths of a single fabric 
and to send it on a three-year tour from Alaska to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wrapped in Pride'' tells the tale of kente cloth, the colorful  
weave linked to royalty in Africa and to black racial pride in the 
United States. It opens Sunday for a stay of almost four months in 
two of the Smithsonian's halls, the Museum of African Art and the 
Arts and Industries Building. 
</P>
<P>
	Doran H. Ross, director of the Museum of Cultural History at  
UCLA, put together an elaborate 347-page catalog. He traces much of 
kente's trans-Atlantic popularity to American-educated Kwame 
Nkrumah. In 1957 Nkrumah led Ghana, on the northwest coast of the 
continent, in black Africa's first successful bid for independence 
from colonial rule, wearing the royal cloth on big occasions 
including his visit to the United States in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have photographs of (then Vice President) Nixon with some  
kente,'' Ross told reporters. ``Nixon went to the inauguration of 
Nkrumah. ... It's perhaps a little bit difficult to realize how 
important that event was in terms of pan-African initiatives ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States was terribly interested in embracing Ghana  
in any way possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton reinforced the  
connection when they visited Ghana 40 years later and appeared 
swathed in broad spreads of kente. 
</P>
<P>
	Last spring Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, a London-trained accountant  
and king of the Ashanti people, emerged from his palace wearing 
brightly colored kente in a sedan chair carried by 20 men. He was 
on his way to his ``enstoolment.'' He seated himself ceremonially 
three times on the Golden Stool, believed to embody the soul of his 
nation -- which makes up 40 percent of Ghana's population. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the republic's constitution gives him no power, the king  
has great influence on the political and business worlds of Ghana 
and power over traditional chiefs in the neighboring Ivory Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Feeling about kente now runs deep in the United States, and can  
have public repercussions. Controversial Washington Mayor Marion 
Barry made suits trimmed with kente his trademark. Last year in 
Denver U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch barred two high school 
graduates from draping kente cloth across their gowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ensure operation of public schools without racial  
identification,'' he ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit closes in Washington Jan. 2, 2000. It will be at the  
Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, Detroit, May 
13 to July 20, 2000; at the Anchorage Museum of History and Art, 
Anchorage, Alaska, Nov. 19, 2000 to Feb. 25, 2001; the Field 
Museum, Chicago, April 15 to July 15, 2001; the Oakland Museum of 
California, Oakland, Calif. Oct. 15, 2001 to Jan. 15, 2002 and the 
Michael C. Carlos Museum, Emory University, Atlanta, February to 
June 15, 2002.

<HEADLINE> Sony Rehires Former TV Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sony Pictures Entertainment has rehired its  
former TV chief Mel Harris as a co-president and chief operating 
officer to oversee television under studio head John Calley. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, who left Sony in 1995 after his contract negotiations  
stalled, returns Sept. 15, sharing his role with Bob Wynne and the 
newly promoted Masayuki ``Yuki'' Nozoe, who will serve as 
co-president for digital entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mel Harris' return to Sony Pictures Entertainment reflects our  
commitment to accelerate SPE's initiatives in digital video and the 
new forms of entertainment it will generate in the 21st century,'' 
Sony chairman Howard Stringer said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment leaves the future of Jon Feltheimer, president  
of Sony's Columbia TriStar Television Group who now reports to 
Harris, up in the air. Feltheimer's contract expires in February 
and he has been negotiating a new pact. 
</P>
<P>
	Feltheimer, who refused comment, was expected to leave as a  
result of the Harris hiring, company sources speaking on condition 
of anonymity told the Los Angeles Times and Daily Variety.

<HEADLINE> New Black Church Pastor Praised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The pastor chosen to head the nation's  
largest black religious denomination -- the National Baptist 
Convention U.S.A. Inc. -- brings a reputation for integrity to a 
group reeling from scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. William Shaw, pastor of White Rock Baptist Church for  
43 years, will succeed the Rev. Henry J. Lyons, the minister 
imprisoned for using the powerful position to steal more than $4 
million from companies and organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has integrity, and clarity of thought,'' said Rev. Archie  
LeMone, who served as Shaw's associate pastor from 1962-66, and is 
now associate director of the National Council of Churches in 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``He expects people to be honest,'' he said. ``If you're in the  
ministry you damn sure better be honest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, 65, a former president of the Pennsylvania State Baptist  
Convention from 1978-84, beat a field of nine candidates at 
Thursday's vote in Tampa, Fla. He ran on a campaign with the 
acronym VISA: vision, integrity, structure and accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who know him say it was a campaign fitting for a man who  
made it a mission to implement a centralized accounting and 
budgeting system when he was president of the Pennsylvania State 
Baptist Convention from 1978-84 and executive director of the 
federal Opportunities Industrialization Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``The National Convention right now needs fiscal  
effectiveness,'' LeMone said. ``He handled millions of dollars for 
the federal government, and he was not audited one time, all the 
books were clean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also could be a refreshing change for the three-million  
member organization still recovering from the scandal of Lyons, the 
folksy eloquent preacher and pastor of a St. Petersburg, Fla., 
congregation. 
</P>
<P>
	Not known for glad-handing or backslapping, Shaw is praised more  
for his intellect and commitment for change. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does not speak without thinking, and when he speaks, he has  
something to say,'' said Rev. C. Edward Geiger, executive director 
of the Metropolitan Christian Council of Philadelphia. ``He is 
clearly committed to strategies and efforts to change the church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a president and board member of the council in the mid-1990s,  
Shaw worked tirelessly for reform, including bringing greater 
inclusion among the different denominational and racial groups, 
Geiger said.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court To Take on Air Bags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide  
whether people can sue automakers for failing to install air bags 
in their cars at a time when federal regulations did not require 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is whether such lawsuits are pre-empted, or legally  
blocked, by federal regulation of car safety.The court said it will 
hear a Washington D.C. woman's argument that she should be allowed 
to sue over injuries she suffered in an accident in her 1987 Honda. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting a head start on its 1999-2000 term, which does not begin  
until Oct. 4, the court agreed to add a half-dozen cases to the 29 
already on tap for full review. Dozens more cases will be added 
through the first several months of the court's term. 
</P>
<P>
	Decisions in each will be announced by late June.  
</P>
<P>
	Other cases accepted by the court Friday included:  
</P>
<P>
	--A case from Alabama and Mississippi to resolve a narrow but  
important point involving disputed arbitrations. The justices said 
they will decide whether a federal judge located where an 
arbitration award is made has the authority to uphold the award 
even though a federal judge elsewhere was asked earlier to overturn 
it. As more and more business contracts include provisions that 
require all disputes to be settled by arbitration, the court's 
eventual decision, expected sometime in 2000, could have broad 
practical impact. 
</P>
<P>
	--A dispute over whether Washington state can set rules for  
staffing and operation of oceangoing oil tankers, even though the 
government says they conflict with national and international 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Whether the time convicted criminals must spend on supervised  
release begins when they are released from prison or, instead, the 
day they should have been set free. 
</P>
<P>
	-- If a runoff election is needed to determine Guam's governor.  
The court will review rulings that stripped Gov. Carl Gutierrez, 
the Democratic incumbent, of the victory he thought he had won last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	--Whether the government can keep secret a letter received from  
British officials about a woman's extradition from England to face 
a criminal charge in the United States. The court said it will use 
the case from Washington state to try clarifying when the Freedom 
of Information Act requires the government to release 
communications from foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
	In the air-bag case, Alexis Geier was injured in January 1992  
when her car went out of control on a curve and struck a tree in 
Washington. She was injured even though she was wearing a seat belt 
and shoulder harness. 
</P>
<P>
	Geier, who was 17 at the time, and her parents sued American  
Honda Motor Co. in 1995, saying the Honda Accord was defective 
because it did not have a driver's side air bag. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda argued that the lawsuit was pre-empted by the 1966  
National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act and a federal 
regulation that made air bags optional for automakers in 1987. 
Since then, the rule has been stiffened. Cars made after September 
1997 must have air bags for the driver and front seat passenger. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled for Honda, and the U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld that ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal rules implicitly pre-empt lawsuits filed under local  
law, the appeals court said, because holding Honda responsible for 
failing to install an air bag would ``interfere with the federal 
government's decision to make air bags only one of federal 
options'' for automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, Geier's lawyers said the federal  
safety law specified that automakers still could be held liable for 
defects even if they complied with federal safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda's lawyers said the appeals court correctly decided that  
allowing the lawsuit to proceed would conflict with the 
government's policy of phasing in air bag technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Geier vs. American Honda Motor Co., 98-1811.

<HEADLINE> Stanley Kubrick Honored in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Stanley Kubrick has been posthumously honored with  
a lifetime achievement award by the Directors Guild of Great 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Christiane Kubrick, his widow, and his daughter Anya accepted  
the award at the London ceremony Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did not relish the attention of those who thought he was  
something special,'' Kubrick's daughter told the gathering, which 
included actor Peter Ustinov and director Alan Parker. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he had to say he did most carefully in his films.''  
</P>
<P>
	Kubrick died in March at the age of 70. His death came only days  
after he finished work on ``Eyes Wide Shut'' starring Tom Cruise 
and Nicole Kidman. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his first film since ``Full Metal Jacket'' in 1987.  
</P>
<P>
	Kubrick's film credits included ``Dr. Strangelove,'' ``A  
Clockwork Orange'' and ``2001: A Space Odyssey.''

<HEADLINE> Court To Review Arbitration Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to use a case  
from Alabama and Mississippi to resolve a narrow but important 
point involving disputed arbitrations. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices said they will decide whether a federal judge  
located where an arbitration award is made has the authority to 
uphold the award even though a federal judge elsewhere was asked 
earlier to overturn it. 
</P>
<P>
	As more and more business contracts include provisions that  
require all disputes to be settled by arbitration, the court's 
eventual decision, expected sometime in 2000, could have broad 
practical impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Cortez Byrd Chips Inc. hired an Alabama construction company in  
1995 to build a mill for it in Brookhaven, Miss., for production of 
wood chips used in the paper-making industry. Bill Harbert 
Construction Co., based in Birmingham, Ala., signed a $1.3 million 
contract with Cortez Byrd Chips but later sought to adjust the sum 
it was to be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute over the contract price went to an arbitration panel  
in Birmingham, which awarded the construction company an additional 
$488,500 for the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Cortez Byrd Chips responded by asking a federal judge in  
Mississippi to set aside the arbitration award. A week later, Bill 
Harbert Construction Co. asked a federal judge in Birmingham to 
confirm the award. 
</P>
<P>
	Told about the earlier court filing, the U.S. District Judge J.  
Foy Guin Jr. ruled that he had the authority to rule in the case 
because ``the place of arbitration determines the jurisdiction of 
the court.'' He then ruled that the construction company should 
receive $274,0000 more than the original contract price, plus 
interest and costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Guin's ruling last  
March. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Cortez Byrd Chips vs. Bill Harbert Construction Co.,  
98-1960.

<HEADLINE> Fleet Paying $1.9M Over Shawmut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fleet Financial Group is paying $200,000 to  
settle federal regulators charges that Shawmut National Bank of 
Boston, which it now owns, failed to tell its investment clients it 
was using their brokerage commissions to pay for client referrals. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement is in addition to the $1.7 million that Fleet --  
the nation's ninth-largest bank -- has already repaid former 
clients, based on its own review that turned up questionable 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the settlement  
Thursday with Fleet, which acquired Shawmut in December 1995. The 
SEC also filed related fraud charges against East West 
Institutional Services Inc., a Detroit brokerage firm, and eight 
individuals, including Michael J. Rothmeier, the former president 
of Shawmut's investment operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet and two of the individuals agreed to settle the civil  
fraud charges, without admitting or denying wrongdoing. East West, 
Rothmeier and the other five people are contesting the charges, and 
their cases will go before an administrative law judge at the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC alleged that beginning in mid-1993, Shawmut Investment  
Advisers Inc. violated its responsibility to its pension fund 
clients by failing to tell them that the brokerage commissions they 
paid went to brokers who referred new clients to Shawmut. 
</P>
<P>
	``Full and fair disclosure to investors is the foundation of the  
federal securities laws,'' Juan Marcel Marcelino, the SEC's 
district administrator in Boston, said in a statement. 
``(Investment) advisers must disclose any and all arrangements 
regarding their use of clients' commissions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet, in a statement from its Boston headquarters, noted that  
it ``promptly initiated its own internal investigation of these 
practices'' by the former Shawmut division and ``voluntarily 
disclosed'' their existence to the SEC in May 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Andreoff, an attorney representing East West,  
declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rothmeier's lawyer, James Quarles, didn't return a telephone  
call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC action follows an investigation by the market watchdog  
agency, the FBI and the Labor Department into allegations that 
brokers and pension managers received kickbacks or gifts in 
exchange for steering investments to Shawmut. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators from the three federal agencies looked into  
allegations that at least two pension funds -- a Teamsters pension 
fund in Chicago and a public fund in Rhode Island -- were bilked of 
millions of dollars in the scheme, The Associated Press reported in 
July 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal, legal and labor sources told The AP the investigators  
reviewed union and investment records in at least four states, 
trying to determine whether questionable commissions that Shawmut 
paid to several East West brokers compromised the pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Fleet voluntarily repaid former clients of Shawmut,  
including one of the pension funds, about $1 million for 
questionable commissions. Fleet, which had acquired Shawmut in 
December 1995, became legally liable for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding East West, Fleet said at the time that a review of  
records kept by Shawmut indicated that the commissions paid to the 
brokerage firm may have been improper because it may not have 
performed research for which it had been paid. 
</P>
<P>
	A Chicago attorney had pushed for an explanation of what  
happened with the funds and a closer examination of ties between 
East West, Teamsters officials and alleged associates of organized 
crime in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Fleet voluntarily repaid approximately $700,000  
last spring. The $1.7 million the bank has paid was credited toward 
the settlement announced Thursday with the SEC, and Fleet has 
agreed to pay the remaining $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The two individuals who agreed to settlements with the SEC are  
two former Shawmut traders, Karen Michalski and Christopher D. 
Sargent. They agreed, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, to 
refrain from future violations of securities laws, to each pay a 
$5,000 civil fine, and to be barred from the investment advising 
business with a right to reapply after 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Rothmeier, the people contesting the SEC's  
charges are Clarke T. Blizzard, former vice president of sales at 
Shawmut Investment Advisers; Rudolph Abel and Donald C. Berry, 
former chief investment officers at Shawmut Investment Advisers; 
Christopher P. Roach, a broker at East West; and Craig Janutol, 
president of East West.

<HEADLINE> NL Ump Rippley Returning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A company controlled by Richie Phillips, the  
head of the umpires union, disclosed it has been receiving about 
$350,000 annually from the American and National leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilot Air Freight Inc. has moved 2,000 tons of baseball  
equipment among 30 cities for more than 13 years, according to 
Richard Morris, the company's chief operating officer. The company 
also has worked with baseball-related charities, such as the Jackie 
Robinson Foundation, Morris said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris denied an allegation by Davey Phillips, a dissident  
umpire who is not related to the union leader, that it has several 
umpires on its payroll. Davey Phillips said last month the payments 
created a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pilot has engaged umpires for public relations purposes for  
nearly 15 years and currently has only two umpires who perform 
services for Pilot Air Freight,'' Morris said, adding that Davey 
Phillips ``had indicated a desire to join the Pilot staff in an 
ongoing capacity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Countered Davey Phillips: ``I never pursued them, they pursued  
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Richie Phillips steered me to an executive in my hometown of  
St. Louis. I worked for them two times -- I was not on the umpires 
union board of directors at the time -- and that was the extent of 
it. I decided I did not want to do it anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davey Phillips, along with Joe Brinkman and John Hirschbeck, has  
been organizing opponents to the union leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Richie Phillips is the chief executive officer of Pilot. Morris  
said its baseball-related revenue was less than 0.25 percent of the 
company's annual total. 
</P>
<P>
	In other umpire news, NL umpire Steve Rippley, who had been  
contemplating retirement, resumes work tonight at Cincinnati, where 
the Reds play the Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	Rippley has not worked in more than a week, unsure of his future  
after 22 of his colleagues were let go by baseball on Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	He had called the NL office last week, saying he wanted to  
retire because he was angry that he would have to work with many of 
the newly hired umpires, whom he said were too inexperienced to 
work in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	NL officials told him to take the weekend off and think about  
his decision before making it final. He then went to North Carolina 
for the funeral of the wife of AL umpire Drew Coble and informed 
the NL office on Wednesday that he would stay on. 
</P>
<P>
	Rippley, 45, is a 16-year veteran and a crew chief. Gary Darling  
and Larry Poncino, who had been on Rippley's crew, were among the 
22 umpires whose resignations were accepted. Rippley's new crew 
includes Wally Bell, Jerry Meals and Hunter Wendelstedt. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, who is in his seventh season, was one of three NL umpires  
who broke with the union leadership. Meals is in his third NL 
season and Wendelstedt is among the 25 newly hired umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	Rippley said he did not want to speak publicly about his reasons  
for changing his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the selection of an arbitrator who will determine  
whether the 22 umps were legally let go was postponed until next 
week, union lawyer Pat Campbell and management lawyer Howard Gans 
decided during a telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of an agreement forged last week at federal court in  
Philadelphia, the sides agreed the umpires could file a grievance 
claiming the 22 should have been allowed to withdraw their 
resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Arbitration Association's Philadelphia office  
provided a list of 15 arbitrators. The sides will take turns 
striking names until one remains, and he will be the arbitrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners intend to argue the arbitrator shouldn't hear the case,  
claiming the collective bargaining agreement leaves decisions on 
terminating umpires to the sole discretion of league presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires submitted their mass resignations in July, all effective  
Sept. 2, hoping to spur an early start to bargaining for a labor 
contract to replace the one that expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy backfired when about two dozen umpires refused to  
go along, and baseball then hired 25 replacements and accepted the 
22 resignations.

<HEADLINE> Belle Having a Fine, Quiet Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Albert Belle takes the same route to right  
field every inning, always takes two swings between each pitch and 
regularly downs two cups of yogurt after every game. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also gotten into the habit of getting at least 30 home runs  
and 100 RBIs every year. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle made it eight straight seasons of reaching 30 homers and  
100 RBIs Thursday night in Minnesota, driving in his 100th run with 
an infield hit to give the Baltimore Orioles a 6-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three players had previously put up those numbers in eight  
straight seasons: Hall of Fame members Jimmie Foxx (12 times), Lou 
Gehrig (nine) and Babe Ruth (eight). 
</P>
<P>
	After the game -- and again on Friday afternoon -- Belle refused  
to talk to the media, a stance of silence he has maintained 
throughout the season with only one exception. But others in and 
around the Baltimore clubhouse marveled at the accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Oriole Frank Robinson hit 586 homers and drove in 1,812  
runs in a brilliant Hall of Fame career, yet he never put together 
more than two successive seasons of 30 homers and 100 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most amazing thing about it is the consistency of it,''  
Robinson said Friday. ``You go out there day in and day out, and 
you have to be fortunate not to get hurt. But the biggest thing is 
his ability to do it year in and year out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The streak began in 1992, when Belle had 34 homers and 112 RBIs  
with the Cleveland Indians. It survived the strike-shortened 1994 
season, when he had 36 homers and 101 RBIs in just 106 games. 
</P>
<P>
	It continued during two seasons with the Chicago White Sox, in  
1997 and 1998, and he's already reached the magic numbers in his 
first season in Baltimore with three weeks left in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had a remarkable year and he just keeps plugging along,''  
Orioles third baseman Cal Ripken said. ``If he finishes up strong, 
just like he has in the past, his numbers will be gigantic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, who knows a thing or two about putting a streak  
together, has hit 30 homers only once during his prolific career. 
He's had just four seasons with more than 100 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``To accomplish it one time is a great thing. The productivity  
he puts up, year in and year out, is remarkable,'' Ripken said. 
``He's definitely one of the most productive hitters of our time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet because the Orioles are in fourth place in the AL East and  
because Belle exceeded 40 homers in three of his previous four 
seasons, he is perceived by many to be having a down year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has the ability to hit 50 homers and drive in 150 runs,  
which is just an unbelievable year that anybody else cannot 
fathom,'' Ripken said. ``The fact that he's done it a couple of 
times raises the bar, raises the expectations. It almost works 
against him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One reason for Belle's big RBI totals is that the players  
batting in front of him are having big seasons. Leadoff hitter 
Brady Anderson, No. 2 hitter Mike Bordick and B.J. Surhoff have 
gotten on base with uncanny consistency. Yet Surhoff has nothing 
but respect for the Orioles' cleanup hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thirty and 100 eight years in a row is a fabulous record,''  
Surhoff said. ``We have a lot of confidence in him. This is pretty 
amazing, especially considering people say he's having a bad year. 
If this is a slow year, hopefully we'll see what it's like in a 
normal, big year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles general manager Frank Wren, who signed Belle to a  
five-year, $65 million contract in December, is convinced the team 
has gotten its money's worth. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Albert, you know what you're going to get. Sometimes you  
get more, sometimes you get less,'' Wren said. ``But it (30-100) is 
at least the standard -- and it's a high standard.''

<HEADLINE> Indians Activate Wright, Langston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Cleveland Indians activated pitchers Jaret  
Wright, David Riske and Mark Langston from the 15-day disabled list 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright has made just two starts over the last seven weeks  
between two stints on the disabled list because of a muscle strain 
in his upper back. The right-hander was placed on the disabled list 
Aug. 9 after aggravating the injury in his start the day before in 
Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright was on the DL because of the same problem July 19-Aug. 3.  
He is 7-7 with a 5.94 ERA in 21 starts, and is scheduled to start 
Sunday against the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Riske, also a right-hander, had been sidelined with a strained  
left oblique muscle. Langston, a lefty, was placed on the DL for 
the second time on Aug. 18 after straining his left quadriceps. 
</P>
<P>
	Riske has appeared in six games for the Indians, all in relief,  
and was 1-0 with a 12.27 ERA. Langston was 1-2 with a 5.34 ERA in 
22 games, including five starts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians also recalled infielders Jolbert Cabrera and John  
McDonald and left-handed pitcher Tom Martin from Triple-A Buffalo. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Milan Honors Gift of Bronze Horse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- A towering bronze warhorse commissioned for  
Milan in the 15th century claimed its rightful place in the city 
today, the gift of an American man who took up where artist 
Leonardo da Vinci long ago left off. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of Americans and Italians stood and applauded as blue  
and white balloons lifted the sheet covering the statue of ``Il 
Cavallo,'' or ``The Horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A dream realized, a friendship strengthened and a tribute to  
Leonardo da Vinci,'' Milan mayor Mayor Gabriele Albertini said. 
U.S. Navy and Italian bands played American and Italian anthems. 
</P>
<P>
	At 24-feet-high, the $6 million horse is said to be the largest  
bronze equine statue in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonardo was commissioned by the duke of Milan to cast a similar  
horse statue, but he never had the chance. The nobleman went to war 
with France and decided he needed the massive amount of bronze for 
cannons instead. 
</P>
<P>
	The dedication came 500 years to the day that the war forced  
Leonardo to abandon Milan, and his dream project. 
</P>
<P>
	A descendant of Duke Ludivico Sforza was among those watching  
the dedication today in a green, colonnaded park being created 
across from a Milan horse track. 
</P>
<P>
	An American airline pilot and art lover, Charles Dent of  
Allentown, Pa., initiated the modern-day version as a tribute to 
Leonardo, the Renaissance and the Italian people. Dent's family saw 
the project through after he died in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure Charlie is smiling down looking at the  
celebrations,'' nephew Charles W. Dent said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Milan's mayor, Gabriele Albertini, welcomed the gift Thursday  
night in a tribute at the northern Italian city's sumptuous La 
Scala opera house, which dedicated the evening's concert to 
Leonardo and ``Il Cavallo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The concert was part of days of festivities surrounding the  
dedication of the horse. Coming days will bring firework displays, 
public concerts, skydiving exhibitions and balloon trips for aerial 
views of the sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible to think something like this is a gift,'' said  
Fiammetta Roselli-Delturco, an Italian at today's dedication. 
</P>
<P>
	It was all a little stunning to the sculptor who brought the  
project to fruition for the Dent family and their supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just sitting down and being in a bit of shock,'' sculptor  
Nina Akamu said at intermission at the red-and-gilt La Scala, 
surrounded by Italian and American dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you think of how many people have been involved in this --  
sometimes I'm the focus of it, but really I feel like I'm just a 
spokesman for them,'' Akamu said. 
</P>
<P>
	The city intends to create a park around the horse, saying the  
site will become a new landmark for Milan's citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Akamu oversaw creation of the horse at the Tallix Art Foundry in  
Beacon, N.Y. All copies of Leonardo's original plans for the statue 
have been lost, and Akamu has said the modern version is inspired 
by Leonardo's vision.

<HEADLINE> With No Fanfare, Bayer Cans Cotton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Don't worry about getting that wad of cotton  
out of the aspirin bottle: It's not there any more. 
</P>
<P>
	Without fanfare, Bayer Corp. removed the cotton from its Genuine  
Bayer aspirin bottles early this year, ending forever the 
frustrating practice of picking it out to get at the tiny 
headache-stopping tablets. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a change in tradition that went largely unnoticed -- The  
Wall Street Journal first reported it in an article Friday. The 
practice of shoving cotton into aspirin bottles dates back to about 
1914 or 1915, around the time Bayer began compressing aspirin 
powder into tablets, said Anne Coiley, a company spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not a simple decision to make, according to corporate  
officials. Before Bayer decided to tamper with a time-proven 
product, it had to test the integrity of cotton-less bottles, 
making sure the tablets would hold up without the extra packing and 
running marketing surveys to determine if it would hurt sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``We concluded there really wasn't any reason to keep the cotton  
in except tradition,'' Chris Allen, vice president of technical 
operations for Pittsburgh-based Bayer, said Friday. ``It's hard to 
get out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And they just figured this out?  
</P>
<P>
	There was a time in the not-too-distant past that cotton served  
a vital purpose for aspirin manufacturers, Allen said. It kept the 
product from falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
	In the old days, the aspirin tablets in a bottle could pulverize  
themselves, banging together until they turned back into dust. The 
cotton tended to keep that from happening. 
</P>
<P>
	That began to change for Bayer nearly 20 years ago. It was in  
1980 when Genuine Bayer became a coated tablet, virtually ensuring 
that -- with or without the cotton -- it wouldn't beat itself into 
dust inside the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the cotton wads remained. When Bristol-Myers Squibb  
Co., the maker of Excedrin, Bufferin and Nuprin, got rid of cotton 
in the mid-90s, Bayer appeared to stand idly by. 
</P>
<P>
	But all along, said Allen, the company was considering getting  
rid of the cotton wads. Early this year, Bayer introduced its 
Gelcaps product, sans cotton. And it decided to stop shoving cotton 
in its Genuine Bayer bottles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it was an improvement we could make,'' Allen said.  
``We're always trying to find little things we can do to improve 
this product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regis Amon, shopping in a downtown Pittsburgh pharmacy on  
Friday, hadn't realized Bayer had dispensed with the cotton 
stuffing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I imagine it would be a plus. Sometimes it's hard to get  
out,'' said Amon, 83, of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	There still are a few Bayer products that include cotton. The  
company's chewable tablets are more likely to crush themselves, so 
the cushion remains. But Allen said the wads should be taken out 
once the bottle is opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton acts as an absorbent, making it more likely that moisture  
will get into the bottle and onto the tablets once the seal is 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Ross, a professional practice associate with the Center  
for Proper Medication Use in Philadelphia, said no reason was left 
to keep the cotton once the pills became hard enough to withstand 
shipment. ``It was something you opened the bottle and you felt 
comfy about,'' Ross said. ``I don't think I'm going to miss it. It 
was a tradition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Schmittlein, chairman of the marketing department at the  
Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said Bayer may be 
giving up a way that it differentiates its product from 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayer officials say some customers have asked about the missing  
cotton. ``It's more curiosity than complaints,'' Allen said.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Touts Train Despite Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite equipment problems that have delayed  
the start of high-speed train service in the Northeast, Amtrak is 
continuing with a roughly $7 million advertising campaign for its 
new ``Acela'' service. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads were supposed to generate interest before the train's  
scheduled introduction late this year. Amtrak officials said the 
campaign would stay on course because the ads not only will promote 
the new train but also service upgrades on other trains in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really not about the high-speed train; it's about the  
rebranding of the service,'' said Amtrak spokesman Rick Remington. 
``It's getting the name out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the ads, all of which were bought before Amtrak  
announced the delay last week, feature the new train -- a 
silver-and-turqoise bullet train that will eventually run at 160 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The new signs are part of a $20 million overall ad campaign by  
Amtrak this year. They are appearing on buses, billboards and other 
outdoor sites in Boston, New York, Washington, Philadelphia, 
Providence, R.I., and New Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year Amtrak rolled out the Acela name in movie  
theater ads shown before films such as ``Star Wars'' and ``Notting 
Hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new train's builder, Montreal-based Bombardier-Alstom, faces  
fines for not delivering the high-speed cars on time. But Amtrak 
said it has no plans to seek reimbursement for the ad campaign. The 
ads ``are getting people's attention and that's the whole 
purpose,'' Remington said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak and Bombardier-Alstom announced last week that premature  
wear on the new train's wheels would delay its rollout until next 
spring at the earliest. The discovery was made while testing one of 
20 new eight-car train sets at a site in Pueblo, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, a set of wheels has been modified and shipped to  
Philadelphia, where it has been placed on a second test train. That 
train, which has already run at 90 mph, will begin runs with the 
new wheels next week. Eventually it will speed up to 165 mph, 5 mph 
over its service speed but the train's actual design speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Acela Express'' will be the name on the new trains, which will  
run in the Boston-New York-Washington corridor. Amtrak also plans 
to rename services from Newport News, Va., to Buffalo, N.Y., as 
either ``Acela Regional'' or ``Acela Commuter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The regional and commuter lines will offer 333 completely  
refurbished passenger cars and 52 redesigned cafe cars. The 
regional service will start in January with two daily roundtrips 
between Boston, New York and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	On each segment, the travel time will be less than four hours --  
not the 2 1/2 to 3 hours that will be provided by the new train. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak also is investing in new stations and a new reservation  
system, and has retrained 10,000 employees to give passengers 
better service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just the train itself isn't going to cut it,'' Remington said.  
``Most likely, people would ride it once and then not come back. 
You've got to upgrade all aspects of your service.''

<HEADLINE> Kinkel Lawyers Try To Block Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Lawyers for school shooting suspect Kip  
Kinkel are trying to block prosecutors from searching for physical 
defects in Kinkel's brain. 
</P>
<P>
	The request was among a flurry of legal challenges that Circuit  
Judge Jack Mattison will hear Sept. 20, a week before jury 
selection is scheduled to start in the teen-ager's aggravated 
murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers plan to say Kinkel was insane or bears  
diminished responsibility for the May 1998 shootings because of a 
mental disease or defect. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers acknowledge that the state has a right to have  
Kinkel undergo a psychiatric examination by a prosecution expert. 
But they argue that medical tests to examine his brain through 
magnetic imaging and other advanced technologies are not 
psychological tests and are not allowed by law. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy District Attorney Caren Tracy argued in a brief court  
hearing Tuesday that the neurological testing is necessary to 
develop a ``complete, honest and accurate'' assessment of Kinkel's 
mental condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel, 17, faces 58 charges in the fatal shootings of his  
parents, Bill and Faith Kinkel, found dead at the family's home, 
and the Thurston High School shootings that killed two students and 
wounded 22 other students. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of aggravated murder, Kinkel could spend the rest  
of his life in prison. Oregon law does not allow the death penalty 
for defendants younger than 18.

<HEADLINE> GM, Ford, Saturn Recall Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. have  
recalled a total of more than 353,000 vehicles with safety defects, 
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said. 
</P>
<P>
	No accidents or injuries have been reported as a result of the  
defects with the GM, Ford and Saturn vehicles, spokesmen said 
Friday. Owners of all the vehicles were asked to take them to 
dealerships for free repairs, NHTSA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalls were posted by NHTSA on its Internet site on  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	GM said it was recalling 168,035 Buick Century and Buick Regal  
1999-model passenger cars built between March 1998 and April 1999. 
In some of the vehicles, a short circuit in the antilock brake 
system could cause a nearby plastic fuel hose to overheat and leak, 
possibly resulting in fire beneath the hood, GM said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford recalled 183,000 1998 and 1999 Ford Contour and Mercury  
Mystique compact sedans built between July 1997 and April 1998. The 
accelerator cable could fray and not return the engine to idle when 
the gas pedal is released, Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's Saturn division issued two recalls of its new 2000 LS  
mid-size cars -- 1,310 made between May and July that have a 
potentially leaky fuel valve, which could result in fuel spillage 
in a rollover, and 1,437 of the vehicles built during the same 
period whose turn signals and hazard lights might malfunction.

<HEADLINE> Hip-Hop Conference Celebrates Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- It might be considered a rapper's delight.  
</P>
<P>
	The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is sponsoring a  
weekend conference to discuss, examine and flat out celebrate 
hip-hop's saturation of pop culture over the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	About 900 people -- including music industry representatives,  
performers, artists, academics and even plain old fans -- registered 
for the meeting being held at Cleveland State University. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the hip-hop heavyweights, Rapper KRS-One delivered the  
keynote speech Friday. Chuck D, the founder of Public Enemy, was to 
speak today as was Kool Herc, the Jamaican disc jockey and rap 
pioneer who began talking over the music in the 1970s while playing 
records at dance parties in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not just doing hip-hop, we are hip-hop,'' an exuberant  
KRS-One said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference schedule was packed with panels examining a  
spectrum of topics that show hip-hop's influence not just on music 
but other aspects of culture as well, including dance styles, 
graffiti art, poetry, feminism and political expression. 
</P>
<P>
	But Friday, the message was focused. Since hip-hop first broke  
through with a mainstream hit 20 years ago -- the Sugar Hill Gang's 
``Rapper's Delight'' -- its influence has transcended pop music, 
seeping into all aspects of American life. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's still growing.  
</P>
<P>
	KRS-One said the conference's title ``Hip-Hop: A Cultural  
Expression,'' fit perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hip-hop is a behavior that frees the mind of inner city  
people,'' he said. ``We are not an artifact. We are not art that 
has become a fact. We are art in effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Stewart, the rock hall's executive director and chief  
executive officer, said it was precisely hip-hop's omnipresence 
over the past two decades -- be it in the aggressive, big beats of 
rap, teen-agers' baggy clothes or the breakdance craze of the 1980s 
-- that made it a good conference topic. 
</P>
<P>
	The rock hall has taken some criticism since it opened in 1995  
for not giving enough attention to hip-hop, although this weekend's 
meeting is the precursor to a hip-hop exhibit scheduled to open in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most pervasive form of music in the world today  
and probably will remain that way for as long as any of us care to 
think about it,'' Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	While undeniably happy to see the music he grew up with in New  
York earn recognition on top of its financial success, KRS-One also 
seemed a bit bemused by the idea of hip-hop being analyzed in the 
halls of academia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharing the stage Friday with Case 2, a New York graffiti  
artist, KRS-One recalled how in the early days of hip-hop, parents, 
police and preachers all looked down on the form. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at us now,'' KRS-One said. ``We're here in the  
university, discussing hip-hop.''

<HEADLINE> Child Killed by E. Coli Buried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MALTA, N.Y. (AP) -- Standing in the chilly drizzle, Wayne and  
Lori Aldrich released colored balloons Friday as they buried their 
3-year-old daughter Rachel -- the first victim of one of the worst 
E. coli outbreaks in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	Then they headed back to the hospital to stand vigil over their  
2-year-old daughter Kaylea, who was struggling with kidney failure 
after sipping a glass of water with her sister on Aug. 28 at the 
Washington County Fair. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials were investigating late Friday afternoon if the death  
of a 79-year-old man at the Stratton VA Medical Center, in Albany, 
was also related to the deadly outbreak. They said he had visited 
the fair and showed symptoms of the infection. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 600 suspected cases of contamination have been  
reported from the fair, held 30 miles north of Albany, making it 
New York state's largest E. coli outbreak ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight other children from the fair were on dialysis Friday at  
Albany Medical Center Hospital as doctors tried to filter toxins 
from their blood. Two other children and two adults also remained 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain runoff is believed to have washed the potentially deadly E.  
coli bacteria from cow manure at a nearby cattle barn into the 
fair's underground water supply. 
</P>
<P>
	After a graveside memorial service underneath a canopy of pine  
trees, Ms. Aldrich described Rachel as ``happy, vivacious, full of 
fun and compassion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When we were at the fair, there were balloons released,'' the  
girl's father said. ``Rachel asked why and at the time I didn't 
know, but today I was inspired. Sometimes things you love just slip 
away from you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost two weeks earlier, the family had spent a carefree day at  
the fair, which is an end-of-summer tradition that has been going 
on for 109 years. It was a day of merry-go-rounds, games and 
petting zoo animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Aldrich said the day at the fair was Rachel's ``last day of fun  
in this world.''

	``We went out to have a good time and the girls really enjoyed  
themselves,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls became sick a day later. A week later, Rachel was dead  
because of hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can result in kidney 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, just moments after Rachel's service, the Aldriches  
received some good news: After three days of dialysis, Kaylea was 
well enough not to need the treatment that day. 
</P>
<P>
	Children, because of their undeveloped immune systems, are more  
susceptible to being sickened by E. coli and the serious 
complications that can result. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many other families, the Aldriches have spent the last week  
at the hospital, praying for their child to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, we can't sit down and tell a specific family  
their kid is going to be fine,'' said Dr. Raymond Walsh, a 
pediatric critical care specialist at the hospital. ``We don't have 
any good answers to give them other than telling them most kids do 
recover from this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said undergoing dialysis is frightening for children.  
</P>
<P>
	``One kid woke up the other night and saw the tubes in her and  
thought they were snakes,'' he said. ``Most of them are under 5 
years old and don't really understand what they're going through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the funeral, Aldrich implored the public to remember the  
other ailing children by donating blood or helping in any way 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of sick babies right now,'' he said. ``And I  
don't know what I'd do if I lost another one.''

	U.N. Compound Looted in East Timor  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Drunk on stolen beer, pro-Indonesian  
militiamen looted the U.N. compound in East Timor on Friday, 
smashing equipment and terrifying East Timorese still inside after 
most of the U.N. staff were evacuated. Indonesian troops fired guns 
to intimidate the 80 remaining U.N. workers, several journalists 
and hundreds of refugees while militia extremists chanted for them 
to be burned out. President Clinton called the attacks on the 
compound ``simply unacceptable,'' and said it was clear the 
Indonesian military was ``aiding and abetting the militia 
violence.'' Clinton was in Hawaii on his way to a Pacific Rim 
summit in New Zealand.

	Israel Transfers More of West Bank  
</P>
<P>
	GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Three days ahead of schedule,  
Israel on Friday transferred 7 percent of the West Bank to 
Palestinian control. The handover, concluding the first stage of a 
new Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, took the Palestinians a step 
closer to their ultimate goal of statehood and boosted trust 
between the two sides after years of deadlock. Ahead of Friday's 
handover, the Palestinians had full or partial control over 29 
percent of the West Bank.

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli Jews went to synagogue at the start of  
the Jewish New Year Friday. For Jews worldwide, the New Year, or 
Rosh Hashana, marks the solemn beginning of a 10-day period of 
prayer and reflection that ends with Yom Kippur, the Day of 
Atonement, the holiest day on the Jewish calendar. Israeli security 
forces set up roadblocks and increased their presence, precautions 
against possible attacks by extremist Palestinians.

	Puerto Rican Nationalists Freed

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Puerto Rican nationalists granted clemency  
by President Clinton began leaving prison today. A spokesman for 
the U.S. Bureau of Prisons said 11 of the 16 people offered 
clemency by Clinton were being released today. Most of those 
eligible for clemency were members of the ultranationalist FALN, 
responsible for some 130 bombings in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
that left six dead and scores wounded. Clinton's offer stirred 
controversy among victims of FALN violence and complicated his 
wife's potential bid for the Senate from New York.

	Floyd Unlikely To Hit Land Soon  
</P>
<P>
	THE VALLEY, Anguilla (AP) -- Islanders boarded up houses and  
stocked up on emergency supplies today, taking no chances as 
Tropical Storm Floyd strengthened into a hurricane, even though 
forecasters said it is unlikely to hit land in the next few days. 
At 2 p.m. EDT, Floyd was moving farther away from land, centered 
about 210 miles northeast of Barbuda in the northern Leeward 
Islands. Hurricane force winds extended about 70 miles from the 
storm's center and tropical storm force winds another 175 miles. 
Forecasters said some islands could experience tropical storm 
conditions.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- National League president Len Coleman, at odds  
with the commissioner's office over control of umpires and player 
discipline, plans to resign later this year, a high-ranking 
baseball official said today. Coleman, baseball's highest-ranking 
black official, has headed the NL since March 1994. He had been 
resisting the efforts of commissioner Bud Selig to switch control 
of umpires to his office from the league presidents.

<HEADLINE> Court To Decide Guam Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court said today it will decide --  
sometime in 2000 -- whether a runoff election is needed to determine 
Guam's governor. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices said they will review rulings that stripped Gov.  
Carl Gutierrez, the Democratic incumbent, of the victory he thought 
he had won last November. 
</P>
<P>
	The court granted an appeal in which Gutierrez and Lt. Gov.  
Madeleine Bordallo seek to avoid the runoff election against 
Republican former Gov. Joseph Ada and his running mate, Felix 
Camacho. 
</P>
<P>
	The case will be argued this winter.  
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled  
that a runoff election is necessary because 1,313 blank ballots 
deprived Gutierrez and Bordallo of the absolute majority they 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Guam is a U.S. territory about 3,700 miles southwest of Hawaii.  
Gutierrez and Ada were the only two gubernatorial candidates in 
last November's election. Gutierrez received 24,250 votes; Ada 
21,200. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law requires a territorial governor to get ``a majority  
of the votes cast in any election,'' and Guam's Election Commission 
declared Gutierrez the winner by a slim margin after adding about 
1,900 write-ins and defective votes to the total. 
</P>
<P>
	Ada sued, contending that the 1,313 ballots on which no votes  
were cast in the governor's contest but were marked for other races 
had to be counted as ``votes cast in any election.'' Counting those 
votes would leave Gutierrez 83 votes shy of a majority. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge John Unpingco ordered a runoff, and a  
three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit court unanimously upheld his 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress presumably would not have included the phrase 'in any  
election' if it meant to refer only to the votes cast in the single 
election for governor and lieutenant governor,'' the appeals court 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Gutierrez and Bordallo  
noted that the exact wording appears in a federal law governing 
gubernatorial elections in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and that a 
federal appeals court ruled that ballots do not count unless marked 
for the territorial governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Gutierrez vs. Ada, 99-51.

<HEADLINE> Timber Co., Environs To Cooperate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Papermaker Westvaco Corp. has reached an  
unprecedented deal with a major environmental group to protect its 
most fragile forests. 
</P>
<P>
	But the arrangement does not restrict tree-cutting on the vast  
bulk of the company's 1.3 million timber holdings in the United 
States, evoking mixed reaction from other environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts from the Nature Conservancy and Westvaco will inspect  
the timber company's entire holdings, identify lands that contain 
endangered or rare plants and animals, and suggest ways to protect 
them, such as avoiding clear-cuts of forests. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties declined to estimate how many acres might be  
protected, and the deal, announced Thursday, will not change 
Westvaco's tree-cutting practices outside of protected areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the arrangement is one of the most sweeping examples to  
date of how the business and environmental communities are shedding 
traditional adversarial relationships to try to change specific, 
criticized practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Home Depot, the nation's largest retailer of lumber,  
agreed not to sell any wood from endangered forests, capitulating 
to several years of protests from environmental groups. Two U.S. 
subsidiaries of Mitsubishi reached an agreement last year with the 
Rainforest Action Network to use wood and paper products produced 
under ecologically sound conditions. In exchange, the group dropped 
a long-running U.S. boycott against the units. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Nature Conservancy has agreements with other forest  
products companies, the size of the Westvaco deal is unprecedented, 
said the group's chief executive, John Sawhill. The group has 
previously protected 11 million acres in the United States through 
hundreds of arrangements with landowners and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope this will set a precedent for others in the  
industry,'' Sawhill said. 
</P>
<P>
	But like some other cooperative arrangements, Thursday's deal  
provoked a mixed reaction within the environmental movement, where 
critics worry that positive publicity could help companies deflect 
criticism about less sound areas of their operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good piece of a bigger puzzle, (but) the overall the  
picture isn't pretty,'' said Christopher Hatch, director of 
campaigns for the Rainforest Action Network, another environmental 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said the deal won't keep Westvaco from clear-cutting trees  
and conducting other potentially harmful practices in the vast bulk 
of its U.S. holdings, and doesn't address the company's 200,000 
acres outside the United States, including land in Brazil and 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists are particularly focused on trying to stop  
companies from logging so-called ``old-growth'' forests, 
undisturbed habitats that are home to a wide diversity of plants 
and animals. Only 20 percent of the world's original forests 
remain, mostly in Brazil, Russia and Canada, amid intensive logging 
and population pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Westvaco, through a spokesman, said it does not  
log any old-growth forests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Far from trying to hide things, we are reaching out in a  
voluntary manner to demonstrate we are a very good steward to the 
forest,'' said spokesman William Fuller. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, Hatch said, the move ``signifies a change in the  
marketplace'' reflecting demand from both business customers and 
individuals for better environmental practices. 
</P>
<P>
	One indication in the trend is seen by a big increase in the  
number of acres owned by timber companies that adhere to 
international standards for environmentally sound tree-cutting, 
which are set by the Forest Stewardship Council, a Oaxaca, 
Mexico-based group.

<HEADLINE> Alcohol Industry Said Policing Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The alcohol industry should strengthen some of  
its voluntary standards to better deter advertising to young 
audiences, but overall companies have been effective in overseeing 
themselves, say federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	A report released Thursday by the Federal Trade Commission  
recommends that companies selling alcoholic products establish a 
third-party review to ensure they are following their own set codes 
that discourage targeting teen-agers. But the FTC's report to 
Congress did not urge mandatory regulation of advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finding ways to deter alcohol use by those under 21 is a  
challenge for government agencies, consumer organizations and the 
beverage alcohol industry,'' said FTC chairman Robert Pitofsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC urged companies to make more stringent a standard that  
generally permits media ads even when half the audience is under 
21. The commission also advised that the industry limit placement 
of alcoholic products to movies rated R and NC-17, after finding 
that some of these products make their way into PG films and 
television shows popular with teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also suggested companies should prohibit ads with  
substantial underage appeal, even if they also appeal to adults or 
instead target their ads to persons 25 and older. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies applauded the report's findings and said many of the  
recommendations would not amount to major changes in their 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Coors Brewing Co. chief executive Peter Coors said his company  
already sets a higher standard for its ad audiences, by requiring 
that 60 percent of viewers be over the age of 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Coors and others support a third-party review system, as a way  
to solidify public confidence in the alcohol industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are responsible advertisers and believe that voluntary  
third party review will reinforce a foundation of trust with the 
American people that we are a responsible industry,'' said Charles 
Phillips, head of United Distillers &AMP; Vintners North America Inc., 
whose consumer brands include Smirnoff vodka and Guiness stout. 
</P>
<P>
	Some groups do not think there is a need for a third-party  
review. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Becker, vice president of alcohol issues for the Beer  
Institute, said brewers already must meet the voluntary industry 
codes, standards set by networks and other rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``Adding to this comprehensive advertising process would be  
redundant,'' Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
	John De Luca, president of the San Francisco-based Wine  
Institute, said he would need compelling evidence that such 
third-party oversight is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	The report examined product placement, Internet advertising and  
college marketing in the industry using reports from eight leading 
beer, wine and liquor companies and input from other sources.

<HEADLINE> British Official Gets IMF Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund said Friday  
that Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown has been 
named chairman of the Interim Committee, the fund's policy-making 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	An IMF statement said Brown succeeds Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who  
resigned in May to become Italy's president. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interim Committee comprises 24 members representing the  
largest of the IMF's 182 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	It meets twice a year and provides guidance for future  
discussions of the executive board of the IMF, which makes 
day-to-day decisions on loan requests and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee usually meets just before the spring and fall  
meetings of the IMF and World Bank. The next meeting is scheduled 
for Sept. 26.

<HEADLINE> Sega's Dreamcast Has a Glitch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Sega Enterprises Ltd. acknowledged Friday  
that some of the software for its new Dreamcast video-game system 
doesn't work, only a day after the much-hyped system hit store 
shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	Sega spokeswoman Jennifer Walker said that only a small quantity  
of some of the new Dreamcast games were affected, blaming it on a 
manufacturing problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The games affected were Blue Stinger, Sonic the Hedgehog, Hydro  
Thunder and Ready to Rumble. The company emphasized the problems 
were not related to the Dreamcast console. 
</P>
<P>
	Struggling Sega has been counting on Dreamcast to vault it back  
to the top of the U.S. video-game market, and analysts had warned 
that any problems could be devastating to the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers said, however, that glitches weren't immediately  
impacting sales, which were going quite well. Toys R Us said that 
all of its 705 stores nationwide sold out of the Dreamcast console 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sega said late Friday that it had recorded $97 million in  
initial sales of equipment and games on Thursday, easily surpassing 
the company's expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Kennedy, news editor of the San Francisco-based  
videogames.com Web site, said that even a minor glitch could be a 
big problem for Sega. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a lot of hype for this system and they had a great  
launch up until now,'' he said. ``This may not seem like a big 
deal, but they can't really afford any problems right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Customers quickly noticed that some of their games weren't  
working, retailers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started hearing stuff from some of the consumers who had  
come in at midnight. Their games weren't loading properly. We 
started making Sega aware of what we were hearing,'' said Peter 
Roithmayr, vice president of merchandising of video games at the 
Electronics Boutique chain, based in West Chester, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Roithmayr said customers were not very upset.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is certainly not a panic thing. We have a small problem and  
it isn't a hardware issue -- which is good because a hardware 
problem is a lot tougher to fix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Software Etc. in New York City, manager Charles Stanley said  
several customers have come in to complain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been fortunate, though. I've heard about lot of problems  
from people on the Internet and they aren't happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sega said the affected software amounts to less than 1 percent  
of the games and 1 percent of the WebBrowser CDs, used to help 
connect Dreamcast users to the Internet. The company said it would 
send out all new WebBrowser CDs on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sega said customers with problems can send e-mail to  
support(at)sega.com or call 1-877-383-3291.

<HEADLINE> Cheese Blintzes Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cheese blintzes manufactured by a small New  
York company and sold in 10 states may be contaminated with 
salmonella, which can cause serious infections in certain people, 
the Food and Drug Administration and New York officials said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratner's Retail Foods is voluntarily recalling frozen cheese  
blintzes sold nationwide, after two New Yorkers became ill with 
salmonella, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The blintzes -- cheese, blueberry-cheese and cherry-cheese -- were  
sold in 13-ounce packages in stores in California, Colorado, 
Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New 
Jersey, New York and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers who purchased the blintzes are urged to return them to  
the store of purchase for a refund, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms of salmonella include diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain  
and vomiting. Healthy people typically recover in a few days, but 
salmonella can cause serious, even life-threatening infections in 
young children, the elderly and people with weak immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Department of Health said anyone who purchased  
Ratner's cheese blintzes within the past six months may be at risk 
of infection.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Pushed on School Vouchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWTON, Iowa (AP) -- Democratic presidential candidate Bill  
Bradley said Friday that he has backed school vouchers ``as an 
experiment'' but doesn't think they are the answer to fundamental 
educational problems facing the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it makes any sense as a national answer,''  
Bradley said in response to a question by an uncommitted Democrat, 
Jamie Sahn. 
</P>
<P>
	During his 18-year Senate career, Bradley conceded he had voted  
in favor of school vouchers on occasion, but insisted it was only 
on a limited basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Advocates of school choice say that the reason school choice  
is good is that it will create competition that will make the 
public schools better,'' said Bradley. ``You don't know that unless 
you have a test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Republican candidates favor a voucher system where  
parents can select the school they want their children to attend. 
GOP front-runner George W. Bush has proposed stripping federal 
funds from poor performing schools and allowing parents to use them 
for other educational alternatives for their children, including 
private schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Voucher supporters say they give families in poverty the same  
rights as the wealthy to pick the best schools. Critics contend 
that vouchers will devastate public schools by draining money away. 
Teachers are an important group in Democratic politics, and they 
strongly oppose vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
	In seeking the Democratic nomination, Bradley can ill-afford to  
offend that constituency, but he was probed on the issue in his 
most recent swing. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was in the Senate, I have voted for vouchers as an  
experiment in about six urban areas in the country,'' said Bradley, 
who represented New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey contains some of the poorest urban centers in the  
nation, with drug- and gun-riddled schools, Bradley argued. He said 
parents in those areas deserved a chance to get their children out 
of a failing school. 
</P>
<P>
	``My job was not just to represent suburbia, but also urban New  
Jersey,'' Bradley said. ``Why don't we try an experiment that will 
help?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley conceded that even discussion the voucher issue carries  
risks, because critics could pounce on his backing even an 
experiment with vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try to be as candid with you as possible,'' Bradley said.  
``That leads to a maximum possibility of distortion. Ultimately, 
you have to give the people the benefit of the doubt on this kind 
of an issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has occasionally used home-state considerations in  
defining his stance on the issues. While he said urban worries in 
New Jersey sparked his position on school vouchers, he's also used 
New Jersey as the reason for opposing ethanol subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethanol is distilled from corn and is very popular in Iowa.  
Bradley voted against the subsidies in the Senate, but says he now 
favors them. He said ethanol subsidies would have increased 
gasoline prices in New Jersey, but that he has a different 
constituency in seeking the Democratic presidential nomination.

<HEADLINE> CIA Wary on N. Korea, Iran Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- North Korea is preparing to flight-test a  
ballistic missile ``at any time'' that could be developed into an 
intercontinental-range weapon capable of striking U.S. territory, 
the CIA says. 
</P>
<P>
	A report released by the CIA on Thursday also said Iran probably  
will develop ICBMs over the next 15 years and that Iraq poses an 
additional -- though somewhat more distant -- ballistic missile 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
	The report characterized the prospect of North Korea acquiring a  
long-range missile by 2015 as ``most likely,'' Iran's prospect was 
judged to be ``probable'' and Iraq was labeled a ``possible'' 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
	These emerging missile forces ``potentially can kill tens of  
thousands, or even millions, of Americans,'' depending on their 
accuracy and whether they carry nuclear, chemical or biological 
warheads, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has no way to shoot down long-range ballistic  
missiles, although the Pentagon is spending billions of dollars to 
develop anti-missile missiles to shield the United States against a 
limited attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Countries developing ballistic missiles also are probably  
working on ``countermeasures'' that would let their missiles 
overcome U.S. defenses, the report said. Russia and China, which 
have developed numerous countermeasures, probably are willing to 
sell these technologies, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has about 1,000 long-range missiles with about 4,500  
nuclear warheads. China has about 20 missiles capable of reaching 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA report said short-range ballistic missiles, such as  
Iran's Shahab-3 and North Korea's No Dong, pose an ``immediate, 
serious and growing threat to U.S. forces, interests and allies'' 
in the Middle East and Asia. Those missiles cannot reach U.S. soil. 
</P>
<P>
	The report portrayed the threat from North Korea, Iran and Iraq  
as somewhat less immediate than did the bipartisan Rumsfeld 
Commission, which told Congress in July 1998 that North Korea and 
Iran -- in as little as five years -- could field a missile capable 
of striking U.S. territory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rumsfeld Commission also concluded that the CIA's ability to  
provide timely and accurate estimates of ballistic missile threats 
to the United States is eroding, and that warning times are being 
reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior U.S. intelligence official said Thursday the CIA has  
changed the way it assesses missile threats. The CIA used to wait 
until a country deployed a missile once before declaring it a 
threat. Now it will declare a threat as soon as a country 
successfully test-launches a missile, the official said. He 
discussed the new report on condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	He said intelligence analysts expect North Korea to flight-test  
its Taepo Dong 2 missile this year unless the North Koreans heed 
U.S. warnings against such a test. The issue is high on the agenda 
U.S.-North Korea talks opened Tuesday in Berlin. The CIA believes 
the Taepo Dong 2 is designed to carry a nuclear weapon, although it 
may be tested initially as an unarmed space launch vehicle. It is 
believed capable of reaching Hawaii or Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not known whether North Korea has a nuclear weapon, nor  
whether the North Koreans have developed a missile re-entry vehicle 
capable of surviving the flight -- exiting the atmosphere and then 
coming back in. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has long posed a major nuclear threat to the United  
States, although Washington and Moscow are attempting to implement 
a second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty to greatly reduce their 
arsenals. Defense Secretary William Cohen is traveling to Moscow 
next week to discuss prospects for cutting nuclear weapons even 
further, and to discuss future missile defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Russian threat, although significantly reduced, will  
continue to be the most robust and lethal, considerably more so 
than that posed by China, and orders of magnitude more than that 
potentially posed by other nations,'' the CIA report said.

<HEADLINE> Texas Death Case Lawyers Pick Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRYAN, Texas (AP) -- Lawyers pared a jury pool today to a panel  
of 12, plus two alternates, to hear the second capital murder trial 
in the dragging death of a black man. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Russell Brewer is accused of being one of three white  
men who killed James Byrd Jr. outside of Jasper last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14 include seven white men, two Hispanic men and five white  
women. Their ages range from 29 to 69, Brazos County Clerk Marc 
Hamlin said. The group was culled from 82 potential jurors who had 
been questioned since jury selection began Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm satisfied with the jury,'' Jasper County District Attorney  
Guy James Gray said today. Opening statements are scheduled for 
Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's trial is taking place 150 miles west of the Jasper  
County road where authorities found parts of Byrd's body. The 
49-year-old man had been beaten, chained to a pickup truck and 
dragged for nearly three miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer, 32, John William King and Shawn Allen Berry were charged  
with capital murder in Byrd's death June 7, 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Roy Lassiter had a goal and an assist as D.C.  
United tied a team record Friday night with its ninth straight 
victory, 2-1 over the Tampa Bay Mutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter tied Stern John of the Columbus Crew for the league  
lead with his 17th goal in the 23rd minute. He also assisted on 
Jaime Moreno's goal in the 43rd minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Raul Diaz Arce scored his 13th goal for Tampa Bay in the 72nd  
minute. He has scored goals in the last four games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mutiny had its four-game winning streak snapped. D.C. United  
has dominated the series, winning 15 of 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter stole an errant pass by Steve Ralston, made a nifty  
move on Joseph Addo and beat goalkeeper Scott Garlick with a shot 
from 12 yards. Lassiter has 35 goals and 17 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	D.C. United opened without Eddie Pope, Ben Olsen and Richie  
Williams, who played Wednesday with the U.S. national team against 
Jamaica. Only Olsen played Friday, entering the game in the 64th 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	United goalkeeper Tom Presthus also missed the match with a  
right ankle sprain and was replaced by Mark Simpson

<HEADLINE> Angels, Mighty Ducks May Be Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The Angels' Mo Vaughn and the Mighty  
Ducks' Paul Kariya might be tempted to ask for raises next year. Or 
at least faster internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	Billionaire Henry Nicholas III, president and chief executive of  
Broadcom Corp., and a small group of investors reportedly are 
moving closer to buying baseball's Anaheim Angels and hockey's 
Anaheim Mighty Ducks from the Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas has rapidly amassed a fortune with Broadcom, an Irvine,  
Calif.-based company that has been a high flyer in the booming 
field of communications technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the direction of Nicholas, who drives a Ferrari and once  
trained to be a fighter pilot, Broadcom's revenue has increased 
nearly 5,480 percent over the past five years. That makes it the 
fastest-growing technology company in Orange County, according to 
the accounting firm of Deloitte &AMP; Touche LLP. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcom, with net income of $36.4 million on sales of $203.1  
million in 1998, develops products such as cable modems and set-top 
boxes that enable high-speed transmission of data over existing 
communication lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeremy Bunting, a communications technology analyst for Thomas  
Weisel Partners LLC, said Broadcom's focus on broadband access has 
enabled the Irvine, Calif. company to ``get in dominant positions 
in all of those markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's no reason for Broadcom's success to stop, he added.  
``The markets they are in are strikingly high-growth (and are) 
expected to expand at an annual rate of over 70 percent for the 
next few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas and Broadcom's other founder, co-chairman and vice  
president Henry Samueli, each have 28 percent voting control of the 
firm, which they began in 1991 and took public in April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Samueli also is among the investors reportedly seeking to buy  
the sports teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orange County Register reported Friday that Nicholas and the  
group are near signing a letter of intent to pay Disney up to $500 
million for the Angels and Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Castro, a spokeswoman for Disney, declined comment.  
Broadcom also declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Register, citing unidentified sources, reported the investor  
group consists of less than six people and includes Marvin Winkler, 
chairman of Irvine-based surfwear company Gotcha International. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas and Winkler did not return phone calls from The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball would have to approve the sale of the Angels, a process  
that could take months. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney bought the Angels for $140 million three years ago. The  
company also paid a $50 million franchise fee for the expansion 
Mighty Ducks. Neither team has been a big moneymaker for the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn, who signed a six-year, $80 million deal with the Angels  
last November, and Kariya, who recently signed a three-year deal 
worth $10 million annually, also might want to consider spending 
some of their money to invest in Broadcom. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's shares sold for $24 at the end of April 1998.  
Despite a $6.37 1/2 drop Friday, Broadcom closed at $119 on the Nasdaq 
Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Schumacher Leads Italian GP Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONZA, Italy (AP) -- Ralf Schumacher, the younger brother of  
injured Ferrari star Michael Schumacher, drove a Winfield Williams 
to the fastest time during free practice Friday for the Italian 
Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	While the younger Schumacher was leading a group of unheralded  
drivers, the top teams like McLaren and Ferrari concentrated on 
testing their race setup instead of trying out their qualification 
technique and car setup. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralf Schumacher said a free practice session doesn't mean much  
in terms of comparison with other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not saying that tomorrow we will be in the pole position,  
but we could reasonably be placed well up in the top 10,'' 
Schumacher said. 
</P>
<P>
	The German, winless in his third Formula One season, beat Jarno  
Trulli, Alex Zanardi and Jean Alesi. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher turned his fastest lap in 1 minute, 24.507 seconds,  
over the 3.585-mile Monza track. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Schumacher, a two-time world champion and the No. 1  
driver of Ferrari, is recovering from a broken leg in a crash 
during the British Grand Prix in July. He also is expected to miss 
the European GP at Nurburgring Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending world champion Mika Hakkinen, who enters Sunday's race  
with a one-point lead over Eddie Irvine in the drivers standings, 
was fifth in a McLaren-Mercedes, .59 seconds behind the leader but 
still ahead of teammate David Coulthard. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine was a distant 16th, with a gap of 1.3 seconds, to the  
disappointment of thousands of Ferrari fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen, who will seek his 11th season pole in Saturday's  
one-hour qualifying, will have to beware not only of Irvine in the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Coulthard, who beat his teammate in the Belgian GP, could become  
a dangerous rival for the world drivers' title if he wins for the 
third time this season. 
</P>
<P>
	With four races left, Hakkinen leads Irvine, 60 to 59.  
Coulthard, winner of the Italian GP in 1997, is third with 46. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen said that McLaren concentrated on race setup Friday and  
said he was not overly worried with his fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many drivers made the times today using new tires and little  
fuel,'' Hakkinen said. ``We had a good day though the times might 
not make it look that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to get a true idea on the cars' performance  
levels on Friday,'' Jean Todt, Ferrari's team manager, said. ``We 
worked towards the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubens Barrichello, who recently signed a two-year contract with  
Ferrari to replace Irvine starting next season, was 11th in a 
Stewart-Ford, .99 behind Schumacher.

<HEADLINE> APEC Ministers Adopt New Trade Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Pacific Rim ministers said Friday  
they are coming together on goals for a new global free trade pact, 
but they could get into a battle with Europe by demanding an end to 
food export subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	The APEC trade ministers said they want to send the European  
Union a ``powerful message'' with a proposal that would scrap 
``unjustifiable export prohibitions and restrictions'' in the 
agricultural sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The subsidies allow some food producers to keep their prices  
artificially low, harming Third World farmers. The 15-member EU is 
``the only significant entity advocating the continuing use of such 
measures,'' Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The host trade minister, Lockwood Smith of New Zealand, called  
APEC's stance on agriculture an important first step, but he dodged 
questions about how it might be recieved in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministers wrapped up two days of talks ahead of a meeting  
that begins in Auckland on Sunday with the APEC heads of state. 
Attendees include President Clinton and Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin, who plan a separate face-to-face session on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministers will recommend to their leaders that the Pacific  
Rim economies bring a unified front to the next round of global 
trade talks, which the World Trade Organization will launch Nov. 30 
in Seattle, Washington. The Geneva-based WTO sets rules for trade 
among its 134 members. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal of the trade pact will be to cut tariffs and free up  
new avenues for international commerce that can improve all 
economies. 
</P>
<P>
	APEC trade ministers are seeking to reduce or eliminate tariffs  
in eight sectors of the global economy: fisheries; forestry; 
chemicals; gems and jewelry; medical equipment; energy; 
environmental goods and services; and toys. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan broke up an APEC trade proposal last year amid objections  
that Washington was pushing too hard to pry open the Japanese 
forestry and fisheries sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	But Japanese trade minister Kaoru Yosano said he was happy with  
the idea of coming up with a full package of trade proposals, 
presumably because that would force the United States to make 
concessions at the same time Japan does. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministers hope to finish the so-called ``millennium round''  
of WTO talks in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Thailand's commerce minister, Supachai Panitchpakdi, who will  
lead the WTO for three years beginning in 2002, acknowledged that 
some key sticking points remained. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have a lot to do before we go to Seattle and launch a  
new round,'' Supachai said. 
</P>
<P>
	The APEC ministers have long wanted to bring a loud, unified  
voice to WTO discussions. Their theory is that a Pacific Rim bloc 
could serve as a powerful counterbalance to the EU, where economies 
have drawn increasingly closer under tighter regulations from the 
European bureaucracy in Brussels and this year's launch of a single 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In an issue with profound implications for global trade,  
Washington and Beijing agreed Thursday to restart their efforts to 
admit China into the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	China's eventual entry into the WTO has loomed for some time.  
But efforts earlier this year to find a way to admit Beijing failed 
in April and U.S.-Sino relations deteriorated in May after U.S. 
forces bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and 
Beijing refused to accept Washington's explanation that it was an 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley said Friday it was  
possible that China could fulfill its requirements for WTO 
membership by November, before the trade talks start. 
</P>
<P>
	APEC members are the United States, Indonesia, Japan, South  
Korea, China, Australia, New Zealand, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Hong 
Kong, Malaysia, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, 
Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.

<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland Indians starter Jaret Wright, injured  
twice this season with a strained muscle in his upper back, was 
activated from the 15-day disabled list Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander has made only two starts in the past seven  
weeks between two trips to the disabled list with the back injury. 
He gave up no runs and only three hits over eight innings in two 
minor-league rehabilitation starts this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, who is expected to start Sunday at Chicago, is 7-7 with  
a 5.94 ERA in 21 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland also activated rookie right-hander David Riske from  
the 15-day disabled list Friday and recalled infielder-outfielder 
Jolbert Cabrera, infielder John McDonald and left-hander Tom Martin 
from Triple-A Buffalo. Cabrera, McDonald and Martin have all had at 
least two stints with the Indians this season.

	1st Puerto Rican Nationalist Freed  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first of the Puerto Rican nationalists  
granted clemency by President Clinton has been set free, a 
government spokesman said today. Dan Dunne of the U.S. Bureau of 
Prisons announced that Alejandrina Torres was released from the 
federal prison at Danbury, Conn. Fourteen of the eligible 16 had 
accepted the clemency offer by late Thursday, and their release was 
expected today as well. Clinton, talking to reporters on the South 
Lawn of the White House, said politics played no role in his 
clemency offer and said his decision was influenced by several 
leaders, including South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu and former 
president Jimmy Carter. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton: Timor Attacks Unacceptable  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today that attacks on  
the United Nations compound in East Timor are ``simply 
unacceptable,'' and it is clear that the Indonesian military is 
``aiding and abetting the militia violence.'' Clinton commented in 
a statement issued aboard Air Force One. He had just been briefed 
by the chief U.S. military commander in the Pacific region during a 
refueling stop in Hawaii, en route to New Zealand. ``This is simply 
unacceptable,'' Clinton said. 

</P>
<P>
	U.N. Evacuates E. Timor Compound  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Fears of a massacre inside the besieged  
U.N. compound in East Timor rose after most of the staff was 
evacuated to the airport, leaving little protection for refugees 
inside from rampaging militiamen. Even under guard by Indonesian 
troops, the trucks of evacuating U.N. staff came under fire from 
militiamen as they passed through the streets of Dili, scattered by 
days of burning and looting, witnesses said. There were no 
immediate reports of casualties. 

</P>
<P>
	Bill Would Up Civil Servants' Pay  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal workers' salaries would rise in  
January by 4.8 percent under an agreement struck between House and 
Senate bargainers. The increase would allow civil servants to 
receive the same raise that military personnel are to receive next 
year. The boost is included in a $28 billion measure financing the 
Treasury Department and several smaller agencies for fiscal 2000, 
which begins Oct. 1. The measure also doubles the next president's 
salary to $400,000. And it clears the way for members of Congress 
to get $4,600 increases in January to $141,300. Members of both 
parties expect it to become law. 

</P>
<P>
	Supreme Court To Take on Air Bags  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide  
whether people can sue automakers for failing to install air bags 
in their cars at a time when federal regulations did not require 
them. The court said it will hear a Washington, D.C., woman's 
argument that she should be allowed to sue over injuries she 
suffered in an accident in her 1987 Honda. Getting a head start on 
its 1999-2000 term, which does not begin until Oct. 4, the court 
agreed to add a half-dozen cases to the 29 already on tap for full 
review. Dozens more cases will be added through the first several 
months of the court's term. 

</P>
<P>
	Floyd Upgraded to Hurricane  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Tropical storm Floyd strengthened today to become  
the fourth Atlantic hurricane of the year, churning with top 
sustained winds of 80 mph and bringing rain to the Leeward Islands. 
``The center is still in the formative stage, but it has 
intensified,'' said Richard Pasch, a hurricane specialist with the 
National Hurricane Center in Miami. ``We think it could continue to 
strengthen and become a major hurricane in three days.'' 

</P>
<P>
	U.N. Reports Kosovo Food Decline  
</P>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Kosovo's rural population will be hit hard with  
nutritional and economic problems in the coming months because of a 
major drop in its agricultural and livestock production, U.N. food 
agencies reported today. The rural population will be heavily 
reliant on aid from abroad, said a joint report by the Rome-based 
Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Program. 
Kosovo wheat production will meet only 30 percent of the 
warfare-battered Yugoslav province's requirements, the report said, 
leaving the population in need of 228,000 tons of wheat, the report 
said.

<P>
	Dow Up 42.33; Nasdaq Up 23.97  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just before the hour, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 42.33 at 11,070.54. NYSE advancers led decliners 
1,295-998. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 23.97 at 2,875.99.

	Ewing To Miss Start of Training Camp  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Knicks center Patrick Ewing is not  
fully recovered from his partially torn left Achilles' tendon and 
will miss training camp. The tendon is still sore and hurts, and 
he's not sure when he will be back, Ewing said yesterday at the New 
York All-Star Basketball Classic. Ewing, 37, tore the tendon in 
Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Indiana Pacers 
June 1. He missed the rest of the playoffs and the finals, where 
the Knicks lost to the San Antonio Spurs in five games.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Sets Record, Dow Loses 50.97 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index soared to a new  
record Friday as investors snapped up shares of Internet companies 
and software makers. The swing toward technology stocks came at the 
expense of industrial stocks, which finished mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq rose 35.04 to close at 2,887.06, easily surpassing  
its previous closing high of 2,864.48, set July 16. For the year, 
the Nasdaq has gained 31.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average couldn't match that performance  
on Friday, falling 50.97 to close at 11,028.43 after giving up a 
gain of 62 points. For the week, the Dow lost 50.02, or 0.5 
percent, but it is still up 20.1 percent so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 4.00 to 1,351.66.  
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq's strength came from hefty gains by online auction  
house eBay, up 13 9/16 to 158, and Internet search provider Yahoo!, 
which rose 7 13/16 to 170 1/2. Software companies also gained ground 
with Microsoft gaining 15/16 to 95, and Oracle, a maker of business 
software, picking up 2 5/16 to 46 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	``Technology is back,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst  
at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``This is a group that had been battered in 
recent weeks, and it's nice to see money coming back into the 
group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traders suggested Thursday's unoffical test run for Year 2000  
computer glitches may have alleviated concerns about 
computer-related companies. Some programmers had feared that the 
string of nines in Thursday's date -- 9-9-99 -- would cause computer 
programs to fail. 
</P>
<P>
	But with no major problems reported, programmers and Wall Street  
professionals alike gained confidence that Jan. 1, 2000, will pass 
without difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks also benefited from a government report of a drop in  
wholesale prices, which eased investor concerns about higher 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said rising energy costs pushed wholesale  
prices up a higher than expected 0.5 percent during August. But 
when the volatile energy and food categories are excluded, 
wholesale prices actually fell 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets tend to set aside food and energy price  
changes and focus on the figure known as core inflation. The 0.1 
percent drop in core inflation last month was better than 
economists expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets have been uneasy lately amid concerns that the  
Federal Reserve, which has already raised interest rates twice this 
year, would push rates higher a third time because of the economy's 
continuing strength. Friday's report helped ease some of those 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was pretty much the icing on the cake,'' said David Orr,  
chief economist at First Union Capital Markets Group in Charotte, 
N.C. ``The market is correct to now relax, at least temporarily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But while most stocks rose, the big industrial companies that  
dominate the Dow fell. Caterpillar tumbled 2 to 56 3/4, and Chevron, 
which rose throughout the week as crude oil prices improved, fell 1 
11/16 to 95 7/8 as investors took profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Maytag plunged 14 13/16 to 41 3/4 after the appliance maker said  
its third-quarter earnings will miss Wall Street analysts' 
estimates because of weak sales of its lower-priced goods. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the market came through this week fairly unscathed,''  
Hogan said. ``But until we hear from the Fed, there's still 
resistance against taking the entire market to new highs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.42 to 441.19.  
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume totaled 973.57 million 
shares, compared with 930.78 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.19 percent.  
European indexes were mixed, as Germany's DAX index rose 0.9 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 
ended 0.6 percent higher.

<HEADLINE> Patriots' Rod Rutledge in Car Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATTLEBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Patriots tight end Rod Rutledge faces  
charges of leaving the scene of an accident, operating to endanger 
and speeding after an early morning crash on Interstate 95. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutledge suffered only minor injuries in the accident that  
occurred around 12:30 a.m. this morning, said state police 
spokesman Lt. Paul Maloney. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutledge was driving in the center lane of I-95 northbound when  
he attempted to pass a car on the right while speeding. He lost 
control of his car, skidded off the highway and crashed into two 
tractor-trailers parked in a rest area, Maloney said. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck's drivers were sleeping at the time and were not  
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	After the accident, a second car apparently traveling with  
Rutledge pulled into the rest area. Rutledge climbed into the car 
and left the scene, Maloney said. 
</P>
<P>
	State police did not know who was in the second car.  
</P>
<P>
	Rutledge, 24, surrendered at the state police barracks in  
Foxboro at 3:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be summoned to Attleboro District Court at a later date,  
Maloney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutledge, in his second year with the Patriots, is a backup  
tight end.

<HEADLINE> Art Hit of 1913 Gets Revival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- He was a hit at the famous exhibit that  
introduced Picasso and Gauguin to their first big American 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's taken 85 years to get Amadeo de Souza Cardoso his first  
one-man show -- at the Corcoran Gallery. He died at 30 in the 
worldwide flu epidemic at the end of World War I. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the Edge: A Portuguese Futurist'' opens Saturday, showing  
53 of his works and material about his life. It closes Nov. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early years of the century Souza Cardoso worked in Paris  
and became friends with such artists as Auguste Rodin, Amedeo 
Modigliani and Diego Rivera. He once had his studio in the same 
apartment house as American writer Gertrude Stein, a great friend 
of Picasso. 
</P>
<P>
	Souza Cardoso did not appear at the 1913 ``Armory show,'' which  
drew an unusual 75,000 visitors in New York. But he sold seven of 
the eight pictures he exhibited, including three later given to the 
Art Institute of Chicago. The other four have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	He got his top price -- $216 -- for one called ``Before the  
Bullfight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That wasn't bad for someone who was only 25 and altogether  
unknown in this country,'' said Laura Coyle, curator of the 
Washington show. ``And very few people have heard of him yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing of his has come up on the American market that she could  
find. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite efforts of a few influential friends, difficulties in  
the art market during the war prevented Souza Cardoso from 
following up his first success and he never visited the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	He was not much regarded during his lifetime in his native  
Portugal either, but has since come to be seen as one of its 
cultural heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	``With breathtaking facility, Souza Cardoso worked through the  
major avant-garde trends of his day and came up with an original 
modernist style characterized by wonderful color, inventive subject 
matter and innovative form,'' said Jack Cowart, the Corcoran's 
chief curator. 
</P>
<P>
	The Corcoran suggests contributions of $6 from adults, $4 from  
senior citizens and students.

<HEADLINE> 53 PBS Stations Did List-Swapping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The practice of swapping member and donor  
lists with political organizations was more widespread at public 
television and radio stations than first thought, according to an 
investigative report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Corporation for Public Broadcasting's inspector general,  
Kenneth Konz, said in a report released late Thursday that 53 
stations -- double an earlier estimate -- engaged in list-swapping 
with political organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	At a congressional hearing in July, public broadcasting  
executives said an initial survey had uncovered list-swapping at 26 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue came to light in May when Boston station WGBH-TV  
admitted giving a list of donors' names to the Democratic National 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republican lawmakers responded to the initial news of the  
sharing of member and donor lists by renewing calls to strip public 
broadcasting of its government subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
	The IG's report found that 29 public television and 24 public  
radio stations exchanged and/or rented the names of their members 
or contributors to political organizations, parties or candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The total number is about 9 percent of the 591 stations that  
receive funding from the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	About 85 of 177 public television stations acquired names from  
political groups, said the IG, citing a separate survey by the 
Association of America's Public Television Stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The report did not find that any of the stations swapped or  
rented information with the intent of helping a political 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	When stations rented or exchanged names, they dealt mostly with  
Democratic groups, the report said. When they acquired names, 
Republicans were also involved, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually all of the transactions occurred through third-party  
list brokers, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that the report's findings, in conjunction with the  
prohibitions that we put on these kinds of transactions in the 
future, ought to put an end to this controversy,'' Robert T. 
Coonrod, the corporation's president, said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Although sharing membership lists is a routine business practice  
done daily by countless organizations, the corporation is a 
private, nonprofit entity that is considered a charity for tax 
purposes. As such, it is barred from direct or indirect 
interventions in political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	The corporation distributes federal money to public radio and  
television stations, National Public Radio and the Public 
Broadcasting Service. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is whether stations violated federal tax law by  
swapping, selling, renting or otherwise providing their donor lists 
to political groups. Tax experts have said that such activities 
would not constitute a violation as long as all parties or 
candidates received equal access to the lists. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., the chairman of the House Commerce  
subcommittee on telecommunications, said he would continue to press 
for a new provision in law expressly forbidding stations from 
buying, selling or trading donor lists with any political 
organizations or politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Public broadcasting gets about $250 million a year, or about 15  
percent of its budget, from the federal government. The rest comes 
from businesses, foundations, state governments and viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin had initially proposed an increase to $300 million next  
year, and up to $475 million a year from 2002 to 2006. After the 
controversy erupted, he said he would reduce his proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, PBS President Ervin S. Duggan resigned after 5 1/2  
years, prompting Tauzin's spokesman, Ken Johnson, to accuse public 
broadcasting executives of scapegoating. Coonrod said there was no 
connection between the IG's report and the resignation.

<HEADLINE> Final Claims Made in Microsoft Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. used its final written legal  
brief Friday to attack the government's broad antitrust case 
against it, arguing its widely used Windows software doesn't afford 
it monopoly power over the high-tech industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The government, in its written summary of the 76-day courtroom  
battle, responded that Microsoft's software runs more than 90 
percent of the world's personal computers, and said no candidate 
capable of displacing it is likely to emerge for years. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had given the two  
sides until Friday to file their final written versions of the 
facts in the landmark case. The dictionary-size documents ran 
hundreds of pages each. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's exchange was expected to be the last before the first  
phase of the judge's two-part ruling. That could come as early as 
late October. Courtroom arguments were set for later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The government criticized as ``bizarre assertions'' Microsoft  
Chairman Bill Gates statement in a deposition before the trial that 
he wasn't closely monitoring activities by rival Netscape 
Communications Corp. during the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, for its part, said the government's earlier summaries  
of the case were ``rife with internal inconsistencies and contain 
stunning concessions that undermine the claims alleged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said the government wrongly interpreted statements by  
computer makers when it told the judge that Microsoft's control was 
so great that reasonable alternative to its Windows software was 
available to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said it faces fledgling competition from an array of  
new technologies, including the upstart operating system called 
Linux, which is freely available on the Internet. An operating 
system controls the most basic functions of a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it shows instead is that if consumers express a desire  
for operating systems other than Windows, (computer makers) will 
promptly meet that demand -- as they have started to do with 
Linux,'' Microsoft said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said Microsoft was pointing to an array of  
technologies, ``presumably with a straight face,'' that never will 
actually challenge the dominance of Windows, such as new hand-held 
computers and other high-tech devices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even Microsoft's economist concedes that the speculation that  
the future may bring a competitive alternative to Microsoft's 
captive customers is no more than speculation,'' the government 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft urged the judge to note that, after testimony in the  
trial ended, Dell Computer Corp. agreed to sell Linux pre-installed 
on some desktop and notebook computers. It said Linux and another 
niche operating system, from Be Inc., ``remain serious threats to 
Windows' category leadership and well could displace Windows over 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyers also argued that the government was wrong in  
repeatedly asserting that other companies face unusually steep 
barriers to compete with Microsoft products. 
</P>
<P>
	They noted the announcement last month by Sun Microsystems Inc.  
that it would begin distributing free on the Internet a package of 
business software programs -- including a word processor and 
spreadsheet -- called ``Star Office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first phase of the judge's ruling, called his ``findings of  
fact,'' is expected to telegraph in many ways the eventual second 
part of his verdict, which probably will come early next year 
unless the sides settle. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's factual findings also are particularly important  
because appellate courts rarely challenge a trial judge's decisions 
on the facts of a case, but typically focus on his application of 
the law in the second phase.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks rose Friday, with oil stocks among  
the best performers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies closed with  
a gain of 0.41 points at 316.82, but the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 
Index, which tracks 297 companies in countries that joined the 
single currency, closed up 2.26 points at 334.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaker-than-expected U.S. producer prices triggered gains in the  
dollar and sterling against the euro and helped exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, the Labor Department said surging energy  
costs pushed producer prices up in August, but core prices remained 
tame, easing concern that the U.S. Federal Reserve will be forced 
to raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	During the week, there had been concern about a potential rate  
increase by the European Central Bank after the Bank of England 
surprised investors with a 25 basis-point hike Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ECB Thursday left its benchmark lending rate unchanged  
at 2.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the theme at the moment is increasing confidence from  
investors that the European economic recovery is becoming firmly 
entrenched,'' said Jeremy Batstone, head of research at NatWest 
Stockbrokers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next question is how soon the ECB is going to raise  
interest rates, or at least reverse the April cut. But there's 
little on the inflation front to suggest that rates need to rise 
now,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index rose 28.94 points to 3887.09,  
while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index was up 8.55 points to 3787.67. 
</P>
<P>
	In domestic markets, the Frankfurt Xetra DAX index closed up 0.9  
percent to 5,483.95, with gains by Bayer and DaimlerChrysler. The 
Paris CAC-40 index was up 0.6 percent to 4,745.48 with Peugeot and 
Danone among the gainers. Amsterdam's AEX index was up 0.7 percent 
to 591.67. London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index 
closed with a loss of 1.1 percent to 6,191.00 
</P>
<P>
	In Paris, oil shares were also in the spotlight following an  
unsourced report in Italian daily newspaper La Repubblica that 
energy group Eni and French counterparts Elf Aquitaine and Total 
Fina SA could merge in a three-way agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf shares and TotalFina made strong gains.

<HEADLINE> Earnhardt Wins Busch Grand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Dale Earnhardt Jr., driving like a veteran  
against one of the best, passed Mark Martin with seven laps to go 
Friday night and outdueled the Winston Cup star to win the Autolite 
Platinum 250 Busch Grand National race. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt, the defending series and race champion, drove like he  
was defending his turf against Martin and Jimmy Spencer, another 
Winston Cup regular who dropped down to run in the BGN series in 
preparation for Saturday night's Exide 400. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the second half of the crash-filled event, the three  
moved to the front and battled for the lead, with Martin's car 
stronger on long green-flag runs and Spencer and Earnhardt better 
in bursts like the 24-lap sprint to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, they had a short run at the end. We did  
everything we could. We got to the front, we got the lead and we 
got a little room between us,'' Martin said. ``But the 3 car was 
stronger and they whupped it on us at the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin led when he passed Spencer with 20 laps to go, and  
Earnhardt followed closely behind one lap later. The two cars then 
steadily pulled away, with Martin opening a lead of several car 
lengths before the youngster reeled him in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could get around and move it high or low when we needed  
to,'' Earnhardt said of his Chevrolet. ``I just steered it, mashed 
the gas and it did the rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cars battled side by side and bumper to bumper as the 61,000  
fans at Richmond International Raceway stood and roared until the 
24-year-old Earnhardt finally passed Martin in turn two and pulled 
ahead, winning by .548 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to ask the race fans, `How was the race from up  
there?''' Earnhardt said in Victory Lane. ``It looked pretty good 
from where I was at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He put it on me there at the end,'' said Martin, who had won  
five of his 10 previous Busch starts this season. ``There wasn't 
anything I could do about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer finished third, followed by Kenny Wallace and Kevin  
Grubb. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was Earnhardt's series-high sixth of the year and  
extended his lead over Matt Kenseth from 26 points to 103 points 
with six races remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenseth started 29th, had problems and finished 17th, a lap  
down. 
</P>
<P>
	The race featured 12 lead changes among eight drivers, eight  
cautions for 53 laps and ended with 11 cars having gone to the 
garage area early with damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was the 13th of Earnhardt's career.

<HEADLINE> Denver Teachers OK Raise Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Denver's teachers union voted Friday on what would  
be the first plan in the nation to tie teachers' pay raises to how 
well the students in their own classrooms perform. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-year pilot program, proposed by the union, would involve  
only a small group of volunteers. But at the end of the two years, 
a decision would be made on whether to expand the program to all 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan needed the approval of 85 percent of teachers to pass.  
Votes were to be tallied Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie Bourg, a fourth-grade teacher, said she voted for the  
plan because it would help lure more professionals into the system. 
``It's an experiment, and I think it's worth the experiment,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many teachers, however, questioned how classroom performance can  
be measured when so many variables are out of their control. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in the printing business for 15 years, and you can't run  
schools like a business,'' said Roxanne Rhodes, a social studies 
teacher at North High. ``If I bought paper in my printing business 
and it wasn't up to quality, we could send it back. You can't do 
that with students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Denver and many other districts around the country, teachers  
automatically get raises based on length of service. 
</P>
<P>
	Some districts around the country have offered merit increases  
or bonuses, but they base the decision on schoolwide achievement or 
factors such as a teacher's work outside the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver program, in contrast, would reward teachers for how  
well the children in their individual classrooms do. 
</P>
<P>
	The participants in the pilot program would get bonuses, rather  
than raises. However, if the program is enacted permanently, the 
teachers whose students do well will be rewarded with actual salary 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Their pay would not be docked if their students didn't measure  
up; they just wouldn't get their raises. 
</P>
<P>
	``This program is truly different. It's not a bonus. If it's  
enacted in two years, it changes where you are in the salary 
schedule, based on student achievement,'' said Kathleen Lyons, a 
spokeswoman for the National Education Association, the nation's 
largest teachers union with 2.4 million members. 
</P>
<P>
	About 450 of the district's 4,300 teachers in 12 elementary and  
three middle schools would volunteer for the pilot program. 
</P>
<P>
	The volunteers would be divided into three groups, which would  
measure student performance differently. One would use students' 
scores of the Iowa Test of Basic Skills. Another would use scores 
on a standardized test created in the district. The third would 
somehow test how much students improve after their teachers have 
taken classes to enhance their skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years after court-ordered busing ending, Denver schools  
are reporting higher test scores among white students. But minority 
scores lag behind, and the 67,000-student district is under 
pressure from the federal government to reduce the gap between 
whites and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Last spring, five of 11 grades failed to meet the reading  
average on the Iowa Tests. Five years ago, not one grade level was 
above the average. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is unsatisfied with the test scores,'' said district  
spokesman Mark Stevens. ``This isn't the answer, but it's one piece 
of it that we need to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starting teachers in Denver make $30,000. The top salary, which  
requires a doctorate, is $60,362.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's not only a free concert that the National  
Symphony offers this Sunday. Kids -- and adults, too -- can come

</P>

<HEADLINE> Rabedeaux Takes Over As UTEP Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- For the first time since 1961, the  
Texas-El Paso Miners have a basketball coach not named Haskins. 
</P>
<P>
	During a press conference in the arena named for recently  
retired coach Don Haskins, Oklahoma assistant Jason Rabedeaux 
officially was named coach of the Miners on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old Rabedeaux, who wasn't even born when Haskins  
took over the team, is starting his new job immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``The legacy, the foundation, the tradition, the success that  
Don Haskins has laid down at this college is unique amongst all 
athletic programs,'' Rabedeaux said. ``He will always be known as 
the coach of the Miners. ... I feel extremely fortunate to be here 
and follow through with his tradition and carry Miner basketball 
into the new millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rabedeaux said contract details had not yet been worked out.  
</P>
<P>
	Rabedeaux, one of five candidates to be interviewed for the job,  
was offered the position Wednesday night during a phone call from 
UTEP athletic director Bob Stull. 
</P>
<P>
	Stull said he wasn't sure UTEP would ever have another coach  
like Haskins, a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame who ranks 
10th on the college career victory list with a 719-353 record. 
Haskins made it into the history books by starting an all-black 
lineup in the 1966 national championship game and beating 
all-white, top-ranked Kentucky -- a move hailed as a turning point 
in the integration of college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Stull had to work quickly to find a replacement for Haskins, who  
announced his retirement just 2 1/2 weeks ago, since the recruiting 
period was imminent and the first game only two months away. 
</P>
<P>
	Stull said he was impressed with the recruiting Rabedeaux did  
while at Oklahoma and Washington State. Two of his Oklahoma 
recruits have made it to the NBA -- Corey Brewer was drafted by the 
Miami Heat in the second round in 1998 and Nate Erdmann was a 
second-round pick by the Utah Jazz in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very tenacious recruiter,'' Stull said. ``He's very  
well connected in the Southwest, in Texas, in the West Coast 
recruiting areas and also in Mexico.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rabedeaux has worked under coach Kelvin Sampson the last 10  
years, the first five at Washington State and the rest at Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	While thanking Sampson for being his mentor for so many years,  
Rabedeaux became choked up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not be standing here today if it was not for him,'' he  
said. ``He took a 23-year-old graduate assistant underneath his 
wing 10 years ago. We traveled down a lot of roads together, a lot 
of practices, a lot of talks, and he truly became a father figure 
to me in a lot of ways.''

<HEADLINE> Dole Campaigning Full-Tilt Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- After a late summer vacation, Elizabeth Dole  
resumed her presidential campaign Friday absent a key aide but 
ready to move into ``higher gear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole pledged to lean on countries that refuse to help stop the  
flow of drugs from their borders into the United States, fleshing 
out part of an anti-drug proposal she promised last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to fight the war at the source and stop drugs from  
entering our country. ... You can recall your ambassador. You can 
send their ambassador home,'' Dole told 170 people who paid $250 to 
$1,000 to attend a luncheon that raised money for the Georgia 
Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole said she would also be willing to support  
``decertification'' of some countries supplying drugs to the United 
States. That would open those nations up to economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	She spent late August vacationing in New Hampshire with her  
husband, former Sen. Bob Dole, and remodeling their Washington 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole insisted the time off hasn't diminished the momentum she  
gained in last month's Iowa straw poll. She finished third behind 
GOP rivals Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and millionaire magazine 
publisher Steve Forbes, while spending only a fraction of the money 
they used to lure supporters to the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone felt the end of August and early September would be  
sort of time for people to catch their breath, vacation time, and 
then after Labor Day everything starts to move in higher gear,'' 
Dole told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	But this week her most visible senior adviser, communications  
director Ari Fleischer, abruptly resigned for unspecified 
private-sector pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer voiced full confidence in Dole's candidacy and said he  
was leaving on good terms. But his departure threatened to lend 
public credence to the private frustration of Republicans -- inside 
the Dole camp and out -- that her campaign has been too cautious and 
slow to capitalize on opportunities, such as the Iowa straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	She declined to answer a question about Fleischer's resignation.  
</P>
<P>
	Dole is preparing for a major policy announcement on taxes and  
continuing to raise money. Her campaign said she raised $50,000 
Thursday night at a private event with about 70 people at a home in 
the Atlanta area. 
</P>
<P>
	She reported raising $3.5 million at midyear, a mere fraction of  
the $37 million Bush had raised. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our funds will never be what George Bush's funds are,'' she  
said. ``We'll just keep working away at it.''

<HEADLINE> CEOs Discuss 'Digital Divide' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Regulation and costs may be slowing the pace  
of offering high-speed Internet access and other advanced 
telecommunications services to rural communities, say some of the 
industry's top leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives from companies both big and small had the ear of  
regulators and lawmakers Thursday as they spelled out some of the 
obstacles they face in serving sparsely populated or remote areas 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel convened by Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of  
South Dakota and moderated by the head of the Federal 
Communications Commission highlighted the so-called ``digital 
divide'' created when high-speed Internet capabilities are not 
readily available to certain parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't do this right, we will have a nation of haves and  
have-nots,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard urged the chief executives assembled  
to ``get beyond the rhetoric of blaming the Congress, the FCC or 
each other'' and focus on ways to tackle the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	But industry heads raised both regulation and economic  
incentives as hurdles they sometimes face in bringing their 
advanced services to areas with low volumes of customers and large 
distances to cross. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West chief Sol Trujillo said current regulatory policy has  
encouraged business decisions that focus on investing in bigger 
cities and serving large-business customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If outdated regulatory barriers were removed, we could do more  
and would do more,'' Trujillo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Public policy does effect the level of investment that goes  
into developing technology,'' said Ivan Seidenberg, head of Bell 
Atlantic. His company and some other regional Bells are seeking to 
enter the long-distance market -- a move which they argue will 
enable them to make greater investments in rural areas at lower 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Newer telecommunications businesses say they are willing to  
expand their reach to underserved areas, but it cannot be cost 
prohibitive for them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a little help in making sure the cost of entry is  
conducive to making investments,'' said Robert Knowling of COVAD 
Communications. ``I'm poised to go anywhere I can if it makes 
sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the smaller companies described how they have  
successfully introduced high-speed Internet services even to the 
sparsely populated areas they serve. 
</P>
<P>
	Averaging about a customer per square mile, Valley Telephone  
Cooperative Inc. of Texas began offering Internet access over 
high-speed digital phone lines several years ago to serve just a 
few dozen customers 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives from the wireless industry say using that  
technology to deliver Internet services may provide a way around 
the distance problems posed by offering them over traditional 
landlines.

Raduchel. AOL said that Andreessen, who co-founded Netscape 
Communications Corp., will remain with the company as a part-time

	NEWTON, Iowa (AP) -- Maytag Corp.'s stock tumbled 26 percent on

Wall Street analysts' estimates because of weak sales of its 
lower-priced goods. The nation's No. 3 appliance maker, behind 
Whirlpool and General Electric, said it expected to earn about 84 
cents in the third quarter. That's below the 99 cents a share that 
analysts' had predicted. Maytag's stock fell 14 13/16 to 41 3/4, 
shaving $1.3 billion off its market value. As recently as late May, 
Maytag was trading at more than 74.

problem. The games affected were Blue Stinger, Sonic the Hedgehog, 
Hydro Thunder and Ready to Rumble. The company emphasized the 
problems were not related to the Dreamcast console.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A limited tax measure Congress must pass this

relief to survive from the 10-year, $792 billion Republican plan 
President Clinton is poised to veto. The smaller, must-pass measure 
-- called the ``extenders'' package on Capitol Hill -- would renew 
several already-expired tax credits favored by business, including 
a research and development credit popular with high-tech companies 
and manufacturers. GOP leaders say they unanimously support 
extension of the business credits, as do most Democrats.

	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Pacific Rim ministers said Friday  
they are coming together on goals for a new global free trade pact, 
but they could get into a battle with Europe by demanding an end to 
food export subsidies. The APEC trade ministers said they want to 
send the European Union a message with a proposal that would scrap 
``unjustifiable export prohibitions and restrictions'' in the 
agricultural sector. The subsidies allow some food producers to 
keep their prices artificially low, harming Third World farmers.

investigation be allowed to open an office in the United States. 
The now-insolvent Russian bank, Inkombank, has surfaced in U.S.

Russian mob is believed to have funneled $10 billion. Russian 
banking authorities and U.S. intelligence reports have linked 
Inkombank to criminal activity.

	IEA Sees Demand for Oil Rising  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A strong U.S. economy and a continued recovery in  
Asia should cause demand for oil to outstrip available supplies 
through the winter, so long as OPEC members don't exceed current 
production levels, a survey said. But the report by the 
International Energy Agency raised uncertainties about the 
direction of prices, which have been rebounding from 12-year lows 
last winter. The price of Brent crude oil from the North Sea has 
more than doubled since February, while the price of U.S. gasoline 
has soared 31 percent since February, when the national average 
dropped just below $1 a gallon. 

</P>
<P>
	Wholesale Prices Jump in August  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inflation at the wholesale level leaped 0.5  
percent in August, reflecting sharply higher energy and food 
prices. However, economists believe that tame core prices excluding 
these two volatile sectors may discourage the Federal Reserve from 
raising interest rates again in the fall. The Labor Department 
Friday said last month's overall increase in its Producer Price 
Index -- which measures inflation pressures before they reach the 
consumer -- followed a modest 0.2 percent rise in July.

	LUFKIN, Texas (AP) -- Chevron Corp., BP Amoco PLC and Conoco Inc.

settle charges that they underpaid oil royalty payments. Chevron 
would pay about $95 million and BP Amoco and Conoco would pay about 
$30 million each, The Dallas Morning News and the Wall Street 
Journal reported in Friday's editions. In a 1996 lawsuit, two 
whistleblowers alleged that the companies knowingly undervalued oil 
they extracted from federal and Native American lands. Chevron 
stock closed down 1 11/16 at 95 7/8. BP Amoco's finished up 1/16 at 
115 7/8 as did Conoco, up 1/8 at 28 15/16.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Warns on U.S. Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States should not commit troops in  
every international crisis that ``catches our eye and emotion,'' 
Defense Secretary William Cohen said in remarks that suggested an 
inclination not to intervene militarily in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech prepared for delivery Thursday night to the  
International Institute for Strategic Studies in Coronado, Calif., 
Cohen made no mention of the crisis in East Timor, where violence 
triggered by an independence vote has forced more than 200,000 
people to flee their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	Focusing on lessons learned from the Kosovo conflict, Cohen said  
the United States and its NATO allies were right to intervene in 
Kosovo to end Serb repression, but the experience underscored that 
intervention is not the answer in every crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Among the enduring lessons of this and every conflict is that  
we must resist the temptation to use our forces in every dispute 
that catches our eye and emotion,'' Cohen said in his prepared 
remarks. An advance copy of his speech was made available to 
reporters at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said the 78-day NATO air war against Yugoslavia showed the  
changing nature of warfare and political conflict, saying it 
highlighted a ``superpower paradox'': U.S. supremacy in 
conventional military power is prompting adversaries to develop 
unconventional methods of warfare. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic used ``rape,  
pillage and slaughter'' as a military tactic, Cohen said. By 
expelling hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo and 
killing many others, Milosevic created a humanitarian crisis as a 
combat strategy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said Americans must answer several basic questions before  
deciding whether it is right to intervene militarily in an 
international crisis like Kosovo. Among those questions are whether 
the vital interests of the United States or its allies are directly 
threatened and whether ``the wheel of conflict, if allowed to spin 
on its violent axis'' will draw other nations into its vortex at 
ever greater cost.

<HEADLINE> FBI Aware Early of Waco Tear Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Justice Department officials acknowledge that  
an FBI document the agency had failed to turn over to Congress will 
become a key part of an independent probe into whether the 
government killed people during the Branch Davidian standoff in 
Waco, Texas, and tried to cover it up, The Associated Press has 
learned. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice spokesman Myron Marlin said Friday night that former  
Republican Sen. John Danforth, who is heading the independent 
inquiry, will have to examine why the crucial page of the report 
did not reach Congress earlier than this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Marlin noted, however, that the page was properly turned over to  
lawyers in criminal and civil cases involving Waco survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it was an administrative error is something that the  
special counsel will have to look at,'' Marlin said. ``But we know 
that the plaintiff and defendants counsel received it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The key final page from a 49-page FBI lab report was turned over  
to the House Government Reform Committee this week, along with an 
internal Justice Department memo acknowledging the document ``was 
not produced to Congress'' during the 1995 investigations into the 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The first 48 pages of the lab report, dated Dec. 6, 1993, had  
been turned over to lawmakers years ago, absent the mention of the 
military-style tear gas that government officials for years had 
denied using. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49th page, obtained Friday by the AP, discloses that FBI  
investigators who examined the scene at Waco found a ``fired US 
military 40mm shell casing which originally contained a CS gas 
round,'' and two ``expended 40mm tear gas projectiles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report is likely to become a key piece of evidence in the  
independent inquiry ordered by Attorney General Janet Reno and 
separate congressional investigations into whether government 
officials tried to cover up the use of potentially incendiary tear 
gas on the final day of the siege. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department and FBI officials denied for years that  
flammable tear gas grenades were used on April 19, 1993, the day 
the Davidian compound went up in flames. They abruptly reversed 
course earlier this month and acknowledged a ``very limited 
number'' of such devices were fired hours before the fatal fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The government continues to maintain that religious sect members  
set the fire, and federal agents did not contribute to it. They 
have said the tear gas canisters bounced off a roof of a concrete 
bunker and into a field. Sect leader David Koresh and some 80 
followers perished during a later blaze in a wooden structure away 
from the bunker. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the physician who headed the team that performed  
autopsies on the people who perished in the Davidian compound, said 
he would welcome an opportunity to reopen his investigation into 
the deaths of the 23 cult members who died of bullet wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a feeling that one should go back and re-evaluate,''  
Dr. Nizam Peerwani, the Tarrant County medical examiner told the 
Waco Tribune-Herald in an interview published today. ``The focus at 
the time was not whether the FBI was doing the shooting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI lab report does not specifically state whether the gas  
in the shells was incendiary or when they had been fired. But the 
potentially flammable M651 tear gas canisters that the FBI 
belatedly acknowledged using on the final day of the siege are 40mm 
military shells like those described in the lab report. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has always acknowledged firing one other type of 40mm  
round that contained nonflammable tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
	A Sept. 2, 1999, Justice Department memo on the history of the  
lab document notes that the department's document database 
``contains multiple copies of this document, most of which contain 
all 49 pages.'' It said only four copies of the report were missing 
the last page. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears that the page on which mention is made of a shell  
casing for a military CS round and the expended tear gas 
projectiles was not produced to Congress,'' trial attorney James G. 
Touhey Jr. wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	During congressional probes, the FBI would typically forward its  
documents to the Justice Department, which would then produce the 
documents to lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth, a former Missouri attorney general, was named Thursday  
to oversee the independent inquiry. He promised to investigate 
whether government officials were responsible for the fatal fire 
and tried to cover it up. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, congressional aides sifted through documents  
subpoenaed from the Texas Rangers dealing with the fiery end of the 
51-day siege. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents were subpoenaed last week by the House Government  
Reform Committee and included a previously unreleased Rangers 
report on ordnance used by the FBI in the final hours of the siege, 
a congressional aide said. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman Tom Vinger, whose  
agency oversees the Rangers, said the report represents ``an 
extremely exhaustive look at some of the controversial evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get right down to it, it is very narrow in focus,''  
Vinger said. He declined to be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers, who have stored tons of evidence collected from the  
Davidians' charred compound, began re-examining their holdings in 
June after learning that military pyrotechnic tear gas canisters 
were fired in the siege's waning hours.

<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- After months of worsening tensions  
between the United States and China, President Clinton and 
President Jiang Zemin sought to change course toward better 
relations and inject momentum in stalled trade talks. In their 
first face-to-face discussions in 15 months, Clinton and Jiang were 
meeting Saturday on the eve of a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders. 
Both sides signaled eagerness to mend tattered ties, and Washington

<P>
	MALTA, N.Y. (AP) -- A 79-year-old man is the second fatality in  
an E. coli outbreak at a county fair that could become the worst 
such contamination in U.S. history. The first victim was 3-year-old 
Rachel Aldrich, who was buried today. More than 600 suspected cases 
of contamination -- already the worst in state history -- have been 
reported from the Washington County Fair, which was held at the end

Novello, the New York state health commissioner, said today that 
the number of cases could eventually exceed 1,000.

	FBI Aware Early of Waco Tear Gas  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A lab document that the Justice Department  
failed to give Congress discloses that the FBI knew within eight 
months of the fiery end of the 1993 Branch Davidian siege that 
military tear gas projectiles were used, The Associated Press has 
learned. A key final page from a 49-page FBI lab report was turned 
over to congressional committees this week, along with an internal 
Justice Department memo acknowledging it ``was not produced to 
Congress'' during its 1995 investigations into the tragedy near 
Waco, Texas. Government officials had denied using incendiary tear 
gas, and the possibility of a coverup is under investigation.

East Timor and urged Indonesia to accept foreign military help. 
Even though Australia, New Zealand, France and many other countries 
have offered troops to a peacekeeping force, Annan said all 
governments ``have made it clear that it's too dangerous for them 
to go in without the consent of Indonesia.'' East Timor's vote in 
August for independence from Indonesia triggered violence by 
militias opposed to separating from the province.

	DENVER (AP) -- Denver's teachers union today approved the first  
plan in the nation to tie teachers' pay raises to how well the 
students in their own classrooms perform. The two-year pilot 
program, proposed by the union, will involve only a small group of 
volunteers. But at the end of the two years, a decision will be 
made on whether to expand the program to all teachers. Some 
districts around the country have offered merit increases or 
bonuses, but they base the decision on schoolwide achievement or 
factors such as a teacher's work outside the classroom.

seizure of ketamine, known on the street as ``Special K''. 
Officials estimated the potential value of the drugs seized today 
at $4 million. The drugs were discovered after officers pulled over 
a truck for a traffic violation, and the driver matched the 
description of a suspect in the ketamine ring, authorities said. 
Officers found 2,162 vials of ketamine in boxes in the back. The 
driver, Geraldo Baptista, led them to a warehouse with thousands 
more, authorities said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Charged in Miss. Lawmaker Kidnap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Miss. (AP) -- A rural Mississippi woman and her  
teen-age son were charged Friday with kidnapping a state legislator 
and demanding money from her. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Miriam Simmons, 71, was held against her will for a short  
time Wednesday in the family's home, about 10 miles from her own, 
and released unharmed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators would not comment on a motive.  
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's deputies arrested Joetta Price, 33, and her  
15-year-old son, Mitchell Jr. Both were charged as adults with 
kidnapping. The charge carries a maximum life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Simmons' son, Wronal Simmons, said his mother was back in  
her Columbia home Friday and did not want to talk about what 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is fine, everything is fine,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Other legislators said Friday they were told that Mrs. Simmons  
had been lured to the Price home by a request for her help as a 
lawmaker, then tied up and ordered to pay up. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Steve Holland of Plantersville said Mrs. Simmons' late  
husband had been a successful businessman. 
</P>
<P>
	A retired teacher, Mrs. Simmons spent 12 years in the  
legislature. She lost a re-election bid last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she's ever made a soul mad, I'd be surprised,'' Holland  
said.

<HEADLINE> Russia To Monitor Y2K Missile Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia has accepted an American offer to place  
a team of Russian officers at a joint monitoring center in Colorado 
to observe U.S. missile warning data during the Year 2000 
transition, the Pentagon said today. 
</P>
<P>
	A formal agreement on the first-of-its-kind arrangement is to be  
signed by Russian Defense Minister Gen. Igor Sergeyev and Defense 
Secretary William Cohen during Cohen's visit to Moscow next week, a 
senior Pentagon official said. The official discussed the matter on 
condition he not be further identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K Center for Strategic Stability is to be established at  
Peterson Air Force Base, Colo., and begin operating 24 hours a day 
with Russian and American monitoring teams in December. It will be 
terminated in January after the Y2K transition. The Russians will 
have 10 to 20 officers there. 
</P>
<P>
	The purpose of the center is to provide reassurance to the  
Russians on potential accidental missile launches -- either by the 
United States or other countries -- resulting from Y2K computer 
glitches. U.S. officials have said they do not anticipate Y2K 
problems with either U.S. or Russian missile systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not because we think we're teetering on the edge of a  
potential false launch, or anything of the sort,'' the senior 
official said. However, ``were there to be some sort of problem, it 
would certainly be useful to have our people in direct contact and 
in direct communication with one another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Discussions on Russian participation began last year but were  
suspended by Moscow as part of a general freeze on 
military-to-military cooperation with the United States during 
NATO's air war in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The senior Pentagon official said the Russians indicated a few  
weeks ago that they would accept the offer to post officers at the 
Colorado facility. Cohen also intends to press the Russians to 
resume talks with the United States on establishing a permanent 
early warning center in Moscow -- a concept that President Clinton 
and President Boris Yeltsin announced earlier. Those talks also 
were suspended because of Russian anger at NATO's bombing of 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen leaves for Moscow on Sunday and is scheduled to return to  
Washington on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Leaks Cancel Schwarzenegger Preview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Leaks have terminated previews of Arnold  
Schwarzenegger's new movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Universal Studios canceled test screenings of ``End of Days'' at  
a San Fernando Valley theater Wednesday and Thursday because 
advance word hit the Internet and a TV station. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of people who had gotten wind of the  
screening. There were even rumors going around that Schwarzenegger 
was going to show up,'' said Gary Frost, a manager at Chatsworth's 
Pacific Winnetka 21 theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Hosts on KTTV-TV's ``Good Day L.A.'' had asked viewers to attend  
the screenings and telephone or fax in their reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Test audiences, usually recruited at shopping malls, aren't told  
the name of the movie they will see. 
</P>
<P>
	``The films shown at test screenings are not ready for public  
presentation. They're a tool that makes the product better. We 
think this is an unethical breach of a private process,'' Universal 
spokeswoman Terry Curtin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarzenegger plays a police officer trying to prevent an  
end-of-the-millennium global catastrophe by stopping the devil, 
played by Gabriel Byrne, from finding a bride. It is to be released 
Thanksgiving weekend.

<HEADLINE> HBO, NECO Agree on 'The Sopranos' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Things appear to be harmonious between the  
makers of ``The Sopranos'' and the National Ethnic Coalition of 
Organizations, thanks to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor, a fan of the show, brokered a deal that brought HBO  
officials together with ``Sopranos'' critic William Fugazy, 
chairman of the NECO, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just made them an offer neither side could refuse,''  
Giuliani said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fugazy had charged the Emmy-nominated program, which portrays a  
northern New Jersey mob family, was chock-full of negative 
characterizations of Italian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	He called for a demonstration outside HBO's Manhattan  
headquarters on Sunday -- the same day the Emmys are awarded in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Fugazy, HBO executives agreed to have members of  
Fugazy's group provide script consultation focused on ways that 
highlight positive contributions of Italian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	HBO spokesman Henry Gomez said only that the meeting went well.  
</P>
<P>
	``We all agreed,'' Gomez said, ``it's a good show.''

<HEADLINE> Renewed Waco Probe Troubles City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WACO, Texas (AP) -- Since 1993, images of a furious blaze,  
military tanks, religious zealots and death have crowded out Waco 
residents' own picture of their friendly, easygoing community. 
</P>
<P>
	The people of Waco have had to endure unending questions about  
the FBI assault on the Branch Davidian cult, wisecracks about the 
``wackos in Waco,'' and countless tourist requests for directions 
to the site of the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Carlson says she becomes defensive when people describe  
Waco as a ``hick town with all these nuts.'' And Penny Jacko, who 
works in public relations at Waco's Baylor University, says she and 
her husband no longer tell people they're from Waco when they 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were always asking: `Did you know David Koresh?'' Ms.  
Jacko says. ``I just hate that people know of Waco because of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, many people in Waco fear that the renewed furor over the  
FBI assault is just reinforcing the way the public instantly 
associates their city with the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	And the attention is likely to intensify with the opening this  
week of an independent investigation into the assault and the start 
next month of a multimillion-dollar wrongful-death trial over the 
catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously it's difficult for the citizens of Waco because this  
is reopening the wound,'' says Larry Holze, a spokesman for the 
city of 109,000. ``It's like a wound that has healed over, but 
opens up every time you flex a muscle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents  
raided a rural compound near Waco that was occupied by Koresh and 
his followers. Four agents and six cultists died in the gun battle. 
After a 51-day siege, Koresh and nearly 80 others died in a fire 
that consumed the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	Surviving Davidians and the relatives of the dead later sued,  
challenging the government's conclusion that the cult members 
themselves started the fire and that they shot first during the 
initial raid. The lawsuits were consolidated into one case that 
will open in Waco federal court on Oct. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the FBI, after years of denials, admitted firing  
combustible tear gas canisters on the day of the final assault. The 
FBI still insisted it did not cause the fire, but the disclosure 
has forced a reopening of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's troubling to people in Waco.  
</P>
<P>
	Holze is meeting with city and business leaders to develop a  
strategy for dealing with the attention. But exactly what they can 
do isn't clear. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing for us to recognize is that this  
whole thing could've happened anywhere. It's just like those events 
in Jasper, Littleton and Oklahoma City,'' Holze says. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Mayor Bob Sheehy says: ``You can't change what happened.  
All you can do is offer help and information. Some of the media are 
going to write ugly things about you. They did us. But if you stay 
the course, they'll probably say some nice things about you before 
they leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a few years after the disaster, Waco reported a downturn in  
business and conventions. 
</P>
<P>
	But Baylor University economics professor Tom Kelly says he  
believes the notoriety helped the city at least as much as it might 
have hurt it. He says economic development officials kind of ``used 
it as an ice breaker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because people have heard of Waco, it is positive for the  
community,'' the 30-year resident says. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheila Martin, the widow of a Branch Davidian, says the  
rehashing of the siege hurts. But the latest disclosures ``have 
made it a lot better'' for the survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have been very nice. There's a genuine spirit of love.  
They saw us as people in pain who had lost family,'' Ms. Martin 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Branch Davidian Amo Bishop Roden, who spends most of her days  
distributing literature to tourists at the site of the former 
compound, is also glad to see the renewed interest in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've watched the government steal and lie for six years. I  
know they're hiding even more,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Waco's tourist information center seems to show the ambivalence  
with which this city regards the cult disaster. Employees are often 
asked for directions to the tragedy site, which is little more than 
the shell of a burned bus, a concrete foundation and trees planted 
in memory of the dead cultists. 
</P>
<P>
	After all these years, Holze says the city is considering adding  
the site to its visitor center maps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We acknowledge it's there,'' he says. ``All we can do is ride  
the wave.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton: I Didn't Discuss Clemency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says politics played no role  
in his clemency offer to 16 Puerto Rican nationalists and he said 
his decision was influenced by several leaders, including South 
African Archbishop Desmond Tutu and former president Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he didn't discuss the matter with first lady  
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who hopes that her opposition to that 
clemency won't damage her likely bid for a Senate seat from New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't discussed other clemency issues with her and I  
didn't think I should discuss this one,'' Clinton said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some law enforcement officials and Republicans say Clinton made  
the clemency offer to curry favor for Mrs. Clinton among New York's 
1.3 million Puerto Ricans. Two more militants accepted the clemency 
-- bringing the total to 14 -- even as the House of Representatives 
overwhelmingly condemned the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources in Puerto Rico close to the prisoners said they will be  
freed today, without specifying whether that included all 11 
eligible for release immediately after accepting Clinton's 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's offer allowed for the immediate release of 11  
prisoners, a release later for two others and forgiving fines for 
three other nationalists who are not in prison. White House 
officials said Thursday night that once clemency was granted, the 
timing on when the 11 prisoners would be freed was up to the Bureau 
of Prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to reporters on the lawn just outside the Oval Office,  
the president said the political ramifications for the first lady 
played ``absolutely'' no role in his decision to free the 
nationalists. He said Mrs. Clinton wasn't aware of his offer until 
one of her aides asked her to comment on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he doesn't believe his wife has flip-flopped on  
this issue, and it is up to New York voters to ``evaluate that as 
they please.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For her part, Mrs. Clinton -- who was in New York City --  
reiterated her opposition and said she understood ``the really 
strong feelings that my friends in the Puerto Rican community have 
on this issue.'' She appealed to them to understand her decision as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope by the time this election comes around in 14 or so  
months -- assuming that I'm on the ballot -- that I will have the 
support of as many New Yorkers as I can possibly reach,'' including 
``elected representatives of the Puerto Rican community,'' she told 
reporters outside a Queens junior high school where she was 
principal for a day last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., a native of Puerto Rico, said  
Mrs. Clinton now has a serious credibility problem, and he is not 
interested in endorsing her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still upset. I'm still hurt. I'm still angry and I've  
heard nothing to change my mind,'' Serrano said. ``If that campaign 
can be so insensitive to something that means so much to Puerto 
Ricans, how sensitive can they be to issues that affect blacks in 
my community? That affect Dominicans in my community? That affect 
Mexicans moving into my community?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of those eligible for clemency were members of the  
ultranationalist FALN, responsible for some 130 bombings in the 
late 1970s and early 1980s that left six dead and scores wounded. 
None of those offered clemency were directly responsible for deaths 
or injuries, officials say. The original prison sentences ranged 
from 35 years to 90 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the House of Representatives condemned the clemency  
offer on a 311-41 vote that was little more than a symbolic 
gesture, since Clinton holds exclusive power over clemency. But in 
a rebuke, 93 Democrats crossed party lines to side with Republicans 
pushing the resolution.

</P>
<P>
	His two houses are nice, as are the condos he owns.  
</P>
<P>
	So far boxing has been very good to the 22-year-old. And it only  
figures to get better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I plan on being a champion for 10 years,'' Mayweather said.  
``I plan on being in the history books by the time I'm done 
boxing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only three years after losing a controversial decision in the  
Olympics, Mayweather is firmly established as both a 130-pound 
champion and a fighter with an immense future. 
</P>
<P>
	He defends his WBC super featherweight title Saturday night  
against Carlos Gerena of Puerto Rico, but his plans go far beyond 
the scheduled 12-round bout at the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be America's champion,'' Mayweather said. ``I want  
to be the next Sugar Ray Leonard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayweather appears to have the potential to be just that. His  
uncle, Jeff Mayweather, one of the fighting Mayweathers who helps 
train his nephew, thinks so. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does have the destiny to become great,'' Jeff Mayweather  
said. ``One day he's going to be great. Twenty years from now 
people will be talking about him. He's going to be a legend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayweather brings a 21-0 record, with 16 knockouts, into the  
fourth defense of the title he won Oct. 3 in a devastating 
performance against Genaro Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	He also brings dreams of ring greatness and a career outside the  
ring that didn't seem possible only a few years ago when he was a 
shy amateur who struggled just to make the U.S. Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm like Sugar Ray Leonard in the fact we both speak well, are  
flashy, and have good looks,'' Mayweather said. ``Plus, we're both 
good fighters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Mayweather's future world, he will be filling up the  
12,000-seat arena at the Mandalay Bay where Oscar De La Hoya meets 
Felix Trinidad next week instead of fighting in a temporary 
convention area. 
</P>
<P>
	To do that, he plans to keep fighting often on HBO, and putting  
his face in public as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be in the entertainment world. I want to commentate  
on HBO, I want to be on a Chris Rock special,'' Mayweather said. 
``I want to be on Oprah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First, though, he'll simply be fighting, defending his title  
against Gerena (34-2, 28 knockouts), a member of the 1992 Puerto 
Rican Olympic team who is ranked No. 7 by the WBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Oddsmakers don't figure it will be much of a fight, making  
Mayweather an 18-1 favorite to retain the title. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's mainly just a good boxer,'' Mayweather said of Gerena.  
``I've got a lot of tricks in my bag, but I don't know if I'll have 
to use any of them in this fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the card is Freddie Norwood, who will defend his WBA  
featherweight title against Juan Manuel Marquez of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Norwood, dubbed ``Little Hagler'' for his resemblance to former  
middleweight champion Marvelous Marvin Hagler, is 34-0-1 with 20 
knockouts. Marquez hasn't lost since his pro debut.

<HEADLINE> US: China May Still Join WTO by Nov. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- China may still be able to join the  
World Trade Organization by November, when a new round of global 
trade talks begins. 
</P>
<P>
	But China will have to act quickly, now that it has agreed to  
resume formal negotiations with the United States on its WTO entry 
after a four-month hiatus, Commerce Secretary William Daley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still possible,'' Daley said after meeting with Chinese  
Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tight schedule, there's no doubt about it,'' he said.  
``The delay over the last number of months has created a time 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China and the United States agreed Thursday after four months of  
acrimony over the U.S. bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia 
to restart talks on getting Beijing into the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision improves the atmosphere for a bilateral summit on  
Saturday in Auckland before the start of the 21-nation Asia Pacific 
Economic Cooperation summit. 
</P>
<P>
	A flurry of recent diplomatic activity has focused on giving  
President Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin a chance to 
redirect relations toward the cordial course set at their last 
meeting, 15 months ago in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, APEC trade ministers agreed to endorse a new  
round of WTO trade talks that are to begin in Seattle in November. 
China has been eager to participate in that round as a WTO member. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said that once U.S. and Chinese negotiators get ``fully  
engaged,'' an agreement on China's membership could be reached in 2 
to 2 1/2 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're 90 percent there,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Daley declined to say what issues remain unresolved. The United  
States has said China still needs to do more to open up its banking 
and securities industries to foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
	It also wants to maintain quotas on imports of textiles from  
China, which Shi said today would be unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	``China will never agree to a discriminatory paragraph on  
keeping the textiles quota,'' he said at an APEC news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Shi said he told Daley that China wants the United States to  
ease curbs on the export of high-tech equipment to China. He said 
he also reasserted China's desire to obtain normal trading 
privileges with the United States on a permanent basis. Currently 
those privileges are renewed annually. 
</P>
<P>
	China and the United States came close to agreeing on Chinese  
entry to the WTO in April, but Clinton rejected a broad 
market-opening offer put forward by Premier Zhu Rongji as 
insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
	China must also reach agreements with several other governments,  
including the European Union, before it can join the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly China is under some significant time pressure if it  
wishes to be a WTO member by the time of the Seattle meeting,'' 
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said.

<HEADLINE> Arnold Palmer Marks 70th Birthday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LATROBE, Pa. (AP) -- If Arnie's Army ever gets an Air Force, it  
has a place to land. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrating Arnold Palmer's 70th birthday on Friday,  
Westmoreland County renamed its airport after Latrobe's most famous 
son. The golfing great's personality and competitiveness, not to 
mention the skill that helped him win seven majors, helped bring 
the sport into the television age. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, who splits time between homes in Latrobe and Orlando,  
Fla., was teary-eyed as Gov. Tom Ridge and others officially 
changed the name of the 945-acre Westmoreland County Airport as 
three Pennsylvania Air National Guard A-10 Warthogs flew overhead. 
</P>
<P>
	From now on, it's Arnold Palmer Regional Airport.  
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said he first learned to fly a plane at the airport some  
45 years ago, about the same time his victory in the U.S. Amateur 
Championship launched him into a professional golf career. During 
Friday's ceremony, his own Lear Jet was parked in a nearby hangar. 
</P>
<P>
	He won four Masters, two British Opens and, in 1960, the U.S.  
Open when he came from seven strokes back in the final round. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus or Tom Watson, there was  
Palmer and his legion of fans, known as Arnie's Army. But he has 
remained a lifelong resident of Latrobe, a community of about 9,300 
people located about 50 miles east of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the majors, only the PGA Championship eluded him -- and he  
came in second in that tournament three times. During a career that 
spanned more than four decades and saw him come back from prostate 
cancer surgery to rejoin the seniors tour, Palmer won 92 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you for the confidence you gave me over the years, the  
push when I needed it,'' Palmer told the 100 or so people gathered 
for the event. ``I'm just pleased and very proud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From 1960 to 1963, Palmer won 29 tournaments. And it all began  
at the Latrobe Country Club -- which Palmer has owned since 1971 -- 
where his father worked as a golf pro and course superintendent. 
Palmer began caddying at the club when he was 11. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never heard of Latrobe until you heard of Arnold Palmer,''  
said retired internist Dr. John S. Parker, 71. ``He lives right 
down the road.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Higher, Tokyo Stocks Advance / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese central bank intervention sent the dollar  
up against the yen today, but investors pushed the greenback down 
again in late trading. Tokyo stock prices advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 108.92 yen in the late afternoon, up 0.08 yen  
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also higher than its late New York 
level of 107.78 yen overnight. The dollar had traded at 107.65 yen 
before the intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 33.46  
points, or 0.19 percent, to finish the day at 17,711.02. On 
Thursday, the average closed up 36.18 points, or 0.21 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar sank against the yen in early  
Asian trading, extending a three-year low hit in New York on 
Thursday. The greenback plummeted following the announcement that 
Japan's economy posted an unexpected growth spurt of 0.2 percent in 
the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bank of Japan intervened repeatedly to buy an estimate  
$2 billion to 3 billion to rein in the yen's rise, lifting the U.S. 
currency to near the 110 yen level. But after the buying spree, 
traders bid up the yen to near its level in late Tokyo trading a 
day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa confirmed that Japanese  
authorities stepped into foreign exchange markets to weaken the 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka said excessive  
strengthening of the yen could damage Japan's nascent economic 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the BOJ chose today to intervene ... on worries that  
standing to the sidelines would create a vicious circle of a strong 
yen and stock losses,'' said Shuji Takano of ABN AMRO bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 115.15 yen, down  
from 115.55 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 107.65 yen and 110.00 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices jumped after concerns about the  
strong yen subsided on the morning jump in the greenback. But the 
market relinquished most of its gains after the dollar sank again. 
</P>
<P>
	A higher yen makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad and  
thus less competitive, cutting into earnings of export-oriented 
Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 43.06  
points, or 0.6 percent, to 11,079.40 at Thursday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 7.24 points, or 0.48 percent, to 1,514.86. The 
TOPIX closed up 5.05 points, or 0.34 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 1.17 billion shares changed hands on the First  
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Retreating issues outnumbered 
advancers 658 to 565, while 120 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.7950 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.8300 percent. Its 
price rose 0.30 points to 100.89

<HEADLINE> HBO, NECO Agree on 'The Sopranos' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Things appear to be harmonious between the  
makers of ``The Sopranos'' and the National Ethnic Coalition of 
Organizations, thanks to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor, a fan of the show, brokered a deal that brought HBO  
officials together with ``Sopranos'' critic William Fugazy, 
chairman of the NECO, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just made them an offer neither side could refuse,''  
Giuliani said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fugazy had charged the Emmy-nominated program, which portrays a  
northern New Jersey mob family, was chock-full of negative 
characterizations of Italian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	He called for a demonstration outside HBO's Manhattan  
headquarters on Sunday -- the same day the Emmys are awarded in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Fugazy, HBO executives agreed to have members of  
Fugazy's group provide script consultation focused on ways that 
highlight positive contributions of Italian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	HBO spokesman Henry Gomez said only that the meeting went well.  
</P>
<P>
	``We all agreed,'' Gomez said, ``it's a good show.''

<HEADLINE> Hispanic Groups Launch TV Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A coalition of minority organizations is calling  
for a boycott of the four major networks during the first two weeks 
of the TV season to protest ``the continued invisibility of Latinos 
on television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``brownout'' of ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC begins Sunday and  
continues through Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Council of La Raza, which is coordinating the  
boycott, counts just one Hispanic -- Martin Sheen, on NBC's ``The 
West Wing'' -- among the lead characters in the 38 new series 
premiering this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference today, the group said it had teamed with  
other minority groups in a push to force the entertainment industry 
to address the issue. They formed a negotiating team made up of 
former California congressmen Norman Minetta and Esteban Torres, 
NAACP president Kweisi Mfume, and the founder of American Indians 
in Film, Sonny Skyhawk. 
</P>
<P>
	Torres said at a news conference that the team hopes to get ``a  
long-lasting, verifiable agreement that will create a rapid 
inclusion of minorities in programming as well as ownership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John White, an NAACP spokesman, said only 52 of the 854 staff  
writers on major network shows are black. ``The public interest is 
not served well by a monolithic, all-white presentation of the 
world,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Hispanics constitute 11 percent of the U.S. population,  
they make up less than 2 percent of all characters on prime-time 
shows, according to Lisa Navarrete, a spokeswoman for La Raza. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Sheen, the group counts three Hispanics  
continuing on returning series: Bruno Campos (NBC's ``Jesse''), 
and, on CBS, Hector Elizondo (``Chicago Hope'') and Cheech Marin 
(``Nash Bridges''). 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the boycott will not be measured by ratings, she  
said. ``If we can educate a large proportion of the community and 
others who are interested in this issue, then we've succeeded,'' 
Navarrete said. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to the planned boycott, CBS said in a statement that  
it ``remains committed to the idea that our programming, and indeed 
our organization, should reflect the diversity of our society. We 
agree that much progress in our industry remains to be made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said ABC: ``We are making improvements and understand that we  
need to do more. This is an ongoing process and ABC is deeply 
committed to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox declined to comment on the boycott, and NBC had no immediate  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Some networks have already made cast changes for upcoming shows,  
though executives insisted they were in the works even before the 
outcry. 
</P>
<P>
	In their original form, none of the 27 new comedies and dramas  
set to premiere on the top four networks had minorities in a 
leading role, and few had them in supporting roles. But more than a 
dozen minority characters have been added to new and returning 
series, including a Hispanic woman in ABC's sitcom ``Sabrina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly welcome the addition of characters,'' Navarrete  
said, ``but there's a bigger problem.''

<HEADLINE> Texas Executes 23rd Inmate of 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A man who beat and strangled an  
84-year-old woman to death during a burglary of her home was 
executed by injection Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	In the seconds before he was put to death, Willis Barnes  
expressed love to his family and asked for forgiveness from the 
family of his victim. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to give love to my mother, sisters and brothers and  
let them know I am thinking of them right now, and I want to thank 
God for giving me such a loving family'' he said. ``To the victim's 
family, I hope you find in your heart to forgive me as I have 
forgiven you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes had insisted he did not kill Helen Greb the night of Feb.  
11, 1988, but acknowledged taking a television and two guns from 
her home. 
</P>
<P>
	He became the 23rd condemned inmate executed in Texas this year.  
</P>
<P>
	Barnes, 51, blamed a $350-a-day cocaine addiction for a string  
of Houston burglaries that put him in prison in 1984 with four 
30-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years later, however, with Texas prisons bulging and  
parole officials looking to ease crowding, he was freed when 
records showed it was his first prison stint and that his offense 
was a property crime.

<HEADLINE> Zoning Dispute Divides Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOIS BLANC ISLAND, Mich. (AP) -- Michael and Christine Stitt  
arrived on this remote Lake Huron island three years ago with an 
ox, goats, pigs and a few emus. They planned to earn a living as 
farmers and raise their children away from what they considered the 
moral rot of modern society. 
</P>
<P>
	But now their land is for sale and their dream is in tatters.  
</P>
<P>
	The township board says they violated zoning codes by keeping  
livestock in a residential area and refusing to obtain construction 
permits for their outbuildings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stitts say they are being persecuted for their  
fundamentalist religious beliefs and for speaking out against what 
they consider immoral behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``My children are being robbed of a good, old-fashioned home  
life,'' Mrs. Stitt said. ``I'm not being allowed to live as a free 
citizen. I feel like I'm in Kosovo or something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight has become deeply personal, dividing neighbors and  
even families on Bois Blanc, where about 3,000 people spend summers 
but only about 50 -- mostly retirees -- live year round. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's torn the whole island apart,'' said Penny Rickwalt, who  
has been here eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Stitts' announcement in court Friday that they planned  
to move away didn't quell the bitterness. After the hearing, a 
woman and her uncle on opposing sides in the feud yelled at each 
other as friends tried to calm them. 
</P>
<P>
	Township officials insist there's no vendetta against the Stitts  
-- they're simply being asked to follow the same rules as everyone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their attitude is, `We aren't going to do what you tell us we  
have to do, and you can't make us,''' said Cheryl Stevenson, 
township treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
	While agreeing on little else, both sides say the Stitts were  
welcomed when they arrived in 1996 on the ferry from Cheboygan, 
five miles south on the tip of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stitts say they are members of a strain of Wesleyanism that  
forbids television and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to get away from the crime, the bad things that were  
happening downstate,'' Stitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	They believed God had called them to the island not just as  
residents, but as missionaries. 
</P>
<P>
	For a while, residents bought vegetables from their farm and  
took hay rides in their ox cart. They offered congratulations when 
the Stitts' sixth child was born. 
</P>
<P>
	But things soured quickly. Township officials say the Stitts  
began raising livestock in the section of their property that was 
zoned residential -- defying the board to stop them -- and erecting a 
barn and other outbuildings without permits. 
</P>
<P>
	Stitt says township authorities endorsed their plans before they  
moved to the island. He contends the Michigan Right to Farm Act 
empowered him to build structures needed to run his operation. 
</P>
<P>
	As tensions rose, a neighbor complained that the Stitts' ox kept  
trampling his property. The Stitts, in turn, reported the neighbor 
for growing marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	They accused the sheriff's department of ignoring drunken  
driving, marijuana cultivation and other misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the township obtained a court order directing the  
Stitts to dismantle all buildings for which they had no permit and 
to get rid of their livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stitts say their attorney signed the order on their behalf  
although they hadn't agreed to all the provisions. Township 
attorney Lyle Peck went back to Mackinac County Circuit Court on 
Friday, asking Judge Nicholas Lambros to declare the Stitts in 
contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Lambros denied Peck's motion, noting that the order had given  
the Stitts until Oct. 7 to comply. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stitts claimed Lambros' ruling had vindicated them but said  
they were finished with Bois Blanc. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to move on,'' Stitt said, ``if we can just find  
another place to go.''

<HEADLINE> Phillies say Francona's Job Is Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Terry Francona's job is safe despite the  
Philadelphia Phillies' terrible slide. In fact, the club is trying 
to extend the manager's contract beyond the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Ed Wade came to Francona's defense Friday,  
saying that the team's second straight late-season collapse was not 
the manager's fault. The Phillies, 13 games above .500 and in 
playoff contention a month ago, have lost 13 of 14 and 24 of 31 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies lost six in a row to culminate the club's worst  
14-game stretch since 1936, when they lost 14 straight. They tied 
Florida for the worst 14-game slide in the majors this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy with the job Terry's done,'' Wade said by  
telephone from Phoenix, where the Phillies began their final road 
trip of the season Friday. ``The problems we're having right now 
could happen to a first-place club, a last-place club or a middle 
of the pack club. We're depleted right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies' playoff chances disintegrated when ace Curt  
Schilling went on the disabled list last month. Making matters 
worse, third baseman Scott Rolen has been out with a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's lack of pitching depth was exposed during a recent  
home stand that ended with a four-game sweep by the Houston Astros. 
In the previous series, the Phillies watched the Cincinnati Reds 
set a major league record with 14 homers in two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Francona, who got agitated when asked recently about his  
contract situation, has a deal that runs through the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't even thought about it,'' Francona said. ``It hasn't  
come up, and I won't bring it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wade said he and the manager started talking about an extension  
last month, when the team was still in the hunt for the NL wild 
card. He believes it could be done before the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are interested in extending Terry beyond the 2000 season,''  
Wade said. ``This is kind of a non-issue for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, the Phillies had a similar late-season swoon. They  
lost catcher Mike Lieberthal to a season-ending pelvic injury and 
lost 37 of their final 57 games. The club's 12th losing season in 
14 years appears certain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've said all along that Terry's the guy we want to lead us  
forward,'' Wade said.

<HEADLINE>  'Fight Club' Packs Literal Punch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VENICE, Italy (AP) -- The first rule of the Fight Club is that  
you don't talk about the Fight Club. And it is the first rule 
people will break when they've seen the movie starring Brad Pitt 
and Edward Norton. 
</P>
<P>
	David Fincher's in-your-face ``Fight Club,'' which had its world  
premiere Friday at the Venice Film Festival, is a movie that packs 
a punch -- literally. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fight Club'' is a darkly funny, furiously fast-paced movie  
with a message of malaise: How do you beat back the numbness of a 
society where, in Pitt's words, people ``work at jobs they hate to 
buy things they don't need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's also tremendously violent.  
</P>
<P>
	Norton plays the narrator, Jack, an insomniac yuppie, and Pitt  
plays his brash, anarchic alter-ego, Tyler Durden. Together they 
create a secret society called Fight Club, where guys get together 
in a basement to beat each other to a pulp. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a guy kind of thing: a way to feel truly alive in a  
testosterone-intolerant world, to beat back modern malaise, to 
connect -- even if brutally -- with another human being. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie's escalating, graphic violence is bound to provoke  
howls in the United States, where the entertainment industry is 
being blamed, at least in part, for trends such as the recent rash 
of school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Friday, the filmmakers defended their film  
and rejected the idea that it would inspire copycat anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a problem if people start fight clubs,'' said  
Fincher, whose previous films include the gruesome but gripping 
thriller ``Seven,'' also starring Pitt, and ``The Game,'' with 
Michael Douglas. ``I do if they start blowing up buildings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Pitt and Norton were attracted by the story, which is from  
a novel of the same name by a diesel mechanic, Chuck Palahniuk, 
because it reflected their own concerns about the emptiness and 
superficiality of modern society. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not about beating someone up,'' Pitt said. ``Its about  
the experience of a punch, of pain -- and the wake-up that could 
bring .... The point was connections, directions, feelings -- an 
answer to numbness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norton garnered an Academy Award nomination for his first film,  
``Primal Fear,'' with Richard Gere, and was up again for an Oscar 
for ``American History X.'' He said ``Fight Club'' addresses the 
angst of his generation, Generation X. 
</P>
<P>
	``This expresses the depth of the paralysis, the numbness, the  
despair that I see in a lot of people I know,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two stars also rejected any suggestion that the violence in  
the film was too extreme. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a violent world that we live in,'' Pitt said. ``I don't  
know how you can ignore that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Fight Club'' opens in the United States in October, backed by  
a high-powered promotional campaign from Twentieth Century Fox.

<HEADLINE> Investors Said Taken for $115M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Investment companies that promised  
lucrative life insurance policies swindled hundreds of people out 
of $115 million that was spent on lavish lifestyles, according to a 
federal indictment unsealed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Just $6 million of the $115 million give to the companies was  
used to buy legitimate policies, court records show. Much of the 
rest was spent on two dozen homes, 34 cars and two helicopters, the 
indictment alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	Frederick Brandau, 54, of Davie; an in-house attorney; a nurse  
and two of Brandau's companies -- Financial Federated Title &AMP; Trust 
Inc. and Asset Security Corp. -- were charged with 44 counts of wire 
and mail fraud, money laundering and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment, returned Aug. 13, was unsealed hours after  
federal agents arrested Brandau at Miami International Airport 
following his failed attempt to enter Bogota, Colombia, according 
to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	``For two years, the defendants preyed upon investors who were  
naive, unsophisticated and in many instances senior citizens who'd 
invested their life savings,'' FBI agent Alan Sadowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors planned to write letters to between 5,000 to  
6,000 investors who are potential victims of the alleged scheme, 
which ran from 1996 to August of this year. Many of them may not 
know they've lost money because they didn't expect to see a return 
for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The investors were told their funds would be used to buy  
discounted life insurance policies of the terminally ill. In what 
is known as a viatical settlement, the investor would receive the 
full value of the policy upon the patient's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandau's lawyer, Thomas Sclafani, did not immediately return a  
call for comment Friday. However, he's earlier said his client was 
not running a scam. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents already have begun seizing the homes, automobiles  
and other items they claim were purchased with funds from investors 
nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Drought Provides Price Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The drought has taken its toll on farmers who  
grow corn, soybeans and cotton, cutting yields up to a third in 
some states while providing a modest increase in depressed 
commodity prices, the government said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on its latest survey of crop conditions, the Agriculture  
Department predicted that farmers will harvest 9.4 billion bushels 
of corn this year, 2 percent under last month's forecast. The 
expected cotton harvest is down 4 percent, and the forecast for 
soybeans fell 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see a whole lot of optimism at this point,'' USDA  
economist Larry Salathe said. 
</P>
<P>
	The crop losses are likely to increase pressure on Congress to  
fatten its planned bailout of the agricultural economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved $7.4 billion in farm aid last month to  
compensate growers for a second year of low commodity prices. The 
Clinton administration is preparing its own proposal that is likely 
to include additional assistance for weather-related losses. The 
White House is considering recommending as much as $800 million, 
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The drought has gotten worse. The more states that get hit,  
the more votes that show up for some kind of assistance package,'' 
said Mary Kay Thatcher, a lobbyist for the American Farm Bureau 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA estimates the drought will cost farmers $1.1 billion. It  
initially did the most damage in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and 
other eastern states, but it has since spread across the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee and parts of Vermont and New Hampshire were declared  
agricultural disaster areas Friday, making farmers there eligible 
for low-interest loans. All or parts of 16 other states already 
received the designation. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton yields are expected to be down this year in three of the  
six top-producing states: Texas, Mississippi and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got some good cotton in some places, but in other places  
it's coming up short,'' said Jim Carrington, a spokesman for the 
Mississippi Farm Bureau. Rainfall in parts of Mississippi is as 
much as a foot below normal. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, farmers in Pennsylvania are expected to harvest just  
72 bushels of corn to the acre this year, down from the 111 bushels 
they got in 1998 and well below the average yield nationally this 
year of 134 bushels per acre. Soybean yields are off by a fourth in 
Pennsylvania and down a third in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ohio, corn yields are expected to drop from 141 to 125  
bushels an acre this year. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, corn yields in Iowa, which has had plenty of  
rain, are expected to soar to 151 bushels, up from 145 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The department has raised its estimate of what farmers will  
receive for soybeans this year to $4.80 a bushel, up 30 cents from 
last month, but that's well under the average price two years ago 
of $6.47. The price for corn rose a nickel from last month's 
forecast to $1.95 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers, not farmers, could be the biggest beneficiaries of  
the higher commodity prices, especially for soybeans, because the 
increase will be offset by reduced federal crop subsidies, payments 
triggered when commodity prices fall to very low levels. Prices 
have been depressed for the past two years because of a worldwide 
glut of grain and the poor economies of Asia and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA lowered its estimate of this year's average wheat price by  
10 cents to $2.60 a bushel, down from $3.38 two years ago. While 
American farmers reduced production this year, big wheat crops in 
Canada and Argentina are expected to offset the drop in the U.S. 
harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Although conservatives have balked at the size of the Senate's  
farm-relief package, farm-state legislators say it's almost a 
foregone conclusion that it will pass. The House-Senate conference 
committee that will write the final version of the measure has yet 
to meet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prospects for profitability in grain and pork and wheat  
are not good, for the next 12 months, anyway. When we go into 
harvest the prices always go down,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley, 
R-Iowa.

<HEADLINE> Parents Dispute Missing Baby Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The parents of a 5-month-old girl reported  
missing two years ago were taken out of context in an indictment 
that accused them of discussing the girl's death and lying to 
investigators, their attorney said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Marlene and Steve Aisenberg are charged with conspiracy and  
concocting stories to mislead police about the fate of their 
daughter Sabrina, who was reported missing Nov. 24, 1997, in the 
Tampa suburb of Brandon. The Aisenbergs have since moved to 
Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple are not charged with murder or kidnapping, but  
federal prosecutor Rachelle Des Vaux Bedke told a magistrate 
Thursday: ``The baby is in fact dead. They knew that and had some 
hand in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Aisenbergs' attorney, Barry Cohen, denied the allegation.  
</P>
<P>
	``If they have evidence to support a murder charge they should  
charge them with murder,'' Cohen said. ``It's not supported by any 
evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bedke also said Aisenberg was heard telling his wife: ``I wish I  
hadn't harmed her. It was the cocaine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said Aisenberg is not a drug user.  
</P>

	``I can assure you there's not going to be any evidence this man  
takes cocaine because he doesn't. He doesn't do drugs. I see a lot 
of things in this indictment that are unbelievable to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment -- which didn't disclose the source of the  
conversation -- doesn't mention drugs; it simply quotes Aisenberg as 
saying: ``I wish I hadn't harmed her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monte Richardson, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in  
Tampa, said he could not say why the reference to cocaine wasn't 
included in the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aisenbergs were arrested in Bethesda on Thursday. After  
using the deed of Aisenberg's father's home to cover their bond of 
$25,000 apiece on Friday, they left the federal courthouse in 
Greenbelt, Md., without comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors in the Aisenbergs' old neighborhood in Brandon  
expressed shock at the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Aisenberg's friend Judy Bailey defended the couple Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``They do not do drugs. They are not drinkers, not partiers,''  
she said. ``Their family is the most important thing in their 
life.''

<HEADLINE> NL Ump Rippley Returning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A company controlled by Richie Phillips, the  
head of the umpires union, disclosed it has been receiving about 
$350,000 annually from the American and National leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilot Air Freight Inc. has moved 2,000 tons of baseball  
equipment among 30 cities for more than 13 years, according to 
Richard Morris, the company's chief operating officer. The company 
also has worked with baseball-related charities, such as the Jackie 
Robinson Foundation, Morris said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris denied an allegation by Davey Phillips, a dissident  
umpire who is not related to the union leader, that it has several 
umpires on its payroll. Davey Phillips said last month the payments 
created a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pilot has engaged umpires for public relations purposes for  
nearly 15 years and currently has only two umpires who perform 
services for Pilot Air Freight,'' Morris said, adding that Davey 
Phillips ``had indicated a desire to join the Pilot staff in an 
ongoing capacity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Countered Davey Phillips: ``I never pursued them, they pursued  
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Richie Phillips steered me to an executive in my hometown of  
St. Louis. I worked for them two times -- I was not on the umpires 
union board of directors at the time -- and that was the extent of 
it. I decided I did not want to do it anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davey Phillips, along with Joe Brinkman and John Hirschbeck, has  
been organizing opponents to the union leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Richie Phillips is the chief executive officer of Pilot. Morris  
said its baseball-related revenue was less than 0.25 percent of the 
company's annual total. 
</P>
<P>
	In other umpire news, NL umpire Steve Rippley, who had been  
contemplating retirement, resumes work tonight at Cincinnati, where 
the Reds play the Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	Rippley has not worked in more than a week, unsure of his future  
after 22 of his colleagues were let go by baseball on Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	He had called the NL office last week, saying he wanted to  
retire because he was angry that he would have to work with many of 
the newly hired umpires, whom he said were too inexperienced to 
work in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	NL officials told him to take the weekend off and think about  
his decision before making it final. He then went to North Carolina 
for the funeral of the wife of AL umpire Drew Coble and informed 
the NL office on Wednesday that he would stay on. 
</P>
<P>
	Rippley, 45, is a 16-year veteran and a crew chief. Gary Darling  
and Larry Poncino, who had been on Rippley's crew, were among the 
22 umpires whose resignations were accepted. Rippley's new crew 
includes Wally Bell, Jerry Meals and Hunter Wendelstedt. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, who is in his seventh season, was one of three NL umpires  
who broke with the union leadership. Meals is in his third NL 
season and Wendelstedt is among the 25 newly hired umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	Rippley said he did not want to speak publicly about his reasons  
for changing his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the selection of an arbitrator who will determine  
whether the 22 umps were legally let go was postponed until next 
week, union lawyer Pat Campbell and management lawyer Howard Gans 
decided during a telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of an agreement forged last week at federal court in  
Philadelphia, the sides agreed the umpires could file a grievance 
claiming the 22 should have been allowed to withdraw their 
resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Arbitration Association's Philadelphia office  
provided a list of 15 arbitrators. The sides will take turns 
striking names until one remains, and he will be the arbitrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners intend to argue the arbitrator shouldn't hear the case,  
claiming the collective bargaining agreement leaves decisions on 
terminating umpires to the sole discretion of league presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires submitted their mass resignations in July, all effective  
Sept. 2, hoping to spur an early start to bargaining for a labor 
contract to replace the one that expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy backfired when about two dozen umpires refused to  
go along, and baseball then hired 25 replacements and accepted the 
22 resignations.

<HEADLINE> Probed Russia Bank Sought US Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Bank of New York official suspended in the  
Russian money-laundering scandal wrote Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan in 1996 urging that a Russian bank now under 
investigation be allowed to open an office in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The now-insolvent Russian bank, Inkombank, has surfaced in U.S.  
investigators' examination of Bank of New York, through which the 
Russian mob is believed to have funneled $10 billion. Russian 
banking authorities and U.S. intelligence reports have linked 
Inkombank to criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
	In her April 1996 letter to Greenspan, Natasha Gurfinkel  
Kagalovsky, a senior vice president and head of Bank of New York's 
Eastern European Division, said allowing Inkombank to open a U.S. 
office would ``go a long way in serving both U.S. and Russian 
customers'' and ``add to the increase of trade between our 
countries.'' A copy was obtained by The Associated Press on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kagalovsky, a native Russian who emigrated to this country  
and became a U.S. citizen, has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	As the federal inquiry into the Bank of New York continued, The  
New York Post reported Thursday that investigators have questioned 
people about the failure of Inkombank and another Russian bank, 
Unexim, which jointly owned a 39 percent stake in Sukhoi, a Russian 
high-tech manufacturer of fighter jets. The investigators are 
concerned that Sukhoi could have come under the control of Russian 
organized crime, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. intelligence reports have linked Inkombank with Russian  
organized crime, an intelligence source told the AP on Friday, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the Sukhoi fighter jets, which often are sold to Third  
World countries, are capable of carrying nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	In Congress, meanwhile, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., asked Senate  
Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, to hold hearings on 
the effects of money laundering on the nation's banking system and 
the international financial business. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerry is an expert on money laundering, having led an  
investigation of the now-defunct Bank of Credit and Commerce 
International in 1991 when he was chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations subcommittee on terrorism, narcotics and international 
operations. The Third World bank, known as BCCI, allegedly catered 
to arms smugglers, drug traffickers and terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	Suggesting the Bank of New York case may be the biggest  
money-laundering scandal in U.S. history, Kerry told Gramm: 
``Regardless of whether (U.S.) banks were actively involved in 
money laundering or were unwitting collaborators of international 
crime figures, these allegations warrant a re-evaluation of current 
laws geared to eliminate money laundering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``More needs to be done to ensure that international crime  
organizations cannot find a safe haven for money laundering,'' 
Kerry wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Christi Harlan, a spokeswoman for Gramm, said he didn't plan any  
hearings on the subject because he didn't want to interfere with 
the current criminal investigation by federal law enforcement 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Banking Committee plans hearings this month on the  
Bank of New York case. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kagalovsky noted in her letter to Greenspan that Inkombank  
was her division's ``largest and most active relationship, 
processing in excess of 250 payments per day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kagalovsky was suspended by Bank of New York after the  
scandal broke on Aug. 19. She is married to Konstantin Kagalovsky, 
who was Russia's representative to the International Monetary Fund 
from 1992 to 1995 and later worked as a senior executive at 
Russia's Menatep bank. He now is vice president of Russia's oil 
giant Yukos. 
</P>
<P>
	Through their New York attorney, Stanley Arkin, the Kagalovskys  
have denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkin didn't immediately return a telephone call Friday seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Inkombank withdrew its application to the Federal Reserve to  
open a U.S. office in September 1998. The reason wasn't known. The 
bank collapsed the following month, reporting $1.5 billion in 
losses.

<HEADLINE> 'Bible Code' Debunked by Scholars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An international team of statisticians is  
debunking the controversial ``Bible code,'' which claims the Old 
Testament has hidden references to 20th century events that can be 
revealed by a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents of the code claim that names and events were hidden  
in the Bible as written thousands of years ago and can be found 
through computer searches of the Hebrew text. Television 
documentaries, fast-selling books and numerous articles have 
popularized the theory, first published in the academic journal 
Statistical Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the same journal, published by the Institute of Mathematical  
Statistics based in Hayward, Calif., is offering an article 
challenging the technique it reported in 1994. The article will be 
published in the quarterly next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Believers in the ``Bible code'' theory treat the Hebrew Bible as  
a string of letters without spaces, looking for words formed by 
equidistant letter sequences. For instance, computers might select 
every ninth Hebrew letter and register a ``hit'' when a ``coded 
word'' intersects with a Bible verse containing related words. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago, three Israeli scholars published the results of  
their search in the journal. As they explained, they took names of 
famous rabbis from a reference dictionary, applied letter sequences 
and found the names near the rabbis' dates of birth or death. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the same technique, others have claimed the Bible contains  
secret predictions, including everything from the assassination of 
Yitzhak Rabin in 1995 to a Los Angeles earthquake in 2010. 
</P>
<P>
	Major Bible scholars ignore the code because, they note, no one  
has a letter-by-letter version of the Bible as originally written. 
The oldest surviving manuscripts include slight variations, any of 
which would throw off computer test results. 
</P>
<P>
	In the upcoming edition of Statistical Science, the new study's  
authors -- Dror Bar-Natan, Maya Bar-Hillel and Gil Kalai, professors 
at Jerusalem's Hebrew University, and Brendan McKay of the 
Australian National University -- combine expertise in mathematics 
and computer science to debunk the theory. 
</P>
<P>
	Using other spellings and assumptions, they ran hundreds of  
tests that repeated the experiment with different variations and 
applied it to more biblical books. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite a considerable amount of effort,'' they write, ``we  
have been unable to detect the codes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is significant, Bar-Natan said in a Thursday interview,  
because ``truth in science is never based on the results of a 
single experiment. A significant requirement is repeatability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their results were no more successful with the Hebrew  
translation of Tolstoy's ``War and Peace.'' Such letter 
configurations can be found in any long text, they say. The trick 
is to find letters in close proximity that form significant words 
more often than by chance. 
</P>
<P>
	But Eliyahu Rips, an Israeli mathematics professor who was  
co-author of the 1994 article, said in a statement that evidence 
for the code is ``stronger than ever'' and said a detailed reply to 
the new criticism would appear soon. 
</P>
<P>
	His ally Michael Drosnin, author of ``The Bible Code,'' said the  
critics ``told a lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Kass, head of the statistics department at Carnegie  
Mellon University in Pittsburgh, edited the journal when it 
published the first article and said it was reviewed by other 
experts. He is disturbed that people perceived publication as ``a 
stamp of scientific approval.'' That first article, he said, merely 
presented a puzzle -- one that has now been explained. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new study shows there were many, many choices,  
particularly for things like the names of the rabbis, that involved 
a lot of latitude. It was only for special sources that the results 
appeared,'' he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said such studies must avoid statistical ``tuning,'' just as  
medical research projects follow strict protocol. 
</P>
<P>
	Bar-Natan says that procedures in the 1994 project had ``enough  
wiggle room to produce whatever you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authors of the earlier article could not be reached for comment.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Conniver Gets Prison Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The leader of one of the nation's largest Medicare  
fraud rings ever was sentenced to 12 years in federal prison for 
being part of a $60 million home health care billing scam. 
</P>
<P>
	Former nurse Susan Regueiro, 61, was sentenced Thursday on a  
guilty plea to conspiracy and money-laundering charges. It was the 
17th conviction in the fraud case of Mederi of Dade County Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	When the indictment was issued in 1997, the dollar loss set a  
national record for the Medicare program. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Regueiro and others were charged with creating a large  
network of bogus nursing groups, keeping a secret partial 
ownership, making fictitious Medicare claims and funneling 
government payments back to co-defendants. Defendants included five 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joan Lenard went above the sentence  
specified in federal court guidelines to add prison time for 
disrupting government functions, saying Ms. Regueiro's conduct 
undermined public confidence in the nation's health care system. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also ordered $15.2 million restitution and probation  
for three years following prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Regueiro has not agreed to cooperate with federal  
prosecutors, but she could become a witness in the related trial of 
state Sen. Alberto Gutman, who is accused with his wife of 
participating in the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutman and his wife Marci were charged with pocketing at least  
$2 million from false claims as hidden owners of home health care 
companies that allegedly billed Mederi for services never 
performed. Their trial is set Oct. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Mederi operated in 1991 and 1992.  
</P>
<P>
	Home health care became the fastest-growing Medicare benefit in  
the 1990s, accounting for nearly 10 percent of program spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the increase has been blamed on widespread overbilling,  
delivery of unneeded services and other abuses, and Miami was 
considered the center of health care fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The second biggest health care fraud uncovered by federal  
investigators also originated in Miami -- a $45 million Medicare 
fraud scheme run through the St. Johns Home Health Agency.

<HEADLINE> IMF Said Pursuing Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration and International  
Monetary Fund sought to assure a congressional advisory panel 
Friday that the IMF is addressing criticism it is too secretive and 
ignores labor and environmental issues in its lending programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told the seven-member panel  
that the 182-nation IMF had made major strides recently in opening 
its activities to public scrutiny and addressing government 
corruption in the countries where it has loan programs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Summers said the administration realizes that more needs to  
be done and he promised to use the IMF Advisory Committee as a way 
to push for greater reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of us can be satisfied with where we are. The way the  
United States represents its interests and does its job (at the 
IMF) needs to be continually evaluated,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The advisory committee must produce a report at the end of two  
years of study. It was established by Congress as a condition for 
approving the administration's request last year for $18 billion to 
boost IMF resources in the midst of the Asian currency crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Among its members are Philip Condit, president of the Boeing  
Co.; Thomas Buffenbarger, president of the International 
Association of Machinsts union, and Steven Rattner, deputy chief 
executive of Lazard Freres investment firm in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer said the agency had  
made strides in recent years in seeking to protect worker rights 
and the environment, eliminate corruption and protect the poor as 
part of IMF loan programs. 
</P>
<P>
	But speaking at the advisory panel's first hearing Friday, he  
also said IMF efforts in these areas often ran up against 
complaints it was meddling in the internal affairs of sovereign 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, critics are accusing the IMF largely ignoring rampant  
corruption in Russia while loaning it billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Fischer took issue with that contention, saying the IMF has  
repeatedly pushed the Russian government to do a better job of 
eliminating tax evasion, which he said was at the heart of much of 
the country's corruption problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have done a lot. We have changed a lot,'' Fischer said,  
assuring the group that IMF officials would respond to the panel's 
requests for information. 
</P>
<P>
	One member of the advisory committee, Harry Cleberg, president  
of Farmland Industries Inc. of Kansas City, said the role the IMF 
plays in managing the international economy remains a mystery to 
most Americans. He said the agency needs to do better at explaining 
its mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this was a business, we would fire the current  
communications director and get another one,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Smith, policy director at the AFL-CIO and another member  
of the advisory panel, said the IMF had been doing a better job in 
the area of worker rights but he said was important for the agency 
to understand that more needed to be done.

<HEADLINE>  Coleman To Resign As NL President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- National League president Len Coleman, upset  
with owners' proposals to strip his job of nearly all authority, 
plans to resign at the end of the World Series, several senior 
baseball officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, baseball's highest-ranking black official, has headed  
the NL since March 1994. He had been resisting the efforts of 
commissioner Bud Selig to switch control of umpires from the league 
presidents to Sandy Alderson, hired last year as Selig's executive 
vice president of baseball operations, and has fought with Selig 
over baseball's failure to hire to more minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a plan baseball owners may vote on when they meet  
Wednesday and Thursday in Cooperstown, N.Y., the job of league 
president would become a figurehead. If the approved, the 
distinctions between the American and National leagues would 
decrease, following the pattern under Selig, who led the push for 
interleague play and advocates radical realignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, player discipline and the making of the schedule  
would be shifted from the leagues to the commissioner's office, 
subject to the approval of the players' association. Without these, 
the job of league president becomes merely ceremonial. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would seem ludicrous to have somebody there just to sign  
the baseballs. If that's all you have to do, I'll apply,'' said 
umpires' union head Richie Phillips, who has fought the plan to 
switch control of his members to Alderson. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing of the resignation plan, according to several  
high-ranking officials who spoke on the condition they not be 
identified, was precipitated by next week's owners' meeting. 
Coleman, however, had not intended to make an announcement today 
and was surprised that news leaked out Friday morning to ESPN, 
several baseball officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	While many baseball votes are conducted among each league  
separately, under the restructuring league meetings would disappear 
and decisions would make made by all owners of both leagues meeting 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, whose annual salary is thought to be in the $600,000  
range, had been negotiating settlement of his contract with Selig's 
staff for some time but had largely kept his plans private until 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a complete shock to me,'' Atlanta Braves president Stan  
Kasten said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman declined comment, as did Selig's spokesman, Rich Levin.  
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig has been much more amenable to  
Alderson's increasing role. Coleman has fought with Alderson and 
others in the commissioner's office, refusing to issue directives 
to umpires they had drafted in his name. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coleman has too much pride to allow himself to continue to be  
used. They stamp his name to stuff he refuses to sign,'' Phillips 
said. ``I believe that Gene Budig's exit will be close on the heels 
of Coleman's, and I don't believe it will be by resignation. Gene's 
job will be not only diminished, but extinguished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Orza, the No. 2 official of the players' association, said  
there would have to be negotiations before the union approves any 
changes in player discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent that they want to come down harder on umpires,  
there might be a psychological impulse to come down harder on 
players when they have confrontations with umpires,'' Orza said. 
``We're going to want some assurances that is not the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's restructuring began shortly after Selig, who had been  
acting commissioner since September 1992, was voted to a full 
five-year term in July 1999.

<HEADLINE> Coleman To Resign As NL President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- National League president Len Coleman, at odds  
with the commissioner's office over control of umpires and player 
discipline, plans to resign later this year, a high-ranking 
baseball official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, baseball's highest-ranking black official, has headed  
the NL since March 1994. He had been resisting the efforts of 
commissioner Bud Selig to switch control of umpires from the league 
presidents to Sandy Alderson, hired last year as Selig's executive 
vice president of baseball operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing of the resignation plan, according to a high-ranking  
official who spoke on the condition he not be identified, was 
precipitated by next week's owners' meeting. Coleman, however, had 
not intended to make an announcement today and was surprised news 
leaked out, another baseball employee said. The planned resignation 
was first reported by ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in the commissioner's office intend to propose a  
restructuring that will reduce the job of league president to a 
ceremonial one, the high-ranking official said. 
</P>
<P>
	If owners approve the restructuring, player discipline would be  
shifted from the leagues to the commissioner's office, subject to 
the approval of the players' association. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, league meetings would disappear and decisions would  
make made by all owners of both the American and National leagues 
meeting together. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman could not immediately be reached and Selig's spokesman,  
Rich Levin, said baseball had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig has been much more amenable to  
Alderson's increasing role. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Coleman had kept his plans private until this week.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's a complete shock to me,'' Atlanta Braves president Stan  
Kasten said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's restructuring began shortly after Selig, who had been  
acting commissioner since September 1992, was voted to a full 
five-year term in July 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Last September, he hired three executive vice presidents who  
report to Paul Beeston, baseball's chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderson, the former president and general manager of the

<HEADLINE> Frank Thomas To Undergo Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago White Sox slugger Frank Thomas ended a  
frustrating season Friday with the announcement that he will 
undergo surgery on his injured right ankle Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	White Sox general manager Ron Schueler said Thomas made the  
decision after consulting with team podiatrist Dr. Lowell Scott 
Weil. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was not at the ballpark Friday to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	``We decided it was in everyone's best interest to go ahead and  
move Frank's surgery up instead of waiting until after the season 
ended,'' Schueler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were in a pennant race, he could've gutted it out,''  
White Sox trainer Herm Schneider said. ``He felt he wasn't helping 
the team right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the surgery, Weil will remove a bone spur from Thomas'  
ankle and the corn from his small toe, and perform several other 
minor podiatric procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas finished with a .305 average, 15 home runs and 77 RBIs.  
It's the first time he has not driven in 100 RBIs, drawn 100 walks, 
scored 100 runs or hit at least 20 home runs since 1990, his first 
full season in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of power was the most puzzling. Thomas was hitting .271  
since the All-Star break with just three home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there are some things that went on that were a little  
struggle, the power things,'' White Sox manager Jerry Manuel said. 
``I really think it was a matter of him not adjusting to the inside 
pitch. He's got to come back with a better plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Frank's as frustrated as anybody,'' Schueler said.  
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, 31, has been bothered by the corn on his toe for much of  
the season and returned to Chicago on Monday from the team's road 
trip to undergo tests Tuesday. X-rays confirmed a significant spur 
on his right ankle and an ultrasound confirmed tendinitis in the 
ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	He has not played since striking out as a pinch-hitter Sept. 6  
in the first game of a doubleheader at Texas. He last started on 
Sept. 3 before leaving in the third inning with a bruised ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	After stating in spring training that he intended to play about  
100 games at first base, Thomas changed his tune and insisted he 
was strictly a designated hitter. In 50 games at first, Thomas hit 
.346, and he batted .281 as the designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	Manuel dismissed any notion that he had a problem with Thomas.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's like my son. My son doesn't always agree with what I  
might say,'' Manuel said. ``I think (Thomas) is going to take this 
and hopefully he'll be motivated.''

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Anderson Likes Spotlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Under the shadow of a practice-field  
goalpost, Jamal Anderson thumbs through a muscle magazine with a 
bunch of slick L.A.-types, trying to settle on the right pose for 
his cover photo. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Bob Whitfield glowered in mock disapproval when he  
spotted the photo session from a nearby sidewalk. A few other 
teammates followed suit, as if to say: Jamal, are you a football 
player or a model? 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson will say he's both.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the prettiest guy in the NFL,'' he says to no one in  
particular at the Atlanta Falcons training complex, mimicking the 
routine of his ``Uncle Muhammad'' (as in Ali, a longtime family 
friend). 
</P>
<P>
	That charisma -- a form of braggadocio that's more lighthearted  
than intimidating -- landed Anderson a small role in the HBO series 
``Arliss.'' His likeness has been replicated in claymation by the 
Fox network. He has posed for several magazine covers. He's trying 
to line up a radio talk show. He hints cryptically about a future 
movie role. He's got a Web site, his own video game and a company 
that promotes parties and concerts with groups such as Backstreet 
Boys and Boyz II Men. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been this way since he was a scrub,'' Whitfield said.  
``That's Jam. Some people were born to be a star.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Make no mistake, Anderson now has credentials to back up all the  
talk. He rushed for a franchise-record 1,846 yards and set an NFL 
mark with 410 carries last season, leading the Falcons to their 
first Super Bowl and earning All-Pro honors. 
</P>
<P>
	With the retirement of Barry Sanders, Anderson and Denver's  
Terrell Davis are the NFL's most prominent running backs. 
</P>
<P>
	At the beginning of each week, Anderson gets together with a  
team official who keeps track of his schedule: interviews, special 
appearances and sundry other requests. If the list doesn't look 
particularly long, Anderson is disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to Sunday's opener against Minnesota, he had plenty of  
things to do: taping a show for the WB television network Tuesday; 
a telephone conference call with the Minnesota media and that photo 
shoot for Muscular Development magazine Wednesday; a morning radio 
show, an interview with Fox reporter Pam Oliver and a conference 
call with national media Thursday; an appearance on coach Dan 
Reeves' TV show and a meeting with Fox broadcasters Pat Summerall 
and John Madden on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	After completing a task, Anderson dutily marks it off the list,  
which hangs prominently in his locker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just cross 'em off as they come,'' he said. ``It's a lot  
different now. At every major airport, somebody recognizes me or 
tries to grab me. That takes some getting used to. It's hard to go 
to the supermarket, It's hard to go to the movies. Everything has 
become an obstacle. You always have to be in a good mood and have 
the proper attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he quickly adds: ``I don't want it to be the other way  
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson threatened his well-cultivated reputation when he held  
out of training camp for two weeks, demanding a new contract. Fans 
flooded his Web site with angry comments, but he eventually agreed 
to a five-year, $32 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he jokes about the negotiations (``I'm not doing Dan's show  
because he cost me a half-million dollars on my bonus'') and the 
whole ordeal seems largely forgotten or forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've taken just as many brutal blows in training  
camp,'' said Anderson, who missed the first preseason game. ``I 
feel fine. I'm in game condition and my weight is better than it's 
been in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves is more pessimistic about Anderson's progress since the  
holdout. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he had played in all four preseason games, you'd feel a lot  
better about it,'' he said. ``Because he is a veteran and knows our 
system, it's not going to affect him like it would a younger 
player. We are not where we were as far as his timing was concerned 
going into last season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It might appear that Anderson could use a breather off the  
field, but he insists that he does nothing to distract from 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know when to shut it down,'' he said. ``There were times  
when I wouldn't do something because I didn't want to travel. Or 
they would come to Utah (where he has a home) so I wouldn't have to 
break up my workouts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Anderson's main focus -- with apologies to film,  
television, radio and magazines -- is redeeming himself for one of 
his poorest games last season: a 23-carry, 67-yard performance 
against Minnesota in the NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember,'' he said, ``better than anybody else.''

<HEADLINE> France Criticizes Michelin Layoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin  
on Friday criticized tire giant Michelin for shedding jobs, 
reminding the company that employment is the government's ``first 
priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We want everyone to share the government's commitment to  
employment,'' Jospin said in Rambouillet, outside Paris, where the 
leftist government met to plot its strategy for the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This government, its priority, its first priority, is  
employment,'' the Socialist prime minister said. ``We want this 
mission to be shared by all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michelin announced this week that it would shed 7,500 jobs  
during the next three years, a reduction of around 10 percent of 
Michelin's work force in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The move, part of a restructuring, aims to increase productivity  
by at least 20 percent over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see a company announce a 20 percent increase in  
profits at the same time they are firing people, it's time to watch 
out,'' Jospin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jospin had vowed to lower France's unemployment rate when he  
took office in 1997, when unemployment was over 12 percent. In 
July, the unemployment rate dipped to 11.2 percent, its lowest 
point in years. 
</P>
<P>
	Jospin's government has instituted a program to change the work  
week from 39 hours to 35 hours in the hope of creating more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The forum here also was to focus on growing discontent by the  
nation's farmers and equality between men and women.

<HEADLINE> Student Sues School Over Photo Flap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDLAND, Texas (AP) -- A picture snapped last January of a car  
parked in front of an unmarried female teacher's residence has 
become the center of a federal civil rights lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The car belonged to Midland High School principal Neil Richmond,  
who is married. The picture was snapped by 18-year-old Casey Riggan 
and two fellow high school seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	Several months later, after Richmond learned of the photograph,  
he accused Riggan of starting rumors of sexual indiscretion that 
caused tongues to wag in this West Texas city of 63,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The principal suspended Riggan and ordered him to apologize.  
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Riggan sued in federal court, alleging that Richmond  
and the school board trampled on his rights of free speech. The 
lawsuit seeks unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
	When Riggan refused to apologize or drop his lawsuit, he was  
suspended for three days and placed in an alternative school -- a 
special campus for students with behavior problems. He also was 
barred from attending his graduation ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	The school board endorsed the discipline.  
</P>
<P>
	Gail Riggan, Casey's mother, said he was the first family member  
in six generations to graduate from high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that they had no right to take one of the most  
special moments of my son's life away from him,'' Mrs. Riggan said. 
``My personal opinion is that they needed a scapegoat to blame 
because word got out about the principal's affair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The principal has declined to respond to the allegations he and  
the teacher were in a relationship. He said Riggan violated the 
school code by being disrespectful of adults by fostering rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Royal Furgeson of Midland is expected to  
decide later this month whether to allow the lawsuit to proceed. He 
has rejected several motions by school attorneys asserting that the 
judge has no authority to involve himself in internal school 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Richmond said the lawsuit is ``absolutely absurd. This is a  
lose-lose situation for both parties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was punished under policies the school has always upheld,''  
Richmond said, declining further comment.

<HEADLINE> Arizona Activates Lee and Kim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks activated first baseman  
Travis Lee and right-handed reliever Byung-Hyun Kim on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Buck Showalter also said left-hander Brian Anderson  
would start in place of right-hander Armando Reynoso against the 
Pittsburgh Pirates next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee has been out since Aug. 16 with a severely sprained left  
ankle. The injury occurred when he was fielding fly balls in the 
outfield during batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee is not expected to play right away, manager Buck Showalter  
said. It was just that his 15 days on the disabled list have 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's getting closer every day, but he's not where he needs to  
be yet,'' Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter said Lee might be used in late innings or as a pinch  
hitter ``but he'd be a guy pretty low on the list right now. The 
only thing he's really having trouble with is turning to his left. 
That's still bothering him some.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he was hurt, Lee already had lost his starting job because  
of a 4-for-43 batting slump. Since then, Erubiel Durazo, called up 
from Triple-A Tucson on July 25, has been seeing most of the action 
at first base and has nine home runs in his last 81 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, the South Korean rookie, has been on the disabled list  
since July 28 with a neck strain. He had been pitching recently on 
a rehabilitation assignment with Tucson. On Sunday against Las 
Vegas, he struck out four in 1 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynoso has been hit hard in his last two starts, allowing 10  
runs on 15 hits in 5 2-3 innings. In Thursday's 9-8 loss in 
Milwaukee, Reynoso (10-4) gave up six runs on seven hits in just 
two innings. Showalter indicated that Reynoso is showing signs of 
throwing more pitches than he's accustomed to throwing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just going to give him a chance to refresh,'' Showalter  
said. ``We're going to let him back off and take a couple of work 
days and try to get him back to where he was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson (6-2) lost his spot in the rotation when Todd  
Stottlemyre came back from a partially torn rotator cuff injury. 
Anderson threw a three-hitter in his last start Aug. 17 against the 
Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other players are expected to come off the injured list  
soon. Shortstop Andy Fox, out with a strained right rib cage, is 
due back on Sunday. Outfielder Turner Ward, on the DL with 
tendinitis on his right knee, since he was called up from Tucson on 
Aug. 31, is expected to be activated next Wednesday.

<HEADLINE>  Coleman To Resign As NL President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- National League president Len Coleman, upset  
with owners' proposals to strip his job of nearly all authority, 
plans to resign at the end of the World Series, several senior 
baseball officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, baseball's highest-ranking black official, has headed  
the NL since March 1994. He had been resisting the efforts of 
commissioner Bud Selig to switch control of umpires from the league 
presidents to Sandy Alderson, hired last year as Selig's executive 
vice president of baseball operations, and has fought with Selig 
over baseball's failure to hire to more minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a plan baseball owners may vote on when they meet  
Wednesday and Thursday in Cooperstown, N.Y., the job of league 
president would become a figurehead. If the approved, the 
distinctions between the American and National leagues would 
decrease, following the pattern under Selig, who led the push for 
interleague play and advocates radical realignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, player discipline and the making of the schedule  
would be shifted from the leagues to the commissioner's office, 
subject to the approval of the players' association. Without these, 
the job of league president becomes merely ceremonial. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would seem ludicrous to have somebody there just to sign  
the baseballs. If that's all you have to do, I'll apply,'' said 
umpires' union head Richie Phillips, who has fought the plan to 
switch control of his members to Alderson. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing of the resignation plan, according to several  
high-ranking officials who spoke on the condition they not be 
identified, was precipitated by next week's owners' meeting. 
Coleman, however, had not intended to make an announcement today 
and was surprised that news leaked out Friday morning to ESPN, 
several baseball officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	While many baseball votes are conducted among each league  
separately, under the restructuring league meetings would disappear 
and decisions would make made by all owners of both leagues meeting 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, whose annual salary is thought to be in the $600,000  
range, had been negotiating settlement of his contract with Selig's 
staff for some time but had largely kept his plans private until 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a complete shock to me,'' Atlanta Braves president Stan  
Kasten said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman declined comment, as did Selig's spokesman, Rich Levin.  
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig has been much more amenable to  
Alderson's increasing role. Coleman has fought with Alderson and 
others in the commissioner's office, refusing to issue directives 
to umpires they had drafted in his name. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coleman has too much pride to allow himself to continue to be  
used. They stamp his name to stuff he refuses to sign,'' Phillips 
said. ``I believe that Gene Budig's exit will be close on the heels 
of Coleman's, and I don't believe it will be by resignation. Gene's 
job will be not only diminished, but extinguished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Orza, the No. 2 official of the players' association, said  
there would have to be negotiations before the union approves any 
changes in player discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent that they want to come down harder on umpires,  
there might be a psychological impulse to come down harder on 
players when they have confrontations with umpires,'' Orza said. 
``We're going to want some assurances that is not the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's restructuring began shortly after Selig, who had been  
acting commissioner since September 1992, was voted to a full 
five-year term in July 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Last September, he hired three executive vice presidents who  
report to Paul Beeston, baseball's chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderson, the former president and general manager of the  
Oakland Athletics, was put in charge of operational matters. Bob 
DuPuy, Selig's longtime lawyer, was made baseball's chief legal 
officer and put in charge all of administrative matters. Rob 
Manfred, a labor lawyer whose firm had represented baseball for 
more than a decade, was put in charge of labor and human resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Beeston, DuPuy, Alderson and Manfred had directed the owners'  
strategy in dealing with the umpires' threat to resign in en masse.

<HEADLINE> Opera Purists Decry Enhancements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Graphic    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In what some opera purists see as nothing less  
than immoral, singers' voices are being ``enhanced'' with 
microphones hidden in the walls and stage of the New York State 
Theater, home of the New York City Opera. 
</P>
<P>
	For centuries, opera companies have relied on their singers'  
God-given acoustic talents. Those who once heard Leontyne Price's 
pianissimo high notes in ``Aida'' float up to the cheapest seats of 
the Metropolitan Opera aren't likely to forget the unearthly 
beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why the installation of microphones at the New York City  
Opera, which is among the first major American musical companies to 
incorporate a sound system into its productions, has started a 
noisy debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Theater officials insist that ``Figaro, Figaro, Figaro'' will  
not be cranked up to ``FIGARO! FIGARO! FIGARO!'' by the two dozen 
microphones around the stage and orchestra and the more than 100 
speakers tucked away in the walls and under balconies. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an amplification system -- it's an enhancement  
system!'' insists Susan Woelzl, a spokeswoman for the theater, 
which is also home to the New York City Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
	But the purists are protesting -- fortissimo.

	``When you put in microphones, you're altering the basic premise  
of someone who buys a ticket to hear voices such as God and the 
voice teacher made them,'' says Rudolph Rauch, editor of Opera News 
magazine. ``Pretending that this important principle is not being 
violated is immoral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sound system -- or ``sonic architecture'' as its Dutch  
designers call it -- makes its debut Saturday at the season-opening 
performance of Puccini's ``Madama Butterfly'' at the 2,700-seat 
auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
	Theater officials say the system is necessary because the  
35-year-old State Theater was originally designed for ballet 
performances, which require stage acoustics that muffle the noise 
of feet. But that also deadens voices, forcing young opera singers 
to struggle to be heard well. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, across the plaza at the rival Metropolitan Opera,  
the acoustics naturally highlight the singing. On the other hand, 
ballet slippers can make a loud pitter-patter on that stage. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Theater realized that it would cost tens of millions  
of dollars to revamp the hall to improve the acoustics, while the 
sound enhancement runs only hundreds of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of theaters around the world have quietly gone for  
``sound enhancement,'' including the Brooklyn Academy of Music, 
where critics have offered no negative reviews of the technology. 
The system also is used at the Houston Grand Opera and the German 
State Opera in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Natural acoustics are the best experience available to  
listeners. That's our goal,'' says Scott Pfeiffer, one of the 
acoustical consultants overseeing installation of the system. ``But 
we can't make the State Theater into the Met.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise, Nasdaq at Record High / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose today, lifting the Nasdaq composite  
index into record territory, after the government's report of a 
drop in wholesale prices eased investor concerns about higher 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was up 28.50 at 11,107.90. The blue-chip index 
had backed off from a gain of 62 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index was up 42.50 at 2,894.52, moving past  
its closing high of 2,864.48, set July 16. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 
500 index was up 8.67 at 1,356.33. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said rising energy costs pushed wholesale  
prices up a higher than expected 0.5 percent during August. But 
when the volatile energy and food categories are excluded, 
wholesale prices actually fell 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets tend to set aside food and energy price  
changes and focus on the figure known as core inflation. The 0.1 
percent drop in core inflation last month was better than 
economists expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets have been uneasy lately amid concerns that the  
Federal Reserve, which has already raised interest rates twice this 
year, would push rates higher a third time because of the economy's 
continuing strength. Today's report helped alleviate some of those 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was pretty much the icing on the cake,'' said David Orr,  
chief economist at First Union Capital Markets Group in Charotte, 
N.C. ``The market is correct to now relax, at least temporarily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While technology issues overall were mostly higher, the Nasdaq's  
gains were led by online auction house eBay, up 10 7/16 at 154 7/8 and 
Internet search provider Yahoo!, up 7 at 169 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders suggested that Thursday's unoffical test run for Year  
2000 computer glitches may have alleviated concerns about 
computer-related companies. Some programmers had feared that the 
string of nines in Thursday's date -- 9-9-99 -- would cause computer 
programs to fail. 
</P>
<P>
	But with no major problems reported, programmers and Wall Street  
professionals alike gained confidence that Jan. 1, 2000, will pass 
without difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
	American Express, rising on the prospect of stable interest  
rates, led the Dow higher, rising 3 5/16 to 141 15/16. IBM was up 
11/16 at 135 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 655.8 million shares, 
up from Thursday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index was up 3.10 at 440.87.

<HEADLINE> Parents Discussed Daughter's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The parents said a kidnapper snatched their  
5-month-old baby as they slept. Talk between the parents, however, 
shed a different light on what happened, according to a prosecutor: 
``The baby is in fact dead. They knew that and had some hand in 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Nov. 24, 1997, disappearance of baby Sabrina  
officially remains an unsolved missing-person report, a seven-count 
federal indictment accuses Steven and Marlene Aisenberg of 
conspiracy, concocting stories about a kidnapping and lying to 
investigators to mislead them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aisenbergs weren't charged with murder or kidnapping.  
</P>
<P>
	The couple, who moved to Bethesda, Md., last spring were  
arrested there Thursday and released under $25,000 bond apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	During an appearance in federal court in Greenbelt, Md.,  
Assistant U.S. Attorney Rachelle DesVaux Bedke said: ``The baby is 
in fact dead. They knew that and had some hand in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bedke also said that Aisenberg was heard telling his wife: ``I  
wish I hadn't harmed her. It was the cocaine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in Tampa, federal agents would not disclose  
the source of the parents' conversation and refused to say whether 
it was obtained on a wiretap. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment detailed a conversation in which Mrs. Aisenberg  
allegedly blamed her husband for Sabrina's death. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the indictment, Mrs. Aisenberg told her husband  
less than a month after the baby's disappearance: ``The baby's dead 
and buried. It was found dead because you did it. The baby's dead 
no matter what you say -- you just did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aisenberg allegedly replied: ``Honey, there was nothing I could  
do about it. We need to discuss the way that we can beat the 
charge. I would never break from the family pact and our story even 
if the police were to hold me down. We will do what we have to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment also quotes Aisenberg as telling his wife: ``I  
wish I hadn't harmed her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Aisenberg replied: ``I just can't take the rap for this,''  
the indictment states. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said they still do not know what has happened to  
Sabrina since her mother reported the cherub-faced, dark-haired 
baby missing from their secluded, suburban Brandon home. 
</P>
<P>
	``The information in the indictment would indicate the child is  
not alive,'' said Hillsborough County Sheriff Cal Henderson, whose 
office followed 2,000 leads and conducted 6,000 interviews in 49 
states and six countries. ``But they've lied to us in the past. We 
can't say. We just don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Aisenbergs' attorney, Barry Cohen, did not return telephone  
calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand jurors said the parents lied to mislead people about the  
baby's disappearance, provided false information to the media, 
passed off a picture of another child as Sabrina, threw out a lead 
in the case they knew to be staged, solicited money for a Sabrina 
bank account then used it to pay credit cards and schemed about 
trying to wrongly blame a Michigan man for an abduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Aisenberg, who turns 36 on Tuesday, is charged in five counts;  
Mrs. Aisenberg, 36, is charged in six counts. If convicted he would 
face a maximum of 25 years in prison and a $1.25 million fine and 
she would face a maximum of 30 years in prison and a $1.5 million 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aisenbergs have two other children William, 9, and Monica,  
6.

<HEADLINE> Gore Greets Children, Not Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CENTRAL FALLS, R.I. (AP) -- It was Vice President Al Gore, not  
Republican presidential hopeful George W. Bush, who greeted 
children at a local elementary school Friday. His slogan: ``Kids 
over cash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic presidential hopeful deftly changed his campaign  
schedule to talk to the mostly Hispanic students at the Ella Risk 
School after Bush canceled his visit Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad weather delayed the GOP front-runner's plane and he chose to  
attend his only other campaign stop in Rhode Island -- a 
$1,000-plate fund raiser in Providence. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island's Republican governor, Lincoln Almond, stood in for  
Bush at the school Thursday. He said Bush's cancellation is ``not 
even a blip''on his campaign record, and political analysts agreed 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gore's campaign did their best to use the visit to score  
some political points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll choose kids over cash every day. Our campaign is driven  
more by compassion than conservatism,'' Gore spokesman Chris Lehane 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a crowded, hot auditorium, Gore took off his suit jacket,  
greeted students in Spanish and knelt down to give high-fives 
before he left. 
</P>
<P>
	Eager for the ``kiddie press conference'' that was scheduled for  
Bush's visit, children asked questions on everything from Gore's 
daily tasks to the kind of car he drives -- a Mercury Sable. When 
one little girl asked if he liked being vice president, Gore said, 
``I like it. It's fun but I think president would be even better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers chuckled at Gore's jokes and students said ``he was a  
nice guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They always say that he is stiff but I didn't see that at  
all,'' said teacher Sue Rouleau. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know he spoke Spanish,'' said fifth grader Taisha  
Gonzalez, translating the message. ``He told us that in his family, 
education is important and that in all families -- Puerto Rican and 
Dominican -- education should be important too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Central Falls, a city of 17,000, has the state's highest  
child-poverty rate. At least a third of the city's residents are 
Latino and Bush had planned to show off his rapport with the 
Hispanic community. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island's Democratic Party Chairman William Lynch said  
Bush's cancellation was ``a monumental blunder by the Bush campaign 
and we took advantage of that absolutely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's spokesperson said the governor had no other choice but to  
cancel the school visit and criticized Gore for stealing his 
thunder. 
</P>
<P>
	``It even looks desperate,'' Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said.  
</P>
<P>
	The good news for the Bush campaign is that the ``political  
blunder'' is likely to only be a temporary embarrassment -- at least 
in Rhode Island, said political observer at the University of Rhode 
Island Marc Genest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rhode Island is inconsequential in the Republican Primary. You  
can afford to lose,'' Genest said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Genest says there may be one lasting affect in a  
presidential race that still has a long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``It reinforced the idea that (Bush) is a moneymaking machine  
and nothing else,'' Genest said. 
</P>
<P>
	Darrell West, a political science professor at Brown University,  
agreed Bush's no show was a mistake and said Gore's visit was 
blatant grandstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	``But grandstanding works.'' West said. ``And kids over cash is  
a catchy sound bite.''

<HEADLINE> Denver Teachers May OK Pay Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Schoolteachers here may be ready to turn the  
tables on critics of public schools by agreeing to link pay to how 
much their individual classes learn. 
</P>
<P>
	Their union has negotiated a contract with the school district  
that would include a two-year pilot program in which a test group's 
raises would be linked to the performance of students in individual 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	If teachers approve the contract today, they would vote in two  
years on whether to make the test program permanent and gamble 
previously guaranteed annual raises on meeting their goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing like this has ever been done before,'' said Andrea  
Giunta, president of the local teachers' union. But she believes, 
when ``members hear the details, their fears will be settled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver plan would reward a teacher based solely on the  
performance of his or her individual classes, unlike other programs 
that link raises to improved overall performance of schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Lyons, spokeswoman for the National Education  
Association, the nation's largest teachers union with 2.4 million 
members, said other types of performance pay have been tried around 
the country and most have failed. 
</P>
<P>
	She said recent experiments included Arizona, where teachers got  
a $500 bonus when student test scores improved statewide, and Ohio, 
which set up a gain-sharing program, giving teachers a bonus if 
they met the goals set by each school. 
</P>
<P>
	``This program is truly different. It's not a bonus. It changes  
where you are in the salary schedule, based on student 
achievement,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be looking at the numbers. The whole idea is to improve  
student performance. That's why we are in this business -- not to 
make kids fail, but to make them learn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three years after court-ordered busing ending, Denver schools  
are reporting higher test scores among white students. But minority 
scores lag behind and the district is under pressure from the 
federal government to reduce the gap between whites and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to change the culture and do some pretty  
dramatic things,'' said school board member Elaine Berman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver contract proposal also includes a provision for  
teachers to become involved in policy-making on academic matters. 
</P>
<P>
	The performance pay test program would involve only 450 of the  
district's 4,300 teachers. They would be selected from 12 
elementary schools and three middle schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers who agree to participate would get $500 to sign up, and  
an additional $1,000 for accomplishing two goals set in discussions 
with their principal. 
</P>
<P>
	The participation bonuses wouldn't be part of a permanent  
program that includes all teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the pending contract, starting teachers would make $30,000  
and senior staff with doctorates would receive $60,362. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a good idea,'' said teacher Gary Apel. ``I'm  
comfortable enough with my teaching ability it doesn't intimidate 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others are skeptical.  
</P>
<P>
	``Teachers on the whole don't like change. Nobody does. Teachers  
are very proud of what they do and feel they're doing a wonderful 
job and they get no respect,'' said teacher Melody Duggan.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Floyd Gains Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- With forecasts predicting Tropical Storm Floyd  
would become a hurricane, the storm moved closer to the Caribbean, 
where some governments had already issued tropical storm watches. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it will probably strengthen into a hurricane later  
today,'' said Richard Pasch, hurricane specialist with the National 
Hurricane Center in Miami. ``Conditions are favorable for it to 
strengthen and it's very close to a hurricane already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By early today, Floyd had top sustained winds of 70 mph, just 4  
mph shy of hurricane strength, and was expected to increase in 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd, the sixth tropical storm of the season, was centered  
about 215 miles east-northeast of Barbuda in the northern Leeward 
Islands. It was expected to continue moving toward the 
west-northwest at near 12 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm was expected to pass just north of the Leeward  
Islands, but could threaten the northeastern Caribbean if it were 
to shift at all to the south, said hurricane specialist Lixion 
Avila. 
</P>
<P>
	The island governments of Antigua, Barbuda, Anguilla and Dutch  
Saint Maarten, French St. Martin, and St. Barthelemy all had issued 
tropical storm watches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now the focus is on the Leeward Islands,'' Franklin  
said. ``Any potential threat to the U.S. would be several days down 
the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tropical storm force winds extended outward up to 175 miles from  
the storm's center, which at 5 a.m. was located at 18.9 north 
latitude, 58.7 west longitude.

<HEADLINE> Marlee Matlin Goes Against Type </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Imagine Marlee Matlin playing the prime  
suspect in the stabbing death of a political candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Nah, the Academy Award-winning actress' screen image is too  
upright and honorable, right? 
</P>
<P>
	Matlin shows a different side of herself as a performer and  
takes a slap at stereotypes in ``Where the Truth Lies,'' airing 9 
p.m. EDT Monday on Lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
	Dana Sue Lacey (Matlin) runs a floral shop in Memphis, Tenn.,  
where she coordinates the state senate campaign of a friend, Dr. 
Sander Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the election, Sander is murdered and Dana, the only  
witness, becomes the prime suspect. She calls on defense attorney 
Lillian Rose Martin, played by Regina King, to prove her innocence. 
Dana is acquitted, but Lillian feels unsettled about the verdict. A 
tangled web of suspects emerges in Lillian's quest to find the real 
murderer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly different for me,'' Matlin said, her fingers  
flying in sign language interpreted by longtime friend Jack Jason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do feel like I get stereotyped. Being a woman and being  
someone who's deaf, they would say, `Oh no, no, no, she couldn't 
possibly do that and we couldn't possibly believe that she's the 
murderer.' I wanted the audience to have the sympathy and use it 
against them in a way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Matlin, her character is deaf and uses sign language and an  
interpreter. Matlin speaks some lines, but the movie's focus is on 
the suspense of finding the murderer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I avoid roles that have to do with deaf stories. Don't  
misunderstand me, I have to accept the fact that I'm a person who's 
hearing-impaired, but I don't want the story to be about being 
deaf,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Matlin said she wasn't being offered the roles she wants, so she  
formed her own production company, Solo One. ``If you want to be 
out there working, you have to come up with it yourself,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Matlin is approached constantly by hearing-impaired people for  
advice on getting into show business. Some even ask to use her 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though this sounds selfish, I don't want to help them  
because I need to help myself. I haven't reached my own goals 
yet,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She does, however, enjoy being a role model for kids, ``because  
it gives me less pressure,'' she said. ``With children, they just 
need to be inspired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matlin notes there are jobs for deaf actors in television, but  
she would like to see them carry a film. 
</P>
<P>
	``But in this business, it's not easy the way it works,'' she  
said. ``It's not going to be something that ever happens right in 
the near future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matlin served as an executive producer for the first time on  
``Where the Truth Lies,'' along with her interpreter Jason, who 
wrote the story. 
</P>
<P>
	She wanted a happy set (even insisting better food for the crew)  
so she could concentrate on acting when she wasn't involved in 
casting decisions and watching the daily footage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how some people who direct and produce and act at  
the same time are able to do it. I have to give them a big hand 
because that's not necessarily something I think I could do yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matlin, now 34, lost most of her hearing when she was afflicted  
with a strain of measles at the age of 18 months. She shot to 
stardom in 1987, winning an Oscar for her movie debut in ``Children 
of a Lesser God.'' She even had the requisite off-screen romance 
with co-star William Hurt, which is detailed in Lifetime's 
``Intimate Portrait'' of Matlin, airing Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Oscar does put a lot of pressure on you,'' she said.  
``Everybody expects that when you win an Oscar, you're going to 
have only good, good films afterwards and that's not the case at 
all. Every career is full of ups and downs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Matlin made other movies, none came close to the  
success and acclaim of her debut. 
</P>
<P>
	She has found greater luck on the small screen, starring in TV  
movies and doing Emmy-nominated turns in such series such as 
``Seinfeld,'' ``Picket Fences,'' ``Reasonable Doubts'' and ``Spin 
City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matlin said that although she is never satisfied, she feels more  
self-confident as she gets older. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have plans for what I'd like to do,'' she said. ``I have  
ideas of what I'd like to do and I'm not afraid to put them to 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>

	THAT'S LIVING: ``Martha Stewart Living'' is back for its third  
season, with the duchess of domesticity once again showing us the 
way. The syndicated show, now a full hour each weekday, promises 
segments on tomatoes (growing, canning, cooking), family traditions 
and ``basics'' such as how to fold a towel. Stewart also is going 
on the road this season, with stops in France, Santa Fe, N.M., and 
even Iowa for the state fair.

<HEADLINE> Denver Teachers OK Raise Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The city's teachers union has approved a two-year  
pilot program -- the first of its kind in the nation -- to tie 
teachers' pay raises to how well students do on tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an experiment, and I think it's worth the experiment,''  
said Laurie Bourg, a fourth-grade teacher who voted for the pact. 
</P>
<P>
	The program, proposed by the Denver Classroom Teachers  
Association, will involve only a small group of volunteers at 
first. At the end of the two years, a decision will be made on 
whether to expand the program to all teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The teachers of Denver have decided to give it a try,'' said  
Becky Wissink, union vice president. She would not give totals from 
Friday's vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``From teachers' perspective, the real value of this pilot is  
that they can be involved from the ground up in the design, 
implementation and evaluation of the study,'' said teachers union 
president Andrea Giunta. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step is the appointment of a design team that will  
create and oversee the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Many teachers are now asking how classroom performance can be  
measured, especially when so many variables are out of their 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in the printing business for 15 years, and you can't run  
schools like a business,'' said Roxanne Rhodes, a high school 
social studies teacher. ``If I bought paper in my printing business 
and it wasn't up to quality, we could send it back. You can't do 
that with students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Denver and many other districts around the country, teachers  
automatically get raises based on length of service. 
</P>
<P>
	Some districts around the country have offered merit increases  
or bonuses, but they base the decision on schoolwide achievement or 
factors such as a teacher's work outside the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver program, in contrast, would reward teachers for how  
well the children do in their individual classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The participants in the pilot program would get bonuses, rather  
than raises. However, if the program is enacted permanently, the 
teachers whose students do well will be rewarded with actual salary 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Their pay would not be docked if their students didn't measure  
up. 
</P>
<P>
	``This program is truly different. It's not a bonus. If it's  
enacted in two years, it changes where you are in the salary 
schedule based on student achievement,'' said Kathleen Lyons, a 
spokeswoman for the National Education Association, the nation's 
largest teachers union with 2.4 million members. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting teachers in Denver make $30,000. The top salary, which  
requires a doctorate, is $60,362. 
</P>
<P>
	About 450 of the district's 4,300 teachers in 12 elementary and  
three middle schools would volunteer for the pilot program. 
Teachers who want to volunteer must get the support of their 
principal and 85 percent of the other teachers in their school. 
</P>
<P>
	The volunteers would be divided into three groups, which would  
measure student performance differently. One would use students' 
scores of the Iowa Test of Basic Skills. Another would use scores 
on a standardized test created in the district. The third would 
somehow test how much students improve after their teachers have 
taken classes to enhance their skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past year, Denver schools reported higher test scores  
among white students. But minority scores lag behind, and the 
67,000-student district is under pressure from the federal 
government to reduce the gap between whites and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Last spring, five of 11 grades failed to meet the reading  
average on the Iowa Tests. Five years ago, not one grade level was 
above the average.

<HEADLINE> Sale of Angels, Mighty Ducks Near </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Billionaire Henry Nicholas III and a  
small group of investors reportedly are close to signing a letter 
of intent to buy the Anaheim Angels and Mighty Ducks from the Walt 
Disney Co. for between $400 million-$500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orange County Register, citing unidentified sources,  
reported today that the investment group is headed by Nicholas, 
president and chief executive officer of the Irvine-based 
semiconductor group Broadcom Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources said the group is made up of fewer than six people,  
and includes Marvin Winkler, chairman of Irvine-based surfwear 
company Gotcha International, and Henry Samueli, Broadcom's vice 
president of research and development and chief technical officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas and Winkler did not return a phone call placed before  
business hours today from The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are declining comment,'' Chris Castro, a spokeswoman for  
Disney, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the Nicholas, Winkler and Samueli already  
have invested together in several ventures, including the Gotcha 
Glacier indoor snowboard and sports park, planned next to Edison 
International Field, where the Angels play in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	Any deal involving the Angels would need the approval of Major  
League Baseball. Michael Eisner, Disney chairman and chief 
executive officer, was in Orange County during Labor Day weekend to 
meet with investors, the paper said. The sources said Disney has 
asked the league for permission to share the Angels' financial 
information with the investors' group. 
</P>
<P>
	The ownership committee does a background check before a  
potential owner can take a look at the books. More extensive checks 
could be in order if both sides are ready to confirm a deal -- a 
process that could reportedly take months or even years. 
</P>
<P>
	The report is the latest development in the ongoing speculation  
of the sale of the two professional teams to Nicholas. Last month, 
ESPN.com reported that Disney had ``completed the parameters of a 
deal'' to sell baseball's Angels and hockey's Ducks to Nicholas. 
ESPN.com is the online information unit of cable broadcaster ESPN, 
which is owned by Disney. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides declined comment on that report.  
</P>
<P>
	The deal at that time was reported to be worth about $650  
million -- an amount well above industry estimates of the team's 
value. While industry analysts have valued the Angels-Ducks deal at 
$375 million to $425 million, the ESPN.com report said Nicholas 
``stepped up and closed the deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disney bought the Angels for $140 million three years ago. The  
company also paid a $50 million franchise fee for the hockey team. 
However, both teams have not been financial windfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Winkler would not comment on the reported deal to the Orange  
County Register, but said he was ``thrilled'' with the idea of 
working with a new Angels owner to develop a retail and 
entertainment area next to Edison Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it would benefit Anaheim if you could create a  
sports village that would encompass the whole area,'' Winkler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The village could include the field, the Arrowhead Pond -- the  
arena where the Ducks play -- and Gotcha Glacier, he said.

<HEADLINE> Corn Lower, Wheat, Soybeans Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat and soybean futures prices rose in trading  
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade while corn futures fell in 
reaction to a bearish crop production report. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures closed lower after the U.S. Department of  
Agriculture pegged corn output slightly above analysts' 
expectations. The U.S.D.A. estimated corn output at 9.381 billion 
bushels. 
</P>
<P>
	The harvest is moving ahead and market participants see prices  
lower for the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just could not get any positiveness in corn today,'' said  
Don Roose, president of Iowa based-U.S. Commodities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans and wheat fell in early trading in sympathy with corn,  
but later turned to the positive side. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans received support from the government's 80  
million-bushel cut to U.S. new-crop carryout, and also a late rally 
in soyoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat benefitted from stronger-than-expected weekly export  
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.D.A. report in soybeans and wheat was largely neutral.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 3 1/4 cent to $2.88 1/2 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1 1/4 cents to $2.17 3/4 cents a bushel; December oats 
fell 1/4 cent to $1.16 a bushel; November soybeans rose 8 1/2 cents to 
$5.15 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures were higher Friday on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while pork futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle rose 1.10 cent to 68.07 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle rose 1.38 cent to 80.35 cents a pound; 
October lean hogs fell .08 cent to 43.22 cents a pound; February 
pork bellies rose 1.32 cent to 54.42 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE>  Catfish Hunter Dies at 53 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter, the country boy whose pitching arm  
lifted him into baseball's Hall of Fame while he kept his feet 
planted firmly in the farmland of eastern North Carolina, is dead 
of Lou Gehrig's disease at age 53. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter died Thursday at his home in Hertford, surrounded by  
family and friends, of the same muscle-wasting disease that claimed 
Gehrig, another baseball great. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter died just days after being released from Pitt County  
Memorial Hospital in Greenville, where he was taken after hitting 
his head on concrete steps at his home on Aug. 8. He was 
unconscious for several days, but improved enough to be sent home 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter was one of baseball's most dominant pitchers during a  
15-year career with the Oakland Athletics and New York Yankees. He 
strung together five straight 20-victory seasons, pitched a perfect 
game, won a Cy Young Award and five World Series rings. 
</P>
<P>
	He also became the first multimillionaire player when he was  
declared a free agent on a technicality after the 1974 season, then 
led the Yankees to their first pennant in 12 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was probably the first player who broke it open for other  
players to be paid what they're worth,'' Hunter said in 1987 after 
he was elected to the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	While achieving fame and fortune, however, he always remained  
true to his North Carolina roots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jimmy was what you call `country boy makes good, but remains  
country boy,''' said Gil Underwood, who taught and coached Hunter 
at Perquimans County High School. ``His fame or his money or 
anything of that nature didn't change him at all. He still loved 
the simple things: hunting, his dogs, being outside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter was a player's player, a fierce competitor on the field,  
but a prankster who loved to have fun with teammates after the 
game. He grew a mustache and wore his hair long like them in the 
fashion of the late '60s and early '70s, but he retained his 
farmboy values and spun stories with a country drawl. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1998, Hunter learned he had amyothropic lateral  
sclerosis (ALS), a neurological disease that attacks nerves in the 
spinal cord and brain that control muscle movement, causing 
progressive paralysis and leading to death. There is no cure for 
the condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter also had diabetes and required insulin injections three  
times a day since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter first noticed the neurological condition in the winter of  
1997-98 when he was hunting near his farm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't lift my shotgun with my right hand,'' he said. ``It  
was a little bit cool that day, and I thought there was something 
wrong with me that would go away. But it just kept getting worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors put Hunter on a drug regimen to slow the disease, but it  
progressed quickly, leaving the once strong-armed pitcher unable to 
function without help. He talked of how Helen, his high school 
sweetheart and wife of more than 30 years, helped him through each 
day, dressing him and cutting his food. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once in a while,'' he said, ``we sit there and cry together.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Athletics found Hunter in Hertford, where he had led  
Perquimans County to a state championship and developed a 
reputation as a fearsome, fastball-hurling presence on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember a lot of times, you'd see guys come to the plate,  
and he was so overpowering their legs would be shaking,'' said 
Francis Combs, who caught for Hunter from eighth grade through high 
school. ``He was so intimidating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Against Plymouth, he struck out 27 batters in 13 innings,''  
Combs recalled. ``And he was just a sophomore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A's owner Charles O. Finley, intent on promoting his players to  
the hilt, pinned the nickname ``Catfish'' on Hunter. To friends and 
family, however, he remained Jim. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter came up with the A's in 1965 and punctuated the team's  
move to Oakland in 1968 with a perfect game against the Minnesota 
Twins. At the time, it was only the seventh perfect game in modern 
baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting in 1971, he strung together five straight 20-victory  
seasons, winning the AL Cy Young Award in 1974. After that season, 
he was declared a free agent by arbitrator Peter Seitz because 
Finley failed to make payments on an annuity that was part of his 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, with baseball's reserve clause still in place, it  
was unprecedented to have a star of Hunter's magnitude available on 
the open market. That autumn, major league club executives trudged 
into Hertford to recruit Hunter, who was more interested in going 
out to hunt than talking contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Hunter agreed to a $3.75 million, five-year deal with  
the Yankees that made him the highest-paid player in baseball 
history at the time and set the stage for full-scale free agency, 
which began after the 1976 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter finished his career with the Yankees in 1979. He returned  
to his hometown and his farm and was elected to the Hall of Fame in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would trade all of that for good health,'' Hunter said after  
he knew he had ALS. ``I'd be a groundskeeper and not let anybody 
know me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A graveside service will be held at 3 p.m. Sunday at Cedar Wood  
Cemetery in Hertford, behind the ballfield where Hunter played in 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter is survived by his wife, daughter Kim, sons Todd and  
Paul, grandson Taylor, three sisters and three brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Memorial gifts can be made to the Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter ALS  
Foundation, P.O. Box 47 Hertford, NC, 27944, or the Perquimans 
County Rescue Squad, P.O. Box 191, Hertford, NC, 27944.

<HEADLINE> Stanley Krubrick Honored in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Stanley Kubrick has been posthumously honored with  
a lifetime achievement award by the Directors Guild of Great 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Christiane Kubrick, his widow, and his daughter Anya accepted  
the award at the London ceremony Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did not relish the attention of those who thought he was  
something special,'' Kubrick's daughter told the gathering, which 
included actor Peter Ustinov and director Alan Parker. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he had to say he did most carefully in his films.''  
</P>
<P>
	Kubrick died in March at the age of 70. His death came only days  
after he finished work on ``Eyes Wide Shut'' starring Tom Cruise 
and Nicole Kidman. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his first film since ``Full Metal Jacket'' in 1987.  
</P>
<P>
	Kubrick's film credits included ``Dr. Strangelove,'' ``A  
Clockwork Orange'' and ``2001: A Space Odyssey.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Throw Money to Campaigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to attacks on trial lawyers, the  
Dallas law firm of Baron &AMP; Budd contributed $150,750 during the 
first six months of the year -- 14 times more than during the same 
period of the last presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm isn't alone. Upset over proposals in Congress to limit  
lawsuits and restrict how much their clients can collect, trial 
lawyers across the country have nearly doubled their campaign 
contributions this year. Democrats have been the overwhelming 
beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	With GOP lawmakers still pushing liability limits and the GOP  
presidential front-runner, George W. Bush, an advocate of such 
lawsuit caps, the trend is likely to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The number of attorneys who have become involved in the  
political process has broadened greatly and will be larger during 
this cycle than in any previous cycle, because of the vicious 
attacks that have been made on the civil justice system,'' said 
Fred Baron, a partner in Baron &AMP; Budd. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Republicans traditionally outraise their Democratic  
counterparts, GOP strategists increasingly worry about trial 
lawyers becoming a financial force on par with unions, which 
historically have been the Democrats' biggest backers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have that much money coming in, it obviously creates  
a major problem,'' Republican consultant Eddie Mahe said. 
</P>
<P>
	A computer analysis of contributions during the first six months  
of 1999 shows trial lawyers gave $4.1 million, with $3.7 million, 
or 90 percent, going to Democratic committees and candidates. 
During the first six months of 1995, the last presidential election 
season, trial lawyers contributed $2.2 million, with $1.7 million, 
or 77 percent, going to Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The increased giving is evident everywhere. From January through  
June, the Association of Trial Lawyers Political Action Committee 
contributed $959,000 to federal candidates -- more than three times 
the $277,100 it gave during the same period in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties see the 2000 election as critical, with the White  
House up for grabs and Democrats needing to pick up just five seats 
to wrest control of the House from Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP-leaning business groups are planning ways to counter the  
lawyers' efforts, including contributions of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``The business community is going to have to respond to the new  
threat posed by the trial bar,'' said Jim Wootton, executive 
director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Institute for Legal 
Reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican officials said they will make the lawyers a campaign  
issue, perhaps using advertising to tie lawyers to the Democratic 
Party in voters' minds. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the people who are making health care unaffordable,  
who are wreaking havoc with our courts, and who are making life 
impossible for everybody from dentists and doctors to small 
business people and schoolteachers.'' said Mike Collins, a 
Republican National Committee spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican strategists believe it could be a winning issue. A  
January Harris poll found that only 10 percent of respondents had a 
``great deal of confidence'' in law firms, compared with 23 percent 
for major companies and 30 percent for Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Trial lawyers say they -- and their clients -- are unfairly under  
attack on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody who lost his legs in a tragedy is not in a position  
to compete with corporate America,'' said trial lawyer Stanley 
Chesley, whose Cincinnati law firm is a big giver to Democrats. 
``There has got to be somebody there for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Congress passed legislation designed to cap  
damages and otherwise curb lawsuits from the Year 2000 computer 
bug. And Congress has tried unsuccessfully to restrict product 
liability lawsuits, including limiting punitive damages for small 
businesses. President Clinton, himself a lawyer, vetoed a 
Republican-backed bill with such limits in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The race for the White House also is drawing attention from the  
legal community. Bush has boasted that he enacted lawsuit limits in 
Texas, ``despite strong opposition from the state's powerful 
personal injury trial lawyers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Articles in legal publications have alerted lawyers to the  
threat. In addition, members of some law firms are urging their 
colleagues to join the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to urge our whole law firm to be active in the  
political scene,'' said Joseph Rice of the South Carolina firm of 
Ness, Motley, Loadholt, Richardson &AMP; Poole, which increased its 
contributions to $303,000 during the first six months of 1999 as 
compared to $248,650 during all of 1995-96. ``Apathy doesn't help 
anybody.''

	U.S. Cuts Indonesia Military Ties  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Indonesia has been clear in refusing outside  
help to ``stop this madness'' in East Timor -- a signal, perhaps, 
that some in the government support a violent takeover there, 
President Clinton said. ``They have been very clear. They do not 
want to ask for international assistance,'' Clinton said Thursday 
as he prepared to leave Washington for a week of economic and 
political summitry in New Zealand -- not far from Indonesia. Militia 
gangs opposed to independence in East Timor ransacked the capital, 
Dili, this week and have forced thousands to flee their homes. The 
violence followed a vote Monday in which East Timorese chose to 
split from Indonesia, which annexed the former Portuguese colony 
nearly 25 years ago. Clinton suspended relations with Indonesia's 
military Thursday and threatened to suspend economic assistance to 
Indonesia if it continues to resist East Timor's ``clear, 
unambiguous'' desire for independence.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- North Korea is preparing to flight-test a  
ballistic missile ``at any time'' that could be developed into an 
intercontinental-range weapon capable of striking U.S. territory, 
the CIA says. A report released by the CIA on Thursday also said 
Iran probably will develop ICBMs over the next 15 years and that 
Iraq poses an additional -- though somewhat more distant -- ballistic 
missile threat. The report characterized the prospect of North 
Korea acquiring a long-range missile by 2015 as ``most likely,'' 
Iran's prospect was judged to be ``probable'' and Iraq was labeled 
a ``possible'' threat.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole's most visible senior adviser  
is resigning at a critical point in her Republican presidential 
campaign, saying opportunities in the private sector are too good 
to pass up. ``You get to a point in your career when the prospect 
of less hours and more money is appealing,'' communications 
director Ari Fleischer said in a telephone interview Thursday. The 
campaign had planned to announce the change Friday, but Fleischer 
confirmed his departure after being contacted by The Associated 
Press and told that sources said he was leaving. He is the second 
top aide to depart the campaign. Consultant Kieran Mahoney left in 
May, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family. Officials 
close to the situation said Mahoney was not satisfied with his role 
in the campaign.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government and Microsoft Corp. will have  
the opportunity Friday to rebut each other's courtroom arguments in 
the final exchange of legal filings before the judge's initial 
ruling in a sweeping antitrust case. The two sides were under 
orders from U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to present 
by day's end their final written versions of the facts of the case. 
The filings could approach 1,000 pages for each side. The filings 
also give them opportunity to rebut each other's arguments in the 
last batch of court papers submitted to the judge a few weeks ago. 
Lawyers will appear in court for a single day's closing arguments 
in less than two weeks, before the first phase of the judge's

homer to lead the New York Mets over Los Angeles 3-1 Thursday 
night. Hershiser outdueled Kevin Brown as the Mets trimmed 
Atlanta's NL East lead to three games and maintained a 3 1/2-game lead 
over Cincinnati in the wild-card race.

<HEADLINE>  Catfish Hunter Dies at 53 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter, the country boy whose pitching arm  
lifted him into baseball's Hall of Fame while he kept his feet 
planted firmly in the farmland of eastern North Carolina, is dead 
of Lou Gehrig's disease at age 53. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter died Thursday at his home in Hertford, surrounded by  
family and friends, of the same muscle-wasting disease that claimed 
Gehrig, another baseball great. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter died just days after being released from Pitt County  
Memorial Hospital in Greenville, where he was taken after hitting 
his head on concrete steps at his home on Aug. 8. He was 
unconscious for several days, but improved enough to be sent home 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter was one of baseball's most dominant pitchers during a  
15-year career with the Oakland Athletics and New York Yankees. He 
strung together five straight 20-victory seasons, pitched a perfect 
game, won a Cy Young Award and five World Series rings. 
</P>
<P>
	He also became the first multimillionaire player when he was  
declared a free agent on a technicality after the 1974 season, then 
led the Yankees to their first pennant in 12 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was probably the first player who broke it open for other  
players to be paid what they're worth,'' Hunter said in 1987 after 
he was elected to the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	While achieving fame and fortune, however, he always remained  
true to his North Carolina roots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jimmy was what you call `country boy makes good, but remains  
country boy,''' said Gil Underwood, who taught and coached Hunter 
at Perquimans County High School. ``His fame or his money or 
anything of that nature didn't change him at all. He still loved 
the simple things: hunting, his dogs, being outside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter was a player's player, a fierce competitor on the field,  
but a prankster who loved to have fun with teammates after the 
game. He grew a mustache and wore his hair long like them in the 
fashion of the late '60s and early '70s, but he retained his 
farmboy values and spun stories with a country drawl. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1998, Hunter learned he had amyothropic lateral  
sclerosis (ALS), a neurological disease that attacks nerves in the 
spinal cord and brain that control muscle movement, causing 
progressive paralysis and leading to death. There is no cure for 
the condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter also had diabetes and required insulin injections three  
times a day since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter first noticed the neurological condition in the winter of  
1997-98 when he was hunting near his farm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't lift my shotgun with my right hand,'' he said. ``It  
was a little bit cool that day, and I thought there was something 
wrong with me that would go away. But it just kept getting worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors put Hunter on a drug regimen to slow the disease, but it  
progressed quickly, leaving the once strong-armed pitcher unable to 
function without help. He talked of how Helen, his high school 
sweetheart and wife of more than 30 years, helped him through each 
day, dressing him and cutting his food. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once in a while,'' he said, ``we sit there and cry together.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Athletics found Hunter in Hertford, where he had led  
Perquimans County to a state championship and developed a 
reputation as a fearsome, fastball-hurling presence on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember a lot of times, you'd see guys come to the plate,  
and he was so overpowering their legs would be shaking,'' said 
Francis Combs, who caught for Hunter from eighth grade through high 
school. ``He was so intimidating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Against Plymouth, he struck out 27 batters in 13 innings,''  
Combs recalled. ``And he was just a sophomore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A's owner Charles O. Finley, intent on promoting his players to  
the hilt, pinned the nickname ``Catfish'' on Hunter. To friends and 
family, however, he remained Jim. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter came up with the A's in 1965 and punctuated the team's  
move to Oakland in 1968 with a perfect game against the Minnesota 
Twins. At the time, it was only the seventh perfect game in modern 
baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting in 1971, he strung together five straight 20-victory  
seasons, winning the AL Cy Young Award in 1974. After that season, 
he was declared a free agent by arbitrator Peter Seitz because 
Finley failed to make payments on an annuity that was part of his 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, with baseball's reserve clause still in place, it  
was unprecedented to have a star of Hunter's magnitude available on 
the open market. That autumn, major league club executives trudged 
into Hertford to recruit Hunter, who was more interested in going 
out to hunt than talking contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Hunter agreed to a $3.75 million, five-year deal with  
the Yankees that made him the highest-paid player in baseball 
history at the time and set the stage for full-scale free agency, 
which began after the 1976 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter finished his career with the Yankees in 1979. He returned  
to his hometown and his farm and was elected to the Hall of Fame in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would trade all of that for good health,'' Hunter said after  
he knew he had ALS. ``I'd be a groundskeeper and not let anybody 
know me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A graveside service will be held at 3 p.m. Sunday at Cedar Wood  
Cemetery in Hertford, behind the ballfield where Hunter played in 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter is survived by his wife, daughter Kim, sons Todd and  
Paul, grandson Taylor, three sisters and three brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Memorial gifts can be made to the Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter ALS  
Foundation, P.O. Box 47 Hertford, NC, 27944, or the Perquimans 
County Rescue Squad, P.O. Box 191, Hertford, NC, 27944.

<HEADLINE> Journey Ends for India Doubles Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lifted by a song from space, Mahesh Bhupathi and  
Leander Paes have completed their own Grand Slam journey. 
</P>
<P>
	India has a rich tennis tradition and many star players,  
including Ramanathan Krishnan and his son, Ramesh, and the Amritraj 
brothers: Vijay, Anand and Ashok. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Bhupathi and Paes, however, the Jewel of the Orient never  
had a Grand Slam tournament champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've proven to India that we can produce champions, even  
though it's only in doubles,'' Paes said, referring to their titles 
this year at the French Open and Wimbledon. ``We've proven to India 
that we can achieve levels and heights of this magnitude if you're 
willing to work hard enough and put things together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The run of Grand Slam titles ended Friday when they lost 7-6  
(9-7), 6-4 to Sebastien Lareau of Canada and American Alex O'Brien. 
Still, the pair became the first team to reach the men's doubles 
title match in all four major events. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was something I wanted to set as a record,'' said the  
26-year-old Paes, who won the Wimbledon junior boys title and was 
ranked No. 2 in the world as a junior. ``Being Indian, I wanted to 
set that trademark, doing it with another fellow Indian, getting to 
four Grand Slam finals, even maybe winning a Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that point in time when I thought about it, I thought it  
was a little farfetched goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The goal became reality -- with a little help from the stands --  
and from space. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing a third-round match against Americans Justin Gimelstob  
and Richey Reneberg, the Indian duo lost the first set before 
leveling the match. Then, from the stands wafted a song. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sare jahaan se achha Hindustan harnara.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bhupathi and Paes heard it and responded.  
</P>
<P>
	``We looked at each other, the song was chanting in the  
background. I had goose bumps on my arms,'' Paes said. ``We made 
eye contact and knew we had to get it going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The duo rallied for a 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 victory.  
</P>
<P>
	``The song is not our national anthem,'' Paes said, ``but it's  
like our folk song. ... Basically what it says, `In the whole 
world, we are the best.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1983, India's first astronaut, Rakesh Sharma, was asked how  
does India look from space. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sare jahaan se achha Hindustan harnara,'' Sharma responded.  
</P>
<P>
	Bhupathi and Paes have accomplished that.  
</P>
<P>
	Until the terrific tandem came along, the best an Indian player  
had done in a Grand Slam was two semifinal appearances at Wimbledon 
by Ramanathan Krishnan. Vijay Amritraj and Ramesh Krishnan reached 
the quarterfinals of both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	After his stellar junior career, Paes faltered as a  
professional, languishing in the 100-plus rankings in singles. 
Then, in 1995, along came Bhupathi. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first two years, they played good doubles, but not world  
class. Then suddenly their game clicked and they began winning 
matches and titles. Paes, the more athletic of the two, is a super 
volleyer. Bhupathi, at 6-foot-1 the taller of the two, has a huge 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
	The breakthrough came in 1997 when Bhupathi teamed with Rika  
Hiraki of Japan to win the French Open mixed doubles title. It was 
the first Grand Slam tournament crown for a player from India. 
</P>
<P>
	Bhupathi did the same here at the USTA National Tennis Center  
earlier this week when he captured the title with another Japanese 
partner, Ai Sugiyama. 
</P>
<P>
	Paes has kept pace, winning the mixed doubles at Wimbledon with  
American Lisa Raymond. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Bhupathi, 25, and Paes won six titles, but in Grand  
Slam tournament could only reach the semifinals at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, they began by reaching the Australian Open final  
before losing to Jonas Bjorkman and Patrick Rafter. But by forcing 
the winners to a fifth set, the ``Indian Express'' and their 
growing band of Indian followers felt a Grand Slam title was within 
their reach. 
</P>
<P>
	The wait was only until the next major tournament, when they  
beat Goran Ivanisevic and Jeff Tarango in the final. At Wimbledon, 
the downed Paul Haarhuis and Jared Palmer in the title match. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are quite a few things that go into our doubles,'' Paes  
said. ``But if there was one single-most quality I'd have to pull 
out, is that when we play together, we play with heart.''

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rican Nationalists Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Puerto Rican nationalists granted clemency by President  
Clinton began leaving prison today, including one who drove out of 
an Indiana prison in a gold Mercedes, ending a 90-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm elated that I'm free, here with my family,'' Ricardo  
Jimenez told reporters as he left the prison south of Terre Haute, 
Ind. His sister was among two other people in the car. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez, who lived in Chicago before his arrest, has said he  
wants to return to Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Dunne, a spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, said 11  
of the 16 people offered clemency by Clinton were being released 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Alejandrina Torres was released from the federal prison at  
Danbury, Conn., at midmorning, while Edwin Cortes left the federal 
penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pa., early this afternoon, the bureau of 
prisons said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough sometimes. It was tough for me. It was tough for  
him. It was tough for my kids. But we made it,'' Cortes' wife, 
Alva, said as she waited outside for him. 
</P>
<P>
	He planned to leave for Puerto Rico this afternoon, his family  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The original prison sentences ranged from 35 years to 90 years.  
</P>
<P>
	Most of those eligible for clemency were members of the  
ultranationalist FALN, responsible for some 130 bombings in the 
late 1970s and early 1980s that left six dead and scores wounded. 
FALN is the initials of Spanish for Armed Forces of National 
Liberation. 
</P>
<P>
	None of those offered clemency was directly responsible for  
deaths or injuries, and they were required to renounce violence as 
a condition for accepting clemency, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton's offer stirred controversy among victims of FALN  
violence and complicated his wife's potential bid for the Senate 
from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, talking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White  
House, said Thursday that politics played no role in his offer. He 
said his decision was influenced by several leaders, including 
South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu and former President Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he didn't discuss the matter with first lady  
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who hopes that her opposition to that 
clemency won't damage her likely bid for a Senate seat from New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't discussed other clemency issues with her and I  
didn't think I should discuss this one,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some law enforcement officials and Republicans say Clinton made  
the clemency offer to curry favor for Mrs. Clinton among New York's 
1.3 million Puerto Ricans. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he doesn't believe his wife has flip-flopped on  
this issue, and it is up to New York voters to ``evaluate that as 
they please.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For her part, Mrs. Clinton -- who was in New York City --  
reiterated her opposition and said she understood ``the really 
strong feelings that my friends in the Puerto Rican community have 
on this issue.'' She appealed to them to understand her decision as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope by the time this election comes around in 14 or so  
months -- assuming that I'm on the ballot -- that I will have the 
support of as many New Yorkers as I can possibly reach,'' including 
``elected representatives of the Puerto Rican community,'' she told 
reporters outside a Queens junior high school where she was 
principal for a day last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., a native of Puerto Rico, said  
Mrs. Clinton now has a serious credibility problem, and he is not 
interested in endorsing her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still upset. I'm still hurt. I'm still angry and I've  
heard nothing to change my mind,'' Serrano said. ``If that campaign 
can be so insensitive to something that means so much to Puerto 
Ricans, how sensitive can they be to issues that affect blacks in 
my community? That affect Dominicans in my community? That affect 
Mexicans moving into my community?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House of Representatives condemned the clemency offer on a  
311-41 vote that was little more than a symbolic gesture, since 
Clinton holds exclusive power over clemency. But in a rebuke, 93 
Democrats crossed party lines to side with Republicans pushing the 
resolution.

<HEADLINE> Pats To Discipline Rutledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATTLEBORO, Mass. (AP) -- New England tight end Rod Rutledge faces  
criminal charges of leaving the scene of an accident, operating to 
endanger and speeding after an early morning crash Friday on 
Interstate 95, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutledge, 24, suffered minor injuries in the accident that  
occurred around 12:30 a.m., state police spokesman Lt. Paul Maloney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutledge was driving in the center lane of I-95 northbound when  
he attempted to pass a car on the right while speeding, police 
said. He lost control of his car, skidded off the highway and 
crashed into two tractor-trailers parked in a rest area, Maloney 
said. The trucks' drivers were sleeping at the time and were not 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	After the accident, a second car apparently traveling with  
Rutledge pulled into the rest area, picked up Rutledge and left the 
scene, Maloney said. The Patriots identified the driver of the 
second car as Ben Coates, also a New England tight end. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutledge, a backup in his second year with the Patriots,  
surrendered at the state police barracks in Foxboro at 3:30 a.m., 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to print and broadcast reports, the players were  
returning from a club in Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots said Rutledge would face internal disciplinary  
measures, but didn't elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Team officials have met with Rutledge to discuss the matter,  
which is considered conduct detrimental to the team, and expressed 
their disappointment with behavior which endangered him and 
others,'' the team said in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
	Patriots spokesman Stacey James declined to say whether the team  
will discipline Coates. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players would be permitted to play in Sunday's game against  
the Jets, James said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutledge will be summoned to Attleboro District Court at a later  
date, Maloney said.

<HEADLINE> Churchill Downs Gets Hollywood Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Churchill Downs said Friday it has  
completed the deal to add Hollywood Park to its stable of race 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	The $140 million transaction included the southern California  
track along with Hollywood Park Casino and about 240 acres at the 
track. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Churchill Downs granted Hollywood Park Inc.  
a 10-year lease on the casino, a California card club, at a $3 
million annual lease rate with one 10-year renewal optional. 
</P>
<P>
	``The completion of the Hollywood Park race track purchase is a  
milestone for our company,'' said Thomas H. Meeker, Churchill Downs 
president and chief executive officer. ``We are excited to now be a 
part of the excellent West Coast racing circuit and to begin 
integration of this historic race track into our existing 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The addition of Hollywood Park's simulcast program will be  
essential to our efforts as we continue to build a comprehensive 
simulcast network.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase of the track in Inglewood, Calif., announced in  
May, followed Churchill's purchase of Calder Racecourse in Miami 
for $86 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Churchill Downs also has racing and simulcast wagering  
operations at Ellis Park in Henderson, Ky., and Hoosier Park in 
Anderson, Ind., as well as a minority interest in Kentucky Downs in 
Franklin. It also holds interests in various other racing services 
companies. Churchill Downs, home of the Kentucky Derby, is the 
company's flagship operation.

<HEADLINE> Student Sues School Over Photo Flap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDLAND, Texas (AP) -- Casey Riggan knew that he and his friends  
had a keeper when they photographed the principal's car parked in 
front of the home of an attractive high school teacher on a 
Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	But the teen-ager never imagined that school officials would bar  
him from attending his graduation last spring once word about the 
picture got around town and rumors circulated about the married 
principal's love life. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Riggan, 18, is suing the school district in federal court,  
accusing it of violating his right to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The photo shows only the car, and no people.  
</P>
<P>
	Riggan's mother said Midland High principal Neil Richmond and  
the school board trampled on her son's rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``My personal opinion is that they needed a scapegoat to blame  
because word got out about the principal's affair,'' Gail Riggan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This picture was never even taken to school and wasn't taken  
on school property or during school hours. They have absolutely no 
right under the law to say he can't photograph a car in front of a 
house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The principal said Riggan was disciplined for being  
disrespectful toward an adult by fostering rumors. Richmond did not 
address the rumors of an affair and declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	Riggan said he didn't even snap the picture in question that  
afternoon in January -- a friend in the car took the photo. Riggan 
said he just kept the picture in his closet. 
</P>
<P>
	But the boys did talk about the photo. In Midland -- population  
117,034 -- that talk quickly evolved from classroom snickering into 
watercooler gossip. 
</P>
<P>
	When Riggan refused to write the apology that Richmond  
requested, Riggan was suspended for three days and placed in a 
school for students with behavior problems. He was also not allowed 
to attend his graduation ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-five students wrote letters to the school board saying  
that folks all over town were already gabbing about the principal's 
relationship with the female teacher even before the picture was 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Riggan said he believes the student who took the photo was not  
suspended because he was a star on the baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Royal Ferguson is expected to decide this  
month whether the lawsuit warrants a trial.

<HEADLINE>  Puerto Rican Nationalists Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Eleven Puerto Rican nationalists granted clemency by President  
Clinton were freed from prison Friday amid a political furor over 
their release, and most were headed for Puerto Rico for a big 
welcome home. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricardo Jimenez left the federal penitentiary near Terre Haute,  
Ind., in style, riding through the gates in a gold Mercedes-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm elated that I'm free, here with my family,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma City, Elizam Escobar walked through Will Rogers  
World Airport on a journey toward a new phase in his life after 
spending 19 years in an El Reno prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-year-old painter and former art teacher expressed regret  
for the bombings, but said before boarding his flight that ``with 
all conflicts, there are people who get injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``As part of the independence movement, we have sustained many  
casualties over the years. I don't like violence. Nobody likes it 
when people get hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the nationalists were members of FALN, the Puerto Rican  
independence group responsible for 130 bombings in the late 1970s 
and early 1980s that left six people dead and scores wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	They were serving sentences of up to 90 years in prisons from  
California to Connecticut on charges of seditious conspiracy and 
possession of weapons and explosives. 
</P>
<P>
	FALN was responsible for a series of bomb attacks and bank  
robberies in the New York and Chicago areas from 1974 to 1983 that 
killed six people and injured dozens. 
</P>
<P>
	None of those offered clemency was directly responsible for  
deaths or injuries, and they were required to renounce violence and 
stay away from each other as a condition for receiving clemency. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's offer outraged law enforcement officials and victims  
of FALN violence, and complicated his wife's bid to win a Senate 
seat from New York, which has a large Puerto Rican population. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the U.S. House condemned the clemency offer on a  
311-41 vote that was little more than symbolic, since Clinton holds 
exclusive power over clemency. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwin Cortes, 44, left the federal penitentiary in Lewisburg,  
Pa., Friday afternoon, and arrived in San Juan shortly before 11 
p.m. EDT. He had been behind bars for 16 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200 people greeted him, whistling, yelling, banging on  
leather ``pandereta'' drums and simply screaming. They waved Puerto 
Rican flags and posters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're delighted and content to receive our sons, sons of our  
nation who have sacrificed and given so much,'' said Lolita Lebron, 
a nationalist jailed 25 years for the 1954 shooting up of Congress 
before being pardoned by former President Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight others who received clemency hoped to reach Puerto Rico  
sometime Saturday, while two others were going to their families in 
the Chicago area. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said his offer was not intended to help his wife's  
campaign for the Senate. He said his decision was influenced by 
several leaders, including South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu 
and former President Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton ended up opposing the clemency offer, saying the  
FALN members took too long to decide whether to renounce violence. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Friday, she said she may have been hasty in making that  
decision. ``I have a number of Hispanic advisers and ... I have to 
admit that the consultation process was not what it should have 
been,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton offered clemency to 16 nationalists in all. U.S. Bureau  
of Prisons spokesman Dan Dunne said two of them received a 
reduction in their sentences instead of immediate release, two were 
already out of prison before Friday, and one had not yet signed the 
clemency offer and remained in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunne said all nine who said they wanted to live in Puerto Rico  
were given permission by the Federal Parole Commission. Without it, 
they would have been forced to return to the cities where they 
lived at the time of their arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	The prisoners' spokesman in San Juan, Luis Nieves Falcon, and  
the prisoners' families said they planned a huge party to celebrate 
the return -- or even nine huge parties, because under the parole 
conditions they cannot associate with convicted felons, including 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rican leaders welcomed the releases but remained angry  
about Mrs. Clinton's stance. Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., a native of 
Puerto Rico, said he was not interested in endorsing her now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still upset. I'm still hurt. I'm still angry and I've  
heard nothing to change my mind,'' Serrano said. He said Mrs. 
Clinton's campaign was ``insensitive to something that means so 
much to Puerto Ricans.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Woman Sentenced To Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VISTA, Calif. (AP) -- A woman who shot her four sons to death and  
blamed it on drugs, alcohol and bad relationships with men was 
sentenced Thursday to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Eubanks showed no emotion when jurors issued their  
decision following two days of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Joan Weber can choose ignore the jury and  
sentence Ms. Eubanks to life in prison at a sentencing hearing 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a terrible thing to have to condemn someone, but in the  
end, she condemned herself every time she pulled the trigger,'' 
juror Debra Goodwin said outside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Eubanks, 35, killed the four boys, ages 4 to 14, in October  
1997 because she was apparently despondent over her broken 
relationships with men. She was separated from her second husband, 
Eric Eubanks, and she had broken up with her boyfriend that day. 
</P>
<P>
	The unemployed nursing assistant wrote five suicide notes before  
the killings. One to Eubanks stated: ``You betrayed me. I've lost 
everybody I've loved. Now, it's time for you to do the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She shot all the boys in the head, two of them twice, and  
stopped once to reload the .38-caliber handgun. 
</P>
<P>
	She killed the oldest boy, Brandon, while he was watching  
television. The other boys -- Austin 7, Brigham, 6, and Matthew, 4 -- 
were shot in a bedroom, where they were sitting on their bunk beds 
playing a video game with their 5-year-old cousin. He was not 
harmed. 
</P>
<P>
	She then shot herself in the stomach.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys contended Ms. Eubanks killed the children in a  
moment of weakness culminating several years of addiction to 
prescription drugs for work injuries and her failed relationships 
with men. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 544 people on California's death row; 10 are women.  
Only three women have been executed nationwide since 1976. The last 
woman put to death in California was in 1962.

<HEADLINE> Comic Rip Taylor Robbed of $5,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Rip Taylor's been ripped off, and it's no  
laughing matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The comedian, who has performed here with headliners such as  
Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr., was robbed of $5,000 and nearly 
two dozen credit cards Thursday while waiting for a ride. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, 69, said one man distracted him while another grabbed a  
compact disc case containing his wallet and jewelry. He said he 
carries his possessions in the case so people won't think it's a 
handbag. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sitting down and I put my bag next to me, because I'm  
always cautious,'' he said. ``And this little man walked by and he 
said, `Look down there, there's a credit card.' I looked down and 
saw one of those Mexican phone cards. I said, `It's not mine.' And 
the bag was gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No immediate arrests were made.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been so careful,'' Taylor said. ``I never thought  
Rip would get ripped off. And don't say the money's nothing. Five 
thousand dollars. That's a lot of one-liners.''

<HEADLINE> Final Microsoft Legal Filings Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government and Microsoft Corp. will have  
the opportunity today to rebut each other's courtroom arguments in 
the final exchange of legal filings before the judge's initial 
ruling in a sweeping antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides were under orders from U.S. District Judge Thomas  
Penfield Jackson to present by day's end their final written 
versions of the facts of the case. The filings could approach 1,000 
pages for each side. 
</P>
<P>
	The filings also give them opportunity to rebut each other's  
arguments in the last batch of court papers submitted to the judge 
a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers will appear in court for a single day's closing  
arguments in less than two weeks, before the first phase of the 
judge's two-part verdict. That ruling could come as early as late 
October, although the case is almost certain to wind through 
appeals courts for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson is clearly interested in moving ahead. He has denied  
requests to delay the trial and limited the number of witnesses to 
testify. Last month at a law panel, he explained he was trying ``to 
avoid the Vietnam morasses'' that other antitrust cases, such as 
the breakup of AT&AMP;T, became. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft was expected to argue in its filing that recent  
developments in the nation's high-tech industry undermine the 
government's antitrust claims. 
</P>
<P>
	A Microsoft attorney said the company will point to the  
remarkable financial success of Red Hat Inc., a leading vendor of 
the upstart Linux software operating system. Red Hat stock has 
soared from $14 on its first day trading last month to close 
Thursday at $123.25. 
</P>
<P>
	An economist who testified for the Justice Department, Franklin  
Fisher, had dismissed as ``a joke, of course'' the potential threat 
that Linux posed to the market dominance of Microsoft's Windows 
software. 
</P>
<P>
	The Microsoft lawyer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
the company will tell the judge it believes Linux to be ``real 
competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the essence of competition in this business,'' the lawyer  
said. ``You have to see the trend and react to it before it has 
market share or you'll be relegated to the history pages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department has argued that Linux has been successful  
challenging Microsoft in the sale of high-end business ``server'' 
computers, not consumer machines. 
</P>
<P>
	And Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates was quoted in earlier evidence  
in the trial as saying at a technology conference this spring that 
Linux's impact ``will be fairly limited'' and that he's never had a 
customer mention Linux to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also was expected to cite an announcement just days  
ago by rival Sun Microsystems Inc. that it has begun distributing 
free on the Internet a package of business applications meant to 
compete with Microsoft's Office software. 
</P>
<P>
	But asking Jackson to take ``judicial notice'' of the industry  
changes is an unusual legal ploy since the evidentiary record in 
the trial is officially closed. The judge can recognize these 
events but can't consider them as evidence because the government 
wasn't given the opportunity to challenge Microsoft's 
interpretation of their meaning. 
</P>
<P>
	One antitrust scholar said the recent business challenges to  
Microsoft were in part fueled by pressure exerted by the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government created an environment by which bolder moves by  
companies are going to occur,'' said William Kovacic, an antitrust 
expert at George Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kovacic described that effect as a double-edged sword for  
the government, since it appears to decrease the need for 
government action to restore competition in the high-tech industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tantalizing dilemma,'' he said. ``It reduces some of  
the urgency to intervene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the trial began last October, the sides have met formally  
three times outside the courtroom, including once in early June. 
Future talks are anticipated later this year, but outside experts 
consider a settlement unlikely.

<HEADLINE> Stanley Kubrick Honored in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Stanley Kubrick has been posthumously honored with  
a lifetime achievement award by the Directors Guild of Great 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Christiane Kubrick, his widow, and his daughter Anya accepted  
the award at the London ceremony Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did not relish the attention of those who thought he was  
something special,'' Kubrick's daughter told the gathering, which 
included actor Peter Ustinov and director Alan Parker. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he had to say he did most carefully in his films.''  
</P>
<P>
	Kubrick died in March at the age of 70. His death came only days  
after he finished work on ``Eyes Wide Shut'' starring Tom Cruise 
and Nicole Kidman. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his first film since ``Full Metal Jacket'' in 1987.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Puerto Rican Nationalists Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Eleven Puerto Rican nationalists granted clemency by President  
Clinton were freed from prison Friday amid a political furor over 
their release, and most were headed for Puerto Rico for a big 
welcome home. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricardo Jimenez left the federal penitentiary near Terre Haute,  
Ind., in style, riding through the gates in a gold Mercedes-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm elated that I'm free, here with my family,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma City, Elizam Escobar walked through Will Rogers  
World Airport on a journey toward a new phase in his life after 
spending 19 years in an El Reno prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-year-old painter and former art teacher expressed regret  
for the bombings, but said before boarding his flight that ``with 
all conflicts, there are people who get injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``As part of the independence movement, we have sustained many  
casualties over the years. I don't like violence. Nobody likes it 
when people get hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the nationalists were members of FALN, the Puerto Rican  
independence group responsible for 130 bombings in the late 1970s 
and early 1980s that left six people dead and scores wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	They were serving sentences of up to 90 years in prisons from  
California to Connecticut on charges of seditious conspiracy and 
possession of weapons and explosives. 
</P>
<P>
	FALN was responsible for a series of bomb attacks and bank  
robberies in the New York and Chicago areas from 1974 to 1983 that 
killed six people and injured dozens. 
</P>
<P>
	None of those offered clemency was directly responsible for  
deaths or injuries, and they were required to renounce violence and 
stay away from each other as a condition for receiving clemency. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's offer outraged law enforcement officials and victims  
of FALN violence, and complicated his wife's bid to win a Senate 
seat from New York, which has a large Puerto Rican population. 
</P>

	On Thursday, the U.S. House condemned the clemency offer on a  
311-41 vote that was little more than symbolic, since Clinton holds

<HEADLINE> Conservative Leader Backs Giuliani </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Calling Republican Rudolph Giuliani the  
``most electable alternative'' to Hillary Rodham Clinton, an 
influential Conservative Party leader said Friday he is backing the 
New York City mayor's expected Senate bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Rochester lawyer Thomas Cook, chairman of the Monroe County  
Conservative Party, said his group's executive committee voted 28-0 
on Thursday to endorse Giuliani for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook said the action was taken to ``send a message'' to state  
party Chairman Michael Long and other leaders of the politically 
potent third party that rank-and-file Conservatives ``dislike Mrs. 
Clinton intensely'' and think the mayor has the best chance of 
beating her in next year's Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Conservatives are repelled by Mrs. Clinton's politics and  
ethics,'' Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Monroe County leader said the endorsement was also meant to  
encourage the mayor to get into the race quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the first lady nor the mayor has formally declared a  
candidacy for the Senate seat being vacated next year by Democrat 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Both have formed exploratory committees 
and are raising money for the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton continued her campaign-like activities Friday with  
a speech in New York City to black, Hispanic and Asian women. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike most other states, New York allows major party candidates  
to accept third-party nominations and they can be crucial in 
statewide races. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, no Republican running statewide has won without  
Conservative Party backing in the more than 25 years since the 
party's founding. In 1994, then-Republican state Sen. George Pataki 
won the governorship on the strength of his Conservative Party 
vote.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise As Inflation Fears Ease / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices rose Friday on mild  
inflation news that appeared to lessen the possibility that 
interest rates would be raised again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 11/16  
point, or $6.87 1/2 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which 
moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.04 percent from 
Thursday's 6.09 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The market rose early after the Labor Department reported the  
Producer Price Index, a widely used measure of inflation at the 
wholesale level, rose 0.5 percent in August. 
</P>
<P>
	While that surpassed economists' expectations for a 0.3 percent  
increase, the report was taken as a benign indicator. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the so-called core rate of inflation, which  
excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, actually fell 0.1 
percent in August, after being unchanged in July. Analysts had 
forecast a slight rise of 0.1 percent for August. 
</P>
<P>
	The core index figures provided confidence to bond traders that  
the Federal Reserve may not need to raise interest rates for a 
third time in 1999. The Fed raised rates last month and in June in 
an attempt to slow the economy to a sustainable, noninflationary 
growth rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasurys also received a boost from a slightly stronger dollar,  
which gained ground on the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasury securities were up 3/32 point to 1/8  
point, and intermediate maturities were up 1/4 point to 15/32 point, 
reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.73 percent as the  
discount fell 0.07 percentage point from Thursday to 4.61 percent. 
Six-month yields were 5.08 percent, as the discount fell 0.05 
percentage point to 4.88 percent. One-year yields were 5.22 percent 
as the discount fell by 0.04 percentage point to 4.96 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 5.12 1/2 percent from 5.25 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 1/4 point to 113 15/16. The average yield 
to maturity fell to 5.81 percent from 5.82 percent.

<HEADLINE> AOL Replaces Technology Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Marc Andreessen, the visionary who  
helped build the world's first commercial Internet browser, is 
stepping down as technology chief for America Online Inc., as he 
follows his entrepreneurial spirit. 
</P>
<P>
	After helping change the way the world communicates with  
Netscape Navigator, a program to easily navigate the World Wide 
Web, Andreessen said Friday he is seeking new challenges after a 
stint as AOL's first chief technology officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The co-founder of Netscape Communications Inc. said in a  
telephone interview that he relinquished the technology officer 
post to devote more time to investing in promising startup 
technology firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreessen will remain a part-time adviser with AOL, however,  
his move is the latest exit of Netscape top executives since the 
Internet software company was taken over by AOL last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Also departing in recent months have been Netscape chief  
executive James Barksdale, its general counsel, and the general 
manager of Netcenter, its flagship Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape employees had expressed concern when the takeover was  
announced that the company's creative corporate culture would be 
harmed by the pairing, although AOL executives insisted things have 
not changed substantially and that morale remains high. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreessen, 28, was a graduate student at the University of  
Illinois in 1994 when he helped found Netscape with James Clark, a 
computer executive who had previously founded Silicon Graphics 
Inc., a maker of powerful PCs. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreessen helped turn some of his early work on an easy ``point  
and click'' method of navigating the Internet into the Netscape 
browser, which rapidly became the most popular way for surfing the 
Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape grew to a $500 million company within three years, but  
was overtaken by Microsoft and, facing an uncertain future, was 
sold to AOL as part of a 3-way alliance with Sun Microsystems, 
makers of powerful network computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreessen was replaced at AOL by Sun Microsystem's William J.  
Raduchel, a seasoned executive who was responsible for Sun's 
corporate planning and development as well as for long-range 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	The new chief technology officer is expected to play a key role  
in coming months in determining whether AOL will get access to new 
high-speed Internet technologies now being pioneered by rivals such 
as AT&AMP;T Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL chief executive Steve Case said Andreessen relinquished the  
position on good terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marc will focus on what he likes doing best -- nurturing the  
rapidly growing number of new companies in Silicon Valley and 
elsewhere -- while remaining a strategic adviser to AOL on 
technology and investment issues,'' Case said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology analyst David Smith of Gartner Group also said the  
Netscape departures were nothing unusual in the highly competitive 
job market in the Silicon Valley region. He suggested, however, 
that Andreessen may have been unhappy being relegated to a mostly 
behind-the-scenes position after gracing the cover of national 
magazines as an industry wunderkind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he was much more prominent at Netscape, and since he  
has taken the role (of technology officer) he's been not very 
visible,'' Smith said. ``He was the technology visionary in a 
company not driven by technology visionaries but more by media 
content.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andreessen acknowledged AOL is more focused on delivering  
information to the masses and worries about technology only in that 
context, but said: ``I knew that when I was going in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a pure technologist anyway. I love working on things  
that reach large numbers of people,'' he said. ``It's not just a 
matter of invention, but it's figuring out a way of bringing it to 
everybody. I find that incredibly interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andreessen may have been foreshadowing his departure from  
day-to-day decision-making at AOL this summer, with the sale of $88 
million worth of his shares in AOL stock and his decision to take a 
stake in a closely held San Francisco startup. That company, 
Accompany Inc., is working to allow individual consumers seeking 
the same purchase over the Internet to act together as a group and 
receive volume discounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Raduchel comes to AOL, with its headquarters just outside  
Washington, at a crucial time for the online service, which is 
involved in a high-stakes public policy fight over its role in the 
next generation of high-speed Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a rare person who can talk technology and policy in the  
same conversation,'' said Ken Wasch, executive director for the 
Software and Information Industry Association, of which Sun and AOL 
are board members. ``Washington lobbyists are filled with people 
who can articulate policy positions but when it comes to technical 
issues will have to call their technical experts. Bill has 
demonstrated talents in both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raduchel's hiring also could further cement the important  
relationship between AOL and Sun, analysts said.

</P>
<P>
	GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- In yet another big step toward  
Middle East peace, Israel today handed over 7 percent of the West 
Bank to Palestinian administrative control. The handover took 
effect after Palestinian and Israeli officers signed the maps 
delineating the 160 square miles that will come under civilian 
Palestinian rule. Nabil Abourdeineh, an adviser to Yasser Arafat, 
said the maps were presented this morning to the Palestinian 
leader. ``He accepted them,'' Abourdeineh told The Associated

	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Fears of a massacre inside the besieged  
U.N. compound in East Timor rose after most of the staff was 
evacuated to the airport, leaving little protection for refugees 
inside from rampaging militiamen. Even under guard by Indonesian 
troops, the trucks of evacuating U.N. staff came under fire from 
militiamen as they passed through the streets of Dili, scattered by 
days of burning and looting, witnesses said. There were no 
immediate reports of casualties. Militiamen also stopped a party of 
Roman Catholic nuns who tried to make it to the airport to catch 
one of the Australian air force flights to Darwin. Their driver was 
beaten, but the nuns managed to reach the airport.

it could continue to strengthen and become a major hurricane in 
three days.'' Floyd was last reported centered about 215 miles

	Wholesale Prices Jump in August  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prices at the wholesale level surged 0.5  
percent in August, led by a huge jump in energy prices and a 
smaller rise in food costs, the Labor Department said today. The 
rise was higher than many analysts had expected. The increase in 
the Producer Price Index, which measures inflation pressures before 
they reach the consumer, followed a modest 0.2 percent rise in 
July. Wholesale prices had actually fallen 0.1 percent in June, 
only the second decline this year.

deadliest quake in more than 40 years. Despite working round the 
clock, emergency crews said they had found no more signs of life 
amid the rubble, as the death toll rose today to 97. More than two 
dozen people were still missing. International crews concentrated 
their searches, using ultra-sensitive listening equipment and 
sniffer dogs, on six sites, including a cleaning products factory 
where a 31-year-old woman was rescued yesterday.

<HEADLINE> Maytag Stock Down on Profit Caution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWTON, Iowa (AP) -- Maytag Corp.'s stock tumbled 26 percent  
Friday on news that the appliance maker's third-quarter earnings 
will miss Wall Street analysts' estimates because of weak sales of 
its lower-priced goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's No. 3 appliance maker, behind Whirlpool and General  
Electric Corp., said it expected to earn about 84 cents in the 
third quarter. That's below the 99 cents a share that analysts' had 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Maytag's stock fell $14.81 1/4 to $41.75 in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange, shaving $1.3 billion off its market value. As 
recently as late May, Maytag was trading at $74.81 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Maytag has been focused on stepping up its higher-priced brands,  
such as Maytag and Hoover, with new styles and innovations. For 
instance, Maytag's Neptune front-loading washer has been a success 
despite being twice the price of a conventional washer. 
</P>
<P>
	While its high-end products do well, it has been losing sales in  
the low-end segment, which includes Magic Chef and Admiral. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesman Tom Schwartz said strategies -- ``product  
innovation and operating excellence'' -- used for Maytag's 
higher-end products have not yet been put in place for some of 
value brands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly we're on an innovation strategy. We've taken that to  
Hoover and Maytag brands,'' Schwartz said. ``The strength in those 
brands and the innovation is likely not to offset some weaknesses 
in other products and price points where we haven't taken 
innovation strongly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd D. Ward, Maytag chairman and chief executive, said the  
company was working to improve ``productivity, quality improvement, 
and cost reduction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company will report its third-quarter results on Oct. 14.  
</P>
<P>
	The news came on the same day that rival Whirlpool said it was  
``comfortable'' with analyst estimates for third-quarter earnings 
of $1.33 a diluted share. 
</P>
<P>
	Newton-based Maytag is a leading producer of home appliances,  
floor care products and vending machines. Its main brands include 
Maytag, Hoover, Jenn-Air and Magic Chef. The company's commercial 
appliance segment includes Dixie-Narco vending equipment and 
Blodgett commercial cooking products. 
</P>
<P>
	Maytag employs about 23,800 people at 17 manufacturing plants in  
North America and China.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Sets Record, Dow Gains 50.97 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index soared to a record  
high today as investors snapped up shares of Internet companies and 
software makers. The swing toward technology stocks came at the 
expense of industrial stocks, which finished mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 50.97 at 11,028.43. The blue-chip index had backed off from a 
gain of 62 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index was up 34.94 at 2,886.96, according  
to preliminary calculations, moving past its closing high of 
2,864.48, set July 16. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index also ended 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq's strength came from hefty gains by online auction  
house eBay and Internet search provider Yahoo! A wide range of 
technology stocks rose today, including Microsoft and Cisco 
Systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Technology is back,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst  
at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``This is a group that had been battered in 
recent weeks, and it's nice to see money coming back into the 
group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traders suggested Thursday's unoffical test run for Year 2000  
computer glitches may have alleviated concerns about 
computer-related companies. Some programmers had feared that the 
string of nines in Thursday's date -- 9-9-99 -- would cause computer 
programs to fail. 
</P>
<P>
	But with no major problems reported, programmers and Wall Street  
professionals alike gained confidence that Jan. 1, 2000, will pass 
without difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks also benefited from a government report of a drop in  
wholesale prices, which eased investor concerns about higher 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said rising energy costs pushed wholesale  
prices up a higher than expected 0.5 percent during August. But 
when the volatile energy and food categories are excluded, 
wholesale prices actually fell 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets tend to set aside food and energy price  
changes and focus on the figure known as core inflation. The 0.1 
percent drop in core inflation last month was better than 
economists expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets have been uneasy lately amid concerns that the  
Federal Reserve, which has already raised interest rates twice this 
year, would push rates higher a third time because of the economy's 
continuing strength. Today's report helped alleviate some of those 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was pretty much the icing on the cake,'' said David Orr,  
chief economist at First Union Capital Markets Group in Charotte, 
N.C. ``The market is correct to now relax, at least temporarily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But while most stocks rose, the old-fashioned industrial  
companies that dominate the Dow fell. Caterpillar tumbled, and 
Chevron, which rose throughout the week as crude oil prices 
improved, fell back as investors took profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the market came through this week fairly unscathed,''  
Hogan said. ``But until we hear from the Fed, there's still 
resistance against taking the entire market to new highs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to preliminary calculations, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
rose 3.99 to 1,351.65. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,605 up, 1,329 down and 589 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 802.51 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
766.94 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.42 to 441.19.

<HEADLINE> Hispanic Groups Launch TV Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A coalition of minority organizations is calling  
for a boycott of the four major networks during the first two weeks 
of the TV season to protest ``the continued invisibility of Latinos 
on television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``brownout'' of ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC begins Sunday and  
continues through Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Council of La Raza, which is coordinating the  
boycott, counts just one Hispanic -- Martin Sheen, on NBC's ``The 
West Wing'' -- among the lead characters in the 38 new series 
premiering this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference today, the group said it had teamed with  
other minority groups in a push to force the entertainment industry 
to address the issue. They formed a negotiating team made up of 
former California congressmen Norman Minetta and Esteban Torres, 
NAACP president Kweisi Mfume, and the founder of American Indians 
in Film, Sonny Skyhawk. 
</P>
<P>
	Torres said at a news conference that the team hopes to get ``a  
long-lasting, verifiable agreement that will create a rapid 
inclusion of minorities in programming as well as ownership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John White, an NAACP spokesman, said only 52 of the 854 staff  
writers on major network shows are black. ``The public interest is 
not served well by a monolithic, all-white presentation of the 
world,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Hispanics constitute 11 percent of the U.S. population,  
they make up less than 2 percent of all characters on prime-time 
shows, according to Lisa Navarrete, a spokeswoman for La Raza. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Sheen, the group counts three Hispanics  
continuing on returning series: Bruno Campos (NBC's ``Jesse''), 
and, on CBS, Hector Elizondo (``Chicago Hope'') and Cheech Marin 
(``Nash Bridges''). 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the boycott will not be measured by ratings, she  
said. ``If we can educate a large proportion of the community and 
others who are interested in this issue, then we've succeeded,'' 
Navarrete said. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to the planned boycott, CBS said in a statement that  
it ``remains committed to the idea that our programming, and indeed 
our organization, should reflect the diversity of our society. We 
agree that much progress in our industry remains to be made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said ABC: ``We are making improvements and understand that we  
need to do more. This is an ongoing process and ABC is deeply 
committed to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox declined to comment on the boycott, and NBC had no immediate  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Some networks have already made cast changes for upcoming shows,  
though executives insisted they were in the works even before the 
outcry. 
</P>
<P>
	In their original form, none of the 27 new comedies and dramas  
set to premiere on the top four networks had minorities in a 
leading role, and few had them in supporting roles. But more than a 
dozen minority characters have been added to new and returning 
series, including a Hispanic woman in ABC's sitcom ``Sabrina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly welcome the addition of characters,'' Navarrete  
said, ``but there's a bigger problem.''

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks Prefer To Stay in NL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks say they're happy to be  
in the National League and that's where they would prefer to 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Colangelo, the Diamondbacks' managing general partner, met  
Thursday with commissioner Bud Selig when Arizona played the 
Brewers in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the Diamondbacks' admittance as an expansion team in  
1998, major league baseball reserved the right to move the 
franchise to the American League through November 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo said recent market research shows 85 percent of his  
team's fans want Arizona to stay in the NL. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of the meeting with Bud was to reiterate our  
position,'' Colangelo said. ``He's well aware of my feelings. It 
made sense then. It makes more sense now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AL West has lobbied for the Diamondbacks, and the major  
league realignment committee is scheduled to release its report at 
next week's owners meeting in Cooperstown, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very sensitive and understanding of Jerry's feelings and  
thoughts,'' Selig said. ``I'm very protective of the Arizona 
franchise. It's one of the crown jewels of baseball and we want to 
do everything we can for it to stay that way.''

<HEADLINE> Wholesale Prices Jump in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inflation at the wholesale level leaped 0.5  
percent in August, reflecting sharply higher energy and food 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But economists didn't quake at the news, believing that tame  
core prices excluding these two volatile sectors may discourage the 
Federal Reserve from raising interest rates again in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said Friday last month's overall increase  
in its Producer Price Index -- which measures inflation pressures 
before they reach the consumer -- followed a modest 0.2 percent rise 
in July. Many analysts had been expecting prices to rise 0.3 
percent in August. 
</P>
<P>
	While economists weren't heartened by the 0.5 percent increase,  
they tended to focus on the good performance of the ``core'' 
inflation rate, closely watched by the Federal Reserve and Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the volatile energy and food categories, the core rate  
of inflation at the wholesale level fell 0.1 percent last month, 
after being flat in July. Many analysts forecast a 0.1 percent 
increase in the core rate and viewed the better-than-expected 
performance as a sign that inflation is under control. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, the core inflation rate has declined at an  
annual rate of 0.4 percent, compared with a 2.5 percent gain for 
all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets' immediate reaction was to hone in on the good  
core rate news. The bond market gained ground, pushing yields on 
30-year Treasury bonds down to 6.04 percent. The Nasdaq composite 
rose 35.01 points to close at 2,887.03, easily surpassing its 
previous closing high of 2,864.48, set July 16. The Nasdaq's 
strength came from hefty gains by some Internet companies and 
software makers. But the Dow Jones industrial average, initially 
lifted by the news, closed down 50.97 points at 11,028.43. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the core rate's decline, said Russell Sheldon, chief  
economist for MCM MoneyWatch, ``the odds are heavily in favor of no 
tightening move by the Fed in October.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Kasriel, chief economist for Northern Trust Co., agreed:  
``This doesn't give the Fed any ammunition to raise rates at its 
Oct. 5 meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, economists said that the big increase in overall  
wholesale prices, if matched at the consumer level, could still 
stoke concerns at the Federal Reserve about a potential breakout of 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists were concerned that the rise in the price of  
materials used in the early phases of production could be sign of 
inflation to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for crude goods -- unprocessed materials such as coal and  
raw cotton -- surged 4.6 percent in August, while the price of 
intermediate goods -- semiprocessed materials such as plywood and 
textile fabrics, rose a sharp 0.8 percent, the biggest one-month 
gain since January 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a case to be made that pipeline inflation pressures  
are building,'' said Ken Mayland, an economist for KeyCorp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve on Aug. 24 bumped up interest rates for the  
second time this year, but signaled that additional rate increases 
this year may not be needed unless the economy shows signs of 
overheating or if inflation flares. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, overall wholesale prices have been rising at  
an annual rate of 2.3 percent, compared with no change for all of 
1998. The pickup in this year's wholesale prices is coming from big 
increases in energy costs, which had been falling for much of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	For August, energy costs rose 3.7 percent, the biggest one-month  
gain since a 5.5 percent rise in April. That April spike had put 
the Fed on inflation alert, and on June 30 the central bank raised 
interest rates for the first time in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	A 9.1 percent rise in gasoline prices and a 5.3 percent gain in  
heating oil prices led the rise in August's energy prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Residential electric power rose 1.1 percent, the biggest gain  
since May 1995, and residential natural gas prices went up by 1.1 
percent, the biggest jump since December 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said last month's surge in gasoline prices reflects  
production cuts, a pickup in demand from recovering economies in 
Asian and Latin America and increased energy demands caused by 
unusually hot weather in many parts of the country. But they expect 
gasoline prices to moderate in September's report. 
</P>
<P>
	Food prices posted a 0.4 percent increase in August, after  
having fallen 0.9 percent drop in July. August's increase was led 
by a hefty 7.1 percent rise in pork prices. 
</P>
<P>
	However, beef prices fell 0.7 percent in August, and vegetable  
prices dropped 5.3 percent, reflecting big decreases in the price 
of celery, dry onions, russet potatoes and carrots. Fresh fruit 
prices declined 3.2 percent, with the price of nectarines, Valencia 
oranges, raspberries and avocados all falling.

<HEADLINE>  E. Timor U.N. Compound Threatened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Pro-Indonesian militiamen threatened the  
U.N. compound in East Timor today, vandalizing equipment outside 
and terrifying East Timorese holed up inside after most of the U.N. 
staff was evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
	Militiamen looted U.N. vehicles after the convoy of 350 U.N.  
staffers evacuated, the United Nations and witnesses told 
Australian Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	In Darwin, Australia, U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst told the AAP  
the Indonesian army did ``absolutely nothing'' to prevent the 
militia from entering the compound in the regional capital of Dili. 
Later, the AAP said, soldiers dispersed the militiamen. 
</P>
<P>
	Marie Colvin, of the Sunday Times of London, said militiamen  
outside the compound threatened to lob hand grenades over the wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The compound is very exposed,'' Colvin said. ``The real danger  
is to the East Timorese refugees, who are targets and who are 
completely defenseless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, military spokesman Brig. Gen. Sudrajat, who uses  
only one name, said no militias had attacked the U.N. building. 
``There are soldiers there to protect it,'' Sudrajat said.

	Pro-Indonesian militiamen have been running rampant since East  
Timor's people voted overwhelmingly for independence in an Aug. 30 
referendum. The military is accused of supporting the militias, and 
doing little to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton called the attacks on the compound ``simply  
unacceptable,'' and said it was clear the Indonesian military was 
``aiding and abetting the militia violence.''

<P>
	``The actions of the Indonesian military in East Timor stand in  
stark contrast to the commitments they have given to the 
international community,'' Clinton said in a statement today. 
</P>
<P>
	Even under guard by Indonesian soldiers, the trucks of  
evacuating U.N. staff came under fire from militiamen as they 
passed through the streets of Dili, scattered with debris and ash 
from days of burning and looting, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	Militiamen also stopped a party of Roman Catholic nuns on their

<P>

members of his own ruling Golkar party joined a call for him not to

<P>
	``People think there is a coup. What coup? There is no coup.  
There is nothing,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  E. Timor U.N. Compound Threatened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Pro-Indonesian militiamen threatened the  
U.N. compound in East Timor today, vandalizing equipment outside 
and terrifying East Timorese holed up inside after most of the U.N. 
staff was evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
	Militiamen looted U.N. vehicles after the convoy of 350 U.N.  
staffers evacuated, the United Nations and witnesses told 
Australian Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	In Darwin, Australia, U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst told the AAP  
the Indonesian army did ``absolutely nothing'' to prevent the 
militia from entering the compound in the regional capital of Dili. 
Later, the AAP said, soldiers dispersed the militiamen. 
</P>
<P>
	Marie Colvin, of the Sunday Times of London, said militiamen  
outside the compound threatened to lob hand grenades over the wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The compound is very exposed,'' Colvin said. ``The real danger  
is to the East Timorese refugees, who are targets and who are 
completely defenseless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, military spokesman Brig. Gen. Sudrajat, who uses  
only one name, said no militias had attacked the U.N. building. 
``There are soldiers there to protect it,'' Sudrajat said.

<HEADLINE> AOL Replaces Technology Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Marc Andreessen, the visionary who  
helped build the world's first commercial Internet browser, is 
stepping down as technology chief for America Online Inc., as he 
follows his entrepreneurial spirit. 
</P>
<P>
	After helping change the way the world communicates with  
Netscape Navigator, a program to easily navigate the World Wide 
Web, Andreessen said Friday he is seeking new challenges after a 
stint as AOL's first chief technology officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The co-founder of Netscape Communications Inc. said in a  
telephone interview that he relinquished the technology officer 
post to devote more time to investing in promising startup 
technology firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreessen will remain a part-time adviser with AOL, however,  
his move is the latest exit of Netscape top executives since the 
Internet software company was taken over by AOL last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Also departing in recent months have been Netscape chief  
executive James Barksdale, its general counsel, and the general 
manager of Netcenter, its flagship Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape employees had expressed concern when the takeover was  
announced that the company's creative corporate culture would be 
harmed by the pairing, although AOL executives insisted things have 
not changed substantially and that morale remains high. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreessen, 28, was a graduate student at the University of  
Illinois in 1994 when he helped found Netscape with James Clark, a 
computer executive who had previously founded Silicon Graphics 
Inc., a maker of powerful PCs. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreessen helped turn some of his early work on an easy ``point  
and click'' method of navigating the Internet into the Netscape 
browser, which rapidly became the most popular way for surfing the 
Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape grew to a $500 million company within three years, but  
was overtaken by Microsoft and, facing an uncertain future, was 
sold to AOL as part of a 3-way alliance with Sun Microsystems, 
makers of powerful network computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreessen was replaced at AOL by Sun Microsystem's William J.  
Raduchel, a seasoned executive who was responsible for Sun's 
corporate planning and development as well as for long-range 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	The new chief technology officer is expected to play a key role  
in coming months in determining whether AOL will get access to new 
high-speed Internet technologies now being pioneered by rivals such 
as AT&AMP;T Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL chief executive Steve Case said Andreessen relinquished the  
position on good terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marc will focus on what he likes doing best -- nurturing the  
rapidly growing number of new companies in Silicon Valley and 
elsewhere -- while remaining a strategic adviser to AOL on 
technology and investment issues,'' Case said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology analyst David Smith of Gartner Group also said the  
Netscape departures were nothing unusual in the highly competitive 
job market in the Silicon Valley region. He suggested, however, 
that Andreessen may have been unhappy being relegated to a mostly 
behind-the-scenes position after gracing the cover of national 
magazines as an industry wunderkind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he was much more prominent at Netscape, and since he  
has taken the role (of technology officer) he's been not very 
visible,'' Smith said. ``He was the technology visionary in a 
company not driven by technology visionaries but more by media 
content.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andreessen acknowledged AOL is more focused on delivering  
information to the masses and worries about technology only in that 
context, but said: ``I knew that when I was going in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a pure technologist anyway. I love working on things  
that reach large numbers of people,'' he said. ``It's not just a 
matter of invention, but it's figuring out a way of bringing it to 
everybody. I find that incredibly interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andreessen may have been foreshadowing his departure from  
day-to-day decision-making at AOL this summer, with the sale of $88 
million worth of his shares in AOL stock and his decision to take a 
stake in a closely held San Francisco startup. That company, 
Accompany Inc., is working to allow individual consumers seeking 
the same purchase over the Internet to act together as a group and 
receive volume discounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Raduchel comes to AOL, with its headquarters just outside  
Washington, at a crucial time for the online service, which is 
involved in a high-stakes public policy fight over its role in the 
next generation of high-speed Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a rare person who can talk technology and policy in the  
same conversation,'' said Ken Wasch, executive director for the 
Software and Information Industry Association, of which Sun and AOL 
are board members. ``Washington lobbyists are filled with people 
who can articulate policy positions but when it comes to technical 
issues will have to call their technical experts. Bill has 
demonstrated talents in both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raduchel's hiring also could further cement the important  
relationship between AOL and Sun, analysts said.

	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- America Online Inc. announced a shakeup  
today in its management ranks, replacing Marc Andreessen, its

J. Raduchel. 
</P>

	AOL said in a statement from its Dulles, Va., headquarters that  
Andreessen, who co-founded Netscape Communications Corp., will 
remain with the company as a part-time strategic adviser focusing 
on startup investments in Silicon Valley and technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreessen, 28, who helped build the world's first commercial  
Internet browser, had joined AOL when it bought Netscape 
Communications for $10 billion early this year.

<P>
	AOL, Sun and Netscape joined forces to sell Internet services

acquisition of Mountain View-based Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape, best known for its Internet browser, is a leading  
provider of software and services for online businesses and the 
operator of NetCenter, a popular entry point to the World Wide Web. 
AOL is the largest Internet access provider and online service.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Home Guarantee Spurs Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A conservative group charged Friday that  
Hillary Rodham Clinton violated federal election law in having 
Democratic fund-raiser Terry McAuliffe co-sign for her $1.7 million 
New York home. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint, filed with the Federal Election Commission by the  
Conservative Campaign Fund, alleges that personal loans and 
guarantees for personal loans have always been treated the same as 
campaign contributions and are subject to the same $1,000 limit. 
Mrs. Clinton is eyeing the U.S. Senate seat in New York being 
vacated in 2000 by retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clearly illegal,'' Peter Flaherty, chairman of the  
Conservative Campaign Fund, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman, Howard Wolfson, called the  
loan guarantee ``perfectly legal and appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not surprising that a right-wing special interest group  
would be attacking Hillary Clinton. We expect that will happen 
quite a bit,'' Wolfson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and Mrs. Clinton signed a contract last week to  
buy a five-bedroom home in Chappaqua, about an hour north of New 
York City. They will put up the $350,000 down payment out of their 
own money. 
</P>
<P>
	McAuliffe, a Clinton friend and one of his chief fund raisers,  
agreed to put up $1.35 million as collateral to guarantee the money 
the Clintons are borrowing. The Westchester County residence will 
be the Clintons first home of their own since at least the early 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	FEC spokeswoman Kelly Huff said she could not comment on the  
complaint itself but that generally the law mandates that loans and 
loan guarantees for candidates are subject to campaign limits if 
they are related to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Flaherty argued that because Mrs. Clinton must establish  
residency in New York to run for a Senate seat the home loan was 
campaign related. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conservative Campaign Fund, based in McLean, Va., is also  
sponsoring an independent ad campaign in New York opposed to Mrs. 
Clinton's expected Senate run.

<HEADLINE> Black Church Group Picks New Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The new president of the National Baptist  
Convention U.S.A. Inc. is calling for healing and direction as he 
takes over an organization still reeling from a scandal that put 
its last elected leader behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. William Shaw, voted into office of the nation's largest  
black church group Thursday night, immediately called for all 
members to begin 40 days of fasting and praying for the ``healing 
and redirection of the convention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a point of beginning for us,'' said Shaw, the pastor of  
White Rock Baptist Church in Philadelphia. ``I would ask now that 
we go home and bow in prayer that God would give the direction that 
we ought to take from this point on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, 65, defeated 10 other candidates with 3,694 votes. The  
Rev. W. Franklyn Richardson, 50, of Mount Vernon, N.Y., was second 
with 3,451 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw succeeds the Rev. Henry J. Lyons, the St. Petersburg  
minister now serving 5 1/2 years in prison for bilking $4 million from 
businesses and keeping nearly $250,000 donated by the 
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith to help rebuild burned black 
churches in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons resigned as president in March and subsequently pleaded  
guilty to federal tax evasion and fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of that scandal, Shaw called for the next president  
to share his power with a cabinet and a restructured board of 
directors, which he said would result in more financial 
accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw said one of his immediate goals is to hire a nationally  
recognized accounting firm to conduct an immediate audit of the 
Convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw has said convention's problems stem from ``a lack of  
accountability and a failure to center the convention around 
Christ.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, we begin shaping a renewed, Christ-centered convention  
that grounds everything we do in the preaching, teaching and 
healing ministry of Jesus,'' Shaw said in a statement. ``With God's 
help, our Convention will stand as a powerful and respected force 
for good work, justice and righteousness in the nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, pastor of White Rock for 43 years, and runner-up  
Richardson were among a group of eight ministers who unsuccessfully 
attempted to oust Lyons two years ago as investigators probed 
whether he misused the group's funds to live in luxury. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Edward V. Hill, the Los Angeles minister endorsed this  
year by Lyons and asked by the convention's board to run, got 2,097 
votes. He pledged his support to Shaw after the election. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will now close ranks and fight the devil,'' Hill said.  
``Congratulations to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The convention, which traces its roots to 1880, claims 8.5  
million members, though at Lyons' trial prosecutors said the figure 
was inflated to attract businesses. They said membership is around 
1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Convention leaders said some 60,000 delegates and visitors  
attended the group's annual meeting.

<HEADLINE> Ewing To Miss Start of Training Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Knicks center Patrick Ewing is not  
fully recovered from his partially torn left Achilles' tendon and 
will miss training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still sore, it still hurts and I'm not sure when I'm  
going to be back,'' Ewing said Thursday at the New York All-Star 
Basketball Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing, 37, tore the tendon in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference  
finals against the Indiana Pacers June 1. He missed the rest of the 
playoffs and the finals, where the Knicks lost to the San Antonio 
Spurs in five games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-time All-Star center said the tendon was healed, but he  
still has tendinitis and cannot run. Ewing missed 12 of 50 games 
last season because of the tendinitis. 
</P>
<P>
	His rehabilitation consists of lifting weights, using a  
stationary bike and treadmill, and running in a pool.

	``Whenever my body heals and the pain and all the swelling goes  
away is when I'll be ready,'' Ewing said. 
</P>
<P>
	Further complicating things for New York is a sprained medial  
collateral ligament sustained by backup center Chris Dudley earlier 
this week. The 6-foot-11 Dudley won't be able to run for 4-6 weeks 
and will miss the start of training camp as well.

<HEADLINE> Cher's Shopper Asked for I.D. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- There was something a little funny  
about the attempted credit card purchase at the Mr. Charles 
boutique. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyer couldn't produce a photo ID -- and for good reason: The  
credit card belonged to Cher. 
</P>
<P>
	It turned out the singer was in town for a show and had sent her  
personal assistant to do a little shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlene Rosen, owner of Mr. Charles, said the assistant  
returned with cash for the purchases, then came back a few more 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	Cher herself visited the store Tuesday. She bought blouses and  
sweaters and gave the staff three concert tickets.

<HEADLINE> Forbes, Bauer Take Aim at Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential hopefuls Gary Bauer  
and Steve Forbes accused President Clinton on Friday of following a 
policy of appeasement toward China. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said Clinton's China policy indicates the administration  
wants a new Cold War or appeasement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's a false choice,'' he said on a Concord, N.H.,  
radio show, ``The Exchange.'' ``If China wishes to transfer or sell 
dangerous technology to rogue states, ... they should know 
sanctions will be applied against specific Chinese companies that 
do business in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Forbes spoke, Clinton was flying to New Zealand for a summit  
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. Outside the 
meeting, Clinton is meeting Saturday with Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin about his country's desire to join the World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Friday, Bauer released a statement that said China's  
move to hold military exercises near Taiwan prior to the 
Clinton-Jiang meeting showed ``the bankruptcy of the Clinton policy 
of appeasement toward Communist China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We offer unilateral concessions to Beijing, and Beijing  
demonstrates in the most insulting manner that we will gain nothing 
in return,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	A pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper reported last week that China  
was planning exercises on the mainland's east coast to press home 
its anger over an assertion by Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui that 
relations between Taiwan and China should be on a state-to-state 
basis. China considers Taiwan a rebellious province. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to imposing sanctions against Chinese companies,  
Forbes suggested sanctions targeting companies in Russia, where he 
said the administration has ignored theft and oppression. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've known for years that tens of billions of dollars were  
being siphoned off by a corrupt elite in the Kremlin, who were no 
more democratic than their Communist predecessors,'' Forbes said.

<HEADLINE> Andy Reid Tries To Resurrect Eagles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- For a rookie coach, Andy Reid understands a  
lot about pro football. He even understands writing about it; Reid 
used to imitate the late Jim Murray in a sports column while at 
Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours away from his first game as coach of the Philadelphia  
Eagles, Reid has a clear idea of how he'd like this story to turn 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, the second-youngest coach in the NFL at 41, is a Mike  
Holmgren clone who has been groomed to coach since his days as an 
offensive lineman at BYU during the late 1970s and early '80s. In 
charge of turning around the dismal recent history of the Eagles, 
he has one of the toughest rebuilding jobs in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like losing,'' said Reid, whose Eagles open the season  
Sunday at home against the Arizona Cardinals. ``I know there are a 
lot of sports psychologists who can coach you on how to lose. But 
losing is not a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's also a reality. Deep down, I understand that we can't  
win every game. I'll handle it the best way I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Handling losing might be the toughest test Reid faces in the  
rare transition from position coach to head coach. Reid, whose 
highest position in 16 years of coaching was offensive coordinator 
at San Francisco State, spent the past seven years coaching the 
offensive line, tight ends and quarterbacks at Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles, 3-13 last season, needed upgrades at nearly every  
position. They still do. They were dreadful on offense while going 
1-3 in exhibition games, an ominous start to a new era. 
</P>
<P>
	There is hope. There is a young coach and a young quarterback,  
No. 2 overall draft pick Donovan McNabb, who have turned the eyes 
of this suffering franchise to the future. The recent past is too 
painful to look at. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you going to think that everything that is bad is  
happening to us?'' Reid said. ``Or do you say, `There's no better 
time than right now to change this thing?' 
</P>
<P>
	``You better think positive on it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Reid draws his attitude from many sources, the most prominent  
among them being Holmgren. The former Packers coach now in Seattle 
urged Reid to learn the intricacies of the West Coast offense and 
placed the supervisory tag on him in 1996. If unknown among fans, 
Reid quietly became a prominent figure among the rising young 
assistants in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia Inquirer recounted a story in which Reid was  
introduced to Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie in February 1997 by Reid's 
predecessor, Ray Rhodes. This occurred at the scouting combine in 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid was a little embarrassed when describing how he tried to  
arrange such meetings. In addition to studying the football 
schemes, Reid spent hours compiling a list of coaches and contacts 
he felt were important to know. 
</P>
<P>
	``As corny as it may sound, I did keep it on my computer and  
when I was at the Senior Bowl or the scouting combine,'' Reid said. 
``I'd make sure to delete guys as I got to know them a bit. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got back to Green Bay, I broke out the media guides and  
went through them and added about everyone I knew. When I got done, 
I realized I knew more people than I thought. ... Over seven or 
eight years, that evolved into the list I used for hiring a 
staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid first impressed the Eagles by showing up for the job  
interview with a binder as thick as the New York City phone book. 
It was filled with notes and diagrams from his diligent offensive 
studies under Holmgren. 
</P>
<P>
	``Andy's a perfectionist,'' Packers tight end Mark Chmura said.  
</P>
<P>
	Even players who were fiercely loyal to Rhodes appreciate Reid's  
strict attention to detail and discipline. Fans appreciate it, too, 
displaying a sign at Veterans Stadium recently that read, 
``Finally, a man with a plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the attitude is a lot different this year,''  
linebacker James Darling said. ``We have a lot more confidence in 
ourselves. That comes from coach Reid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A defining moment in Reid's brief tenure occurred when offensive  
lineman George Hegamin left practice after learning he'd been 
demoted to the second team. Reid punished him by making him push a 
blocking sled 100 yards after practice -- with the 300-plus-pound 
Reid standing on it. The coach also insisted that television 
cameras film it. Hegamin was soon released. 
</P>
<P>
	What sort of column would Reid have written about that?

<HEADLINE> Indians Reach Slot Machine Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Leaders of 58 tribes signed agreements  
with the state Friday that will allow them to keep slot machines 
operating at Indian-run casinos while voters consider amending the 
California Constitution to legalize such gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreements ward off a Justice Department threat to enforce a  
federal court order that would have shut down the tribes' slots and 
low-stakes blackjack games in mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribes voted late Thursday and early Friday to sign the  
agreements. A major break came when Gov. Gray Davis, labor-friendly 
legislators and tribal leaders agreed to deal separately with the 
issue of whether unions can try to organize casino workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The state agreed to allow slot machines to continue operating  
after the Indians consented to a cap of no more than about 43,000 
of the devices. An estimated 20,000 are in use now. 
</P>
<P>
	``It balances the interests of the Indian people and the other  
people of this great state,'' Davis said. ``And for those tribes 
that adopt it, this compact offers security and economic promise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreements were awaiting endorsement from state legislators,  
who planned to approve them before adjourning Friday. Lawmakers 
also gave final approval to the constitutional amendment that would 
go before voters in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest known holdout among California's Indian tribes was  
the Aqua band, whose 1,200-slot casino in Palm Springs is one of 
the state's largest. The tribe is pressing for unlimited gambling 
at Indian casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	The casinos faced an Oct. 13 shutdown because of a state Supreme  
Court ruling last month. The high court overturned Proposition 5, 
the 1998 voter-approved measure that allowed gambling machines and 
certain card games at Indian casinos. The justices said the 
California Constitution bans such Las Vegas-style gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the ruling, a federal judge in Los Angeles had  
ordered some casinos closed. But federal prosecutors said that if 
tribes and the state demonstrated a good-faith effort to reach 
agreements, they would hold off enforcing the order until voters 
could consider an amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada casinos, which have more than 200,000 slot machines, have  
fought the introduction of Las Vegas-style gambling at Indian 
casinos because they don't want the competition. Indian tribes say 
they desperately need the money; many have already become rich from 
casino gambling.

<HEADLINE> DEA Agent Admits Shooting Colleague </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A Drug Enforcement Administration  
agent pleaded guilty to manslaughter Friday in the shooting death 
of another agent during a ride home from a holiday party. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard A. Fekete could face up to 14 years in prison, but his  
attorneys hope the judge will be lenient based on conclusions by 
doctors that Fekete is an alcoholic plagued by psychotic delusions. 
</P>
<P>
	Fekete, 55, has said he doesn't recall leaving a party at the  
Dade County Police Benevolent Association hall with fellow agent 
Shaun E. Curl, or the car crash after the shooting in Miramar. 
</P>
<P>
	When police arrived at the accident scene, Curl, 39, of Coral  
Springs, lay dead from several gunshots to the head. Fekete was 
charged with second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Fekete told investigators he'd been ``drinking brew'' for more  
than 10 hours Dec. 12, 1997, starting at an all-day Christmas party 
with prosecutors and investigators on an anti-drug task force. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests showed Fekete had a blood-alcohol level of 0.26 percent --  
more than three times the 0.08 legal limit for Florida drivers.

<HEADLINE> Cotton Higher, Corn Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Cotton futures prices jumped Friday on the New York Cotton  
Exchange on lower government crop estimates following a dry August. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets Friday, crude oil futures and grains were  
higher, while corn was lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton futures posted gains after the U.S. Department of  
Agriculture announced crop estimates that were lower than last 
month's projection. 
</P>
<P>
	The news did little, however, to alleviate generally depressed  
prices that have plagued cotton for months. The heat wave that 
killed cotton crops in the South this summer wasn't considered 
enough to significantly help raise cotton prices for growers, which 
hit a 13-year low in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.D.A. reported earlier this summer that world production  
was on the rise, as were estimates on the amount of the crop 
expected to be left over from the previous harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	October cotton rose 1.11 cents Friday to 52.25 cents a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	For the fourth straight session crude oil futures rose on the  
New York Mercantile Exchange to levels last seen in 1997. The 
October contract reached a 31-month high at $23.60 before settling 
at $23.55, a gain of 35 cents on the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil futures soared past the $23-a-barrel mark Thursday for  
the first time since February 1997 in response to a pair of reports 
which showed U.S. inventories at their lowest level since January 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude prices tumbled below $11 a barrel last December due to a  
world glut but have recovered after production cutbacks by the 
Organization of the Petroleum Export Countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat and soybean futures prices rose in trading Friday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade while corn futures fell in reaction to a 
bearish crop production report. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures closed lower after the U.S. Department of  
Agriculture pegged corn output slightly above analysts' 
expectations. The U.S.D.A. estimated corn output at 9.381 billion 
bushels. 
</P>
<P>
	The harvest is moving ahead and market participants see prices  
lower for the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just could not get any positiveness in corn today,'' said  
Don Roose, president of Iowa based-U.S. Commodities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans and wheat fell in early trading in sympathy with corn,  
but later turned to the positive side. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans received support from the government's 80  
million-bushel cut to U.S. new-crop carryout, and also a late rally 
in soyoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat benefitted from stronger-than-expected weekly export  
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.D.A. report in soybeans and wheat was largely neutral.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 3 1/4 cents to $2.88 1/2 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1 1/4 cents to $2.17 3/4 cents a bushel; December oats 
fell 1/4 cent to $1.16 a bushel; November soybeans rose 8 1/2 cents to 
$5.15 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures were higher Friday on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while pork futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle rose 1.10 cents to 68.07 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle rose 1.38 cents to 80.35 cents a pound; 
October lean hogs fell 0.08 cent to 43.22 cents a pound; February 
pork bellies rose 1.32 cents to 54.42 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Aeroflot Begins Nonsmoking Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's largest airline and one of the world's  
most smoker-friendly carriers, Aeroflot, has banned smoking on many 
domestic and international flights of less than two hours, a 
newspaper reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The no-smoking policy covers flights between Moscow and 30  
destinations, including Ukraine, the Baltic nations, Poland and 
Finland, the daily Segodnya said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Aeroflot conceded that fines for violations would not be  
large, making it unlikely that passengers will comply with the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoking is widespread in Russia, and is allowed in most public  
places. Aeroflot didn't say what prompted its new ban, which 
immediately came under fire from a prominent Russian lawyer who 
said the state-controlled company had no right to restrict smokers' 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	If Aeroflot's decision ``has to do with the fashion for fighting  
smoking, it is a violation of human rights,'' the lawyer, Anatoly 
Kucherena, was quoted as saying by Segodnya. ``And if it is concern 
for passengers' safety, then representatives of the firm must 
coherently explain their position but leave the right to make a 
decision for legislators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aeroflot introduced some nonsmoking flights last year, and  
decided to expand the policy because there have been no protests or 
other ``incidents,'' the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aeroflot insisted it will not ban smoking on trans-Atlantic  
flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Another large Russian airline, the privately owned Transaero,  
banned smoking on flights of two hours or less in 1994, and later 
expanded the ban to flights lasting up to five hours. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Transaero said it suspected that many people continue  
to break the ban by smoking in its airplanes' bathrooms, where 
tobacco smoke doesn't trigger Russian-made smoke detectors, 
Segodnya reported.

<HEADLINE> Dispute Over WACO Evidence Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- U.S. marshals delayed carrying out a judge's  
sealed order to seize more evidence from the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms stemming from the Branch Davidian standoff, 
The Dallas Morning News reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The marshals carried out the order after U.S. District Judge  
Walter Smith issued a second edict Thursday that they comply with 
his initial order immediately, the newspaper said, citing 
unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
	An ATF spokesman in Washington confirmed that Smith issued the  
order after hearing that the agency was considering closing their 
Waco office. He said the judge wanted the office's contents to be 
preserved. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was, I guess on his part, some concern that the office  
might be closing,'' said Jeff Roehm, public affairs chief at the 
agency's headquarters. ``It was pretty much expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the News, the chief U.S. marshal for the district  
spent hours debating whether to execute the order, first consulting 
with his agency's headquarters in Washington and the U.S. 
attorney's office in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, the marshals seized files and took custody of keys  
to storage facilities, the News said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith next month is scheduled to begin hearing a wrongful death  
lawsuit filed against the government by Branch Davidians who 
survived the 1993 federal raid and subsequent fire at their 
compound. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Smith rejected a plea by the Justice Department,  
parent agency of the U.S. Marshals Service, not to take control of 
the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	A Justice Department spokesman in Washington declined comment on  
Thursday's seizure, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Waco ATF office was set up to help coordinate the federal  
prosecutions and contained case files and documents related to the 
51-day standoff at the Branch Davidian compound. 
</P>
<P>
	Roehm said the agency had decided to keep the office open until  
the end of the wrongful-death lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	David Koresh and about 80 of his followers died in the April 19,  
1993, fire at their Mount Carmel compound. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno this week appointed an independent  
inquiry to investigate the FBI's actions at the end of the standoff 
after the agency revealed, after years of denials, that it fired 
potentially flammable tear-gas canisters at the compound on the day 
of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The government still maintains that the Davidians set the blaze.  
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, Smith had to intervene before the ATF allowed the  
Texas Rangers access to the Waco storage facility containing the 
massive collection of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers had asked to enter the facility to search for items  
relating to pyrotechnic tear-gas devices fired by the FBI. Rangers 
instead discovered the spent remains of a star parachute flare.

<HEADLINE> Depression Felt in Most Workplaces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most human resource managers say they have  
recognized signs of depression among workers at their companies, 
but depressed employees aren't always getting help, a survey finds. 
</P>
<P>
	Among human resource managers for 406 U.S. companies who  
responded to the survey, more than half -- 56 percent -- said 
employees suffering from depression have had a negative impact on 
productivity at their company in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, faxed to 2,300 companies, was conducted in July by  
the Society for Human Resource Management and the National 
Foundation for Brain Research. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 17 million Americans experience serious depression  
each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms that can indicate depression that human resource  
managers said they most often recognized among workers include 
tiredness or lethargy, poor concentration, a decline in 
productivity, overall sadness and an increase in unexplained 
absences. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all of the managers took action when they recognized a  
problem, however. Six out of 10 said they had taken steps such as 
suggesting the employee seek counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing a pretty good job at getting the word out that  
depression is an identifiable illness that affects productivity,'' 
said Daniel J. Conti, who runs an employee assistance program for 
Bank One Corp. ``However, we still have a ways to go in tying that 
together with good treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of the companies responding to the survey have  
similar employee assistance programs that could arrange counseling 
for employees, and 98 percent have health insurance plans that 
cover treatment for mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
	But managers and co-workers may not know how to approach someone  
who needs help, or confidentiality concerns may deter a worker from 
seeking assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Society for Human Resource Management and the National  
Foundation for Brain Research suggested steps companies can take to 
break down barriers that may prevent workers from getting help. 
They include: 
</P>
<P>
	--Training managers in how to recognize depression and approach a  
worker to offer assistance, which may need to include a temporary 
reduction in workload or hours while treatment is sought. 
</P>
<P>
	--Offering all workers a confidential depression screening, which  
some companies have arranged with counseling services that provide 
a toll-free phone number. 
</P>
<P>
	--Using an outside employee assistance program so workers don't  
feel they must share personal problems with a colleague to get 
help.

<HEADLINE> Lauryn Hill Win Big at MTV Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pavarotti was out and Puff Daddy was in. Instead  
of the Three Tenors, rappers Eminem, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg were in 
the (opera) house. And in the end, there was no fat lady to be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it was Lauryn Hill, the svelte hip hop artist, who  
capped off Thursday night's 1999 MTV Video Music Awards, the garish 
annual extravaganza that relocated for one night to the staid 
Metropolitan Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill captured awards for best video, female video, R&AMP;B video and  
art direction. And she graciously accepted the evening's final 
award -- for best video -- after surprise presenter Paul McCartney 
inexplicably introduced her as ``some guy named Lawrence Hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing rose-colored glasses, Hill also performed her song  
``Everything is Everything'' on the stage typically reserved for 
the music of Wagner or Handel. 
</P>
<P>
	Presenters from Tupac Shakur's mother, Afeni, to actress Heather  
Locklear handed out MTV's astronaut statues, honoring videos that 
aired on the network between June 1998 and June 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Hill as the night's big winners were British dance  
artist Fatboy Slim, who collected three awards for his ``Praise 
You'' video; Ricky Martin, who won twice for his ubiquitous 
``Livin' La Vida Loca''; and Korn, which captured a pair of statues 
for its ``Freak on a Leash'' video, a technological marvel that 
featured a slow-motion animated bullet. 
</P>
<P>
	The MTV crowd, renowned in the past for rude and lascivious  
behavior, toned down its act at the tonier venue. Guests strolled 
down a red carpet and up a spiral staircase, walking past an 
enormous chandelier. The MTV censor, ordinarily busy during the 
live broadcast, had a virtual night off. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, when Blink 182 performed outside the opera house before  
the show, Lincoln Center hosted its first mosh pit. 
</P>
<P>
	Host Chris Rock, opening the show, joked that he was the first  
black man to appear on the Met stage ``without a mop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And later, Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee -- sporting only an  
overcoat and a knit wool hat -- visited the press room to flash his 
love, Pamela Anderson Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	Madonna, after winning an award for her salacious Austin Powers'  
video ``Beautiful Stranger,'' returned to the stage accompanied by 
male impersonators dressed in a retrospective series of outfits 
from her videos. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I have to say,'' she declared, ``is it takes a real man to  
fill my shoes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The viewer's choice award, selected by MTV viewers, went to the  
chart-topping Backstreet Boys -- the boy band's only victory despite 
four nominations. Korn, despite its two trophies, lost in seven 
other categories. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the evening's other major category winners were Eminem  
for new artist, Will Smith for male video and the Beastie Boys for 
hip hop. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beastie Boys' Adam Horovitz, accepting his award, addressed  
the topic of sexual assault, urging musicians to speak with 
promoters about protecting women at concerts, after the reports of 
rapes at Woodstock '99. 
</P>
<P>
	Buddy Hackett, after making a brief appearance on stage, may  
have summed up the event best. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought they went through an awful lot of trouble,'' the  
75-year-old comedian deadpanned backstage, ``to show me that my 
generation had ended.''

<HEADLINE> VW To Introduce Cheaper Beetle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WOLFSBURG, Germany (AP) -- Volkswagen said Friday it plans to  
offer its New Beetle in Germany next year with two new engine 
options: one smaller and cheaper, the other a souped-up turbo. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Beetle currently is available with a 115-horsepower gas  
engine and a 90-horsepower diesel. But company spokesman Hans-Gerd 
Bode said VW would present two new gas engines -- 100-horsepower and 
a turbocharged 150-horsepower -- at next week's Frankfurt Auto Show. 
</P>
<P>
	The smaller engine will help cut about $2,700 from the base  
price of $19,200, Bode said in a statement. The bigger one is about 
$1,200 more. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Beetle has been a wild hit in the United States, where  
it starts at $15,200. But sales have been slower in Germany, 
largely because of the higher price, dealers say.

<HEADLINE> Gore Greets Children, Not Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CENTRAL FALLS, R.I. (AP) -- It was Vice President Al Gore, not  
Republican presidential hopeful George W. Bush, who greeted 
children at a local elementary school Friday. His slogan: ``Kids 
over cash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic presidential hopeful deftly changed his campaign  
schedule to talk to the mostly Hispanic students at the Ella Risk 
School after Bush canceled his visit Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad weather delayed the GOP front-runner's plane and he chose to  
attend his only other campaign stop in Rhode Island -- a 
$1,000-plate fund raiser in Providence. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island's Republican governor, Lincoln Almond, stood in for  
Bush at the school Thursday. He said Bush's cancellation is ``not 
even a blip''on his campaign record, and political analysts agreed 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gore's campaign did their best to use the visit to score  
some political points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll choose kids over cash every day. Our campaign is driven  
more by compassion than conservatism,'' Gore spokesman Chris Lehane 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a crowded, hot auditorium, Gore took off his suit jacket,  
greeted students in Spanish and knelt down to give high-fives 
before he left. 
</P>
<P>
	Eager for the ``kiddie press conference'' that was scheduled for  
Bush's visit, children asked questions on everything from Gore's 
daily tasks to the kind of car he drives -- a Mercury Sable. When 
one little girl asked if he liked being vice president, Gore said, 
``I like it. It's fun but I think president would be even better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers chuckled at Gore's jokes and students said ``he was a  
nice guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They always say that he is stiff but I didn't see that at  
all,'' said teacher Sue Rouleau. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know he spoke Spanish,'' said fifth grader Taisha  
Gonzalez, translating the message. ``He told us that in his family, 
education is important and that in all families -- Puerto Rican and 
Dominican -- education should be important too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Central Falls, a city of 17,000, has the state's highest  
child-poverty rate. At least a third of the city's residents are 
Latino and Bush had planned to show off his rapport with the 
Hispanic community. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island's Democratic Party Chairman William Lynch said  
Bush's cancellation was ``a monumental blunder by the Bush campaign 
and we took advantage of that absolutely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's spokesperson said the governor had no other choice but to  
cancel the school visit and criticized Gore for stealing his 
thunder. 
</P>
<P>
	``It even looks desperate,'' Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said.  
</P>
<P>
	The good news for the Bush campaign is that the ``political  
blunder'' is likely to only be a temporary embarrassment -- at least 
in Rhode Island, said political observer at the University of Rhode 
Island Marc Genest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rhode Island is inconsequential in the Republican Primary. You  
can afford to lose,'' Genest said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Genest says there may be one lasting affect in a  
presidential race that still has a long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``It reinforced the idea that (Bush) is a moneymaking machine  
and nothing else,'' Genest said. 
</P>
<P>
	Darrell West, a political science professor at Brown University,  
agreed Bush's no show was a mistake and said Gore's visit was 
blatant grandstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	``But grandstanding works.'' West said. ``And kids over cash is  
a catchy sound bite.''

<HEADLINE> Tax Cuts May Stay Alive in Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A limited tax measure Congress must pass this  
year could provide a last-ditch opportunity for at least some tax 
relief to survive from the 10-year, $792 billion Republican plan 
President Clinton is poised to veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The smaller, must-pass measure -- called the ``extenders''  
package on Capitol Hill -- would renew several already-expired tax 
credits favored by business, including a research and development 
credit popular with high-tech companies and manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders say it is highly unlikely Congress will pass a  
second major tax cut bill this year after Clinton's veto, expected 
as early as next week. But they unanimously support extension of 
the business credits, as do most Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``The extenders are something that we're going to have to work  
on,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ``That's nuts and 
bolts stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over 10 years, the doomed $792 billion bill would have reduced  
all income tax rates by 1 percentage point, eased the marriage 
penalty on many two-income couples, eliminated estate taxes and the 
alternative minimum income tax, reduced capital gains taxes, 
expanded pension and 401(k) laws and provided numerous business tax 
breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would have renewed the business credits, which Congress  
extends only a year or so at a time in part to ensure there will be 
an annual engine to drive the tax debate. The credits, which 
expired June 30, include those that encourage businesses to hire 
former welfare recipients and exempt certain foreign finance 
operations from taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is whether a more modest package will move alone in  
this congressional session's final weeks or if other, broader tax 
cuts might be attached. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans want to capitalize on what they insist is a  
shift in public opinion toward tax relief caused by their August 
publicity campaign. But they don't want a dark-of-night deal with 
Clinton and the Democrats that trades tax cuts for sharp government 
spending increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we will be able to work with the president,'' said Sen.  
Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. ``I believe, in the end, we will 
have a tax cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, meanwhile, are talking more about a tax cut  
compromise now that GOP leaders have declared the issue all but 
dead for this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving for an economic conference in New Zealand,  
Clinton said his ``door is open'' to tax negotiations and that 
failure to try would indicate the GOP always intended to use taxes 
as a 2000 campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether there is a bill, of course, is up to them,'' the  
president said. ``They can control what bills come up. But if 
they're saying, well, 'It's our way or no way,' then that is 
evidence that this has been pretty much about politics all along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas,  
said the tax bill is not merely a political document and he wants 
to see ``as much tax relief as possible for the American people'' 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if Republicans do negotiate with the president, Archer  
said it will be difficult to resolve philosophical differences on 
tax relief. The GOP, he said, wants to cut income taxes for people 
who pay them -- middle- and upper-class taxpayers -- while Clinton 
favors a variety of credits geared toward working classes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to see tax relief go to the people who pay the taxes,''  
Archer said in an interview. ``They want tax relief targeted to 
people who aren't paying income taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the White House has argued that the $792 billion tax  
cut's benefits were unfairly divided, with 60 percent going to 
people in the top 10 percent income brackets. But Republicans, 
noting that some 48 million lower-earning Americans paid no income 
taxes last year, say actual taxpayers deserve a break. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration contends that roughly $250 billion of the GOP  
bill fits Clinton's goal of tax relief for the middle class, 
providing a chance for compromise if spending and Medicare reform 
are also addressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds to us like they're giving up too early,'' Office of  
Management and Budget Director Jack Lew said Friday of the GOP. 
``We're not ready to quit in terms of putting a package together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are other pressures for another tax measure, including a  
desire to fix a glitch that could cause more and more middle-class 
people who claim numerous personal credits to fall subject to the 
complex alternative minimum tax, which was enacted to prevent 
wealthy people from escaping tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's budget deal exempted personal credits -- such as the  
$500 per child credit -- from triggering the AMT. But like the 
business credits, that too has expired.

<HEADLINE> Top Dole Campaign Aide Leaves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole's most visible senior adviser  
is resigning at a critical point in her Republican presidential 
campaign, saying opportunities in the private sector are too good 
to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get to a point in your career when the prospect of less  
hours and more money is appealing,'' communications director Ari 
Fleischer said in a telephone interview Thursday. The campaign had 
planned to announce the change today, but Fleischer confirmed his 
departure after being contacted by The Associated Press and told 
that sources said he was leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer is leaving as the former American Red Cross president  
tries to build momentum from a solid third-place finish in Iowa's 
straw poll. Her public profile has been surprisingly low since the 
Aug. 14 event, but she is planning several high-profile appearances 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The departure of the top adviser could fuel speculation about  
the viability of her candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer said he is leaving on good terms.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to miss her. I think she's a great lady. I still  
think she is going to make history,'' said Fleischer, who broke the 
news to the candidate over the Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I talked to Mrs. Dole, we ended up hugging,'' Fleischer  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good man and I'm going to miss him and the campaign is  
going to miss him,'' said campaign manager Tom Daffron, who hopes 
to announce a replacement shortly. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer has casually discussed private-sector options since  
June, including the possibility of joining a trade association, a 
public relations firm or opening his own media consulting company. 
But he said he didn't want to fully explore those opportunities 
while on Dole's payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew if I started talking to people it would get out. That's  
not the way I do business. If I'm going to do something, it's going 
to be forthright,'' Fleischer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer, 38, is former communications director of the powerful  
House Ways and Means Committee. He joined the Dole campaign in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the second top aide to depart the campaign. Consultant  
Kieran Mahoney left in May, saying he wanted to spend more time 
with his family. Officials close to the situation said Mahoney was 
not satisfied with his role in the campaign.

<HEADLINE> No Chances Taken With Floyd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THE VALLEY, Anguilla (AP) -- Islanders boarded up houses and  
stocked up on emergency supplies Friday, taking no chances as 
Tropical Storm Floyd strengthened into a hurricane, even though 
forecasters said it was unlikely to hit land soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the next few days we expect it to organize and strengthen  
and it could eventually become a major hurricane,'' said 
meteorologist Todd Kimberlain of the National Hurricane Center in 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane did not pose any immediate threat to the United  
States. At 5 p.m. EDT, Floyd was moving farther away from land, 
centered about 250 miles northeast of Anguilla in the eastern 
Caribbean. It was expected to continue moving northwest at near 12 
mph through the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane force winds extended about 70 miles from the storm's  
center, and tropical storm force winds extended another 175 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was north of the Leeward Islands, the U.S. and British  
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, but some islands could experience 
tropical storm conditions, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
	The governments of Antigua, Barbuda, Anguilla, Dutch St.  
Maarten, French St. Martin and St. Barthelemy issued tropical storm 
watches. 
</P>
<P>
	In Anguilla, the government closed schools and residents put up  
hurricane shutters despite sunny skies, in case the storm veered in 
their direction. Ports and airports remained open. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on what I saw, the people are taking this thing serious.  
They are shopping mostly for dry foods, and batteries, which are 
essential during a hurricane,'' said Lee Brooks, manager of a 
supermarket in The Valley, capital of the British island. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather also was mild in Barbuda, with light rain in the  
morning but clear skies later, said hotel worker Ruth Henry. 
Schools and businesses remained open.

	``All along we were told Floyd wouldn't be of any consequence to  
us,'' Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was too early to tell if the storm would threaten the  
Bahamas, which lie far north of other Caribbean islands, Kimberlain 
said. Floyd is expected to be east of the Bahamas in about three 
days, he said.

<HEADLINE> 15 More Held in Airport Drug Sting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Airport workers accused of trying to smuggle drugs  
into the United States were apparently unfazed by a recent bust of 
other employees on the same charges, federal authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people were brazen enough to think they could continue  
doing this,'' said U.S. Customs special Agent Frank Figueroa. ``I 
suspect that with this second roundup ... the word is out on the 
tarmac.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen people were arrested early Thursday on charges of  
conspiring to smuggle drugs aboard flights arriving at Miami 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests stem from a large sting operation -- the second in as  
many weeks -- sprung by federal law enforcement agents to catch 
airport workers exploiting their access to smuggle drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubbed Operation Ramp Rats II and Operation ICon (for Internal  
Conspiracy), the year-long interagency investigations featured 
undercover agents using fake cocaine to catch those arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them were ramp workers, supervisors and others employed by  
contractors that provided services to most airlines at the airport, 
U.S. Attorney Thomas E. Scott said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Surveillance photos showed workers diverting cocaine-laden  
luggage and circumventing inspections by Customs before making a 
handoff to an undercover agent posing as smuggler. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspects charged agents $2,000 per 2.2 pounds of cocaine  
delivered, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that real cocaine was not used does not matter,''  
Scott said. ``These folks believed it was real cocaine and treated 
it as real cocaine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of the suspects were rounded up at their homes early  
Thursday, said Brent Eaton, a Drug Enforcement Administration 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	They face anywhere from up to 15 years to life in prison on  
various charges including conspiracy to import cocaine into the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 25, federal agents sprung Operation Ramp Rats, indicting  
59 people on drug and weapons conspiracies charges, including 30 
American baggage handlers and ground crew workers at Miami 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged smugglers hid bogus cocaine in food carts, garbage  
bags and carry-on luggage, and dozens of workers gained easy access 
to secure areas by flashing their ID badges. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's bust, employees worked at four different companies  
that service the aircraft industry at the airport -- Evergreen 
Aviation Ground Logistics Enterprises, Inc., American Sales and 
Management Organization, RS Investigations, Inc. and Dispatch 
Service, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The employees are alleged to have transported what they believed  
was cocaine aboard Bahamas Air, Ecuatoriana and Air Aruba flights, 
according to criminal complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an ongoing problem,'' said Figueroa. ``Everything is  
cyclical as we continue to work here there will be someone else 
trying to figure out how to beat Customs.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-NBAer Wingfield Sentenced to Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Dontonio Wingfield, who had a limited stay in  
the NBA, was sentenced today to a year in prison after pleading 
guilty to assaulting two suburban Cincinnati police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wingfield, 25, was arrested Thursday when he showed up two days  
late for his originally scheduled sentencing in Hamilton County 
Common Pleas Court. 
</P>
<P>
	He was jailed overnight before today's sentencing.  
</P>
<P>
	The case goes back to August 1998 when Wingfield fought with the  
police officers when they arrived in response to a report of his 
dispute with a girlfriend at her apartment. Police said Wingfield 
resisted arrest, injuring one of the officers. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, the same judge, who sentenced him, David Davis,  
ordered Wingfield arrested when he failed to show up for a court 
appearance. Wingfield arrived a week late, but Davis threw out the 
arrest warrant. 
</P>
<P>
	Early Wednesday, Wingfield was involved in a one-car accident in  
suburban Cincinnati. Greenhills police said Wingfield told them he 
blacked out shortly before his car struck a utility pole. 
Wingfield, who was not seriously hurt, was cited for failure to 
control his vehicle and failure to display a driver's license, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	He played for the University of Cincinnati in the 1993-94  
season. He left after his freshman year and played for the Seattle 
SuperSonics and Portland Trail Blazers. Portland released him last 
year.

<HEADLINE> Safeway Acquires Randalls Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Shareholders of grocery giant Safeway Inc. have  
approved the chain's acquisition of privately held Randalls Food 
Markets Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is expected to close shortly, at which time Randalls  
chief executive officer Randall Onstead Jr. will step down but 
remain available as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Lazaran, a Randalls senior vice president, will be named  
president of the new Safeway division, the companies said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Randall Onstead has done a superb job as CEO,'' said Steven A.  
Burd, chief executive officer of Safeway. ``Under his leadership, 
Randalls has enhanced its reputation as one of the finest regional 
food retailers in the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Onstead said the absorption of his family's stores into Safeway  
was a ``critical step'' in ensuring the chain's viability. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having the opportunity to run the business my father and his  
partners started over 33 years ago has been a dream come true for 
me,'' Onstead said. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston-based Randalls operates 116 stores in the Houston,  
Dallas-Fort Worth and Austin areas with annual sales of $2.6 
billion. The stores in Dallas-Fort Worth carry the Tom Thumb and 
Simon David names. 
</P>
<P>
	Pleasanton, Calif.-based Safeway boasts annual sales of more  
than $27 billion from 1,534 stores in the United States and Canada. 
Randalls' 18,000-plus employees will join Safeway's approximately 
169,000 workers.

<HEADLINE> IEA Sees Demand for Oil Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Robust growth in the U.S. economy and a continued  
recovery in Asia should cause demand for oil to outstrip available 
supplies through the winter, so long as OPEC members resist the 
temptation to exceed current production levels, according to a 
respected industry survey. 
</P>
<P>
	But the monthly report released Friday by the International  
Energy Agency raised uncertainties about the direction of prices, 
which have been rebounding from 12-year lows last winter. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of Brent crude oil from the North Sea has more than  
doubled since February, while the price of U.S. gasoline has soared 
31 percent since February, when the national average dropped just 
below $1 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. government report Friday on inflation at the wholesale  
level said energy costs surged 3.7 percent in August, the biggest 
one-month gain since a 5.5 percent rise in April. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, higher prices have tempted some OPEC members to  
cheat on their quotas by pumping more oil in an effort to maximize 
short-term profits. Such cheating could lead to a glut of oil that 
would in turn cause prices to fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The IEA survey assumed that the Organization of the Petroleum  
Exporting Countries, which produces almost two-fifths of the 
world's oil, would stick to its current levels of production for 
the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paris-based IEA is part of the Organization for Economic  
Cooperation and Development, a group of the world's most developed 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Its report suggested that some of the recent increase in prices  
might not be justified. It noted that the world's wealthiest 
countries barely reduced their oil supplies in July, when they 
tapped inventories by what the IEA called a ``meager'' 70,000 
barrels a day. This means that an expected decline in oil supplies 
in the third-quarter is off to ``a very slow start,'' the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But as temperatures start to cool, a seasonal increase in demand  
for heating oil should help keep prices high. 
</P>
<P>
	West Texas Intermediate crude, the benchmark oil in the United  
States, rose 5 percent last month and climbed to $23.55 a barrel 
Friday in New York, more than twice the Dec. 11, 1998 low of $10.65 
and the highest close on the New York Mercantile Exchange since 
February 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The upward spike in energy prices has contributed to heightened  
worries about inflation at the Federal Reserve, which has twice 
raised U.S. interest rates this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Global demand for oil is expected to increase by 2.43 million  
barrels per day in the last quarter of the year, while supplies are 
forecast to rise by just 1 million barrels during the same period, 
the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
	World oil production averaged 73.15 million barrels per day last  
month, a drop of 200,000 barrels per day from July. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the main causes for this decrease were a daily  
production cut of 150,000 barrels by OPEC's biggest producer, Saudi 
Arabia, and fewer exports by suppliers in the former Soviet Union. 
Temporary closures of oil rigs in Norway due to maintenance work 
also had an effect. 
</P>
<P>
	By far the biggest variable in the agency's outlook is OPEC,  
which so far has shown an unusual degree of discipline in sticking 
to output cuts adopted by its members in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The IEA estimated that the cartel's compliance rate with those  
cuts continued to be high in August, at 92 percent. OPEC's 
compliance rate in July was revised downwards from 91 percent to 89 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some industry analysts cast doubt on the IEA's  
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the whole, I would say the OPEC numbers are too  
conservative,'' said Mehdi Varzi of the investment bank Dresdner 
Kleinwort Benson. 
</P>
<P>
	Varzi said OPEC's actual compliance rate is no better than 85  
percent, a view that suggests some members might be slipping back 
into a habit of cheating on their quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Redway, of the brokerage Greig Middleton and Co. Ltd., said  
OPEC's compliance rate could actually be in ``the high 80s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria, historically one of OPEC's less-disciplined members,  
saw its monthly output fall in August for the third month in a row. 
The IEA attributed this decline to disruptions caused by civil 
strife in southern Nigeria, where most of the country's oil is 
produced. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Iran -- OPEC's No. 2 producer -- boosted its  
output last month by an estimated 110,000 barrels per day. Kuwait, 
Qatar and Algeria increased their production by smaller amounts, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC members will meet Sept. 22 in Vienna, Austria, to decide  
whether to change their levels of production.

<HEADLINE> Lauryn Hill Win Big at MTV Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pavarotti was out and Puff Daddy was in. Instead  
of the Three Tenors, rappers Eminem, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg were in 
the (opera) house. And in the end, there was no fat lady to be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it was Lauryn Hill, the svelte hip hop artist, who  
capped off Thursday night's 1999 MTV Video Music Awards, the garish 
annual extravaganza that relocated for one night to the staid 
Metropolitan Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill captured awards for best video, female video, R&AMP;B video and  
art direction. And she graciously accepted the evening's final 
award -- for best video -- after surprise presenter Paul McCartney 
inexplicably introduced her as ``some guy named Lawrence Hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing rose-colored glasses, Hill also performed her song  
``Everything is Everything'' on the stage typically reserved for 
the music of Wagner or Handel. 
</P>
<P>
	Presenters from Tupac Shakur's mother, Afeni, to actress Heather  
Locklear handed out MTV's astronaut statues, honoring videos that 
aired on the network between June 1998 and June 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Hill as the night's big winners were British dance  
artist Fatboy Slim, who collected three awards for his ``Praise 
You'' video; Ricky Martin, who won twice for his ubiquitous 
``Livin' La Vida Loca''; and Korn, which captured a pair of statues 
for its ``Freak on a Leash'' video, a technological marvel that 
featured a slow-motion animated bullet. 
</P>
<P>
	The MTV crowd, renowned in the past for rude and lascivious  
behavior, toned down its act at the tonier venue. Guests strolled 
down a red carpet and up a spiral staircase, walking past an 
enormous chandelier. The MTV censor, ordinarily busy during the 
live broadcast, had a virtual night off. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, when Blink 182 performed outside the opera house before  
the show, Lincoln Center hosted its first mosh pit. 
</P>
<P>
	Host Chris Rock, opening the show, joked that he was the first  
black man to appear on the Met stage ``without a mop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And later, Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee -- sporting only an  
overcoat and a knit wool hat -- visited the press room to flash his 
love, Pamela Anderson Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	Madonna, after winning an award for her salacious Austin Powers'  
video ``Beautiful Stranger,'' returned to the stage accompanied by 
male impersonators dressed in a retrospective series of outfits 
from her videos. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I have to say,'' she declared, ``is it takes a real man to  
fill my shoes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The viewer's choice award, selected by MTV viewers, went to the  
chart-topping Backstreet Boys -- the boy band's only victory despite 
four nominations. Korn, despite its two trophies, lost in seven 
other categories. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the evening's other major category winners were Eminem  
for new artist, Will Smith for male video and the Beastie Boys for 
hip hop. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beastie Boys' Adam Horovitz, accepting his award, addressed  
the topic of sexual assault, urging musicians to speak with 
promoters about protecting women at concerts, after the reports of 
rapes at Woodstock '99. 
</P>
<P>
	Buddy Hackett, after making a brief appearance on stage, may  
have summed up the event best. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought they went through an awful lot of trouble,'' the  
75-year-old comedian deadpanned backstage, ``to show me that my 
generation had ended.''

<HEADLINE> MTV Sets Ratings Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- This year's MTV Video Music Awards drew the  
highest rating ever for an entertainment program on cable 
television, the music channel said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 12 million people watched Thursday night's awards  
show held at the Metropolitan Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming to the Met had such a great buzz,'' said Van Toffler,  
MTV's general manager. ``We've never been to such a wonderful, 
classy environment. The expectations were high that we might trash 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They didn't, but the Met hosted performances by Kid Rock and  
Snoop Dog, a dozen male Madonna impersonators and teen-ager Britney 
Spears. Hip-hop star Lauryn Hill was the big winner with four video 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratings for the show were up 37 percent over last year's show  
held in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Toffler credited a strong year in music, particularly with rap,  
teen-aged pop and hard rock, and stars who were accessible to the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Thursday, the highest-rated entertainment show on cable  
was USA's airing of ``Moby Dick'' two years ago, MTV said. The 
previously most-watched MTV Video Awards show was in 1990. This was 
its 16th year.

<HEADLINE> Rembrandt Found After Reward Raised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- The museum from which paintings by  
Rembrandt and Giovanni Bellini were stolen this year had to 
quintuple its original reward offer in order to recover them, a 
spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nivaagaard Collection museum initially offered a reward of  
$50,000 for information leading to the recovery of the two 
paintings after they were stolen in January. 
</P>
<P>
	But the museum eventually paid $286,000 to get the paintings  
back last month. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, ``we got a hint about the whereabouts of the  
paintings,'' said Ebbe Simonsen, a spokesman for the private museum 
north of Copenhagen. ``But a larger reward was needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, police arrested two men in Copenhagen as they were  
negotiating to sell the paintings. 
</P>
<P>
	The reward money was paid to four persons, including ``a  
middleman'' in an unnamed European country, Simonsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The small museum near Hoersholm, 15 miles north of Copenhagen,  
focuses on 16th and 17th century art. The two paintings were not 
protected by alarms or surveillance systems.

<HEADLINE> Indians Reach Slot Machine Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Leaders of at least 57 tribes signed  
agreements with the state Friday that will allow them to keep slot 
machines operating at Indian-run casinos while voters consider 
amending the California Constitution to legalize such gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreements ward off a Justice Department threat to enforce a  
federal court order that would have shut down the tribes' slots and 
low-stakes blackjack games in mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribes voted late Thursday and early Friday to sign the  
agreements. A major break came when Gov. Gray Davis, labor-friendly 
legislators and tribal leaders agreed to deal separately with the 
issue of whether unions can try to organize casino workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The state agreed to allow slot machines to continue operating  
after the Indians consented to a cap of no more than about 43,000 
of the devices. An estimated 20,000 are in use now. 
</P>
<P>
	``It balances the interests of the Indian people and the other  
people of this great state,'' Davis said. ``And for those tribes 
that adopt it, this compact offers security and economic promise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreements were awaiting endorsement from state legislators,  
who planned to approve them before adjourning Friday. Lawmakers 
also gave final approval to the constitutional amendment that would 
go before voters in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest known holdout among California's Indian tribes was  
the Agua Caliente band, whose 1,200-slot casino in Palm Springs is 
one of the state's largest. The tribe is pressing for unlimited 
gambling at Indian casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	The casinos faced an Oct. 13 shutdown because of a state Supreme  
Court ruling last month. The high court overturned Proposition 5, 
the 1998 voter-approved measure that allowed gambling machines and 
certain card games at Indian casinos. The justices said the 
California Constitution bans such Las Vegas-style gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the ruling, a federal judge in Los Angeles had  
ordered some casinos closed. But federal prosecutors said that if 
tribes and the state demonstrated a good-faith effort to reach 
agreements, they would hold off enforcing the order until voters 
could consider an amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada casinos, which have more than 200,000 slot machines, have  
fought the introduction of Las Vegas-style gambling at Indian 
casinos because they don't want the competition. Indian tribes say 
they desperately need the money; many have already become rich from 
casino gambling.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Moves To Expand Gay Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The California legislature passed  
major gay-rights legislation in the closing hours of its 1999 
session Friday, including a bill that would prohibit discrimination 
of gay students and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Assemblywoman Sheila Kuehl, who is openly lesbian, said the  
legislation is necessary to curb violence aimed at gay teens and 
teens who are picked on because others think they are gay. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are thousands of students in this state who are  
suffering every day from harassment in school ... because they are 
different or people think they are gay or lesbian,'' Kuehl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another bill passed Friday would create a state domestic  
partners registry for gay couples and let state and local 
government workers get health benefits for their partners. 
</P>
<P>
	A third bill would move state laws prohibiting discrimination  
against gays in employment and housing into the state's main civil 
rights law. 
</P>
<P>
	California Gov. Gray Davis plans to sign the domestic registry  
bill, but he does not yet have a position on the others, 
spokeswoman Hilary McLean said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuehl's bill would add sexual orientation to a state education  
law that already bars discrimination in public schools and colleges 
based on race, ethnicity, gender or disability. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill doesn't prescribe a punishment, but by adding sexual  
orientation to state law, it make it easier for parents or students 
to sue harassers or schools where harassment occurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts has a similar law, and Kuehl said about half of  
California's public school districts have similar policies. 
</P>
<P>
	A Centers for Disease Control study of more than 8,000 high  
school students found one in 13 were targets of violence because 
other students thought they were homosexual, Kuehl said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When society allows harassment and discrimination to go  
unchecked in our educational institutions, we create a climate in 
which incidents of hate violence can flourish,'' said James 
Wagoner, president of Advocates for Youth, a Washington, D.C.-based 
group supporting the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents said the bill would force schools to advocate a  
homosexual lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Moms and dads don't send their children to school to learn  
from homosexual role models,'' said Randy Thomasson of Capitol 
Resource Institute, a conservative religious-oriented group 
opposing the bill.

<HEADLINE> Judge Halts Racial Busing in N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A federal judge on Friday ordered an end  
to busing and other means of achieving racial balance in 
Charlotte-Mecklenburg, the school system that pioneered urban 
busing in the United States after a landmark Supreme Court ruling 
30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest in a series of court rulings against plans  
that aimed to desegregate school systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven white parents had sued North Carolina's largest school  
system after a half-white, half-Hispanic student was barred from a 
magnet program that used race as a factor in admissions. The 1997 
lawsuit challenged all of the school district's 
classroom-assignment policies, including busing. 
</P>
<P>
	In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Robert Potter said the school  
system, which is 40 percent black, remedied past segregation 
``quite some time ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He ordered the district to stop ``assigning children to schools  
or allocating educational opportunities and benefits through 
race-based lotteries, preferences, set-asides or other means that 
deny students an equal footing based on race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The school board hasn't decided whether to appeal. It has 30  
days to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Other U.S. cities have also been freed from court-ordered  
desegregation plans in recent years, including Cleveland, Denver 
and Norfolk, Va. The Charlotte case was different, however, because 
while other districts sought to end court-ordered busing, Charlotte 
did not. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nightmare of forced busing is finally coming to an end,''  
said Clint Bolick of the Washington-based Institute for Justice, a 
conservative legal group. ``Busing has ravaged inner-school 
districts all across the nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Charlotte district has been busing many of its 100,000  
students to achieve racial balance since the 1969 Supreme Court 
case, Swann vs. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, led to 
court-ordered busing in several cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Luke Largess, a lawyer for two black families in that case who  
joined the school district in the 1997 lawsuit, said his clients 
will appeal if the school district doesn't. He said the judge 
overstepped his authority. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the decision won't end busing in Charlotte.  
</P>
<P>
	``Charlotte planned its schools in such a way that they're still  
going to have to bus, because they don't have enough seats in black 
schools,'' Largess said. ``Black kids are going to have to ride 
buses for the next five to 10 years until they get the schools 
built.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's ruling, which would take effect in the next school  
year, said the district has ``complied with the 30-year-old 
desegregation order in good faith; that racial imbalances existing 
in schools today are no longer vestiges of the dual system; and 
that it is unlikely that the school board will return to an 
intentionally segregative system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Potter said the schools have achieved racial balance.  
</P>
<P>
	Among other cities that have dismantled busing plans is Omaha,  
Neb., which in May passed a $254 million bond issue to help rebuild 
schools. The renovations were necessary after officials decided to 
end 23 years of forced busing and return students to neighborhood 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In Boston, the school board voted in July to end race-based  
busing beginning with the next school year. Busing there began with 
a federal court's desegregation court order 25 years ago, but the 
district is now about 85 percent minority. 
</P>
<P>
	The Charlotte ruling came after Bill Capacchione sued the school  
board because his daughter Cristina was twice denied admission to 
the communications magnet program at Olde Providence Elementary 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	Cristina, who is half-white and half-Hispanic, fell into the  
``non-black'' category the school system uses to allot magnet 
seats. Capacchione said Cristina's constitutional rights were 
violated. 
</P>
<P>
	School board member Jim Puckett said the ruling will give  
parents the choice of sending their children to neighborhood 
schools or magnet programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents openly have to have the choice, and up until now we  
haven't had that choice,'' he said. ``This is a return to a school 
system which is based on constitutional principles.''

	Storms rumbled across the Plains on Friday, while much of the  
rest of the country enjoyed fair weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Warm and moist air pumped into the central Plains from the Gulf  
of Mexico. This moisture combined with a very unstable atmosphere 
led to the development of thunderstorms across portions of Kansas 
and northeastern Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Thunderstorms with lightning and heavy rain stretched across  
northeastern Oklahoma, southeastern Kansas, and northwest Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	A large area of the Northeast was covered by showers and some  
embedded thunderstorms. Rain extended from southern Maine, New 
Hampshire, Vermont and northeastern New York south into coastal 
areas of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Atlantic Ocean, Tropical Storm Floyd strengthened into a  
hurricane, even though forecasters said it is unlikely to hit land 
in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	High pressure brought fair and dry weather to regions from the  
Ohio Valley, south across the Tennessee Valley and the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	In the West, most areas along the coast were reporting clear or  
partly cloudy skies and dry weather. Fair and dry weather continued 
across the Desert-Southwest, the Pacific Northwest and the 
California coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures across the Lower 48 ranged from a low of 32 in  
Hettinger, N.D., to an early-afternoon high of 95 in Yuma, Ariz. 
With the heat index, it felt like 104 in Marathon, Fla.

<HEADLINE> Md. Dad Charged in Child's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Md. (AP) -- A man who had told his estranged wife he  
was taking their children to the beach instead shot them both as 
they sat buckled in their car seats, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-year-old boy was killed while the 3-year-old girl was  
critically injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Wayne Spicknall II, 27, was charged with murder Thursday  
and held without bond. He originally told police he was carjacked 
by a hitchhiker who forced him to jump in a river and then drove 
off with his children. 
</P>
<P>
	State Police Maj. Greg Shipley said Spicknall confessed to the  
shooting after police, suspicious of his story, prepared a search 
warrant for his home in Laurel, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation began about 2:40 a.m., when Spicknall called  
police to report that an armed hitchhiker he picked up on a bridge 
over the Choptank River on Wednesday night had thrown him into the 
water 25 feet below, and that his car and children were missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Spicknall called police from a fishing pier more than three  
hours after he said he was thrown into the river. Police found him 
at the phone, dripping wet. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said construction workers found the car around 8 a.m.  
Thursday, parked behind a house about a half mile from the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Troopers had to break into the locked car to get to the  
children, both of whom had been shot in the chest at close range. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Spicknall III was pronounced dead at Dorchester General  
Hospital. Destiny Array Spicknall was flown by helicopter to the 
University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore, where she was 
in critical condition, said Dr. Duane Tull, general surgeon at 
Dorchester. 
</P>
<P>
	Spicknall was charged with first-degree murder, attempted  
murder, first degree assault and use of a handgun in the commission 
of a felony. Talbot County Commissioner Sue Shortall said Spicknall 
could face the death penalty if convicted of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they had not found the murder weapon and had not  
established a motive. 
</P>
<P>
	Spicknall is separated from the children's mother, Lisa  
Spicknall, 24. He told police he was taking his children to see 
their grandparents in Ocean City when he stopped for the 
hitchhiker, whom he described as an older, bearded white man 
wearing a tan T-shirt and blue jeans. 
</P>

	Cambridge is 50 miles southeast of Baltimore on Maryland's  
Eastern Shore.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Higher, Gold Falls in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The U.S. dollar rebounded in European trading,  
recovering from a three-year low against the yen after Japan's 
central bank moved to slow the yen's rise. Gold fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose to 109.00 yen in late European trading from  
107.67 yen Thursday. The dollar had dropped as low as 107.65 yen 
earlier today in Tokyo, the lowest level since August 1996, before 
the Bank of Japan began buying dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials fear that if the yen rises too far, it will  
slow the country's recovery from the steepest recession since World 
War II. A rising yen makes Japanese goods more expensive on world 
markets, making it tougher for manufacturers to export products. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0488 in late European trading, down  
from $1.0544 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, in afternoon trading in New York, the euro slid to  
$1.0391, while the dollar was worth 108.83 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,  
included 1.5287 Swiss francs, up from 1.5174; and 1.4812 Canadian 
dollars, down from 1.4815. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound was quoted at $1.6269, down from $1.6320.  
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately, though they remain in use. Based on euro 
rates, the dollar is worth 1.8648 German marks, up from 1.8549; 
6.2544 French francs, up from 6.2211; 2.1012 Dutch guilders, up 
from 2.0900; 1,846.18 Italian lire, up from 1,836.37. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold closed in London at $255.90 bid per troy ounce, down from  
$256.80 on Thursday. In Zurich the bid price was $255.65, down from 
$256.75. Gold fell 30 cents in Hong Kong to $256.35. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver closed in London at $5.17 bid per troy ounce, down from  
$5.21.

<HEADLINE> Hechinger Closing 177 Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Md. (AP) -- The Hechinger Co. will close its remaining 177  
stores and sell off its assets to pay creditors of the home 
improvement retailer, the company announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hechinger filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection June 11 in  
Wilmington, Del., saying at the time that it planned to close 89 
underperforming stores in 36 markets. The company said improvements 
in sales since the filing were not enough to provide enough cash 
flow to reorganize. 
</P>
<P>
	Going-out-of-business sales will be held at the remaining  
Hechinger, Home Quarters and Builders Square stores and the 
company's real estate assets will be sold off, if the sales are 
approved by the bankruptcy court, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, the firm has lost market share to national  
hardware giants, Lowes and Home Depot. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was not a surprise to one retail analyst.  
</P>
<P>
	``Hechinger was pretty much doomed several years ago,'' said  
Kurt Barnard of Barnard's Retail Trend Report. 
</P>
<P>
	The hardware chain was facing ``overbearing and overly strong  
forces,'' and bad business decisions, including the takeover of 
Builders Square and the creation of larger stores, didn't help, 
Barnard said.

<HEADLINE>  'Fight Club' Packs Literal Punch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VENICE, Italy (AP) -- The first rule of the Fight Club is that  
you don't talk about the Fight Club. And it is the first rule 
people will break when they've seen the movie starring Brad Pitt 
and Edward Norton. 
</P>
<P>
	David Fincher's in-your-face ``Fight Club,'' which had its world  
premiere Friday at the Venice Film Festival, is a movie that packs 
a punch -- literally. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fight Club'' is a darkly funny, furiously fast-paced movie  
with a message of malaise: How do you beat back the numbness of a 
society where, in Pitt's words, people ``work at jobs they hate to 
buy things they don't need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's also tremendously violent.  
</P>
<P>
	Norton plays the narrator, Jack, an insomniac yuppie, and Pitt  
plays his brash, anarchic alter-ego, Tyler Durden. Together they 
create a secret society called Fight Club, where guys get together 
in a basement to beat each other to a pulp. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a guy kind of thing: a way to feel truly alive in a  
testosterone-intolerant world, to beat back modern malaise, to 
connect -- even if brutally -- with another human being. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie's escalating, graphic violence is bound to provoke  
howls in the United States, where the entertainment industry is 
being blamed, at least in part, for trends such as the recent rash 
of school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Friday, the filmmakers defended their film  
and rejected the idea that it would inspire copycat anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a problem if people start fight clubs,'' said  
Fincher, whose previous films include the gruesome but gripping 
thriller ``Seven,'' also starring Pitt, and ``The Game,'' with 
Michael Douglas. ``I do if they start blowing up buildings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Pitt and Norton were attracted by the story, which is from  
a novel of the same name by a diesel mechanic, Chuck Palahniuk, 
because it reflected their own concerns about the emptiness and 
superficiality of modern society. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not about beating someone up,'' Pitt said. ``Its about  
the experience of a punch, of pain -- and the wake-up that could 
bring .... The point was connections, directions, feelings -- an 
answer to numbness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norton garnered an Academy Award nomination for his first film,  
``Primal Fear,'' with Richard Gere, and was up again for an Oscar 
for ``American History X.'' He said ``Fight Club'' addresses the 
angst of his generation, Generation X. 
</P>
<P>
	``This expresses the depth of the paralysis, the numbness, the  
despair that I see in a lot of people I know,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two stars also rejected any suggestion that the violence in  
the film was too extreme. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a violent world that we live in,'' Pitt said. ``I don't  
know how you can ignore that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Fight Club'' opens in the United States in October, backed by  
a high-powered promotional campaign from Twentieth Century Fox.

<HEADLINE> Court To Clarify Gov't Letter Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to consider  
letting the government keep secret a letter received from British 
officials about a woman's extradition from England to face a 
criminal charge in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said it will use the case from Washington state to try  
clarifying when the Freedom of Information Act requires the 
government to release communications from foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
	The British woman's lawyer is seeking release of the letter.  
</P>
<P>
	The lawyer, Leslie R. Weatherhead of Spokane, Wash., represents  
Sally Anne Croft, a follower of Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, 
who had a commune in Oregon during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Croft was charged in Oregon with conspiring to attack a federal  
prosecutor who was investigating alleged illegal activities by 
commune members. No attack was carried out, but in 1994 Croft was 
extradited from Britain to face the conspiracy charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing the FOIA, Weatherhead asked the Justice Department to  
release a letter from British officials about Croft's extradition. 
The State Department, after learning that British officials opposed 
release of the letter, classified it as ``confidential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weatherhead was told in 1995 that the letter would not be  
released. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyer sued in federal court in Spokane. A judge initially  
ruled for Weatherhead, but then reviewed the letter in secret and 
decided it must be withheld under the FOIA's national security 
exemption. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1998, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered  
the letter released. The court called the letter ``innocuous'' and 
said the government never identified any damage to national 
security that would result from releasing it. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, Justice Department lawyers said  
the court should have deferred to government officials' judgment 
that releasing the letter might discourage foreign governments from 
providing information to the United States.

	Puerto Rican Nationalists Freed  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Puerto Rican nationalists granted clemency  
by President Clinton began leaving prison today, including one who 
drove out of an Indiana prison in a gold Mercedes, ending a 90-year 
sentence. ``I'm elated that I'm free, here with my family,'' 
Ricardo Jimenez told reporters as he left the prison south of Terre 
Haute, Ind. His sister was among two other people in the car. Dan 
Dunne, a spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, said 11 of the 
16 people offered clemency by Clinton were being released today. 
Alejandrina Torres was released from the federal prison at Danbury, 
Conn., while Edwin Cortes left the federal penitentiary in 
Lewisburg, Pa., the bureau of prisons said.

	E. Timor U.N. Compound Besieged  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Pro-Indonesian militiamen threatened the  
U.N. compound in East Timor today, vandalizing equipment outside 
and terrifying East Timorese holed up inside after most of the U.N. 
staff was evacuated. In New York, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan 
said that martial law has failed to restore order in East Timor and 
urged Indonesia to accept foreign military help. Militiamen looted 
U.N. vehicles after the convoy of 350 U.N. staffers evacuated, the 
United Nations and witnesses told Australian Associated Press.

	Clinton: Timor Attacks Unacceptable  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today said attacks on the  
United Nations compound in East Timor are ``simply unacceptable,'' 
and accused the Indonesian military of participating in the 
violence. ``The Indonesian government and military must reverse 
this course, do everything possible to stop the violence and allow 
an international force to make possible the restoration of 
security,'' Clinton said.

	Clinton Seeks Israel-Syria Accord  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Syria's tough stand on recovering the Golan  
Heights could prompt President Clinton into more direct involvement 
in Mideast peacemaking, U.S. officials say. If Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright and senior U.S. envoy Dennis B. Ross are unable 
to work out a peace formula between Syria and Israel, the president 
may feel compelled to get personally involved and stake his legacy 
on the outcome. Ross is due to go to Israel on Monday for the 
ceremonial opening of negotiations between Israel and the 
Palestinians on an overall settlement. The visit will provide an 
opportunity for talks with Israeli and Egyptian officials.

	GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Israel transferred 7 percent of the  
West Bank to Palestinian administrative control today, three days 
ahead of schedule. The handover, concluding the first stage of a 
new Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, took the Palestinians a step 
closer to their ultimate goal of statehood and boosted trust 
between the two sides after years deadlock and broken promises.

	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- America Online Inc. announced a shakeup

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Symphony is not only offering a  
free concert Sunday, but an opportunity for the audience -- both 
kids and grownups -- to touch the trumpets, violins and other 
instruments. There will be American music by such composers as 
George Gershwin, Leonard Bernstein and Samuel Barber, and a new 
work by Stephen Paulus in honor of the 200th anniversary of George 
Washington's death. After the symphonic concert, members of the

	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Knicks center Patrick Ewing is not  
fully recovered from his partially torn left Achilles' tendon and 
will miss training camp. The tendon is still sore and hurts, and 
he's not sure when he will be back, Ewing said yesterday at the New 
York All-Star Basketball Classic. Ewing, 37, tore the tendon in 
Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Indiana Pacers 
June 1. He missed the rest of the playoffs and the finals, where 
the Knicks lost to the San Antonio Spurs in five games.

	FBI Soon Knew of Waco Tear Gas  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A lab document that wasn't given to Congress  
discloses that the FBI knew within eight months of the deadly, 
fiery end of the 1993 Branch Davidian siege that military-style 
tear gas projectiles were used, The Associated Press has learned. A 
key final page from a 49-page FBI lab report was turned over to 
congressional committees this week, along with an internal Justice 
Department memo acknowledging it ``was not produced to Congress'' 
during its 1995 investigations into the tragedy near Waco, Texas. 
For years, government officials had denied using incendiary tear 
gas, and the possibility of a coverup is under investigation.

	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said  
in New York on Friday that martial law has failed to restore order 
in East Timor and he urged Indonesia to accept foreign military 
help. Pro-Indonesian militiamen looted the U.N. compound in East 
Timor, smashing equipment and terrifying East Timorese still inside 
after most of the U.N. staff was evacuated. East Timor's people 
voted in a landslide for independence from Indonesia on Aug. 30, 
which triggered violence by machete-swinging militias opposed to 
independence for the province.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Eleven of the 16 Puerto Rican nationalists  
granted clemency by President Clinton were being released from 
prison today, a spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons said. Most 
of those eligible for clemency were members of the ultranationalist 
FALN, responsible for some 130 bombings in the late 1970s and early 
1980s that left six dead and scores wounded. None of those offered 
clemency was directly responsible for deaths or injuries, and they 
were required to renounce violence as a condition for accepting 
clemency, officials say.

not to ``separate the motherland.'' Taiwan's military said the 
activities were routine and no cause for concern. The exercises 
reported by the Xinhua News Agency and state television appeared to 
be a mock invasion of Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade 
province to be recaptured by force if necessary.

a team of Russian officers at a joint monitoring center in Colorado 
to observe U.S. missile warning data during the Year 2000 
transition, the Pentagon said today. The Y2K Center for Strategic 
Stability will begin operating 24 hours a day with Russian and 
American monitoring teams in December. It will be terminated in

<HEADLINE> Mirror-Image QBs Meet Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Mark Brunell doesn't know Steve Young  
very well. And rarely does he consider that his game and Young's 
game are near carbon copies of each other. 
</P>
<P>
	When they play on the same field Sunday, however, the  
similarities will be hard to deny. 
</P>
<P>
	A pair of left-handers, both wearing No. 8, both mobile and both  
with great arms will meet when the San Francisco 49ers play the 
Jacksonville Jaguars in the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Some might consider it a chance for Brunell to wrest away the  
title as the best left-hander in the league. Brunell doesn't quite 
see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, I admire Steve and consider it a compliment to be  
compared to him,'' Brunell said. ``He's a fine quarterback. But I'm 
just here, doing my own thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although they won't spend a second on the field together, the  
judgment this week will be made on the final statistics and the 
final score. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the kind of stage Brunell needs to shine and take his  
game to the championship level. 
</P>
<P>
	Young is already there, with more than 32,000 yards passing, one  
Super Bowl title and a 97.6 career quarterback rating, the best in 
NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has something to prove this year, as well. When people  
say the 49ers are old, past their prime, they're including the 
37-year-old quarterback, who is a year older than Jerry Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Young's age, the 49ers haven't toned down anything in  
their offense to accommodate him. That impresses Jaguars coach Tom 
Coughlin as much as anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gets hit a lot,'' Coughlin said. ``He runs out there wide  
open on the corner. He's in the pocket, out of the pocket. They run 
the naked reverses, run the bootlegs. They do everything in their 
power to take advantage of his skill, and he takes the shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither quarterback likes to make much of the Young vs. Brunell  
debate, although both concede there are valid reasons for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't watched Mark extensively enough to know what the  
comparisons are,'' Young said. ``I just know he's efficient, he 
makes plays, he's accurate. He can throw the deep ball. That's what 
you need to have in the NFL to be successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Niners coach Steve Mariucci was quarterbacks coach at Green  
Bay, he worked out Brunell during his senior year at Washington. 
The Packers weren't in the market for a quarterback, but when 
Brunell was still available in the fifth round of the 1993 draft, 
they felt they had to take him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was, by far, the best athlete available,'' Mariucci said.  
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, the Packers traded Brunell to the Jaguars,  
where he has flourished. He has thrown for 12,512 yards and has an 
86.3 quarterback rating, listed as the fifth-best in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hated to lose him because we knew he was going to be a  
starting quarterback fast,'' Mariucci said. ``We had a tearful 
farewell. I told him I'd see him at the Pro Bowl, because I knew he 
was going to be there. And I knew I'd be playing against him sooner 
or later.''

<HEADLINE> Toronto Film Festival Has Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Schedule 320 movies over a 10-day period and  
you're going to end up with some unfortunate choices. The directors 
of this year's Toronto International Film Festival discovered that 
when they had to book a public screening of the Israeli film 
``Kadosh'' for Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Two problems:  
</P>
<P>
	--Saturday mornings are part of the Jewish Sabbath, a time of  
rest and of worship. 
</P>
<P>
	--And this Saturday is part of the Jewish New Year, Rosh  
Hashanah. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate, but there's nothing that could be done,''  
said Hussein Awarshi, owner of Mongrel Media, the movie's Canadian 
distributor. 
</P>
<P>
	Each film at the Toronto festival, which runs Sept. 9-18, gets  
two public showings and programmers try to place them a couple of 
days apart. To accommodate the schedule of director Amos Gitai, who 
was to make an appearance, the first screening ran Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday morning was the only other possible time for the second  
show. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very conscious of the problems with running it on  
Saturday, but Amos Gitai was only going to be in town a few days 
and this is what we had to do,'' said the festival's associate 
director of programming, Noah Cowan. ``We triple-checked with the 
filmmakers and they told us it was OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gitai, it turns out, didn't even make the screening. After  
arriving earlier Thursday, he quickly fell ill and flew right back 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kadosh,'' which is Hebrew for ``sacred,'' is hardly a  
celebration of Orthodox Jewish values. The third of a trilogy of 
films by Gitai about Israeli life, ``Kadosh'' is set in a highly 
religious neighborhood and openly criticizes the treatment of 
women. Gitai has called his film a statement against that country's 
religious right. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Cowan ran into a problem scheduling another  
controversial movie, ``Dogma.'' Kevin Smith's satire of 
Christianity -- rock star Alanis Morissette plays God -- already has 
been criticized by the Catholic League for Religious and Civil 
Rights as ``clearly designed to degrade and denigrate the Catholic 
culture.'' The film's original U.S. distributor, the Disney-owned 
Miramax Films, ended up selling rights to Lions Gate Films. 
</P>
<P>
	A press screening was scheduled for Saturday morning, with  
public screenings on Saturday night and Monday. But the 
distributors wanted the media to see ``Dogma'' with an audience 
first and asked that the press showing be re-scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	The only possible time? Sunday morning.

<HEADLINE> Book Recalls Berlin Spy Wars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Soviets discovered one of America's  
biggest Cold War operations -- an underground CIA tunnel in Berlin -- 
before construction even began. CIA agents in Berlin shortly after 
World War II ``paid too much attention ... to rumors, high-level 
gossip.'' East German spymaster Markus Wolf was slightly 
cross-eyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Such are the gleanings from a 634-page collection of documents  
by CIA historians on U.S. intelligence efforts in Berlin -- ground 
zero of the Cold War -- from the end of World War II until the wall 
was built in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	The book was compiled as part of a three-day conference  
beginning Friday in the German capital. Historians and former CIA 
and KGB agents will be trading tales about the intelligence wars at 
the epicenter of East-West espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA is sponsoring its first overseas conference with the  
Allied Museum of Berlin around the 10th anniversary of the fall of 
the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd Salvetti, director of the CIA's Center for the Study of  
Intelligence, calls the German capital ``arguably the hottest spot 
during the Cold War.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book, made up mainly of documents declassified in recent  
years, traces the tentative start of clandestine operations in 
Berlin after the war, the 1948 Soviet blockade of Berlin and the 
Allied airlift, a 1953 uprising by Germans in Soviet-controlled 
Berlin, the 1956 Soviet uncovering of the CIA tunnel and East 
Germany's construction of the wall. 
</P>
<P>
	The first U.S. intelligence officers in Berlin after the war  
didn't have a Russian speaker until 1947, and were frowned on by 
U.S. Military Governor Gen. Lucius Clay, who was determined to 
maintain good relations with the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
	They were denied military cover and in 1946 were down to a staff  
of only 23. ``There are still instances of immaturity, emotional 
unbalance and social inbreeding within our little community,'' said 
a 1948 memo. ``... Too much attention was paid to rumors, 
high-level gossip, political chitchat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One 1947 dinner party source, Maj. Gen. Leonid Malinin, was so  
voluble after drinking three vodkas and five whiskeys that he was 
invited back to another meal with the American ambassador. Turned 
out he was head of a major Soviet spy agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA accurately predicted before the start of the June 1948  
blockade that the Soviets were ready to try drastic means, short of 
war, to drive the Americans, British and French out of the divided 
city. The Soviets were thwarted by the Allied airlift, which flew 
up to 4,000 tons of supplies a day into Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA infiltrated a meeting after the blockade began where the  
Soviets ``evidenced a great consternation'' when they learned from 
their German allies how a counter-blockade from the West would 
cripple production in eastern Germany and cut off food exports to 
the Soviet Union. ``If we had known this, we would not have gone so 
far,'' one Soviet official was quoted as saying.	   The KGB ``was often very good at collecting information, but 
they were frequently unable to make use of that information,'' said 
Donald Steury, the CIA historian who edited the book. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA's Berlin Tunnel was an ambitious operation in 1955 to  
tap Soviet military communications. Even before construction began, 
the Soviets were tipped off by British agent George Blake, a KGB 
mole, the CIA documents indicated. But the Soviets, to protect 
Blake, didn't ``accidentally'' discover the tunnel until more than 
a year after it was built. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA analysis at the time said the discovery was ``purely  
fortuitous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf, who controlled East Germany's agents from 1953 to 1986,  
was described in a 1959 dispatch as ``slightly cross-eyed'' with a 
``casual, even sloppy'' manner. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the famous spy ``does not always exercise 100 percent  
self-control. He often left material lying on his desk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book also contains extensive CIA analyses of the crisis in  
the late 1950s, when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev's attempts to 
prop up the East German regime and weaken Western influence in West 
Germany raised real concerns of war. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA's chief agent inside the Soviet General Staff in Moscow,  
Oleg Penkovsky, says in a 1961 transcript that Khrushchev was ready 
to strike if the West didn't make concessions. 
</P>
<P>
	But a CIA analysis casts doubt on Penkovsky's remarks, saying it  
was highly unlikely the Soviets would strike first ``unless they 
were convinced that a large-scale Western attack was inevitable and 
imminent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steury said the East German move to erect the wall in August  
1961 caught both the American and Soviet intelligence communities 
by surprise, although the documents showed that the CIA had been 
predicting for some time that the communists would do something to 
seal off its section of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The wall diminished the value of CIA operations in Berlin and a  
memo in September 1961 predicted a ``drop in morale'' among agents. 
Two months later, a dispatch noted that while they were still 
working hard to monitor activities in the east, ``there is no 
practical way to conduct black operations into East Berlin in the 
face of physical barriers and patrols on the border.''

<HEADLINE> Batch of Asthma Inhalers Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A batch of prescription albuterol inhalers  
have been recalled by a Schering-Plough Corp. subsidiary because an 
asthma sufferer purchased one that was empty. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients who have filled a prescription since April for Warrick  
Pharmaceuticals' albuterol metered dose inhaler -- a generic version 
of the common asthma medication -- are urged to check if they have 
the recalled inhaler. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled inhalers bear the lot number 9-BBS-525, both on the  
box and on the albuterol canister's label. They were distributed to 
pharmacies nationwide between late April and early May, and bear an 
expiration date of August 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem could be life-threatening if an asthma patient  
discovers an empty inhaler in the midst of an asthma attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Asthma patients who have those inhalers are urged to promptly  
return them to the drugstore of purchase for a replacement.

<P>
	The company believes that a temporary glitch on the assembly  
line that filled the inhalers caused some to slip through without 
getting any drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Although some 190,000 canisters are being recalled, Warrick  
estimated that the mechanical failure was caught soon enough that 
fewer than 150 canisters will prove to be empty. Warrick said it 
believes most of the 150 canisters are already in the company's 
possession.

<HEADLINE> Judge Halts Racial Busing in N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A federal judge's order effectively ends  
all race-based student assignment policies, including forced 
busing, in Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools --the district that 
pioneered the desegregation practice. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials have not yet decided whether to appeal. School  
board chairman Arthur Griffin said the district has 30 days to 
decide whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The main effect of Friday's ruling by U.S. District Judge Robert  
Potter will be to dismantle busing, because other race-based 
student assignment programs are relatively few, board members said. 
</P>
<P>
	Potter said the Charlotte school system, which is 40 percent  
black, remedied its segregation problems ``quite some time ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He ordered the district to stop ``assigning children to schools  
or allocating educational opportunities and benefits through 
race-based lotteries, preferences, set-asides, or other means that 
deny students an equal footing based on race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven white parents sued North Carolina's largest school system  
after a non-black student was barred from a magnet program that 
used race as a factor in admissions. The 1997 lawsuit challenged 
all the school district's classroom-assignment policies, including 
court-supervised busing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nightmare of forced busing is finally coming to an end,''  
Clint Bolick of the Washington-based Institute for Justice said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Charlotte district has been busing many of its 100,000  
students to achieve racial balance since the landmark 1969 Supreme 
Court case, Swann vs. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, led 
to court-ordered busing nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Luke Largess, a lawyer for two black families in that case who  
joined the school district in the current lawsuit, said his clients 
would appeal if the school district doesn't. He said Potter 
overstepped his authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he's saying is you cannot use race in any aspect of  
operating the educational system,'' Largess said. ``It's an 
interesting legal question whether he can do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Local NAACP president Dwayne Collins called the judge's ruling  
premature. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern,'' he said, ``is how do you justify doing away with  
busing when all vestiges of a dual system have not been removed?''

<HEADLINE> Miami Cops Make 'Special K' Bust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Police seized more than 11,000 vials of a designer  
drug likely intended for teen-age rave parties in the largest U.S. 
seizure of ketamine, known on the street as ``Special K''. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials estimated the potential value of the drugs seized  
Friday at $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The drugs were discovered after officers pulled over a truck for  
a traffic violation, according to police. The driver matched the 
description of a suspect in the ketamine ring, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers found 2,162 vials of ketamine in boxes in the back. The  
driver, Geraldo Baptista, led them to a warehouse with thousands 
more, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baptista, 37, was arrested Friday and charged with drug  
possession and distribution, a felony that carries up to 20 years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Ketamine is manufactured in the United States as a clear liquid  
used primarily by veterinarians as an animal anesthesia. Boiled 
into a powder, it can be snorted, swallowed in pill form or added 
to drinks for a hallucinogenic high. 
</P>
<P>
	It also can cause permanent brain damage in humans, slow the  
heart rate to the point of death, and cause a stupor-like condition 
that has led to ketamine being labeled a ``date-rape'' drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``This drug is very common at rave parties ... where you find  
the 15-, 16-year-old kids taking these types of narcotics,'' 
Miami-Dade Police Sgt. Juan Perez said.

<HEADLINE> Calif., Tribes Reach Casino Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The state and more than 50 tribes  
reached agreements overnight to keep Indian casinos open, including 
a change in the allocation of slot machines that could more than 
double their number. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreements reached Thursday and early today were reached  
when the tribes, Gov. Gray Davis and labor-friendly legislators 
agreed to put aside for another month the controversial issue of 
union rights for casino workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the final plan, the labor proposal would have to be  
endorsed by each tribe by Oct. 13 or the newly signed compacts 
would be nullified. 
</P>
<P>
	That will give all sides more time to work out terms acceptable  
to unions, which want strong protections for casino employees, and 
for tribes, which worry including such a requirement in the 
compacts infringes on their sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribes were forced to the bargaining table when the state  
Supreme Court recently overturned Proposition 5, a 1998 
voter-approved measure allowing a major expansion of Indian 
casinos. The court ruled that the measure allowed Nevada-style 
gambling banned by the state constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers also were nearing final action today on a related  
proposal that would change the state constitution to get around the 
court ruling. The proposal -- which would have to be approved by 
California voters -- would give tribes a monopoly on slots and 
Nevada-style blackjack games. 
</P>
<P>
	``That measure, together with the compacts that we are agreeing  
to tonight, will finally allow California Indian tribes to achieve 
the self-reliance that we have long been seeking and will protect 
the thousands of people employed by tribal gaming operations 
throughout the state,'' the tribal governments said in a statement 
released early today. 
</P>
<P>
	A big factor for many of the smaller tribes was a change in the  
way slot machines would be allocated, said Scott Crowell, an 
attorney for several of those tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, the tribes with no slots would have the first  
opportunity to draw from a pool of machines available to all Indian 
casinos. It's estimated the number of slots would more than double 
to at least 43,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition 5 was approved by 63 percent of the voters last  
November after a campaign that cost nearly $100 million, a national 
record for a ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
	About two-thirds of the money came from tribes who sponsored the  
initiative. The opposition campaign was largely bankrolled by 
Nevada casinos, whose owners feared competition from the Indians' 
casinos. The Nevada casinos also funded one of the two lawsuits.
