<HEADLINE> Buyoya Rejects Foreign Intervention, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Pierre Buyoya, who was declared
interim president of Burundi on Thursday by the Burundian army,
said today that foreign intervention can only bring disaster in
his country.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he suggested the possibility of a "National debate" to
work out a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
At the first press conference he gave after Thursday's putsch,
Buyoya said, "I have never thought that this ethnic conflict can
be solved through a foreign intervention. This is not in any case
a solution."
</P>
<P>
"I would not expect a solution in it. We have seen what the
idea of foreign intervention has produced here -- idea only. It
has caused the fall of the little of the government that remained.
I think that it is clear," local press reports quoted Buyoya as
saying.
</P>
<P>
At a regional summit held in Arusha, Tanzania on June 25,
Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, the Hutu president who was ousted in
Thursday's coup, called on neighboring countries to send a
multinational force to maintain peace in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The plan was vehemently rejected by both Tutsi and Hutu
radicals in the country, and it triggered a crisis which finally
led to the fleeing of Ntibantunganya into the U.S. embassy in
Bujumbura on Tuesday this week, an act described as "resignation
in fact" by the Burundian army.
</P>
<P>
Before that, a massacre of some 340 Tutsi civilians by armed
bands believed to be Hutu militias last weekend raised the tension
to a climax in the overpopulated tiny central African state
ravaged by an ethnic war between majority Hutus and minority
Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
"It should be that we find, among us (Burundians), and of
course with the help, advices and encouragements of our friends,
the way to solve our conflicts," said Buyoya at the press
conference held in a big hotel in Bujumbura, according to a report
by Agence France Presse.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya, a Tutsi, who was the president of Burundi from 1987 to
1993, also announced that a transitional government would be
formed "within a couple of days" to "reflect on the reality of
Burundi today, (which will stay) outside the mechanism of
political parties."
</P>
<P>
"We are going to study the possibility of establishing a
transitional parliament, also to let the Burundians of different
categories and sensitivities to participate fully in the
establishment of new institutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that all these transitional organs will stay in a
period of time as short as possible with the aim of ``making
peace" and "organizing a national debate", which he said should
</P>
<P>
Buyayo admitted that a putsch is a step backward in the process
of democracy. ``Today, one should accept this step backward to
better jump tomorrow and to avoid (the risk of) a genocide that no
one has done anything to prevent from happening,"he said.
</P>
<P>
"(One should not) let the Burundian people die while saying
that we have respected the principles of democracy.... This is not
distress," he added.

<HEADLINE> WHO Recommends Safe Substitutes For Asbestos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization today
recommended using safer substitutes for the main variety of deadly
asbestos used in construction.
</P>
<P>
The world health body said substitutes should be used because
the level of exposure to chrysotile asbestos, particularly in
building materials, can be extremely high.
</P>
<P>
Results of latest evaluations of chrysotile show that workers
involved in alterations, maintenance and demolition are at a
higher health risk, since control measures are difficult to set up.
</P>
<P>
Average exposure to the adverse effects of chrysotile is viewed
as "generally low", and production of chrysotile is, in general,
much safer as exposure levels have fallen through dust control
measures, the WHO reports.
</P>
<P>
But workers involved in chrysotile textile production are still
at a high risk of exposure, although those involved in cement
production and mining are at lower risk, experts have found.
</P>
<P>
Asbestos has long been shown to cause lung cancer and a range
of deadly respiratory diseases many years after exposure to the
material through dust or water entering the lungs.
</P>
<P>
The WHO said that an evaluation of chrysotile asbestos was
requested by several governments after the International Labor
Organization (ILO) recommended discontinuing the use of
crocidolite, another kind of asbestos used commercially.
</P>
<P>
Chrysotile asbestos now accounts for over 95 percent of the
world asbestos trade. Deposits of the mineral are exploited in
more than 40 countries and most of the reserves are found in
southern Africa, Canada, China and Russia.

<HEADLINE> 1st Mekong River Commission Dialogue Meeting Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The four member countries of the
Mekong River Commission (MRC) today held their first-ever dialogue
meeting with their two partners -- China and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The four Mekong River Commission (MRC) member countries --
Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam -- exchanged views and
information with the two dialogue partners on activities and
projects concerning the use of the Mekong river and its resources
and sought ways and means to cooperate and coordinate the use of
the river and its resources.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held following two exploratory meetings of the
MRC Joint Committee, which invited the two upper riparian
countries to MRC meetings with a view to establishing a
relationship with the two upper reach countries.
</P>
<P>
The upper reach of the river is in China and called the Lancang
river, which runs through Yunnan province.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting today, the two sides exchanged views and
information on hydrological data, navigation and transport,
tourism and recreation, hydropower development and energy demands,
water resources, human resources development, protection of
environment and maintaining the ecological balance.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yesui, head of the Chinese delegation, proposed at the
meeting that cooperation between China and the MRC start with
increasing mutual understanding, through exchange of views,
information and visits.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the two sides should prioritize their
cooperation activities and that cooperation proceed in a gradual
manner, starting with easy projects.
</P>
<P>
Asked at a press conference when China will join the MRC, Zhang
said Chinese experts of various departments are studying documents
of the MRC carefully and that it will take some time before a
decision is made concerning the membership.

<HEADLINE> Aidid's Life Endangered, Radio Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Radio North Mogadishu
supporting Ali Mahdi Mohamed announced that Aidid had been
seriously wounded in the fighting in Medina district three days
ago.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted what it called "confidential sources" close
to the doctors of General Aidid as saying his life is endangered
after receiving gunshots in the abdominal and in the lower
intestine above the kidney.
</P>
<P>
The radio said the wounded General Aidid would be evacuated to
Nairobi even though he preferred Wissil Village where he claims
to be born 61 years ago.
</P>
<P>
There has been no word from the government of Aidid over the
fighting as well as about his conditions.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the combined militiamen of Abgal and
Hawadle clans supporting Ali Mahdi Mohamed occupied for one hour
this morning the Afgoe district, 30 km west of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The development followed the capture of the airport of
Ballidogle from north Mogadishu warlord Mohammed Farrah Aidid on
Thrusday night.
</P>
<P>
According to the civilians in Afgoe, Ali Mahdi's forces
hijacked one vehicle and lost one of their militiamen in the
battle over the town which hosts more than 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Four armed wagons, one with 37 mm anti-aircraft missile,
entered the town early in the morning, only to be chased
away by the militiamen of Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The occupation of Ballidogle airport and the attack on Afgoe
is believed to be part of Ali Mahdi's tactics aimed at relieving
the pressure on Medina district in Mogadishu by General Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting is continuing in Medina until noon today with
an exchange of heavy mortar attacks. Aidid's men used D-30
artillery pieces as well to shell positions of their arch
rival.

ATLANTA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China won its first Atlanta
Olympic shooting gold medal when sharpshooter Li Duihong shot down
the women's sport pistol event here today at the shooting
tournament.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old Chinese from Heilongjiang Province totalled
687.9 points in the final. She also collected 589 points after the
qualification to lead the field of 37 shooters.
</P>
<P>
Diana Yorgova of Bulgaria came second with 684.8 points while
Marina Logvinenko of Russia was third with 684.2 points.
</P>
<P>
Being quick minded, the Chinese shooter joined the Chinese
People's Liberation Army in 1984 and scored many good results in
the national shooting tournament.
</P>
<P>
However, her weakness in her psychological instability casted
her many opportunities in the major international tournament. At
the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, she won the silver medal with a
score of 586 points in the event when she made her Olympic debut.
</P>
<P>
Her twin sister Li Shuanghong is also a shooter in the
Chinese national team.

<HEADLINE> Banks in Nigeria Lower Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Banks and other financial
institutions in Nigeria have started lowering their deposit and
lending rates, a week after the Central Bank of Nigeria announced
a reduction in the interest rates payable on treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
The development, considered as a positive step towards
achieving a realistic interest rate in the economy, was
attributed to the improved liquidity position of some banks and
the persistent consumers resistance to locally produced goods
which, in turn, has slowed down manufacturing activities,
industry sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Many banks have adjusted their deposit rate to 11 percent from
an average of 13 percent last week, while effective prime lending
rate in some banks is 19 percent, two percent below the
government recommended rate of 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that further crash in the rate might encourage
genuine investors to borrow from banks to finance new projects in
the productive sector of the economy, the sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The magic Irishwoman Michelle
Smith seemed ready to take her fourth Olympic gold at the current
Games as she clocked a new national record in the women's
200-meter butterfly heat here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old swimmer, who was timed in 2:10.03, was second
only to Susan O'Neil of Australia in the heats.
</P>
<P>
Smith swirled up to three golds in the 200-, 400-meter
individual medley and 400-meter freestyle.
</P>
<P>
Another Australian Petria Thomas was thrid.
</P>
<P>
China's Qu Yun also booked a final berth with a fourth
finishing in the heats. World champion Liu Limin clocked a slow
2:13.12 for the last final berth.
</P>
<P>
The United States showed their edge in the men's 200m
backstroke, with Brad Bridgewater and Tripp Schwenk sweeping the
top two places.
</P>
<P>
World record holder and defending champion Martin Lopez-Zubero
of Spain took the sixth at 2:00.77, 4.20 seconds off his own world
record.
</P>
<P>
Le Jingyi, world's number one female sprinter, finished atop in
the 50-meter freestyle, clocking in 25.10 seconds in the heats,
the second fastest time of the year.
</P>
<P>
The World champion and world record holder in both the 50m and
100m freestyle scored the fastest time in 50m this year at the
Olympic Trials in Tianjin, at 24.93.
</P>
<P>
"She swam well in the heats," said Le's coach Zhou Ming, "but
it is very difficult to predict the final, because anything could
happen in the sprints. The gap between the swimmers is extremely
slim. "
</P>
<P>
Amy Van Dyken of the Untied States, gold medalist in 100m
butterfly on Tuesday, was second, just 0.02 second behind,
followed by Sandra Volker of Germany at the third place.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Flooded With Imported Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) is being flooded with imported goods
worth about 17 billion US Dollars, a United Nations expert said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Senior training officer of the UN International Trade Center
(ITC) Jason Spencer-Cooke said while the market has potential of
exporting goods worth two billion Dollars annually, the influx of
the imported goods denys the business community this potential.
</P>
<P>
At the one-day seminar of the COMESA on business in the trade
organization, he said similar goods brought into some COMESA
member countries are also exported to the international market by
some other COMESA member countries.
</P>
<P>
Cooke said lack of information on trade potentialities and
available supplies and import requirements as well as tariff
barriers are the most identified obstacles to the growth of
exports from the COMESA.
</P>
<P>
The statistics released at the seminar indicates that African
continent will by the year 2,000 lose most of its trade to the
European Union, America and Asia because it is importing more
than its exports.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Spurs Clinton on Settlement of Trade Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto has called on U.S. President Bill Clinton to settle
bilateral trade disputes on semiconductors and insurance by the
end of July, Kyodo News Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Clinton, Hashimoto said Japan is prepared to
take a flexible stance on insurance, saying a "political decision"
will be necessary to bridge the gap between the two sides, Kyodo
said, quoting government sources.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the United States are at odds over access to the
"third sector" of the Japanese insurance market which includes
such cover as nursing, cancer and personal accident insurance and
in which U.S. companies have a strong foothold.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. claims that Japan is poised to renege on a 1994 deal
by opening up this "third sector" before substantially
deregulating its primary life and non-life insurance sectors.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. says Japan should substantially liberalize these two
sectors of the insurance market before opening up the third.
</P>
<P>
But Japan argues that major Japanese insurers should be allowed
to tap the third sector by setting up subsidiaries. One of the
main sticking points is how soon Japanese subsidiaries should be
allowed to offer personal accident insurance.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are also in dispute over the replacement of a
five-year agreement on access to Japan's microchip market which
comes to an end on July 31.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto rejected as "meaningless" a U.S call for gauging the
foreign share of the Japanese microchip market using capital
affiliation.
</P>
<P>
Washington has demanded the two governments continue surveying
foreign market share after the current accord expires, fearing
that the foreign share will otherwise fall below its present level
of more than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo, however, has rejected U.S. calls for another two-way
deal and says the surveys are no longer needed as they are
conducive to managed trade. Instead, Japan has proposed a global
government forum involving other countries to discuss the world
microchip industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian government has approved
the applications for the establishment of four private
universities, the Cairo press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif was quoted as saying that
establishing private universities would open the way for
competition in the sector of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
Two of the four universities, to be financed by the private
sector, will be located in the City of October 6, a new industrial
city some 30 kilometers northwest of Cairo. The other two will be
built on a site along the road between Cairo and Ismailiya, a town
halfway along the Western bank of the Suez Canal.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri said at a cabinet meeting
Wednesday that approving the establishment of private universities
is an important step in enhancing Egypt's education.

<HEADLINE> EU-Asia Meeting on Trade and Investment Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Top officials from European
Union(EU) and Asia ended here today their two-day informal meeting
which is aimed to promote the cooperation on Trade and Investment
between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
The attendants held a wide-ranging exchange of views on the
first WTO ministerial conference due to be held in Singapore in
December and preparing the ground for concrete measures to
increase trade and investment and to strengthen technological
cooperation between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
The officials expressed the hope that the WTO accession process
should be accelerated for applying countries with influence in the
world economy so that they can enter the multilateral trade system
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
But differences still remained between European and Asian
officials on the focal points of the WTO ministerial conference
and the future working plans of the World Trade Organisation.
</P>
<P>
There was a widespread view from the Asian said that the
Singapore Conference should be focused on the full implementation
of the Uruguay Round commitments and the labour standard issue
should be excluded at the Conference since it is not a
trade-related issues.
</P>
<P>
The attendants agreed to begin the preparation to establish the
Asia-Europe Trade Facilitation Action Plan.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation, led by Li Zhaoxing, Vice-Minister of
Foreign Affairs, presented to the meeting its ideas on the
establishment of a study group on enhancing technological
exchanges and cooperation, particularly in the areas of
agriculture, environmental protection, and technological upgrading
and improvement of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
ASEM partners welcomed these ideas which could form an
important basis for the further discussion of this issue.
</P>
<P>
China indicated her intention to host an experts' meeting on
these topics in the first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
This is the first high level meeting which held overall
discussion on the Asia-Europe economic and trade cooperation,
following the ASEM(Asia-Europe Meeting) summit of European and
Asian leaders in Bangkok last March.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from 25 countries, the 15 European Union
states plus China, Japan, Korea and the seven ASEAN(Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) nations, have joined the European
Commission(EC) and the Irish Presidency for two days of intensive
discussions.

<HEADLINE> China Strikes Women's Sport Pistol Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese army shooter Li Duihong
shot down the Atlanta Olympic women's sport pistol gold here on
Friday at the Wolf Creek Shooting Complex.
</P>
<P>
Li, 26, totaled 687.9 points to beat a field of 37 shooters for
the title. Her result of 589 points in the qualification round is
also a new games record.
</P>
<P>
Diana Yorgova of Bulgaria, who holds the current world record
of 594 points in the preliminary and 696.2 in the final, came
second with 684.8 points. The bronze medal went to Barcelona
Olympics champion Marina Logvinenko of Russia, 0.6 point less than
the silver medalist.
</P>
<P>
Born in Daqing, a famous oil field in Northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province, the Chinese started her shooting career at
the age of 15.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese markswoman made her debut at 1987 World Cup
tournament in Havana, Cuba, after she joined the Chinese People's
Liberation Army in 1984.
</P>
<P>
She did not compete in the Seoul Games, but two years late she
came to the front by setting an Asian and world junior record of
589 points in the event.
</P>
<P>
Being quick minded, she scored many good results in the
national shooting tournaments and took the Olympic silver medal at
the Barcelona games in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In today's competition, the Chinese overcame her weakness in
her psychological instability and beat defending champion
Logvinenko and world record holder Yorgova for the title.
</P>
<P>
Her twin sister Li Shuanghong is also a shooter in the Chinese
national team.
</P>
<P>
This is the first gold medal won by the Chinese team at the
Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the shooting competition, Chinese veteran Wang Yifu
took a silver in the men's air pistol event.

ANKARA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Wild falcons on the verge of
extinction in Turkey are being caught by Syrian hunters and
smuggled to Arab countries through the Tigris and Euphrates
rivers, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>

The allegations have been made by officials of the Hunting and
Protection of Wild Life Foundation, a watchdog group monitoring
hunting in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The organization has outlined methods and routes it maintains
are used in wild bird smuggling.
</P>
<P>
According to the foundation, Syrian hunters come to Turkey to
hunt wild birds every year between April and August.
</P>
<P>
The birds are taught to hunt mice, birds and other animals,
and then they are transported to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and other Gulf countries and sold to Arab sheiks for
exorbitant prices.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy: Mideast Peace Process Will Be Long </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross
said here today that it was an illusion that the stalled Middle
East peace process would progress in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody should have the illusion that we are just around the
corner of a breakthrough (in the peace process)," said the
U.S. Middle East Peace Coordinator after meeting with Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that "it would be a long process." Yet, he
added he is still "hopeful" regarding the prospect.
</P>
<P>
Ross is on a tour of Arab capitals to assess the possibility of
resuming the Arab-Israeli peace talks suspended by the May
election victory of Israel's right-wing leader Binjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
He met Wednesday with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in
Damascus and flew here Thursday to continue his mission, which
will also take him to the Gaza Strip to meet Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
While in Jerusalem, he tried to cool down the expectation for a
quick breakthrough, saying Israel and Syria were still far apart
on a possible peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
But he observed that "the reality is that there is a desire
for everyone I have spoken with to find a way to produce peace
and they see no alternative to it."
</P>
<P>
In response to the killing of two Israelis this morning, Ross
said that terrorists can not be allowed to dictate and determine
the future of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Ross met with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu for
the second time since his arrival. No details were made available
so far.
</P>
<P>
A flurry of diplomatic activity swept the Middle East Thursday
as Ross and Arafat tried to mend strained relations with Syria
and coax Israel and Syria back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Ross made his way from Syria to Jordon to Israel following on
the heels of French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette, who took
his peace mission on the same route earlier in the week.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
today at State House, Nakuru, received 85 opposition parties
members who defected to the ruling KANU.
</P>
<P>
Thanking them for their choice to rejoin the ruling KANU,
President Moi advised the defectors to shun politicians whose
intention is to cheat for the sake of gaining political mileage.
</P>
<P>
He told them that the major problems facing Africans today is
that many nations have discarded their democratic ideals in favor
of the western values.
</P>
<P>
The President noted that as a result there has been consistent
turmoil in many parts of the continent, adding that the savior
could only be through unity of purpose among the different
communities.
</P>
<P>
Today's defectors who are from Bungoma District, include an
opposition FORD-Asili Councillor Donald Tunduli, Moses Wamalwa,
the party's Vice-Chairman in Saboti Sub-Location and Chrisastus
Sifuna, the FORD-Kenya Chairman of West Saboti Sub-Location.
</P>
<P>
The defectors said they opted to rejoin the ruling party
because of President Moi's excellent leadership and his sense of
direction in development.
</P>
<P>
The opposition members defected to the ruling KANU a year
before the forthcoming multi-party General Elections to be held
in 1997.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Rebukes Japan's Slanders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea today rebuked Japan for its slanders against the DPRK
made in the 1996 While Paper on Defense.
</P>
<P>
The official newspaper Rodong Sinmun said in a strong-worded
commentary that slandering and harming others in a far-fetched way
is the old practice and method of the Japanese aggressive forces.
</P>
<P>
The white paper, which was adopted by the Japanese cabinet on
July 19, described the DPRK as "a serious factor of instability in
ensuring security in the whole of East Asia."
</P>
<P>
The commentary said, "the factor of instability in East Asia is
none other than Japan and this has been well illustrated by the
new white paper of defense."
</P>
<P>
The white paper "cries for" the need to expand the activities
of the Japanese Self-Defense forces to operations of searching and
rescuing refugees and transporting Japanese abroad in emergency.
</P>
<P>
"This implies that the Japanese troops can engage in military
operations in any region of the world at any time under any
pretext," the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
By calling the DPRK a factor of instability, Japan is trying to
mould world opinion that the DPRK is "a very dangerous country,"
and watching for a chance to reinvade Korea, it added.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said Japan should not take issue with others
while trying to convert itself into a military power and a nuclear
power.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Tightens Control of Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian government is to
tighten control of weapons and explosives due to increasing
arms-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
A decree issued today says weapons cannot be transported
without approval from the Interior Ministry and new gun licenses
will only be valid in the geographical areas where they are issued.
</P>
<P>
The decree also imposes strict guidelines for the transport of
weapons in the country.
</P>
<P>
Most gun licenses were issued by various political factions
before the 1993 U.N.-brokered general elections, said Sok Phal,
chief of the Information Department of the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said that new weapons and explosives' licenses will be valid
for one year and the previously issued licenses will expire before
September this year.
</P>
<P>
He threatened members of the national and military police who
don't obey the new rules with the sack and punishment.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Forces Evacuate Positions in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli troops have evacuated
several front positions near the north border of the Israeli
self-carved "security zone" in south Lebanon, the state-run
Lebanese National News Agency(LNNA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citizens coming from the occupied border strip were quoted as
saying that the Israeli occupation forces had "completely"
dismantled a post at the Taibe village in Marjayoun area.
</P>
<P>
They had also evacuated the Bir Kalab barrack which used to be
a military and intelligence center, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It said that two Israeli positions in Sharqi Saida had been
abandoned by the Israeli forces as well.
</P>
<P>
The report came when the Israeli government headed by Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is exploring a "Lebanon First"
proposal under which the Jewish state would pull its troops out of
the 15-kilometer-wide buffer zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In return, the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, should
be disarmed and a mechanism to guarantee the security of the
Galilee panhandle in northern Israel should be mapped
out.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah spearheads a guerrilla warfare against the Israeli
occupation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Jerusalem said Netanyahu discussed the proposal
of the unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon with
U.S. President Bill Clinton when they met in Washington earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator for the
Middle East peace talks, carried with him the proposal when he
visited Syria Wednesday and held talks with Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz, speaking to reporters
on Thursday, said that Lebanon would welcome Israel's
unconditional withdrawal from all the occupied land in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, Lebanon would reject a "redeployment" of
Israeli forces that would only be aimed at ensuring better
defense and protection for Israeli troops occupying parts of
south Lebnaon against Lebanese guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Doubting that the proposal was aimed at separating Lebanon
from Syria, the Lebanese foreign minister said that his country
is not prepared to discuss political issues with Israel in a
purpose to reach a separate peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
A total and unconditional Israeli withdrawal would be
consistent with U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, and "this
will be a welcome move," Boueiz said.

<HEADLINE> China Strikes Women's Sport Pistol Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese army shooter Li Duihong
shot down the Atlanta Olympic women's sport pistol gold here on
Friday at the Wolf Creek Shooting Complex.
</P>
<P>
Li, 26, totaled 687.9 points to beat a field of 37 shooters for
the title. Her result of 589 points in the qualification round is
also a new games record.
</P>
<P>
Diana Yorgova of Bulgaria, who holds the current world record
of 594 points in the preliminary and 696.2 in the final, came
second with 684.8 points. The bronze medal went to Barcelona
Olympics champion Marina Logvinenko of Russia, 0.6 point less than
the silver medalist.
</P>
<P>
Born in Daqing, a famous oil field in Northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province, the Chinese started her shooting career at
the age of 15.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese markswoman made her debut at 1987 World Cup
tournament in Havana, Cuba, after she joined the Chinese People's
Liberation Army in 1984.
</P>
<P>
She did not compete in the Seoul Games, but two years late she
came to the front by setting an Asian and world junior record of
589 points in the event.
</P>
<P>
Being quick minded, she scored many good results in the
national shooting tournaments and took the Olympic silver medal at
the Barcelona games in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In today's competition, the Chinese overcame her weakness in
her psychological instability and beat defending champion
Logvinenko and world record holder Yorgova for the title.
</P>
<P>
Her twin sister Li Shuanghong is also a shooter in the Chinese
national team.
</P>
<P>
This is the first gold medal won by the Chinese team at the
Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the shooting competition, Chinese veteran Wang Yifu
took a silver in the men's air pistol event.

<HEADLINE> Coach on Chinese Swimmers' Performance in Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Ming, deputy head coach of
the Chinese swimming squad, said here Friday that he had mixed
feelings about the performance of the Chinese swimmers at the
current Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"We have mixed feelings as some veterans, especially Le Jingyi
and Liu Limin, have performed superbly and male swimmers have made
a historical breakthrough in the competitions, while youngsters
have failed to meet their goal as expected," he said.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has collected only one gold, two silver and two
bronze medals.
</P>
<P>
"For a team, which consists mostly of first-time Olympians,
those results are not too bad," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese swimmers bagged four golds and five silvers in
Barcelona four years ago.
</P>
<P>
"We won more golds last time. But in 1992, we had a more
experienced team with only five first-timers including Le Jingyi."
</P>
<P>
Le finished a lowly sixth in the 100m freestyle final and got a
silver in the 4X100 free relay. Le was the only novice swimmer to
enter the final in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
"Here much more Chinese youngsters who make their Olympic debut
advanced to the finals. This is a plus to us," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of butterfly specialist Liu Limin, the world
champion, who is making her first Olympic appearance.
</P>
<P>
Liu finished second in the women's 100m butterfly and entered
the 200m butterfly final after Friday morning's heats.
</P>
<P>
"The Olympic competition is very special, just like a thrilling
derby. So it's quite difficult for the first-time participants,"
said the coach.
</P>
<P>
Another butterflier Cai Huijue, from Shanghai, who is taking
part in international competition for the first time, entered the
final and finished 7th in the 100m.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese coach said he was satisfied with the women's 4X100m
medley relay team, mainly consisting of young swimmers.
</P>
<P>
"That bronze medal is even more valuabe for us," said Zhou.
"These teenagers will be the main force in the next Olympics."

<HEADLINE> S.African-U.S. Arms Smuggling Case Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- In a major breakthrough in
South African-U.S. relations, the two countries have finally
resolved in principle the long-drawn-out U.S.arms smuggling case
against the South Africa's state arms agency, Armscor.
</P>
<P>
The agreement in this aspect will remove the main irritant in
U.S.-South African relations since October 1991 and will also
normalise arms commerce between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, South African Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki and U.S.Vice-Presidential Gore finally clinched the
deal in a White House meeting on July 23.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards the White House press secretary issued a statement
saying that the three leaders ''welcomed the agreement in
principle between the U.S.and South African legal teams on a
framework for resolving the Armscor case''.
</P>
<P>
''This agreement meets the needs of both countries and
represents a successful efforts to resolve a difficult bilateral
matter,'' the White House said.
</P>
<P>
Armscor,South Africa's major arms producer and saler, will
plead no contest in a Philadelphia court to the charges of
breaking U.S. arms export laws and the arms embargo between 1978
and 1989, but will pay about 12.5 million U.S. Dollars in fines,
according to the agreement reached by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In an important concession, however, Armscor will not face the
usual one-year period of debarment from doing business with
U.S.arms companies. This will allow it back into the U.S.arms
business immediately the agreement is formalised.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's government-owned arms firms have been prevented
from buying arms from or selling them to the U.S.since the
U.S.implemented the mandatory U.N.arms embargo against the
apartheid regime in the 70's.
</P>
<P>
In another concession to South Africa, some of the 12.5
million U.S. Dollar fine will be channelled back to South Africa
to finance a compliance program to ensure that in future the
indicated South African arms firms only use U.S. arms for
lincensed purposes.
</P>
<P>
The October 1991 indictment in a Philadelphia court against
Armscor, its missile-making-company Kentron and seven Armscor
officials, charges that they conspired with a Pennsylvania-based
company called International Signal and Control to smuggled out
components.
</P>
<P>
Some of these ended up in shells fired at U.S. troops by Iraq
in the golf war.

<HEADLINE> Mswati Names New Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Swazi monarch King Mswati
iii today named former Finance Minister Barnabas Sibusiso Dlamini
as the kingdom's new prime minister, the South African Press
Association has reported.
</P>
<P>
Mswati made the announcement at a traditional gathering of
Swazis at his Ludzidzini royal residence near the capital
Mbabane.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini, who was a popular and respected finance minister, is
considered a modernist in a country where traditionalists wield
considerable influence.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini, currently a Director with the World Bank-Internatioal
Monetary Fund's African region, succeeded Prince Mbilini Dlamini,
whose "retirement" was announced by the king two months ago.
</P>
<P>
The new prime minister was expected to lead the government
through the constitutional reform promised by Mswati earlier this
year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The reform was aimed at gently transforming the African
kingdom into a state of democracy, while still retaining the
Swazi's culture, traditions and customs.
</P>
<P>
Since Swaziland's independence in 1968, the post of prime
minister has been restricted to members of the royal family, the
Dlaminis, the royal clan which bears Mswati's surname.
</P>
<P>
Since Prince Mbilini's dismissal, Deputy Prime Minister
Sishayi Nxumalo has been acting as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is the only southern african country in which
political parties have been banned since 1973, and the monarch
king rules the kingdom by royal decree.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland has been plagued by industrial strikes and political
unrest since January, aimed at pressurising the king to introduce
democratic changes. enditem

<P>
NAIROBI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has decided

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho was again cut off
from the rest of the world today when a strike by hundreds of
Lesotho Telecommunications Corporation (LTC) workers entered its
fifth day.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the strikers said in Maseru they would
continue to push for their main demand of an improvement in the
management of the corporation, reported the South African Press
Association.
</P>
<P>
The nation was unable to communicate with the outside world as
all telecommunication facilities are provided by the ltc, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South African Cellular Phone Company Vodacom
was also unable to operate in Maseru as its exchange had been
situated on LTC premises.
</P>
<P>
The LTC employees said management had failed to comply with a
pledge to offer workers and the public a 20 percent shareholding
in a joint venture between the LTC and the Vodacom.
</P>
<P>
However, Transport and Communications Minister Mamoshebi Kabi
failded on Friday to reach a compromise with striking workers
over their demands.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho is a small land-locked country surrounded by South
Africa. enditem

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cameraman One of Two Bomb Casualties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish cameraman was one of the
two killed by a pipe bomb which exploded in the Centennial Olympic
Park downtwon Atlanta in the small hours on Saturday, said a
senior official of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games
(ACOG) this morning.
</P>
<P>
A. D. Frazier, ACOG chief operation officer, identified the one
of the casualties as Melih Uzunyol of Turkey, cameraman for
Turkey's CRP TV.
</P>
<P>
Frazier refused to disclose the name of the other casualty, who
witnesses said was a woman who died of head injuries.
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Vogel, who works at Emory Univeristy Crawford Long
Hospital, said he and a nurse gave the woman CPR, but it was too
late.
</P>
<P>
Vogel said he stayed in the area for a while treating the
injured, most of whom suffered cuts from what may have been flying
shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
The bomb went off at about 1:25 a.m. near a sound and light
tower at the Centennial Olympic Park, where thousands of revelers
were celebrating at an open-air, free concert.

<HEADLINE> Indian Central Bank Urged to Check Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Indian Finance Minister P.
Chidambaram today urged the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to check
inflation by ensuring that money supply growth does not go beyond
the present 15.5-16 percent target set for the current fiscal year
(April 1, 1996 to March 31, 1997).
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the central board of the central bank,
Chidambaram noted that inflation control must have high priority
and all inflationary expectations would have to be dampened.
</P>
<P>
He added that the RBI should ensure that monetary and credit
policies reflect the need for inflation control.
</P>
<P>
Chidambaram made the request in view of the expectations that
inflation rate in the country will go up following the recent
massive price hikes in petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
Talking about his maiden budget submitted to the parliament
earlier this week, the minister said that his objective was to
tackle five major areas of weakness in the economy -- high fiscal
deficit, sluggish agricultural growth, serious infrastructure
bottlenecks, high interest rates and growing trade deficit.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's PDI Headquarters Abandoned After Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The headquarters of the Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI) in Jalan Diponegoro, central Jakarta, has
been abandoned today after a clash between supporters of a PDI
faction led by Soerjadi and Megawati Sukarnoputri's supporters.
</P>
<P>
The control of the abandoned headquarters has been handed over
to the local police.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses on the scene said that the clash, which left dozens
of people injured, started at about 5:30 a.m. local time after
hundreds of Soerjadi supporters threw stones at the party
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Megawati, daughter of late Indonesian president Sukarno, was
elected in 1993 to a five-year term as the party leader and was
ousted by the breakaway faction last month at a congress in Medan,
north Sumatra. She was replaced by Soerjadi during the last
three-day deliberations.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of riot policemen surrounded the party headquarters at
dawn today as scores of people hurled stones at the building.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 supporters of Magawati have kept a round-the-clock
presence at the headquarters since she was deposed.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has three parties, namely the ruling Golkar party,
the United Development Party (PPP) and the PDI. The three parties
will compete for 425 out of the 500 parliamentary seats in next
year's elections. Under the country's constitution, the remaining
75 house seats are reserved for the armed forces.

<HEADLINE> Karst Landscape Discovered in Sichuan Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan Province
is likely to follow the lead of its neighbors to become a popular
tourism spot featuring karst landscape.
</P>
<P>
Experts base this prediction on the recent discovery of several
rare large-scale karst landscapes in south Sichuan's Fengjie,
Yunyang and Xingwen counties.
</P>
<P>
Areas currently known for their karst scenery are Yunnan
Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
China has one of the world's largest karst landscapes; tourists
from all over the world have visited the hills and water in
Guilin, which is in Guangxi, and the stone forest in Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu Xuewen, an expert from the China Institute of
Karst Topography, the karst area found in south Sichuan is unique.
</P>
<P>
Karst funnels there are the largest of their kind in the world,
with depths of up to 662 meters, he said.
</P>
<P>
"When I first saw this splendid natural beauty, I just couldn't
believe my eyes," Zhu said. "I strongly believe this not only has
great scientific significance, but will also be of great value to
world tourists."

PARIS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
expressed "horror" over the explosion earlier today at the heart
of the Olympic Games, condemning it as a "cowardly act."
</P>
<P>
At least two people died and 110 were injured when a bomb
exploded during a concert at the Olympic Park in central Atlanta
at about 1:15 a.m.(EST), (0515 GMT).

<HEADLINE> Secluded Residents in Tibet Able to Watch TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- For Galsang Norbu, a rural resident
in the remote Cona County of Tibet, watching TV is not only
enjoyable, but also a way to learn about the outside world and
make more money.
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, the 30-year-old man of the Memba ethnic group
knew nothing about TV.
</P>
<P>
In July, 1994, the central government pooled 280 million yuan
(33.7 million US dollars) to help build solar broadcast and
television receiving stations in Tibet's 550 townships. Most of
the stations have been completed.
</P>
<P>
Tibet's Membas live mainly in four townships of the Legbo
District in Cona County. Now they are able to watch TV on seven
channels of the China Central Television Station and the Tibet
Regional Television Station.
</P>
<P>
"By watching TV, I know more about the things taking place in
other areas at home and abroad. In particular, I have more
economic knowledge," Galsang Norbu said.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, he obtained 10,000 yuan in loans and opened a store in
his secluded village, where he sold daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
With his growing earnings, he bought a truck. "We have timber
all around us, which is in short supply in other places," he said.
</P>
<P>
With approval from the local government, Memba people are free
to cut some of the trees.
</P>
<P>
"It is a historic stride for people living in the remote
mountainous areas to watch TV," said Cering Jigme, chief official
of Legbo District.
</P>
<P>
"Watching TV can meet the need of amusement for the Memba
people. Meanwhile, they can broaden their minds and make them
obtain more knowledge," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen of the 141 households in the district have color
television sets. Many more people are waiting to buy good quality
TV sets, he said.
</P>
<P>
A standard color television costs two to three thousand yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to local banking statistics, each Memba person has
average deposits of more than 6,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
"Memba people can see the world now, although they live in deep
mountains and forests," Cering Jigme said proudly.

<HEADLINE> Qiao Shi Urges Quicker Pace in Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Bolder steps and a quicker pace
are necessary for reforms in state enterprises and the technical
transformation of old industrial bases, the Chairman of the
National People's Congress Standing Committee has said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi made the remark during an inspection tour in northeast
China's Liaoning Province from July 20-26, where he noted that
Liaoning has made progress in both urban and rural economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The chairman made an inspection to a number of factories,
companies, economic development zones and rural households in
Liaoning, an old and important industrial base in the country, and
expressed his satisfaction with their achievements.
</P>
<P>
He urged local authorities to pay great attention to both
industrial and agricultural development and work to further narrow
the urban-rural economic gap.
</P>
<P>
Qiao showed concern for the reform of the state enterprises,
and urged them to make earnest efforts and take bolder steps to
carry out various changes.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that under the socialist market economy, state
enterprises must sharpen their competitive edges and give full
play to their superiorities, in order to expand their shares in
both domestic and international markets.
</P>
<P>
On July 23, the chairman visited Anshan Iron and Steel Company,
where he was employed in the 1950s. He praised the company's
achievements in enterprise reform and technical transformation.
</P>
<P>
He called on the steel and iron giant to make a greater
contribution to the country's modernization drive.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Paper Criticizes Netanyahu's Idea of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The local Syrian daily Al-Thawrah
criticized today the attitude of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu toward the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu seeks to gain the (occupied) land, peace and
security from the Arabs without giving them anything," the paper
said in its editorial.
</P>
<P>
The paper criticized him for his insistence on introducing new
"heinous approaches" to the peace process which was based on the
land-for-peace principle and aimed to establish a just and
comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve his ends, Netanyahu tries to impose his
unacceptable approaches by force as he sometimes brandishes the
Israeli conventional and unconventional weapons at the Arabs," the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
He tries to dictate the illogical idea of "security-for-peace"
and denies the rights and security of other partners as if they
should serve the Israeli security, it added.
</P>
<P>
"The Arabs have to adapt to the new reality characterized by
the power of peace. Otherwise, they will be undone," the paper
warned.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's notion of "security-for-peace" will inevitably
cancel practically any approach to peace and will even undermine
and uproot the peace process in the region, according to
Al-Thawrah.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian official paper underlined Syria's commitment to the
peace process and the importance of resuming peace talks on the
principles of the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions and
the principle of "land for peace."
</P>
<P>
The paper also dismissed as a "sinister ploy" Netanyahu's
proposal that Israel and Syria try to end hostilities in Lebanon
first, before tackling the issue of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was reported by the Israeli press recently.
</P>
<P>
Syria insists that there can be no peace with Israel before the
return of the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau the Jewish state
seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.

URUMQI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Lanzhou-Urumqi Railway, one of
the most important traffic lines linking northwest China's
Xinjiang with the hinterland, re-opened for traffic at six
p.m. today after an 8-day breakdown.
</P>
<P>
In the early hours of July 20, rare heavy floodwaters swept
down a mountain near the Turpan-Urumqi section of the railway,
damaging 34 sections of the railway, paralyzing all
telecommunication lines and destroying a number of roadbeds in the
area.
</P>
<P>
A 350-meter-long section of track was suspended in air, while
the Baiyanghe railway bridge, on the eastern edge of the Tianshan
Mountains, was submerged.
</P>
<P>
Traffic was halted at 10 o'clock that morning, and
transportation between the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and
the inland areas was cut off.
</P>
<P>
Fifty passenger and cargo trains were blocked, and nearly
10,000 travelers were stranded in the local area.
</P>
<P>
The Urumqi Railway Bureau, under the leadership of the Ministry
of Railways and other departments, sent road-repair equipment and
more than 10,000 workers to the area.
</P>
<P>
The damaged railways have been paved with new roadbeds and
tracks. No casualties were reported.

<HEADLINE> Tangshan Built Anti-Quake Lifelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A catastrophic earthquake
that smashed Tangshan in north China 20 years ago produced a
nightmare when it cut off all communications systems and the water
and power supplies.
</P>
<P>
Domestic and international experts later blamed the city's
unsophisticated emergency system for the delays in rescue work,
which should have been carried out soon after the quake occurred
on July 28, 1976, in this 100-year-old industrial city.
</P>
<P>
Many people believe that the death toll of over 240,000 would
have been reduced if the city had had an advanced emergency system
in operation.
</P>
<P>
Foreign experts on city planning have flocked to see the
reconstructed city of Tangshan, showing their interest in the
modern, effective layouts of water and power supplies, the traffic
network, communications and medical facilities, and the food
supply system.
</P>
<P>
The city now has several thoroughfares and a dozen major
crossroads that connect with other parts of the country including
Beijing, Tianjin and Qinhuangdao. Highways have been built to link
the railway station and the airport.
</P>
<P>
If necessary, the new grassy parks can be used as helicopter
landing grounds.
</P>
<P>
All of the newly-built civil and industrial buildings are
required to adopt anti-quake measures to reduce the potential for
future quake-related damage.
</P>
<P>
The city's water supply has been divided into four independent
blocks, each with its own water plants and water sources, while
large factories and rural families have retained their own water
sources and wells. All the underground water pipelines have been
built with rubber connectors.
</P>
<P>
Tangshan's electricity supply network is similar to the
water-supply system: both have several independent back-up systems
that will ensure power in the event of a major earthquake.
</P>
<P>
The two communication networks, one wire and the other
wireless, each with its own control system and buildings, are
believed to be able to withstand potential outages caused by
quakes.
</P>
<P>
The city has established a complete food-storage,
food-processing and rescue-food-processing system to prevent
starvation among quake victims.
</P>
<P>
In addition, well-designed medical and firefighting networks
have been established, with the public systems as their base of
operations. They are supported by enterprises and community-based
rescue facilities.
</P>
<P>
"The high population density was one of the major causes for
the high death rate of the Lunan District, which was twice the
average in urban areas," said the city's mayor Zhang He.
</P>
<P>
The reconstructed city of Tangshan has three sections, about 25
km apart, that are connected by railways and roads. The areas
around the city's five coal mines have become small industrial
towns.

MOGADISHU, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of the Somali
warlord Mohamed Aidid today officially denied reports that the
general was seriously wounded in the ongoing faction fighting
over the control of the city airport.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Mohamed Afrah, Aidid was "in good
health and fulfilling his normal duties" in his office.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman said Aidid's troops have defeated
rival militiamen loyal to Ali Mahdi Mohamed and are now in full
control of Mogadishu's Ballidogle Airport.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Radio North Mogadishu supporting Ali Mahdi
and Radio South Mogadishu supporting Aidid's another rival Osman
Atto, have also been claiming an absolute victory in the control
of the airport.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi's radio has also claimed that his militiamen are in
full control of Afgoe district, 30 km west of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Despite the contradictory claims from both sides, reports from
the conflicting fields say that heavy fighting is still going on
between the two sides over the control of the airport and the
strategic Tarmac road linking Afgoe to the airport.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, fighting is also going on in the
villages of Warmahun and Tihsile along the road leading to
Ballidogle. Tihsile is 30 km east of Ballidogle.
</P>
<P>
Each side has captured two armed wagons belonging to the
other during the fighting and at least 19 people were killed and
more than 39 others were wounded, said the reports.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 27 (Xinhua) -- South Korea today threatened to
retaliate if the United States imposes unilateral sanctions
against it over access to its domestic telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Foreign Ministry spokesman Suh Dae-won said in a
statement he regretted the U.S. decision to put the country on the
U.S. Priority First Country (PFC) telecommunications list because
of a dispute about government involvement in telecommunications
procurement by private firms.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on opening the South Korean telecommunications
market must be carried out through the World Trade Organization
(WTO), not on a bilateral basis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Seoul is prepared to actively consider accepting all reasonable
demands from Washington but will take retaliatory measures against
any U.S. unilateral sanctions, Suh said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not appropriate for South Korea and the U.S. to sign a
separate agreement stipulating that governments cannot and should
not be involved in the procurement of telecommunications equipment
by private firms," Suh added.
</P>
<P>
Washington has insisted since last March that the Seoul
government provide U.S. firms with the same treatment as domestic
firms in the South Korean corporate telecommunications equipment
market.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa-EU Trade Talks Raises Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The proposed trade talks
between South Africa and the European Union (EU) is increasingly
raising concern among neighboring countries in the southern
African region.
</P>
<P>
Parliament member of African National Congress and trade
expert Rob Davies said here today that more evidences are
emerging of how much Southern African Customs Union (SACU) states
could be affected.
</P>
<P>
Davies said South Africa's neighboring countries were "gravely
concerned about the impact of the proposed Free Trade Agreement
on revenue in that country."
</P>
<P>
"They found that a reduction of a substantial part of tariffs
to zero, as distinct from a reduction in tariffs, would be bound
to affect the overall revenue pool of customs duties," he said.
</P>
<P>
Namibia could lose anything up to 15 to 20 percent of total
government revenue if this is not addressed, he added.
</P>
<P>
The EU had indicated it was not prepared to provide Namibia or
other SACU states with any compensation for this, but had
suggested South Africa should find another way to fill the gap.
</P>
<P>
"They say we need to understand that a customs union based on
revenue derived from protectionism may not be sustainable in a
globalizing world," he said, adding the customs union "should
base itself on some revenue source other than customs duties."
</P>
<P>
"What's true for Namibia is obviously true for the other
countries," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland was also urged to cut its budget deficit. And for
Lesotho, the size of the customs revenue is larger than for any
other country.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed the fact that some neighbouring countries had
started to identify their own interests, especially since they
were all members of the Lome Convention and there was speculation
that the FTA was increasingly being seen as a possible model for
relations with developing countries when the current Lome
Agreement expired.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the loss of customs duty revenue, an FTA-type of
agreement would limit the access of SACU members to the EU.
</P>
<P>
Despite growing impatience by the EU, South Africa is
insisting on drawing up its negotiating mandate and having it
approved by all interested parties, including parliament, before
it starts negotiations with the EU.
</P>
<P>
South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin has
indicated that negotiations could possibly start in September or
October.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Prevention Publicity Conducted in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Earthquake prevention and disaster
reduction practices were the focus of a large-scale public
awareness campaign held today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Activities were jointly sponsored by the State Seismological
Bureau and the Beijing Municipal Government, with approval from
the General Office of the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Seismologists and officials from seismological departments took
to the streets and offered knowledge about earthquake prevention
to passersby. Twelve publicity posts were set up in the city's
eight districts and three major parks, and in front of the bureau
building.
</P>
<P>
He Yongnian, vice-director of the State Seismological Bureau,
warned that China is in the fifth seismic active period.
</P>
<P>
"People living in cities should not forget July 28 and the
bloody lesson taught by the strong Tangshan earthquake, whether
they are facing the danger of earthquakes or not," the official
said.
</P>
<P>
On July 28, 1976, a powerful earthquake claimed lives of about
240,000 people in Tangshan, an industrial center in north China's
Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
People should be better educated about earthquakes and disaster
reduction, the vice-director added.
</P>
<P>
Similar activities were held in every county in Beijing and
other large cities throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> Ancient tomb of Ming Dynasty Damaged Seriously </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- An ancient tomb of the Ming
dynasty (1368-1644) has been destroyed by illegal excavations by
farmers, China Culture News reported.
</P>
<P>
The newly-discovered tomb is located in Qichun County in
central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Without approval from departments in charge of archeology work,
two local officials organized a group of farmers to unearth the
tomb and its coffin.
</P>
<P>
The tomb has a great bearing on the study of the history and
culture of the Ming dynasty, according to Huang Fengchun, an
expert with the provincial archeology institute, and a piece of
silk clothing with over 1,500 Chinese characters was also found.
</P>
<P>
However, Huang added that the tomb was seriously damaged
because the excavations had been carried out without the guidance
of archeologists. The valuable silk-made clothes were torn and
some characters on it could hardly be identified.
</P>
<P>
At present, the provincial experts have been making great
efforts to restore all the destroyed items.

<HEADLINE> China Active in Teaching Geology to Youngsters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Since 1981, China has held annual
geology summer camps throughout the country that have attracted
more than 143,000 youngsters.
</P>
<P>
More than 130,000 geological articles and four volumes of their
geological theses written by the kids have been published.
</P>
<P>
The budding geologists also have collected more than 400,000
varieties of geological specimens.
</P>
<P>
The popular camps have aroused youngsters' strong interests in
geology, said the Science Popularization Committee of the China
Geological Society. And they have been praised by the Chinese
Association for Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
To spread geological knowledge among youngsters, the committee,
in cooperation with local scientific and educational departments,
has established various amateur geology organizations in Beijing,
Yunnan, Shanghai, Guizhou, Qinghai, Nanchang, Wuhan, Kunming and
other cities or provinces.
</P>
<P>
Such groups also have been set up in a number of primary and
secondary schools and are very successful, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
China also aims to improve the geology knowledge of the
children's instructors. Shanghai has held training courses for
over 1,000 geology teachers from 20 districts or counties; East
China's Jiangsu Province has trained geology teachers from seven
cities or counties.
</P>
<P>
In order to stimulate youngster's interests in geology, China
has also held contests and solicited articles and essays through
media advertisements.

<HEADLINE> Summer Fads in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Painting toenails with black
polish is the latest summer craze for women in north China port
city Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The black-toenailed ladies wear high-heel transparent plastic
sandals and carry simply-designed plastic handbags.
</P>
<P>
"The match gives a sense of the time", commented beautician Cai
Yang.
</P>
<P>
Cai added that while black lip stick has become fashionable in
some countries, it is not suitable for the yellow skin of the
Chinese. But black nail polish seems an ideal form of cosmetic
decoration.
</P>
<P>
However the fad has sparked objections from many older people,
who, while finding red-colored nails acceptable, deem the black
polish as "ugly".
</P>
<P>
Another fad is the emergence of street stalls offering
on-the-spot fried dishes.
</P>
<P>
Since a lot of citizens want to escape from the heat of the
kitchen, the stalls offering dishes at much lower-prices than in
restaurants have become very luring.
</P>
<P>
Another fad is the newly created rent-flower business.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin Flower Production Center, for example, can lease
over 20,000 pots of flowers each day to hotels, enterprises,
institutions, department stores and individuals.
</P>
<P>
A hotelier said that his hotel used to need to spend 120,000
yuan (14,457 US dollars) to buy flowers, now it only takes less
than half of the expenditure to rent them.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa MP Warns Against Foreign Intervention in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A South African Member of
Parliament today warned against sending foreign troops to
Burundi, which he said would cause serious consequences for the
country and could spark a devastating civil war.
</P>
<P>
"I never believed this ethnic conflict would be resolved by
foreign intervention. This is not a solution," said Jan Van Eck,
a member of parliament from the African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
While the East African countries are planning to send troops
to Burundi, speculation is mounting this week that South Africa
was also considering contributing troops as part of a
multi-national African peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
Burundi is deep in crisis after the minority Tutsi-led
military took over power two days ago. An all-out war between the
Tutsi army and the majority Hutu rebels are increasingly feared.
</P>
<P>
Van Eck, who has just returned from Burundi's capital of
Bujumbura, urged African countries not to pursue ideas of
military intervention in the central African nation torn apart by
increasing ethnic strife.
</P>
<P>
He said because of the increasing conflict between the
minority Tutsi-led military government and the majority Hutu
rebels, a military solution is impossible unless people regain
faith in each other.
</P>
<P>
"The foreign force will only escalate the internal conflict
massively," said the South African MP.
</P>
<P>
"The army may fight foreign troops and will probably consider
forming militias. In other words, the army will disintegrate and
there will be even more rebel movements in the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Burundi's new leader, Major Pierre Buyoya who seized power
from President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya in an army-backed coup on
July 25, also vehemently warned against foreign intervention,
saying Burundi's problems could only be solved by Burundians
themselves.

<HEADLINE> 2 Confirmed Dead, 110 Injured in Olympic Park Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Two persons were confirmed dead
and 110 more injured in the bombing earlier today at the
Centennial Olympic Park in downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Woody Johnson, a spokesman of the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), told a press conference that the bombing
would be considered "an act of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Independent local media reports said one of the two victims was
a woman who died of head injuries on the site, and the other was a
man who was pronounced dead at a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people were enjoying music performances at the
concert stage of the park when the bomb went off at 1:25
a.m. local time (525 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Exclusive footages provided to the Cable News Network (CNN)
showed a firework-like flash in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
At least 10 athletes from Cuba and Argentina were reportedly a
few meters away from the blast, believed to be caused by a pipe
bomb.
</P>
<P>
Police immediately sealed off the park and all the streets
leading to downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the explosion, a sound technician with a band
playing on the stage spotted a suspicious package in a paper bag
on the site, CNN said.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said police sweeping the area with
bomb-sniffing dogs later found two more explosive devices in the
8.5-hectare park, which was opened a week before the Olympics
began.
</P>
<P>
Two blocks away from the park, where the blast could be heard,
police also blocked the entrance of the Olympic media center and
fired tear gas to disperse reporters.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place when more than 100 reporters were
negotiating with the police in an effort to gain access to the
center and to file their stories.
</P>
<P>
The bombing was considered the worst tragedy to hit the
Olympics since terrorists killed 11 Israeli athletes and coaches
at the 1972 Munich Games.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing 26th Olympics started on July 19 and is scheduled
to last 17 days with the participation of over 10,000 athletes
from 157 countries.
</P>
<P>
Two days before its opening, a Trans World Airlines (TWA)
Beoing 747 exploded in the air shortly after taking off from
Kenndy International Airport in New York, and plunged into the
Atlantic Ocean, killing all 230 passengers and crew members aboard.
</P>
<P>
While U.S. officials were probing the July 17 TWA airliner
crash and listing terrorism as a probable cause, security measures
have been tightened around the venues of the Olympic games.
</P>
<P>
At an early morning press conference three hours after today's
bombing, a top official of the International Olympic Committee
(IOC) vowed that the Olympic games "will go on."
</P>
<P>
"Although profoundly shocked by the incident, the IOC and the
Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games remain firm in the
conviction that the ... Games will continue as planned," said IOC
Director General Francois Carrard.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that a moment of silence will be observed
later in the day in memory of the bombing victims, and all Olympic
flags will be lowered to half mast for the duration of the games.

<HEADLINE> Scandal in Jordan's Olympic Team Revealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian sportsman, who was
disqualified at Atlanta due to his absence from the
pre-competition weigh-in last Sunday, was not the player slated
to take part in the games, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The surprising scandal about Walid Al Awazem, who was supposed
to represent Jordan in Judo's 94- kilogram category at the 26th
Atlanta Olympic Games, was revealed by the English-language daily
"Jordan Times."
</P>
<P>
Awad Haddad, Chairman of Technical Committee of the Jordan
Olympic Committee (JOC), disclosed Friday that his committee has
received the names of two players Yousef Sadi and Awazem,but the
Jordan Judo Federation (JJF) slated Sadi rather than Awazem.
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised to find out that Awazem was the one who
got the chance to go," Haddad said. "Sadi had priority because
he was better qualified."
</P>
<P>
"I cannot understand what happened when the JOC sent the
applications," he added.
</P>
<P>
While officials and sports fans in Amman followed the event
at a loss of who to blame for the disqualification which
cost Jordan a chance to compete in the field for the first
time, a statement by Minister of Youth Mohammad Daoudieh, now
in Atlanta, gave a series of surprising details pointing
to deceitful actions on the part of Awazem and his coach
Khaled Al Rifai.
</P>
<P>
Awazem told delegation officials that the coach, a U.S.
resident assigned by the JJF to oversee the player for
financial reasons, was less-experienced than him and had actually
been his student, said the daily.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear why Awazem had suggested to the JJF and the JOC
to name Rifai as his coach while knowing that he was not
qualified for the job.
</P>
<P>
A routine medical check of Jordanian athletes in the Olympic
village in Atlanta showed that Awazem had concealed a recent
injury, which had required medication and physiotherapy for four
days prior to the competition.
</P>
<P>
The daily also disclosed that Awazem's failure to show up
at the pre-competition weigh-in was not due to his negligence
but to his fear.
</P>
<P>
When the head of Jordan's delegation Ismat Al Kurdi told
Awazem that the draw had put him in contention with a world
class Dutch champion, "the play was evidently disturbed," said
the daily.
</P>
<P>
On the day of competition, Kurdi made sure both Awazem
and his coach Rifai went to the weigh-in early.
</P>
<P>
The two men went to the venue but were told to go to
the Olympic village.
</P>
<P>
However, "they apparently chose not to and missed the
official weigh-in," although they had enough time, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister of youth contacted the International Judo
Federation in an attempt to enable the player to participate,
thinking that there was a mix-up, it added.
</P>
<P>
It turned out that the coach, Rifai, had signed the set
of regulations and weigh-in time on three different occasions
and was clearly aware of the rules, said the daily.
</P>
<P>
Some Jordanians contacted by Xinhua expressed anger at the
scandal, hoping that the dishonest sportsman and his coach would
be severely punished because they have defamed the Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
They asked officials concerned to explain the case.

in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Driven by the need for big spending cuts to qualify for
monetary union, EU ministers agreed on Thursday night to cut 2
billion pounds (3 billion U.S. dollars) from funds for
agriculture, regional aid and other areas, which means Britain
will pay less in real terms for its membership of the EU than in
any year since it joined in 1973.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The International Monetary Fund has warned Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, that he has no scope for tax cuts in this year's
budget and that he needs to do more to bring public finances under
control.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Detailed proposals for the most sweeping reform of the civil
justice system in England and Wales this century were published by
Lord Woolf, the Master of the Rolls, yesterday. The changes in the
370-page report are designed to make justice cheaper and quicker.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>

last night after Unionists claimed the Social and Democratic
Labor party could have disqualified themselves from the multi-arty
talks.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Although west African leaders are
calling for strengthening the sub-regional peacekeeping force in
Liberia known as ECOMOG, Nigeria's participation in the force has
again come under sharp criticisms in the industrial circle.
</P>
<P>
Chief Kola Daisi, President of the Nigerian Association of
Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture, said here
yesterday Nigeria's involvement is questionable at this period
when the country is faced with mounting external debt obligations
and several domestic problems like unemployment and declining
standard of living.
</P>
<P>
The attempt to restore sanity to liberia has cost Nigeria no
less than four billion US Dollars in addition to human resources.
</P>
<P>
The president believed that there was the need for greater
domestic attention to revive the economy which would be
impossible with the mounting depletion of national wealth "in
such unproductive ventures".
</P>
<P>
At Friday's opening of the 19th summit of the heads of state and

General Sani Abacha reiterated Nigeria's firm commitment to the

<P>
Presenting his ministry's estimates for 1996/97 at the

<P>
TANGSHAN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese president Jiang Zemin
said the rebirth of Tangshan and remarkable achievements the city
has made since the 1976 catastrophic earthquake demonstrate once
again the superiority of socialism.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang visited Tangshan in Hebei province on the
morning of July 26. He laid a basket of flowers before the
monument to the earthquake in the center of the city and then
visited the museum commemorating the event. There he mourned with
deep grief the people killed in the earthquake and the martyrs who
died in earthquake rescue operations. 240,000 people were killed
on July 28, 1976.
</P>
<P>
Jiang visited a "rehabilitation village" where those disabled
and paralyzed survivors are taken care of. He presented as a gift
rehabilitation and gym facilities to every "villager".
</P>
<P>
President Jiang also heard reports from leading officials of
Hebei province and Tangshan. Jiang said the earthquake 20 years
ago reduced Tangshan, a city with 100 years' history and one
million population, to ruins. That was an irresistible natural
disaster that shocked the country and the world.
</P>
<P>
Two decades has past, but Tangshan, instead of disappearing
from the face of the earth, has become more prosperous, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also inspected state-owned firms, including Tangshan
Ceramics Co. and Jidong Cement Co.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also visited a unit of Chinese People's Liberation Army
stationed in Tangshan.
</P>
<P>
Among those accompanying the president were Zhang Wannian,
vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, leaders of Hebei
province and Tangshan city.

DAR ES SALAAM, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Military experts from five
states of the Great Lakes Region are trying to chart their
security assistance for Burundi, two days after the military coup
was staged which toppled the civilian government.
</P>
<P>
The the two-day meeting in Arusha, Northern Tanzania, is to
prepare for the forthcoming summit meeting of the region and to
work out a plan on the Burundian crisis, according to a report
reaching here from Arusha today.
</P>
<P>
General Robert Mboma, Chief of Tanzania's Defense Forces, who

Burundi and Rwanda were not represented, but representatives
from Cameroon, the current OAU Chairman and OAU Secretariat were

</P>
<P>
But the plan to send in African peacekeeping troops met
opposition from the Hutu-dominated fragmented rebels and minority
Tutsi-dominated army of Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The opposition culminated in the coup d'etat this week that
brought back to power Major Pierre Buyoya who handed over power
to a civilian president in the first democratic elections in

<HEADLINE> Museum Criticized For Overcharging Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The State Planning Commission
today circulated a notice of criticism nationwide about the
punishment to Dazu County under southwest China's Chongqing city
for over-charging foreign visitors to the Dazu Stone Carving
Museum.
</P>
<P>
In March of this year the county government, overstepping its
authority, raised the price of the tickets for foreigners visiting
the museum from 45 Yuan (about 5.5 U.S. dollars) to 100 Yuan
(about 12 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The notice from the State Planning Commission ordered the
Chongqing City Price Bureau to correct this malpractice and impose
fines on the museum.
</P>
<P>
According to the current regulations, ticket prices for foreign
visitors should be fixed by the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Currently in most tourism spots the tickets for domestic
visitors and foreign visitors are different. The notice from the
commission says that the State Council, the central government,
has a policy of gradually phasing out price differentials of
tickets for domestic and foreign tourists. The Dazu county
government's price hike ran counter to this policy, the notice
says.
</P>
<P>
The State Planning Commission calls on price bureaus throughout
the country to strictly control price hikes in the service sector
and create conditions for phasing out the duel-price system for
domestic and foreign visitors to tourist spots.

<HEADLINE> Two More Explosive Devices Found at Olympic Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Atlanta, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Two more explosive devices were
discovered at the Centennial Olympic Park in downtown Atlanta
following an earlier explosion that killed at least one person.
</P>
<P>
According to Cable News Network reports, the bombs were found
by police sweeping the area, who fear about secondary explosions
following the first one at about 1:30 a.m. local time (5:50 gmt).
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bill Campbell of Atlanta City, which is hosting the
ongoing 17-day Olympic Games, confirmed one death as the direct
result of the explosion, presumably of a pipe bomb.
</P>
<P>
Local hospitals said they were treating at least 75 injured
people.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people were enjoying music performances inside the
park when the bomb went off near the concert stage, shaking the
windows of nearby buildings.
</P>
<P>
"There was a loud explosion and I saw a woman's leg was blown
off," said Greonie Daniel, an eyewitness at the scene.
</P>
<P>
James Terry, another witness, said he saw a boy's hip was blown
off. The boy was just standing beside him on the right side of
the stage. "People started running," he said. There were still
wet stains on Terry's pants.
</P>
<P>
On the right of a big tent inside the park, a reporter with
Xinhua saw a bleeding man lying on the ground. Several nurses
were providing medical assistance. There were also several people
with bruised hands inside the park, which is just behind the Main
Press Center of the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Greg Addison, who claimed to be only about 100 feet (30 meters)
away from the site of the explosion, said, "It was a quick bomb
which gave heavy impact on my chest."
</P>
<P>
"There were heavy smoke and fire," a young witness said. "You
can feel it on your skin."
</P>
<P>
Police and troops had blocked all the streets leading to the
park and the downtown area.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Accuses Israel Of Reimposing Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat has criticized the Israeli authorities for
re-enforcing full closure on the West bank, Israel Radio reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told reporters in Gaza last night that this was another
breach of what had been agreed upon between the two sides. "They
do not have the right to do so," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) announced the closure shortly
after an drive-by shooting attack early Friday morning, in which
two Israelis were killed and a third was critically wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israel suspects that the assailants belong to the Popular Front
 for the Liberation of Palestine, a Damascus-based PLO faction
opposed to the Oslo accord. It also believes that they came from
the Hebron area.
</P>
<P>
This morning, the IDF announced to ease the closure somewhat,
freeing Jericho from the ban and permitting traffic between
Bethlehem and Hebron areas. But the full closure on the West Bank
remains in effect.
</P>
<P>
Israel usually announces full closure on the Palestinian
territories each time when a violent attack takes place in
Israel. The Palestinians angrily condemn the action as a
"collective punishment."

<HEADLINE> Arab League Chief Warns of "New Intifada" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the Arab
League Esmat Abdul-Meguid has warned of eruption of grassroots
Arab uprising against Israel if the Jewish state put aside the
agreements it had signed with Arab parties.
</P>
<P>
"Now If Israel does not implement all what it has promised,
there will be a new intifada," the Arab League's chief said in an
interview with the local daily An-Nahar, which was published today.
</P>
<P>
The 1987-91 intifada, in which the Palestinians expressed their
anger by throwing stones, compelled the Israeli government of
former Likud Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to hold face-to-face
negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League chief pointed out that an explosion of the
Middle East situation is not in the interest of all the people,
including the Israels, in the region, nor in the interest of
stability.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that an Israeli radicalization would lead to an
Arab radicalization, noting that "violence will only cause
violence and it will not resolve any problem but make it more
complicated."
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid ruled out an American pressure upon Israel,
especially when the presidential election in the United States is
approaching.
</P>
<P>
"There are only four months before President Bill Clinton runs
the elections, I think it is difficult for the U.S. administration
to exert pressure on Israel during this period," the Arab League
chief said.
</P>
<P>
"Israel should be conscious that peace is in its interest and
in the interest of the Arab," he added. "It should not think that
peace is a gift it accords to the Arab, peace is also a gift to
Israel because it is Israel, not the Arab alone, who would benefit
from peace."
</P>
<P>
On the Lebanese position, Abdul-Meguid stressed that "the
Lebanese position is identified with the Arab position, that is to
say, a demand for a just and comprehensive peace."
</P>
<P>
Lebanon insists on implementation of U.N. Security Council
Resolution 425, which calls for an unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon, Abdul-Meguid said, noting that
"Resolution 425 has nothing to do with other resolutions."
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon's position is clear and we support it," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"If Israel wants to obtain confidence of the Arab, it should
change its position," the Arab League chief pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Israel's hard-line Likud party leader Benjamin Netanyahu won
the May 29 election to become prime minister. He has declared his
rejection of the land-for-peace principle, on which the Middle
East peace process was based.

<HEADLINE> S.African Minister Defends Economic Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
would not budge from the goals of its recently released
macro-economic policy strategy, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The Citizen" daily of the country today quoted Manuel as
saying that he faced an uphill battle in selling the strategy to
the allies of the African National Congress (ANC).
</P>
<P>
"It will be extremely hard to drive this process through with
all of our colleagues, at national and provincial level, " the
minister admitted at a press conference held in Johannesburg on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The macro-economic strategy, entitled growth, employment and
redistribution, was launched by Manuel on June 14 in the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The strategy, serving as government's basic economic policy
until the next century, committed the government to privatization
of certain state-owned companies, trade liberalization and
lifting of currency exchange controls.
</P>
<P>
The strategy, although envisaged by foreign enterpreneurs as a
positive step to creating invest-friendly environment, was
strongly criticized by the organized labour.
</P>
<P>
Sam Shilowa, General Secretary of the 1.6 million strong
Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), slashed out at
the strategy at the weekend, saying it was a "neo-liberal plan"
which posed serious difficulties for the working class and the
country as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Committed to Mideast Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli embassy here stressed
that the new Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was
committed to the creation of proposed Middle East Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
A source in the embassy strongly rejected recent media reports
that the hardline Israeli prime minister was backing off on the
previous government's push for such a regional economic body.
</P>
<P>
"These assumptions are wrong," said the source, quoted by the
daily "Jordan Times" today. "The new government wants to promote
the Mideast bank, and Mr. Netanyahu himself is very committed to
its establishment."
</P>
<P>
The source asserted that Netanyahu held meetings with members
of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee in an effort to
convince the American legislators of the "importance of
establishing the regional bank as a unique and important tool to
promote regional trade and to give a push to economic relations."
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. enthusiastically backed the project at last
October's Amman economic summit and agreed to fund it with 260
million U.S. dollars, accounting for 21 percent of the bank's
total start-up capital, the Senate Appropriations Committee has
not included the American contribution to the bank in Congress'
foreign aid bill which is scheduled to be approved in the next few
days.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli source said that Israel's stand toward the
establishment of the bank has not changed despite the change in
government.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, the newly elected prime minister gave new
energy and new impetus to the effort to establish the bank," the
source asserted.
</P>
<P>
The decision to create the Middle East Development Bank, as a
body to finance infrastructural projects in the region, was
considered as one of the most outstanding results of the Amman
economic summit.
</P>
<P>
According to the statute drafted last November in Cairo by a
commission of experts, the startup capital of 1.25 billion
dollars should be provided by the U.S., Japan, Russia -- 21
percent, 9.5 percent and 6 percent respectively, while Israel,
Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian self-rule areas should account
for four percent each.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said the remaining capital is to be put up by
the Netherlands, Canada, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Greece,
Malta, Korea, Turkey and Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Defects Crop Up in Purchased U.S. Made Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Serious defects have been
cropping up in a number of F-18 fighter jets purchased by the
Kuwaiti army soon after the Gulf War in 1990-91, official sources
said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said signs of corrosion had been noticed in
certain fighter jets only after several years of use.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti government had bought 40 F-18 fighter jets after
its liberation from the Iraqi seven-month occupation in 1991 in a
package deal. Presently, the Kuwaiti military authorities are
looking into other possible problems in the fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
They thought there might be a possibility that some parts
installed in the fighter jets were outdated or had been taken
from inventory in spareparts warehouses.
</P>
<P>
They said:"another aspect currently being probed by the army
is the likelihood that the manufacturers used substandard parts
or less durable parts in constructing the fighter jets."
</P>
<P>
F-18 is an advanced model of fighter jets manufactured in the
U.S. with a high combat capability.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Kuwaiti army was currently negotiating
with the manufacturers for carrying out necessary maintenance and
repairs.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kuwaiti Air Force "will most likely temporarily
reduce reliance on this particular model of fighter jets in view
of this problem, along with other causes," the sources
added.

DAR ES SALAAM, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Total output of Tanzania's
cereals this financial year is expected to increase by 2.4
percent while that of non-cereals is expected to decline by 1.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the Food Security Department of the Ministry of Agriculture

food maize was expected to increase by 2.7 percent to 2.64 million
tonnes from 2.57 million tonnes recorded during 1995/96.
</P>
<P>
The review estimated total cereal availability during 1996/97
at 4.5 million tonnes against the total annual requirement of
4.476 million tonnes.
</P>
<P>
"Following satisfactory food supply estimated during 1996/97,
the overall food prices are expected to decline, and thus ease
the inflationary pressures during 1996/97," the BOT review added.

Region after the handover of Hong Kong in 1997.
</P>
<P>
British representative Allen Paul said that the decision to
award the six licenses will provide the Hong Kong consumer with
more choice and higher quality services at competitive prices and
that it will not result in a wastage of resources or in damaging
competition.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Adopts New Way to Compute Foreign Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank adopted
a new method to compute the country's foreign debts and found they
registered a fall of 37.78 billion U.S. dollars as of the end of
1995, Governor of the Central Bank Gabriel Singson said here today
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that the new method excluded the
"net due to head office" of foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
These funds, which in fact formed part of the permanent capital
of the branches of the foreign banks in the Philippines, had
formerly been considered part of the country's external debts.
</P>
<P>
Singson noted that a foreign bank branch does not really "owe"
its head office abroad, as any liability of the foreign bank
branch is also the liability of the head office.
</P>
<P>
However, the new computation also excluded revaluation of
multi-currency loans from the World Bank and Asian Development
Bank, he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Criticizes Syrian-made Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish officials have criticized a
Syrian-made TV series that shows Ottomans impaling Arabs on
stakes, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The series, recently released in Europe and the Middle East, is
controversial because the company that produced it is owned by
Syrian Vice-President Abdul-Halim Khaddam's son Basem Khaddam, the
Turkish Daily News said.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Turkish officials as saying that the series
"Brothers of the Earth" is intended to foment hatred toward
Ottomans and Turks.
</P>
<P>
The series covers events from 1912 to 1918 in the Middle East
in an exaggerated way, the officials claimed.
</P>
<P>
The series portrays Cemal Pasa, one of the three most important
personalities in the Union and Progress Party, as the killer of
poor and innocent Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Although, historically, Cemal Pasa tried to put down Arab
uprisings, the series exaggerated it by showing him eagerly
impaling Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The paper also quoted some sources as saying that the Syrian
Army gave its support to the film by providing figurines and
costume, and both the director and screenwriter are Syrian.
</P>
<P>
The series includes 30 episodes, each 45 minutes long.
</P>
<P>
"Brothers of the Earth" was shown in Saudi Arabia, the United
Arab Emirates, Syria and Libya at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Syria's ties with Turkey have been strained by the water issue
of the Euphrates and by Syria's support for the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK), that has fought a separatist war with
Turkish government troops in southeast Turkey since 1984.

<P>
Atlanta, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A bomb went off at the Olympic

</P>
<P>
"There was a loud explosion and I saw a woman's leg was blown

<HEADLINE> Romanian President to Run for Second Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Ion Iliescu
agreed today to run in the November presidential election as the
candidate of the ruling Party of Social Democracy (PDSR).
</P>
<P>
But Iliescu made it a condition of his candidacy that there be
an anti-corruption drive in the PDSR, which was formed in 1993 by
the Democratic National Salvation Front and several other parties.
</P>
<P>
At today's PDSR national convention, Iliescu, 66, said the
party must choose "clean" candidates to stand in the parliamentary
polls, which will take place in parallel with the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
The convention adopted a resolution calling on Romania's law
enforcement sector to quicken its investigation into the
corruption scandal surrounding PDSR's former top leader and make
the truth known to the public.
</P>
<P>
The party planned to ask the new parliament to approve a bill
demanding all deputies declare personal property obtained between
1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
PDSR Executive Chairman Adrian Nastase said his party needed to
ally with the Socialist Labor Party and the Socialist Party in
order to gain more votes in the parliamentary ballots.
</P>
<P>
The two main opposition parties -- the Democratic Convention of
Romania Alliance (CDR) and the Social Democratic Union (USD) --
were likely to gain about 54 percent of the vote, Nastase said.
</P>
<P>
He said his party would try to win the next presidency and the
right to form a new cabinet and prevent the opposition parties
from forming a government.
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll released today by the private SOROS institute
gave Iliescu 33 percent of support, far ahead of his closest rival
-- Emil Constantinescu from the CDR with 23 percent. The third
candidate, Petre Roman from the USD, won 16 percent of support,
the poll showed.
</P>
<P>
Iliescu came to power in 1989 after former Romanian President
Nicolae Ceausescu was overthrown and secretly executed by troops
loyal to Iliescu.
</P>
<P>
He was elected Romania's president in 1990 after his National
Salvation Front won the general election that year. He was
re-elected in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Paper calls to seek the Tangshan spirit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Commemorating the 20th anniversary
of the century's worst earthquake that flattened Tangshan city,
the China Daily today calls on the whole nation to develop the
Tangshan spirit in the country's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
The China Daily commentary recalls that the quake left 240,000
people dead and 160,000 disabled, and destroyed 14 million square
meters of buildings and 5.3 million homes in and near Tangshan.
</P>
<P>
The commentary describes the national unity and selflessness as
the Tangshan spirit. It says that the spirit of national unity was
played to the full after the Tangshan earthquake when the
survivors braved frequent aftershocks to come to rescue to people
they did not know.
</P>
<P>
"Thousands of construction workers from all over the country
worked shoulder to shoulder with the earthquake survivors to give
the city a new birth", the paper says, "if not for such unselfish
help, the death toll could have been much higher."
</P>
<P>
Thanks to 20 years' strenguous effort from the local people and
great support from the whole nation, a new Tangshan, much larger
and more prosperous than the destroyed one, has risen from the
debris, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
The commentary also says that through the rescue and
reconstruction efforts in Tangshan, the Chinese government's care
for human rights has won full support from the Chinese people and
wide international acknowledgement.
</P>
<P>
If the whole nation adhere to the spirit of
Tangshan: "readiness in going through thick and thin together,
being undaunted in the face of setbacks and relentlessly pursuing
of human development", the commentary concludes, China will have a
good chance of reaching its development goals for the next 15
years.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Gross International Reserves Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' gross
international reserves held by the Central Bank has reached 10.7
billion US dollars as of July 24, an increase of 39 percent over
the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Singson, the central bank governor, said here today
that the growth should be attributed to the continued inflow of
foreign exchange that was brought about by the country's robust
performance of the export sector.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the year, the bank has purchased a total of
3.9 billion US dollars, net of sales, from the Philippine dealing
system -- the country's electronic foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
The bank's present amount of the gross international reserves
is enough for more than 3 months worth of imports of goods and
services.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report On Tin, CPO, Rubber Markets In Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The tin, crude palm oil (CPO)
and rubber markets in Malaysia ended the week mixed with tin and
COP prices firmer while the rubber price mixed.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) ended the week higher in
brisk trading aided by strong performance of the London Metal
Exchange (LME).
</P>
<P>
The tin market here started the week on a weak note but
rebounded at midweek and strengthened further before the weekend.
The tin price gained 14 sen this week to close at 15.39 Malaysian
Ringgit (about 6.15 US dollars) per kg, with European and Japanese
and local buyers dominating the bulk of transactions.
</P>
<P>
Turnover for the week climbed to 597 tons from last week's 568
tons. The KLTM premium over the LME broadened to 85 US dollars per
ton from 50 dollars per ton last week.
</P>
<P>
The crude palm oil physicals ended the week also better aided
by the bullish export figures released during the week. It is
announced that Malaysia's palm oil export for July 1-25 rose to
521,904 tons compared with 484,915 tons in June 1-25.
</P>
<P>
The market rose as it followed strongly with the performance on
the Chicago Board of Trade throughout the week. The market started
the week unchanged, but was improved after the news that the
Indian government would cut import duties on edible oil to 20
percent from 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
July South expired on Thursday and August South was traded at
1,100 Malaysian Ringgit ( about 440 US dollars) per ton, 25
Ringgit (about 10 dollars) higher compared with last week's
closing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Malaysian rubber market ended the week mixed on
short covering ahead of the long weekend. Compared with the prices
finished last week, August RSS One dropped 0.5 sen to 333 sen
(about 1.33 US dollars) per kg, and SMR 20 rose three sen to 307.5
sen (about 1.23 dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
Dealers here said heavy buying interest from China and Europe
for SMR 20 boosted prices of the grade.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Aims to Be Auto Parts Hub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Thailand, already a leading player
in auto assembly in Southeast Asia, is also aiming to become an
auto parts production base for the region.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, the top car assembler in the region, produced 570,000
units last year, with an auto market worth nearly 100 billion baht
(4 billion US dollars), of which half was from locally-produced
auto parts.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia was the second largest auto assembler in the region,
with 400,000 units last year.
</P>
<P>
To further expand auto parts industry, the Thai government has
adopted attractive investment and deregulation policies.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry will cut tariffs on raw materials used in
auto parts production by the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
The government's Board of Investment (BOI) has decided to grant
privileges to another 10 categories of supporting industries in
addition to the existing 14 categories that enjoy incentives.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Thai Industry Ministry has decided to abolish
the 54 percent local content requirement by July 1998, two years
ahead of schedule. This will attract more assemblers who will be
free to use parts from any production center.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of this year, BOI approved 312 projects
in the auto parts industry, valued at a total of 95.6 billion baht
(about 3.84 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Among them, investment in engines and engine parts ranked first
with 150 projects worth 26.8 billion baht (1.07 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Thailand aims to produce 100 percent local content diesel
engines by 1998.
</P>
<P>
Thailand-produced engines, engine parts, electronics and
decorative accessories were rated at 'above average' standards,
according to a survey by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers
Association on parts standards in three Southeast Asian countries
-- Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian-made engines, transmission equipment, engine parts
and decorative accessories were rated above average, but
Malaysian-made electronic equipment was rated average, while
engines and parts, transmission equipment and decorative
accessories were rated below average.
</P>
<P>
Some auto parts manufacturers are thinking of relocating their
plants to Thailand due to its more favorable investment
environment, a BOI official said.

in the Olympic Games," said Gong Luming, head coach of the Chinese

<HEADLINE> U.S. Relaxes Ban on Imports of Thai Shrimps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States has agreed to
relax its ban on imports of Thai shrimps by allowing Thai trawlers
to use turtle excluders on a voluntary basis, Director-General of
the Thai Fisheries Department Plodprasop Suraswadi confirmed
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decision will allow the import of shrimps that are
certified by the Thai government for the use of turtle excluders,
said Plodprasop Suraswadi, who had held talks with officials of
the U.S. State Department in the U.S. earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. remained firm that Thailand must eventually
legislate to make trawlers use excluders to demonstrate a
commitment to the protection of sea turtles, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had earlier imposed an embargo on imports of Thai
shrimps, which it said were caught by trawlers without any device
to let endangered sea turtles escape.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that Thailand has agreed to the use of
excluders to save sea turtles and related agencies are seeking a
proper device suitable for Thai trawlers.
</P>
<P>
Thai officials are scheduled to visit the U.S. again in August
to show the progress of the measure.

<HEADLINE> Spain Wins First Semifinal Berth in Hockey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Spain qualified for the semifinals
of the Olympic men's field hockey tournament for the first time
since 1980 when they coasted past the United States in their
fourth group A match on Friday.
</P>
<P>
They led the weak host team 3-0 inside 25 minutes and went on
to a 7-1 victory, the biggest winning margin of these Games in
either men's or women's competition.
</P>
<P>
Spain's fourth successive win put them in an unassailable
position at the head of their group, three points ahead of Olympic
champion Germany with one pool match to play.
</P>
<P>
Germany, who looked in some danger of not reaching the
semifinals when they gained only one point from their first two
games, continued their improvement with a commanding 3-0 win over
Argentina which virtually ended any prospects the Pan American
champions had of making the last four.
</P>
<P>
A win over the Americans will ensure their place in the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
A near capacity crowd of 14,800, the biggest of the tournament,
turned out to watch the clash between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
It was hardly a vintage game between the Asian giants, the
goalless draw doing no favours for either team.
</P>
<P>
Both need Germany to slip up against the Americans to have a
chance of finishing second in the group.

<HEADLINE> Manila, Muslim Group to Sign Final Deal in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) are expected to sign next
month the final accord on peace in Mindanao in the south of the
country, the Philippine Daily Inquirer reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Blo Adiong, an MNLF peace negotiator, as
saying that the Muslim rebel group and the government have
requested the Indonesian government to schedule the fourth and the
last round of their formal peace talks in Jakarta on August 2 or
August 3.
</P>
<P>
"We are just waiting for Indonesia's response," Adiong said.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta talks are expected to produce the final accord on
an end to 27 years of war between government troops and MNLF
fighters in Mindanao, which claimed over 120,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
The final accord will provide for, among other things, the
creation of the Southern Philippines Council for Peace and
Development, an MNLF-led body under the office of the president
that will oversee government projects in 14 provinces in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
According to MNLF officials, after the accord is initially
signed in Jakarta, it will be brought to Tripoli, capital of
Libya, where a Mindanao peace accord was forged in 1976.
</P>
<P>
The document will then be brought to the headquarters of the
Organization of Islamic Conference in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, for
symbolic signing, and lastly back to Manila, where a final formal
signing ceremony will take place.

<HEADLINE> Perez and Barnes Split Golds in Olympic Athletics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A little-known Ecuador's walker
and a world class American shot putter split the gold medals on
the opening day of the Olympic athletics competition here today.
</P>
<P>
Jefferson Perez, a 23-year-old from Ecuador's mountain area,
upset many big names to win the men's 20-kilometer walk gold. It
is the first medal ever for Ecuador in history.
</P>
<P>
His winning time was one hours 20 minutes and 7 seconds, about
14 seconds faster than his personal best.
</P>
<P>
Ilya Markov of Russia won the silver in 1:20:16 ahead of world
best time setter Bernardo Segura of Mexico, 1:20:23.
</P>
<P>
The day's other gold medal was taken by world record holder
Randy Barnes who unleashed his winning toss of 21.62 meters on the
final outing, bringing a packed home crowd of more than 80,000 to
their feet at the Olympic stadium in the men's shot put final.
</P>
<P>
Another American John Godina won the silver with a 20.79 toss
to Aleksandr Bagach of Ukraine's 20.75.
</P>
<P>
Other big names including Michael Johnson of the United States,
Frank Fredericks of Namibia, and American women star sprinters
Gail Devers and Gwen Torrence, stormed into the next round easily.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 20km final, which started in the cool early
morning, a field of 61 walkers opened their battle with Igor
Kollar of Slovakia leading as a rabbit in the early stages.
</P>
<P>
About 23 minutes later, the big bunch caught up Kollar and
rolled forward together with Rishat Shafikov of Russia and China's
Li Zewen, World Cup winner last year, leading the pace.
</P>
<P>
Perez, Markov and Segura just followed Shafikov and Li
comfortablely and passed the first 10 kilometer point in 40:59.
</P>
<P>
Shafikov, whose best time this season was 1:19:13, used a
higher gear to break away from the field and built up a big 15
second lead in the following two kilometers.
</P>
<P>
At that time, only seven walkers could hang on in the second
squad and Li has faded for good.
</P>
<P>
After 15 kilometers, Shafikov still remained as a clear leader
and never looked back to stride on, leaving Segura, who set a
1:17:25 world best two years ago, and Perez, South American
champion last year, battling against Markov.
</P>
<P>
With two kilometers to ago, Shafikov was given a warning by a
referee and that forced him to slow his pace. Markov passed the
18km mark in 1:12:29 with Perez and Segura close at his heels.
</P>
<P>
In the final 1,000 meters, Perez found a higher gear to get rid
of his rivals and walked into the stadium first for a surprising
victory.
</P>
<P>
Shafikov finished fifth in 1:20:41 and Li wound up 28th in
1:25:28. A total of six walkers including early rabit Koller and
Julius Sawe of Kenay were disqualified.
</P>
<P>
The men's shot put saw three Americans fight against a couple
of Europeans throughout the showdown.
</P>
<P>
Barnes, silver medalist at the 1988 Olympics, led the opening
round with a 20.44 toss, but Paolo Dal Soglio of Italy, European
Cup winner last year, responsed strongly on his second round with
a 20.65 effort, while Bagach improved to 20.50.
</P>
<P>
Cheered by the yelling fans, C.j. Hunter put the U.S.A. name
first on the board in the fourth round with 20.64, but Soglio
gained the lead quickly with a 20.74.
</P>
<P>
World champion Godina turned the table in the next round with a
20.79 push, and Barnes found his biggest one in the final toss.
</P>
<P>
Bagach, who ranked sixth before the last round, almost beat
Godina with his final effort. His bronze winning distance was only
four centimeters shy of the American.
</P>
<P>
The day was also highlighted by Fredericks who hit the tape
with a brilliant 9.93 seconds time in the men's 100m second round.
The time was only 0.01 outside of the Olympic record.
</P>
<P>
Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago looked also awesome when the
23-year-old turned in a 9.95 fast time in his group.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 100m second round, Devers clocked 10.94 and
Torrence was timed 11.11 to enter the semifinals. The two
Americans are the hot favorites to win the 100m title tomorrow
evening.
</P>
<P>
The only big name who met some trouble in the day's qualifying
was the world triple jump record holder Jonathan Edwards of
Britain. The Best Athlete of 1995, who set the 18.29m world
record, was four centimeters outside of the qualification mark,
and finished sixth with a best jump of 16.96m.
</P>
<P>
Kenny Harrison of the United States, who produced a 18.01-wind
aided mark early this season, showed he is the man to beat in the
event by topping the field today at 17.58m.
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow will feature four finals including the men's and
women's 100 meters, men's triple jump and women's javelin.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Women Duo Enter Table Tennis Semis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- World and Olympic champions Deng
Yaping and Qiao Hong of China survived big scares to secure their
semifinal berth in the women's doubles table tennis tournament
here Friday at the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Against a pair of Chen Jing and Chen Chiu-tan of Chinese
Taipei, the top seeded paddlers surrendered the first and fourth
sets before winning the breaking points for their eventual outing
in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jing, former Olympic women's singles champion in the 1988
Seoul Games when she represented China, staged the nail-biting
challenges as the backbone of the Hong Kong squad by taking the
first set 21-18.
</P>
<P>
Deng Yaping, also current world and Olympic champion, remained
steady in her fast attacks to anchor her teammate Qiao Hong to win
the second and third sets and even surged ahead in the fourth set.
</P>
<P>
However, Qiao Hong who ranked second, only next to teammate
Deng in the world, hit outside time and again, enabling the Hong
Kong pair to catch up anew and overtake the Chinese duo for a 2-2
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
With her forehand top spin and backhand flat shots, Chen Jing
displayed her top-notched prowess as a hard nut for the top duo in
the world by surging ahead in the decisive set.
</P>
<P>
However, the experienced Deng and Qiao were in no way concede
their defeat despite being lagged 14-18, a seemingly certain upset
in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
By sparing little effort, the Chinese paddlers pulled back with
more fierce fast attacks for a 19-all tie before sealing the game
18-21, 21-16, 21-19, 22-24 and 23-21.
</P>
<P>
Qiao admitted later they were pleased to win the game, saying
"they are tough opponents but we were no way to concede and kept
on fighting till the final point."
</P>
<P>
With the hard-won victory, Deng and Qiao will face semifinal
opponents eighth-seeded Kim Moo-Kyo and Park Kyoung-Ae of South
Korea who eliminated third-seeded Hong Kong duo of Chai Po-wa and
Chan Tan-lui 21-18, 21-13, 21-13.
</P>
<P>
The other two semi-finalists will come out of the later games
on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition Demands Minister's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Nepali opposition lawmakers has
demanded Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat to resign after the
revelation of his personal account in a US bank.
</P>
<P>
Opposition MPs especially those from the main opposition
Communist Party of Nepal (UML) Friday at a lower house meeting
raised moral and legal questions over Mahat's foreign bank
account, which was revealed by a CPN-UML lawmaker Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The opposition lawmaker disclosed that the finance minister has
maintained an account in the Worldwide Consumer bank (WCB) of New
York even after being appointed cabinet member last September.
</P>
<P>
He submitted a photocopy of a WCB bank statement for Mahat's
account to house speaker Ram Chandra Poudel. The bank statement
shows that Mahat has nearly 47,000 US dollars in the account till
late June.
</P>
<P>
A local post office worker intercepted a letter containing the
bank statement from America and handed over it to the opposition,
according to a source on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Under Nepal's foreign exchange regulations act, a Nepali
national living in Nepal has to get permission from the country's
central bank for maintaining a foreign bank account. Any violation
of the act could lead to fine and imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Friday's lower house meeting was adjourned without starting its
regular discussion as opposition MPs demanded a conclusion on the
issue of the finance minister's foreign bank account.
</P>
<P>
Later at the meeting the minister explained that he opened the
account several years ago when he worked with the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) as an economist.
</P>
<P>
It was not possible for him to close the account immediately as
he needed years to settle claims between him and the UNDP, Mahat
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mahat, he had already informed Nepal Rastra Bank,
the central bank, about his foreign account. However, local
newspapers said there was no record about his account in the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
Mahat said he opened the account in 1988 when he joined UNDP
service and the agency paid his salary into the account.

<HEADLINE> Americans Lead in Olympic Swimming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- As expected, the United States
showed its supremacy with the biggest medal haul in the Olympic
swimming pool here, capitalizing on its home-turf advantage.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. squad grabbed a total of 13 golds, 11 silvers and two
bronzes, well ahead of the second-placed Russia with four golds,
two silvers and two bronzes.
</P>
<P>
"The United States, who finished disappointingly at the Rome
World Championships, really made rapid progress," said Lu
Yongming, one of China's swimming coaches.
</P>
<P>
However, the brilliance of the U.S. swimmers was jostled by
Michelle Smith of Ireland, a real late boomer at the age of 26,
who stunned the spectators by snatching three golds and one bronze
from the hands of the Americans, out of four individual events in
which she had been entered.
</P>
<P>
The controversy in her late entry as well as the drug suspicion
raised by the Americans just made the "magic" woman even more
splendid. Hers are the first Olympic swimming golds for her
country.
</P>
<P>
Just like Ireland, South Africa, former minnow in the pool,
also celebrated their first swimming golds since 1951 in the
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Penelope Heyns swam to two golds in the women's breaststroke
events, and she shattered her four-month-long world mark in the
100m heats.
</P>
<P>
Her fellow countrywoman Marianne Kriel also snatched a
surprising bronze in the 100m backstroke.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, pre-Games hot topics Germany and Japan suffered
unexpected disappointment here. Both teams slumped in the final
medal standings without a gold.
</P>
<P>
Australian fans got some relief on the final day after a long,
long wait.
</P>
<P>
Susan O'Neil ended Australia's gold drought by winning a gold
in the women's 200m butterfly Friday night while her fellow
countryman Kieren Perkins added another title in the men's 1,500m
free, just one hour later.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team also experienced mixed feelings in the
week-long competitions in the pool.
</P>
<P>
Their men made an impressive performance here with two swimmers
entering the finals, while Jiang Chengji shattered Asian records
on four occasions, in the 50m free and 100m butterfly.
</P>
<P>
His fourth-place finish in both events is the highest ever for
the Chinese male swimmers at Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"It's a historical breakthrough for us," said his coach Zhou
Ming. "In the near furture the Chinese male swimmers will become
more competitive against their European rivals."
</P>
<P>
Le Jingyi, world champion and world record holder, competing in
her second Olympics, added one gold in the 100-meter freestyle and
one silver in the 50m free to her personal medal credit.
</P>
<P>
But some Chinese youngsters with high expectations before the
Games, failed to make a strong impact in the competitions.
</P>
<P>
"It's logical. Anything could happen in the competitions,
especially in such a big clash like Olympics, " explained Zhou.
"It's really tough for the first-time Olympians."
</P>
<P>
However, not all veterans gave spectacular shows.
</P>
<P>
Janet Evans, a three-times Olympian from the U.S. with four
Olympic gold medals, found the Atlanta trip was just a nightmare
for her.
</P>
<P>
The triple world record holder could manage to place sixth in
her speciality, the women's 800m freestyle, and was eliminated
from the 400m freestyle final, the first Olympic preliminary
crash-out for her.
</P>
<P>
Gemany's "Golden Fish" Franziskan Van Almsick, who took the
limelight with two silvers and two bronzes at the Barcelona Games,
failed to fulfill her Olympic gold dream.
</P>
<P>
The highly-expected 18-year-old took a silver in the 200m
freestyle and was fifth in the 100m freestyle, in addition to a
bronze in the 4X100m freestyle relay at the current Games.

<P>
MOSCOW, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Bolivia agreed today to
strengthen their political ties and cooperate in the fight
against drug-trafficking and in environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during a meeting between Russian
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Bolivian Minister of Foreign
Affairs and Worship Antonio Guiroga.
</P>
<P>
They signed three documents, including a basic treaty on
the strengthening of bilateral ties, an accord on cooperation in
the crackdown on drug-trafficking and a memorandum on cooperation
in environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Primakov said Guiroga's visit would
promote political and economic ties between the two countries and
spoke highly of the basic treaty on bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Latin America has an important position in Russia's foreign
policy, said Primakov, who visited Bolivia and two other Latin
American nations in May.
</P>
<P>
Primakov also reiterated Russia's all-round foreign policy,
which he advocated since taking office last year, saying Russia
would not give its foreign policy priority to only one
region.

KIEV, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine opened a station today to
dismantle SS-19 intercontinental ballistic missiles under its
nuclear weapons reduction treaty with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The official news agency said the major task of the station was
to dismantle and neutralize Ukraine's 130 SS-19 missiles which
were still directed towards the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The station was expected to dismantle at least four missiles a
month. If the works goes as planned, Ukraine would get rid of the
missiles by December 1998.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has provided 250 million U.S. dollars in financial
aid to help build the station under the U.S.-Ukrainian agreement
on eliminating strategic nuclear weapons, signed in December
1993.

<HEADLINE> Argentine President Fires Economy Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Menem today asked Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo to resign and
appointed Central Bank President Roque Fernandez to replace him.
</P>
<P>
"The President has asked me to announce that ... he has asked
for (Cavallo's) resignation," Presidential Press Secretary Raul
Delgado said in a brief statement.
</P>
<P>
Menem's request was made Wednesday after a clash with Cavallo.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the cause of the dispute was Cavallo's
disagreement with Menem about the way to finance the Bank Social
Services Institute.
</P>
<P>
The economy minister objected to a presidential decree to
reinstate a 2 percent tax on certain bank industry transactions.
The tax was eliminated last year.
</P>
<P>
Cavallo, 49, took over the Economy Ministry in 1991. His main
achievement was to implement the so-called Convertibility Plan,
which rapidly stabilized Argentina's economy.
</P>
<P>
The analysts said that Cavallo's resignation would affect the
stability of this South American country's economy, since rumors
spreading in recent days had caused a steep slide in the local
stock market.
</P>
<P>
The Merval index, which measures the main stocks, plunged to
end more than 4 percent lower today.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- World record holder Randy Barnes
of the United States turned the table with his final push to win
the thrilling-fight of the men's shot put gold here this evening
at the Olympicathletics competition.
</P>
<P>
It was a battle between the Americans and Europeans and the
fight was not finished until the last toss. John Godina won the
silver with a 20.79m effort for the host and Aleksandr Bagach of
Ukraine wound up third four centimeters behind.
</P>
<P>
Barnes, silver medalist at the 1988 Olympics, led the opening
round with a toss of 20.44 meters, ahead of Bagach, European
runner-up last year, by three centimeters.
</P>
<P>
Paolo Dal Soglio of Italy, European Cup winner in 1995,
responsed strongly on the second outing with a 20.65 effort, while
Bagach improved to 20.50.
</P>
<P>
Cheered by a packed crowd of 80,000 fans, C.J. Hunter managed a

<HEADLINE> Perry to Ask Saudi to Share Security Cost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry will go to Saudi Arabia this weekend to persuade the kingdom
to share the increased costs for the security of American troops
stationed there, Pentagon officials said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Perry proposed last week that as many as 5,000 American troops
be moved from densely populated urban facilities to the remote air
base of Al kharj, about 55 miles southeast of the capital city of
Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
The redeployment of the troops is expected to cost hundreds of
millions of dollars, and Perry's visit aims at asking the kingdom
to pay at least half of the cost of the new security measure, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The plan to protect the American soldiers deployed in the
kingdom was drawn up following the truck bomb explosion at an air
base near Dhahran, on June 25, which killed 19 American air force
personnel.
</P>
<P>
Perry will also carry with him security proposals made by
U.S. Army General Binford Peay, chief of the U.S. Central Command,
which is responsible for American forces in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
"It is a visit to discuss security ... It is to discuss the
costs and how we pay for troop movements," said officials.
</P>
<P>
Saudi defense Minister Prince Sultan has publicly signaled
support of the U.S. move, but Perry wants to discuss the
specifics, according to Friday's New York Times.
</P>
<P>
Perry also planned to travel to Kuwait and Bahrain, where he
may meet with other commanders of the 20,000 American troops now
stationing in the Gulf.

<HEADLINE> More Ships Apply for Registration in Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, July 26 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of
vessels from other countries applied for registration in Panama
this year, bringing more revenue to the country which has the
world's shipping registration record.
</P>
<P>
Most of the ships being built around the world have already
been registered in the tiny Central American country, Alejandro
Kouruklis, vice consular and shipping director in the Finance
Ministry, said today.
</P>
<P>
Panama provided 445 ships with its flag this year, surpassing
the number registered in the same period of last year and
generating some 1 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Kouruklis said the political crisis in Liberia, Panama's main
competitor, has caused many shipping companies to choose
registering in the Panamanian merchant navy.
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of the Panama-registered fleet came from Asia,
mostly from Japan, while 30 percent were Greek and 10 percent from
the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Panama has 132 consulates around the world, but only 58 can
register merchant ships.
</P>
<P>
Panama has, from a technical point of view, the biggest
merchant fleet of the world in terms of the number of ships and
registered gross tonnage, which amounts to 99 million tons.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government Friday imposed
stricter controls on food imported from Japan to prevent diseases
caused by escherichia coli bacteria, the Bangkok Post reported
today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Thai Health Ministry, the bacteria can cause
stomach ache and severe diarrhea and may even lead to renal
failure.
</P>
<P>
Inspectors from related departments have started to check food
imports from Japan, particularly raw meat, and collect samples for
medical analysis at the Don Muang International Airport and Klong
Toey port here, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Importers have agreed to slow down their distribution of food
products to facilitate the checks.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry urged people not to consume uncooked food
to minimize the risk of being infected with the bacteria.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Regulates Layoff of Public Employees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan Ministerial Council
approved a decree to regulate layoff of public employees during
institutional restructuring and a privatization process.
</P>
<P>
The decree aims mainly to minimize the social impact of
dismissals, to make government agencies more efficient and to
rationalize public spending, said Information Central Office
Director Fernando Egana.
</P>
<P>
The decree also seeks to apply a correct policy of austerity,
find the best way to administer human resources and avoid wasting
public funds, added Egana.
</P>
<P>
Under the decree, authorities have to report to a presidential
commission whether the restructuring, privatization or liquidation
of public organizations need any layoffs.
</P>
<P>
Employers are required to grant retirement to employees when
they reach the legal age of retirement.

ATLANTA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Mansueto Velasco of the
Philippines pulled off one of the biggest boxing upsets of the
Olympics on Friday when he won a decision over Cuba's Yosvani
Aguilera.

Velasco's win was the first by any boxer against the Cubans,
who had won 14 consecutive bouts at the Atlanta Games.

</P>
<P>
He got inside to land quick combinations, then bounced around
the ring before landing another flurry.
</P>
<P>
Velasco advanced to a quarterfinal fight against Hamid Berhili
of Morocco, who beat Yang Xiangzhong of China 14-9.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, two boxers from Thailand won easily to give
their country three boxers in the Olympic quarterfinals.

kilogram bout by an 18-7 margin, while Veongviact Phongsit won by

campaign in Bosnia, the office of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) based in Banja Luka said today.
</P>
<P>

agency reported from the largest Serb city of Banja Luka in
northwestern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Every coalition of at least four parties can receive 400,000
U.S. dollars at the most, while every party running independently
in the elections can receive up to 240,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Dimas Wins 83-kg Weightlifting with Two World Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Barcelona Olympic gold medalist
Pyrros Dimas of Greece lifted two world records in the snatch and
total to win the 83-kg category event at the Centennial Olympic
Games here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
German Marc Huster won the silver medal with a world mark in
the clean and jerk.
</P>
<P>
Dimas, who won the world championships in Guangzhou, China last
November, snatched 180 kilograms and jerked 212.5 kilograms for a
total of 392.5 while Huster had 170 in the snatch and 212.5 in the
jerk for a combined weight of 382.5 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Andrzej Cofalik of Poland finished third at 372.5 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Huster hoisted 213.5 in the jerk for a new world mark.
</P>
<P>
According to the rules of the International Weightlifting
Federation, those weight which could be divided by 2.5 are
effective in the competition results.
</P>
<P>
Dimas, who began his competition in weightlifting at the age of
10, established his winning status after his first lift of 172.5
kilograms in the snatch.
</P>
<P>
"When I made first attempt, I know I will win the gold medal,"
Dimas said.
</P>
<P>
After making the weight at 175 in his second try in the snatch,
Dimas requested a world record of 180 kilograms in the third, and
lifted the barbell high above his head.
</P>
<P>
After the snatch competition, he defeated his nearest rival by
10 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
In the clean and jerk which witnessed a competition against
himself for the Olympic gold, Dimas had a world record weight of
213 kilograms in his third lift which he kept for a merely one
minute.
</P>
<P>
Huster, who finished second to Dimas at the world
championhships last year, successfuly improved the world record in
the jerk by 0.5 kilograms in his third attempt.
</P>
<P>
After lifting the weight, Huster jumped to the air and made
figures on the lifting arena which brought him applauses and
laughs from the crowds.
</P>
<P>
For Dimas, with two world records and two Olympic golds in
hands, he has been a hero back home.
</P>
<P>
"I have trained three years for the Olympic Games," he said.
"My main purpose here is to win Olympic gold medal."
</P>
<P>
"When I saw it was my day, I tried to break world records,"
added the Greek.
</P>
<P>
Huster, who faild his first lift at 170 kilograms in the
snatch, admitted that he was a little bit nervous in today's
competitions.
</P>
<P>
"I was not strong in the snatch, " he said. "Perhaps it was
because of the excitement of the Olympics."
</P>
<P>
"I was a little bit nervous at the moment," he added. "So I
failed to make 170 in my first lift in the snatch."
</P>
<P>
After six-day competitions in weightlifting, China and Turkey
each had two golds to lead the medal table, with Cuba and Greece
each taking one from six categories.
</P>
<P>
The 91-kg category is scheduled for Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Frank Fredericks of Namibia clocked
an unusually fast time of 9.93 seconds in the men's 100-meter second
round here this evening at the current Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian eased up in the final strides, but his winning time
was only 0.01 second outside the Olympic record set by Carl Lewis of
the United States in 1988.
</P>
<P>
His speed looked awesome and many people singled him out as the
hottest favourite to win the men's 100 meter title. The 28-year-old,
who has run the second fastest 100 meters in history with a time of
9.87 last month, may beat the world record in Saturday's final.

<HEADLINE> Senate Approves Sanctions Against Burma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Senate passed today a bill
that will impose limited sanctions against Burma in a bid to force
political change in that Southeast Asian country.
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved 93-7, was an amendment, sponsored by
Republican senator William Cohen of Maine, which calls for an
immediate end to U.S. government assistance to Burma except for
humanitarian and counter-narcotics aid.
</P>
<P>
Burma's Asian neighbors, however, stand firm against the
sanctions, dismissing them as "counter-productive."
</P>
<P>
The bill directs the president to impose a ban on new U.S.
investment in the country if what U.S. lawmakers called repression
increases or opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi is exiled, harmed
or arrested. It also directs the U.S. government to oppose loans
to Burma by international lending institutions.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the sanctions is to increase pressure on the Burmese
regime of the State Law and Order Restoration Council to make
political reforms, said an administration official.
</P>
<P>
State Department officials applauded the measures against
Burma.
</P>
<P>
"It provides the administration the flexibility that we need to
press the Burmese regime to make progress in the areas of
democracy and human rights and counter-narcotics," said State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions will last until the U.S. president certifies to
Congress that Burma has made "measurable and substantial" progress
in improving human rights practices and implementing democratic
government.
</P>
<P>
The moving force behind the sanctions against Burma is
Republican Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who has supported
Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, pushed the plan for
three years, and favored a total cutoff of economic ties to Burma.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher called on Asian
countries last week to join U.S. efforts in imposing sanctions
against Burma, before leaving for the ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) Regional Forum in Jakarta, but received
negative response from the ASEAN member states. Instead, the ASEAN
offered Burma an observatory status.
</P>
<P>
The member states of ASEAN remain steadfast in their opposition
to the sanctions against Burma.
</P>
<P>
"The Western solution is not the way," said a Thai Foreign
Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas dismissed the sanctions
as counter-productive.
</P>
<P>
"We don't think it will achieve even the objectives that have
been pursued by those who would exert or apply those economic
sanctions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The total U.S. investment in Burma is relatively small,
estimated at around 200 million dollars between 1989 and 1994.

<HEADLINE> Perry to Ask Saudi to Share Troop Movement Cost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry will travel to Saudi Arabia this weekend to press the
kingdom to share the increased cost for the security of American
troops stationed there, Pentagon officials said today.
</P>
<P>
Perry proposed last week that as many as 5,000 American troops
be moved from densely populated urban facilities to the remote air
base of Al kharj, about 55 miles southeast of the capital city of
Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
The redeployment of the troops is expected to cost hundreds of
millions of dollars, and Perry's aim of the visit is to ask the
kingdom to pay at least half of the cost of the new security
measures, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The plan to protect the American soldiers deployed in the
kingdom was drawn up after a truck bomb exploded in a air base
near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, on June 25, which killed 19 American
air force personnel.
</P>
<P>
Perry will also carry with him security proposals made by U.S.
Army Gen. Binford Peay, chief of the U.S. Central Command, which
is responsible for American forces in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
"It is a visit to discuss security.... It is to discuss the
costs and how we pay for troop movement," said one of the
officials.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Defense Minister Prince Sultan has publicly signaled
support for the U.S. move, but Perry wants to discuss the
specifics, according to today's New York Times.
</P>
<P>
Perry also planned to travel to Kuwait and Bahrain, where he
may meet with other commanders of the 20,000 American troops now
stationed in the Gulf.

ATLANTA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Olympic defending champion Gail
Devers and world champion Gwen Torrence, both from the United
States, sailed into the women's 100-meter semifinals easily here
on Friday in the Olympic athletics competition.
</P>
<P>
Devers, who clocked the fastest time of 10.92 seconds in this
morning's first round heats, went on to show her powerful speed in
the second round, winning in 10.94.
</P>
<P>
Torrence didn't run as fast as she could, but her winning heat
time of 11.11 in the second round is the third best.
</P>
<P>
Irina Privalova of Russia, Olympic and world bronze medalist,
was beaten into fourth in the third group which was won by Juliet
Cuthbert of Jamania. Cuthbert, Olympic 200m silver medalist, hit
the pace in 11.20 to Privalova's 11.40. However, the Russian
still qualified for the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Merlene Ottey of Jamania, silver winner both at the previous
Olympics and world championships, indicated that she might be a
tough challenger for the Americans to handle when the 36-year-old
turned in a 11.02 time, the second fastest in the second round.
</P>
<P>
The women's 100m final will be held Saturday evening with the
semifinals scheduled two hours before the showdown.

<HEADLINE> Two Engines of Ill-Fated TWA Flight Located </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Two engines from the ill-fated
flight of the Trans World Airlines were found today by the remote
video cameras in the main debris field in the Atlantic Ocean,
investigators announced.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came a day after divers brought up the jumbo
jet's black boxes, which record cockpit voices and flight data.
The cockpit tape carried the sounds of a normal flight, followed
by a mysterious split-second sound and then silence.
</P>
<P>
So far, no information has been available on the condition of
the two engines or when they might be raised from the ocean floor.
The Boeing 747 had four engines.
</P>
<P>
The new findings brought investigators closer to concluding
that a bomb blew the jetliner out of the sky, a source told The
Associated Press. "Investigators are holding out for physical
evidence before they declare the probe criminal," the source
added.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-bound TWA plane, which took off on July 17 from the
International Kennedy Airport, New York, exploded and crashed into
the waters off Long Island near New York. All 230 people aboard
were killed.
</P>
<P>
The search for the bodies and wreckage has been under way. At a
news briefing, Robert Francis, vice chairman of the National
Transportation Safety Board, said that 138 bodies had been found,
and the search for more bodies continued today in the sunken
wreckage off long Island.
</P>
<P>
A Family Information Center has been set up to ensure victims'
relatives receive prompt information on the investigation and the
recovery of bodies.

<HEADLINE> Some Senate Democrats Oppose Welfare Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A number of U.S. Senate
Democrats today asked President Bill Clinton to veto the latest
welfare reform bill, referring to a study that said the measure
would push 2 million adults and children into poverty.
</P>
<P>
Clinton promised drastic welfare changes during the 1992
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat from Minnesota, opposed the
latest welfare plan when it passed the Senate Wednesday, saying
the measure showed a congressional character flaw.
</P>
<P>
"When the Congress is willing to consign more than a million
children to poverty, we are suffering a spiritual deficit,"
Wellstone said. The proposal would "literally take food out of the
mouths of children," he said.
</P>
<P>
Senate Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that "there's
nothing in conference that could improve this legislation."
</P>
<P>
Some senators referred to a report issued by the Urban
Institute, which said the Republicans' latest welfare plan would
force 2.6 million people below the poverty line, including 1.1
million children.
</P>
<P>
But Senate Republican leader Trent Lott dismissed the report,
saying, "There are certain groups that want welfare for
everybody."
</P>
<P>
Republicans in the Senate and the House of Representatives
favor dismantling most of the existing federal welfare system and
replacing it with block grants for states to experiment with their
own poverty programs.
</P>
<P>
Both chambers want to end a six-decade entitlement of
assistance for the poor by requiring adult beneficiaries to work
after two years and cutting off cash assistance after five years.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has said more work is needed, but he has hinted that an
agreement with Congress on welfare changes -- a politically
desirable goal for both parties -- was near.
</P>
<P>
White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta reportedly made it
clear during a meeting this morning that the White House wants a
good bill.

<P>
NEW YORK, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street posted
solid gains today, but they failed to make a sharper rally as
investors took a wait-and-see attitude for next week's economic
data.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 51.05 to 5,473.06.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 2-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with its volume declining
to 349.84 million shares, from 403.61 million in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 2.50 to 340.87, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.73 to 635.90.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 14.73 to 1,077.12, as
technology shares rebounded for the second straight session.
</P>
<P>
The American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 6.56 to
539.15.
</P>
<P>
The positive tone of Thursday's rally, spurred by an
encouraging earnings report from IBM, was reinforced by a strong
profit report from Gateway 2000, which said its sales continued to
grow at one of the fastest rates in the personal computer
industry.
</P>
<P>
Two mild economic readings Thursday had eased concerns about
inflation, but analysts said it was unclear whether the economy
was slowing enough to avert an inflation-fighting interest rate
hike by the Federal Reserve.

<HEADLINE> (Updated) Spanish Airliner Hijacked to Miami Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A Spanish jetliner bound for
Havana was hijacked to southern U.S. city of Miami today by a man
from Lebanon who surrendered to the U.S. authorities when the
plane landed at the Miami International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker, identified by the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) as Saado Ibrahim, demanded that the pilot of
Iberia Airline Flight 6621 divert the DC-10 to Miami on the way
with a threat of bomb.
</P>
<P>
The plane, with 217 passengers and 14 crew members aboard,
safely landed at the U.S. airport at about 3:00 p.m. EDT (1900
GMT). After a negotiation between FBI officials and the hijacker,
the latter surrendered to U.S. federal authorities and the
passengers and crew members were safely taken away by bus half an
hour after the landing.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker was taken into custody by federal authorities,
and, according to FBI officials, he would be arrested on a federal
charge of air piracy. The felony charge carries a penalty of at
least 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker reportedly left Beirut Thursday and arrived in
Madrid after a stop in Zurich, Switzerland. The "bomb" he
displayed to the crew was just a tape recorder covered with
aluminum foil, with a couple of wires pulled out.

<HEADLINE> Fu Begins Her Defence of Platform Diving Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Fu Mingxia of
China got to a good start of retaining her Olympic platform diving
gold, winning the 5-dive preliminary round on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Fu, who made history four years ago as the youngest Olympic and
world champion, had a slow start and once placed fourth in the
33-diver field.
</P>
<P>
It was Fu's teammate Guo Jingjing who took the limelight at the
very beginning. She collected 77.76 points from her first dive, a
backward 3 and a half somersaults and one and a half twists.
</P>
<P>
But Guo was too relaxed in her last two dives, having
collecting modest scores and faded to the fourth place after Fu,
Becky Ruehl of the United States and Irin Vygouzova of Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Fu, to the contrary, hit her form gradually and with her last
and best dive of inward three and a half somersaults, she got
76.80 points for a winning total of 329.25 points.
</P>
<P>
Ruehl finished second at 323.91 points and Vygouzova was third
in a total of 319.11 points.
</P>
<P>
The top 18 finishers of the preliminary qualify for the
semi-finals scheduled on Saturday while the top 12 divers from the
semi-finals enter the finals, also on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls for Compliance With Int'l Civil Aviation Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council today called on all parties to acknowledge and comply with
the international civil aviation law and related internationally
agreed procedures, including the rules and standards and
recommended practices set out in the Chicago Convention.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted with 13 votes in favor and two
abstentions from China and Russia, the council noted that the
unlawful shooting down by the Cuban Air Force of two civil
aircraft on February 24, 1996 violated the principle that states
must refrain from the use of weapons against civil aircraft in
flight, and that, when intercepting civil aircraft, the lives of
persons on board and the safety of the aircraft must not be
endangered.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council expressed deep regret over the loss of
four lives and offered its deep sympathy and condolences to the
bereaved families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
The council reaffirmed the principle that each state shall take
appropriate measures to prohibit the deliberate use of any civil
aircraft registered in that state or operated by an operator who
had his principal place of business or permanent residence in that
state for any purpose inconsistent with the aims of the Chicago
Convention.
</P>
<P>
It condemned the use of weapons against civil aircraft in
flight as being incompatible with elementary considerations of
humanity, the rules of the customary international law as codified
in article 3 bis of the Chicago Convention, and the standards and
recommended practices set out in the annexes of the Chicago
Convention, and called upon Cuba to join other states in complying
with their obligations under these provisions.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council urged all states which have not yet done
so to ratify as soon as possible the Protocol adding article 3 bis
to the Chicago Convention, and to comply with all the provisions
of the article pending the entry into force of the Protocol.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Security Council, Chinese Ambassador Qin Huasun
said that the principles of the international law should be
implemented in a comprehensive, fair and balanced manner.
</P>
<P>
"No country should apply selectivity to their implementation in
accordance with its own needs. Therefore, we maintain that the
provisions in the international law for non-use of weapons against
civil aircraft should be respected and by the same token, those
for inviolability of territorial air space as well as those
against the abuse of civil aviation must also be observed," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Council of the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) considered all aspects of the question and
adopted a resolution which was balanced, fair and representing the
collective will of all members of the ICAO.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation repeatedly emphasized that the Security
Council should base its actions on the ICAO resolution and adopt
the same fair and balanced approach. However, despite some efforts
by the sponsor, the key amendments proposed by the parties
concerned were not accepted. This had given the current draft
resolution a biased tilt. Therefore, the Chinese delegation would
abstain on the draft resolution, Qin said.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Unable to Achieve Its Goal, Rawlings Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings
said today that the Economic Community of West African States
(ECPWAS) has not been able to achieve its goal of regional
integration, not even the basic requirement of a common customs
union under a common market system.
</P>
<P>
Regional integration efforts have been strained by the poor
performance of the economies of ECOWAS member states, which have
suffered from balance of payment problems, high levels of
unemployment, inflation and huge foreign debt burdens, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings, who is the two-term Chairman of the 21-year-old
ECOWAS, made the remarks at the opening ceremony of the 9th
ecowas summit that opened today in Abuja, capital of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the community, however, has recorded some
modest achievements, especially in building bridges between the
francophone and anglophone member states, providing regional
infrastructure such as roads and telecommunications, as well as a
platform for monetary integration.
</P>
<P>
President rawlings called for concerted efforts to reverse the
decline in member states' economies through the efficient
management of economic adjustment programs.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need for greater commitment to the
implementation of national minimum agenda of action to accelerate
regional integration.
</P>
<P>
Trade liberalisation, the core of economic integration, has
remained a dream because of the creation of hurdles across
national borders and extortion of businessmen at border
crossings, Rawlings said.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the problem, Rawlings urged the member states to
set up monitoring bodies to stop bureacrats and security men who
manned road blocks and extorted money from people travelling
across borders.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Gambian leader Lt. Yaya Jammeh blamed the poor
performance of ECOWAS on the improper structure of its
secretariat, which has made it unable to enforce community
decisions.
</P>
<P>
However, President of Cote d'Ivoire Henry Konan Bedie said the
poor performance of ECOWAS should not be interpreted as a
tendency toward failure. The situation should be understood in
the context of the fact that integration is a long process, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which is being attended by 12 presidents and two
prime ministers, will end on Saturday. The Secretary-General of
the Organisation of African Unity, Salim A. Salim is also at the
summit.
</P>
<P>
The leaders considered, at today's meeting, the executive
secretary's report, the report of the committee of nine on
liberia and the final report of the council of ministers,
according to reports reaching here.

<HEADLINE> IFP To Stay In South Africa's Government of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFP) has no intention of leaving the Government of National
Unity (GNU), IFP Leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the IFP national council in Ulundi
ahead of the party's annual national congress on Saturday,
Buthelezi said he would not object if the party decided to rejoin
the constitutional-making process.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi's comments followed months of media speculation that
the IFP was considering pulling of of the African National
Congress-led GNU and forming an alliance with the National Party
(NP).
</P>
<P>
Recent media reports claimed that the IFP might follow the
NP's suit to pull out of the GNU.
</P>
<P>
The NP withdrew from the the government on June 30 to become
an official opposition because it claimed that the new
constitution, adopted by the constitutional assembly on May 8,
did not provide a power-sharing mechanism in the executive
branch.
</P>
<P>
The IFP withdrew from the constitutional assembly in early
1994 protesting against the ANC's refusal to honour a pre-general
election promise of international mediation on Zulus autonomy in
Kwazulu/Natal.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said that the IFP would discuss its future role in
the government at the national congress at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
He said peace initiatives in Kwazulu/Natal would be discussed
at the congress, especially because many IFP councillors and
leaders had been killed since the local government elections last
month.
</P>
<P>
Politically-motivated violences between IFP and ANC supporters
in Kwazulu/Natal had claimed an estimated 20000 lives in the
province since mid-1980s.

LAGOS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State Sani Abacha
said today that the country remained firmly committed to the
enthronement of peace in Liberia, pledging to cooperate with
other countries in the sub-region to achieve lasting peace in
that war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
It is now necessary for factional leaders in the Liberian
crisis to show more commitment to efforts being made to restore
peace in their country, Abacha said at the opening of the summit
of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
The head of state urged the international community to fulfil
its promise to assist the ECOWAS peacekeeping force operating in
Liberia, known as ECOMOG, logistically and in other areas, so as
to ensure the full disarmament of the Liberian rebel soldiers and
pave the way for the eventual democratisation of the country.
</P>
<P>
He also warned the warring factions in Liberia not to misuse
the current hope for peace in their country.

ADDIS ABAbA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Some 22 kg of heroine and 4
kg of canabis which had been intercepted at Addis Ababa Airport

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Government bans FGM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian government has banned
female genital mutilation (FGM) operations in all hospitals after
a teenager bled to death in Cairo last week.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of the English-language weekly Al
Ahram, Minister of Health and Family Planning Ismail Sallam
decreed the ban, specifying that midwives, doctors and nurses
registered with the Ministry of Health must stop the ritual or
face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
The ban was imposed after 11 year-old Sara bled to death in a
Cairo hospital after a botched FGM operation by a village barber.
Police are investigating the incident and the barber is likely to
face criminal charges for inflicting physical harm on the girl.
</P>
<P>
Sallam stated that the decision puts an end to the
psychological and physical harm that young girls are forced to
endure as a result of the ritual, the newspaper reported without
giving date.
</P>
<P>
A common belief in Egyptian society is that FGM checks a
woman's sexuality and thus prevents pre-marital sex and
promiscuity. Many people consider it as obligatory and this
encourages thousands of families to subject their girls to the
practice.
</P>
<P>
The minister has called on clergymen to cooperate with the
government regarding the matter. Grand Imam of Al-Azhar mosque
Sayed Tantawi had reportedly declared that there is no definite
evidence that the practice is ordained by Islam.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report from the Egyptian Organization for
Human Rights, FGM is performed daily on about 3,600 girls between
the ages of eight and 14. Some of these girls meet the same sad
fate as Sara, Al Ahram said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government today
condemned the military coup in Burundi which ousted president
Sylvestre Ntibantunganya on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a Press Statement, Kenyan Minister for Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperation Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka said that the
military coup in Burundi goes against " the very letter and
spirit of the regional initiative which aims at ensuring
democracy and security for all".
</P>
<P>
The statement said " Kenya calls on all the Burundi people to
uphold sanctity of life."
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi-dominated Burundian Army overthrew President
Sylvestre Ntibantungany in an army coup on Thursday and
reinstated former President Pierre Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
The new Burundian authority has announced that Parliament was
disbanded with all political parties suspended. Bujumbura airport
was closed indefinitely. All borders were closed and a
dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the toppled Burundian President Sylvestre
Ntibantunganya who took refugee in the U.S.Embassy in Bujumbura
said he will not resign.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the coup in Burundi, the Kenyan Government has said it
favours the sending of foreign troops to Burundi to intervene in
what has become "a large scale catastrophe" in Burundi.

<HEADLINE> Political Reforms Announced in Swaziland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Swazi King Mswati III today
announced the long-awaiting political reforms expected to launch
the tiny mountain kingdom on the road to full democracy, the
South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
At a traditional gathering of the nation at his Ludzidzini
royal residence north of the capital Mbabane, Mswati announced
the establishment of a constitutional comittee which would
implement the constitutional reform exercise in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The king appointed former Finance Minister Barnabas Sibusiso
Dlamini, 54, as the kingdom's new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini, currently a director with the World Bank/Internatioal
Monetary Fund's African region, succeeded prince Mbilini Dlamini,
whose "retirement' was announced by the king two months ago.
</P>
<P>
The 27-member constitutional committee represented a broad
spectrum of the Swazi society, including representatives of
banned political movements, trade unions, churches, civic and
women's organisations and traditional chiefs.
</P>
<P>
The panel was expected to investigate possible reforms in the
country's constitution, which was suspended by Mswati's father
late king Sobhuza in 1973 when he banned all political parties.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is the only southern African country in which
political parties have been banned since 1973, and the monarch
king rules the kingdom by royal decree.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland has been plagued by industrial strikes and political
unrest since January, aimed at pressurising the king to introduce
democratic changes.
</P>
<P>
however, members of a political alliance formed by the leaders
of the Swazi Federation of Trade Unions and banned opposition
parties threatened earlier this week to boycott Mswati's
constitutional reform exercise unless the 23-year-old ban on
political parties had been lifted beforehand.
</P>
<P>
Mswati today urged the Swazis to submit recommendations for a
new constitution and the future political dispensation in
Swaziland to the constitutional commission.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela, Botswanan President
Ketumile Masire, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano,
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and Swazi Acting Prime
Minister Sishayi Nxumalo held "an emergency consultative meeting"
in Maputo on Wednesday to discuss the political situation in
Swaziland.

<HEADLINE> Tutsis in Burundi Recruited to Fight Against Hutu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A mass recruitment drive of Tutsi
youths in Burundi was under way as sporadic fighting between
the Tutsi-dominated army and Hutu rebels was reported today.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Tutsi youths lined up outside army
recruitment points in the capital Bujumbura in response to the
offer of President Pierre Buyoya to provide military training to
Tutsis to counter a rising Hutu guerrilla campaign, a report
reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
The report said Hutu rebels clashed overnight with the army in
the northern Gitega Region and in Bururi to the south.
</P>
<P>
``We offer to the youth, to all the young the opportunity to
participate in the defence of our country,'' Buyoya said Thursday
in his speech to mark his return to power.
</P>
<P>
``Our first objective is to stop immediately the massacres
and all forms of criminality that have prevailed in Burundi for
the last three years,'' Buyoya said.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 150,000 people have been killed in three years
of violence in Burundi. World leaders have pledged not to allow
a repeat of the 1994 genocide in neighbouring Rwanda, in which
some one million Hutus and allied Tutsis were killed.
</P>
<P>
Major Pierre Buyoya and his men toppled former President
Sylvestre Ntibantunganya on Thursday. Immediately after the power
takeower, the new ruler outlawed political parties, closed the
airport and land borders.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya cited insecurity and government failure to rule as the
reasons for his takeover.
</P>
<P>
However, the military takeover in Burundi has been condemned
by the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity, the
United States, South Africa, Kenya, and other African countries.
</P>
<P>
Ntibantunganya has now taken refuge in the US Ambassador's
residence in Bujumbura. enditem
