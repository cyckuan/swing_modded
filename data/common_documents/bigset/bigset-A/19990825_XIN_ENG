<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebels Announce Date for Signing Lusaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Both factions of the Congolese
Rally for Democracy (RCD), a major rebel group in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), have agreed to sign the Lusaka cease-fire
agreement on August 31, a report monitored here said Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The founding members of the rebel group announced their
willingness to endorse the peace pact after two days of meeting,
the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) quoted spokesman of the
Goma-based faction, Bizime Karaha, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Due to the dispute over the leadership, the RCD has failed to
sign the cease-fire agreement reached in the Zambian capital on
July 10 by the six countries directly involved in the conflicts in
the third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
One faction led by Wamba dia Wamba was based in DRC's northern
town of Kisangani and the other led by Emile Illunga was based in
eastern town of Goma. They are allegedly backed by Uganda and
Rwanda respectively.

KAMPALA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni swore in Edward Rugumayo as the new Minister of Internal
Affairs at the State House Tuesday evening, ending the five-month
vacancy of the ministerial post.
</P>
<P>
Rugumayo's appointment to the cabinet post was announced in the
last cabinet reshuffle made by the president earlier this year.

<P>
Rugumayo, Uganda's former high commissioner to South Africa,
has replaced Tom Butime, who was transferred to head the Ministry
of Disaster Preparedness and Refugees.
</P>
<P>
Butime was allegedly transferred because of the worsening
security situation in the east African country as well as rampant
corruption among police officers.

The swearing-in ceremony was attended by Vice-President
Specioza Kazibwe and other senior officials, a press release from

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Urges Government to Focus on Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei on Tuesday urged the government of President Mohammad
Khatami to focus on economy, saying it is "the main issue facing
the country."
</P>
<P>
"Looking at people's life even with an ordinary outlook, one
would undoubtedly find out that the most important problem of the
country is economy," said Khamenei, who is powerful in any
decision-making, but largely detached in day-to-day running of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei's words at the beginning of the "Government Week" ,
which runs from Tuesday to next Monday, echoed widespread
complaints about the government's poor performance in improving
people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
Iran's oil-dependent economy suffered because of weak oil
prices in the world market over the past years.
</P>
<P>
The "Government Week" was to mark the 1981 killing in a bomb
attack of the then President Mohammad Ali Rajaie and Prime
Minister Mohammad Javad Bahonar.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with Khatami and his cabinet, Khamenei appreciated the
government's hard work and praised the moderate president for
his "capability" and "qualification."
</P>
<P>
With the recovery of crude prices on the world market, there is
hope that Iran's economy will gear up. In a development plan for
the next five years, the government expects economic growth to
proceed at a speed of 6 percent each year.
</P>
<P>
At present, the annual growth rate is only 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei urged the government to seriously follow up the third
Five-Year Development Plan "so that the programs adopted by the
government to remove economic problems become evident."
</P>
<P>
According to the official Islamic Republic News Agency, the
leader voiced his constant support for the government and termed
as necessary the principled criticism and review of the
government's function.
</P>
<P>
He also called for unity and solidarity despite factional
struggle between moderates and hardliners.
</P>
<P>
"Division and partitioning of the system at higher levels is
only to the benefit of enemies," he added.

<HEADLINE> S. African Central Bank Supports Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- New South African Reserve
Bank Governor Tito Mboweni Tuesday supported the government's call
for inflation targets but called for a more flexible deadline and
a significant Reserve Bank say in setting the targets.
</P>
<P>
In his first address to the central bank's annual general
meeting, Mboweni reiterated that he would follow the conservative
monetary policy approach of his predecessor Chris Stals.
</P>
<P>
The commitment to inflation targeting was the focus of
Mboweni's policy approach but he also signaled a more transparent
and consultative approach to monetary policy, including the
creation of an informal monetary policy forum with trade unions
and business.
</P>
<P>
The monetary policy forum would meet twice a year to discuss
macro- economic development and monetary policy issues while a
monetary policy committee would be created within the bank "for
the formulation of monetary policy."
</P>
<P>
The committee will consist of the governor and deputy governors
as voting members, and senior officials of the bank as non-voting
members.
</P>
<P>
The final decision-making power on monetary policy would remain
with the committee, said the central bank boss.
</P>
<P>
Mboweni, who was former labor minister, said that the
independence of the central bank would be preserved.
</P>
<P>
"In pursuit of the primary objective of financial stability, it
is essential that the Reserve Bank performs its functions
independently and without fear, favor or prejudice.
</P>
<P>
"The bank will strive to achieve closer cooperation and
coordination with the authorities responsible for policy decision,
the autonomy of the bank will be preserved."

<HEADLINE> London Plans Technology Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The London Stock Exchange is set
to announce details of its plans for a separate market for
technology stocks next month.
</P>
<P>
"It is something we would expect to be doing. We are not ready
to launch it yet," BBC quoted a spokeswoman for the stock exchange
as saying Tuesday. But she dismissed detailed newspaper reports on
the new market as speculation.
</P>
<P>
While details are few, the aim of the market would be to
encourage the listing of high-growth stocks without a profits
record. Fear exists that London could miss the boat over Internet
stocks because of the lack of a suitable growth market to list on.
</P>
<P>
For the new market, some rules governing flotation are likely
to be relaxed to encourage the listing of genuine start-up
companies with no profit record, a BBC report said.
</P>
<P>
Similar high technology markets exist already in Europe, such
as Germany's highly successful Neuer Markt, with the U.S. market
catered for by Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
Europe in general has been slow to follow the U.S. lead in
embracing the importance of new technologies and the potential of
the companies involved in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The London Stock Exchange, fighting to defend its position
against European rivals such as Frankfurt, is keen to promote
itself as having expertise in the sector.
</P>
<P>
"The London market is increasingly providing a key focus for
high-tech companies and investors," London Stock Exchange
marketing director Martin Wheatley has previously said.
</P>
<P>
London's financial sector has waken up to the potential and
importance of technology and Internet related companies in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
A survey by Tempest Consultants found that the number of
analysts in London focusing on technology stocks among the top 350
companies had trebled to 567 from 185 five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The interest created by the flotation of Internet Service
Provider Freeserve in July has added to the pressure on the
exchange to provide better opportunities for similar but smaller
companies.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Three million tourists visited Turkey in the first
six months of this year as compared to 3.9 million during the
corresponding period last year, down by 21.74 percent.
</P>
<P>
And Turkey's tourism sector is trying to hold fast following
the devastating earthquake that hit western Turkey last Tuesday,
the Arab economic daily Alam Al Yom Tuesday quoted a source at the
Turkish Ministry of Tourism as saying.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 9.4 million tourists visited Turkey, bringing in 7.2
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is particularly attracting German people who represent
one fourth of the total number of tourists visiting Turkey,
followed by British tourists, 9 percent, Russians 7 percent,
Romanians 5.4 percent and Americans 4.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Arab states are called to build a unified electricity
network in view of the sharp rise in demand for electric power
over the past three years, said economic studies findings.
</P>
<P>
An electric grid linking the Arab states will help reduce the
volume of investments by approximately 10.15 billion U.S. dollars,
of which 9.55 billion dollars will be saved as a result of linking
the networks in Arab eastern countries, and 600 million dollars in
the Arab Maghreb states, the Arab economic daily Alam Al Yom
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The studies, conducted by the Arab Center for Economic Studies,
called for developing modern Arab industries to manufacture the
component parts of electric networks.
</P>
<P>
The electric grid linking Arab states will provide, among other
benefits, the opportunity to invite the private sector to build,
possess and manage electricity establishments in order to
alleviate the financial burdens on the state, thus, saving
financial resources for other services.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Cyprus stock market brokers staged an impromptu
strike Monday to protest against the suspension by the bourse's
authorities of three brokerages for failing to clear a backlog of
overdue transactions, the Cyprus Mail newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The suspension and the brokers' reaction plunged the market
into chaos, leaving the bourse's reputation in tatters and
undermining investors' confidence, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Brokers spoke of the loss of millions of pounds in trade and
thousands of pounds in income for brokerages, some of which are
public companies.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan has cut down custom duties on cars by up to
50 percent, thus, enabling limited income citizens to own cars,
said Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel Raouf al-Rawabdeh.
</P>
<P>
To offset the deficit in State Treasury revenues, an increase
in benzoline prices was imposed recently on customers at a rate of
20 fils (2.8 cents) per liter, and car registration and annual
license fees were also raised which will bring in about 20 million
dinars (28.2 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Treasury will bear 17 million dinars (24 million dollars)
as a result of cutting custom duties on cars, the Arab economic daily
Alam Al Yom reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Car trading companies expressed satisfaction with the decision,
while analysts warned against economic repercussions caused by the rise
in benzoline prices.

GAZA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official

The Israeli side is still refusing to offer more power supply

<HEADLINE> French Greens Leader Warns Against Breakup of Left Majority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The leader of the French Greens,
Dominique Voynet, Tuesday warned the government of Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin against a "nuclear explosion" of the leftwing
majority if he insists on implementing his nuclear policy.
</P>
<P>
Voynet, who is minister of management of territory and
environment of the Jospin government, said that if "an
irreversible decision" is taken on the issue of nuclear energy
without a debate, "the first nuclear explosion would be that of
the (leftwing) majority."
</P>
<P>
"Without the Greens, the classic leftwing has perhaps the
majority at the National Assembly, but it is not majority in the
country," she said at a meeting of the militants of Greens in
Lorient, western France.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the spokesman of the Greens, Denis Baupin, said that
if the Jospin government decides to build a prototype of the
European Pressurized Water Reactor, the Greens will leave the
leftwing majority.
</P>
<P>
The Greens won about 10 percent of the votes in France in the
European Parliament elections in June.

JERUSALEM -- As another conciliatory gesture toward the
Palestinians, the Israeli government has decided to allow 10,000

<P>
The decision came after Prime Minister Ehud Barak adopted the
recommendation by Israel's coordinator in the Palestinian areas

<HEADLINE> Greek PM Calls for Peaceful Co-Existence in Balkan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis called here Tuesday for peaceful co-existence among the
countries in the Balkan.
</P>
<P>
Simitis, who was on his one-day visit to Albania, made this
call during his closed-door meeting with Albanian President Rexhep
Meidani.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Simitis clarified the Greek government's
view of favoring a Balkan without antagonism and crises in the
forthcoming years, but with peaceful relations among the countries
in the region, according to the Albanian Telegraphic Agency (ATA).
</P>
<P>
Concerning the Kosovo issue, Simitis said that Greece is
against any changes of boundary in the Balkan, and against
creation of new states in the ex-Yugoslav space.
</P>
<P>
However, Simitis said, Greece would accept the creation of a
structure with a federal character in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Simitis also called on the European Union to adopt a common
policy for all the countries in the Balkan, instead of for some
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meidani expressed the hope that Greece and Albania would
strengthen their ties. He indicated that the fate of Kosovo and
Montenegro should be settled by the people there by their free
will.
</P>
<P>
Simitis arrived here Tuesday morning and held a brief talk with
his Albanian counterpart, Pandeli Majko.
</P>
<P>
Self-determination, co-existence and peace should prevail in
the Balkan, Majko said at a joint press conference together with
Simitis here in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government believed that the essence of the
Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe is respect for the new
realities created in the Balkan to build a common future, said
Majko.
</P>
<P>
Simitis said that he favored an inclusion of all the countries
in the region in the regional economic development and their
integration into the Euro-Atlantic structure, without excluding
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Simitis also promised to legalize the
Albanian immigrants working and living in Greece, but stressed
that a normal frame should be settled for them and their living in
Greece should be based on some legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
The Greek and Albanian governments Tuesday signed two
cooperation protocols here, under which the two countries will
build three customs points on their land boundary and launch joint
patrols in their sea border waters.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government also promised to offer some 1.5 million
U.S. dollars to finance the Albanian state budget.

satellite whose technology is ``within reach'' of the country.

He said that several European countries, including Germany and
Italy, have also shown their interests in building this kind of
spy radar satellite, which can observe the earth through heavy
clouds.
</P>
<P>
``Such a cooperation will allow Europe to have an autonomous
strategic instrument for better preparing for the situations of
crisis,'' he said.

<P>
NAIROBI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Over 31,000 Congolese refugees
living in Rwanda are seeking for quick repatriation to their own
country, the Rwanda News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 31,000 Congolese refugees started flocking into Rwanda's
prefectures of Byumba and Kibuye from east part of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo since 1997, an official with the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The Congolese refugees fled from Masisi in northern Kivu
Province in eastern DRC because of existing insecurity brought
about by the civil war," said Aboulaye Barry, UNHCR field officer
for eastern Kibungo and Umutara prefectures in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
During a tour in Rwanda, UNHCR director for Africa Albert Alain
Peters welcomed the wish by refugees to be repatriated back to the
DRC.
</P>
<P>
But he said that UNHCR is very much concerned about the
refugees' security in the area they fled.
</P>
<P>
"UNHCR is trying hard to help restore security in the DRC, and
thereafter will assist in repatriating the Congolese refugees,"
Peters said.

NAIROBI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Wildlife Service said
Tuesday that four poachers had been arrested on a charge of
killing at least six elephants.
</P>
<P>
The poachers surrendered when encountered by park rangers in

where there has been a sharp increase in poaching in the past few
months, according to a statement issued by the Kenyan wildlife

<HEADLINE> French Automaker Renault to Sell Bicycles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The French automaker Renault will
sell from September in its marketing network the bicycles made by
the Giant company in the Netherlands, announced Renault on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bicycles will include several models of all fields and all
roads sport bicycles, children's bicycles, foldable bicycles and
electrically aided bicycles for climbing hills or attaining
without human efforts a speed of 25 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
The bicycles will all have the trade mark ``Renault Sport,''
and will be sold at prices ranging from 2,800 francs (460 U.S.
dollars) to 10,000 francs (1,670 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Although Renault has been producing cycles for bicycles for 20
years, this is the first time for Renault to sell bicycles with
its own trade mark.
</P>
<P>
Other European automakers, including France's Peugeot, and
Germany's BMW, Mercedes and Audi, also sell bicycles under their
trade marks.
</P>
<P>
The decision to sell bicycles is aimed at accompanying
customers' effort to respect environment and use a transport means
which can put people closer, said Renault.

LONDON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Nervousness about possible
interest rate rises in the United States saw the London stock
market reverse previous dramatic gains Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index closed down seven points at 6315.1, having
registered gains of 204 points in the past two sessions.
</P>
<P>
The near-200 point surge on the Dow Jones Industrial Average
failed to lift the mood as the market was cautious of a slide on
Wall Street in anticipation of the Federal Reserve's interest rate
decision.

Bank stocks suffered the most, reversing some of the gains made
Monday on the back of prospective bank mergers in France and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
HSBC fell 10p to 787p, Barclays fell 37p to 1897p, while Abbey

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Twelve civilians were killed and
injured 10 others in an ambush launched Monday in south Angola by
the rebellious National Union for Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA).
</P>
<P>
An official from the local police station confirmed that five
men, three women and four children are on the list of the dead,
official news agency Angop reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place when a civilian vehicle was running on
its way from Menongue, capital of the southeast Province of
Cuando-Cubango, to a village called Comuna do Longa.
</P>
<P>
It is also reported that the Angolan Armed Forces (FAA) has
smashed on Sunday a group of UNITA rebels in the north Province of
Uige, killing 11 militants and injuring three.
</P>
<P>
The local administration of the Uige Province then announced
that the region is "under the control of the Angolan authorities".
</P>
<P>
Vice-governor of the Huila Province Paulo Lucas, meanwhile,
said the situation in his province is "worrying" due to the
rampant activities of the armed rebels of UNITA in various places
around the south-central province.
</P>
<P>
The militants came from the central Angola, especially from
Andulo, a city of the Bie Province called "headquarter of UNITA",
Lucas said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Reportedly in Full Control of Daghestan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops assumed
control of all villages in the Daghestani district of Botlikh as
of Tuesday evening, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In reports that still have to be verified, the Russian Interior
Ministry press center in Makhachkala, the regional capital, said
the Islamic militants that infiltrated the villages two weeks ago
have retreated to neighboring Chechnya, the breakaway Russian
republic.
</P>
<P>
Around 1,000 militants have been killed since the beginning of
the armed conflict, the center said. Up to 30 units of the
extremists' armored equipment were destroyed. The federal
casualties include 47 army and 12 interior and police servicemen,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, the Federal Security Service's Daghestani branch
said federal troops have captured the villages of Tando, Rakhata,
Shodrota, Ansalta and Ashino in Botlikh district of Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued in the afternoon, the branch warned that
the Islamic militants may stage terrorist attacks on the towns of
Khasavyurt and Buinaks, Novolakskoye and Kazbek district, the
Cherkei hydraulic power station and other targets, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Itar-Tass news agency reported that federal
troops would gain control over all villages occupied by the
militants by 19:00 Moscow time (1500 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The guerillas left the villages and were trying to flee to
Chechnya under artillery and aircraft fire from the federal
troops, Tass reported, quoting a source in Daghestan.
</P>
<P>
If the federal control of the villages proved true, it would
mean a major victory for Russia's new Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin, who set Tuesday as the deadline to root out the rebels.

</P>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Marion Jones, who retained the
women's 100 meters world title but finished only third in the long
jump on Monday, created a good impression by winning in the first
heat with 22.45 seconds at the 200m quarterfinals here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Her time was three hundredths of a second ahead of the Jamaican
Merlene Frazer.
</P>
<P>
Jones hasn't lost in the 200m snce 1995 and has won 21
consecutive finals in the event. She said she was tired today after
getting only five hours of sleep.
</P>
<P>
"When I was standing behind the blocks, I should have been
visualizing the race," Jones said. "Instead, I was visualizing
going back to my hotel and going back to bed."
</P>
<P>
Her closest rival and fellow American Inger Miller won
comfortably in the third heat in 22.49.
</P>
<P>
"I was basically like a workout for me, just feeling it out,"
Miller said. "I've got the same motivation I had in the 100m, the
same high energy. That's my plan, to be on the podium."
</P>
<P>
The fastest heat was the second one, dominated by the Jamaican
Beverly McDonald with 22.26. This heat produced a new national
record for the Italian manuela Levorato and three personal bests
for Fatima Yusuf of Nigeria, Muriel Hurtis of France and Esther
Moller of Germany.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Debbie Ferguson of Bahamas won the fourth heat with
22.53.

<P>
Busemann, who was in fifth position after the two events, said
in disappointment: "In the warm-up, I came out of the blocks and it
happened. I spoke to the doctor and he said it made no sense to
carry on because the muscle could tear. This is unbelievable."

WASHINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Reserve Tuesday
raised interest rates for the second time in eight weeks in an
effort to cool the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said it was increasing its target for the federal funds
rates, the interest banks charge each other on overnight loans, to
5.25 percent from current 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time this summer that the Fed has raised
this rate. It boosted the funds rate from 4.75 percent to 5
percent on June 30, the first increase in two years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, to drive home its efforts to fight inflation, the
Fed announced it was raising its discount rate, the interest that
it charges for direct loans to banks, by a quarter of a point as
well. The discount rate was increased to 4.75 percent, the first
increase in the discount since Feb. 1, 1995.

SEVILLE, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Susanthika
Jayasinghe, the women's 200 meters silver medalist at the 1997
World Championships in Athens, has headed home with nothing from
the on-going 7th World Championships.
</P>
<P>
Jayasingh, who was here aiming to win the 100m and 200m titles,
was forced to pull out because of injury. Despite treatment, she
failed to make it for the opening 200m heats on Tuesday,.
</P>
<P>
It was a heavy blow for the Sri Lankan who has been involved in
a doping case since early last year.
</P>
<P>
She also caused a furor even before she arrived in Spain. Team
officials were angered when she claimed shortly before flying here
that she feared her compatriots might try to spike her food.
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe, who tested positive for a banned drug, was banned in
April last year but her suspension was lifted four months later
after a local hearing.
</P>
<P>
But the IAAF were angry with the results and referred her case
to an arbitration panel.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF later said she was free to compete in the World
Championships since her case could not be reviewed before the
biennial championships.

<HEADLINE> Market for Stationary Fuel Cells to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Among the various emerging
energy technologies being rapidly developed and deployed, fuel
cells will be the leader in the evolving worldwide distributed
generation industry, according to a new report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Substantial financial marketing and organizational resources
are currently being devoted to fuel cell technology, driving the
nascent market from approximately 40 million U.S. dollars in 1999
to over 10 billion dollars by 2010, said the report from Allied
Business Intelligence, a U.S. technology research think-tank.
</P>
<P>
The report examined the U.S. and global markets for the leading
fuel cell technologies producing from 50 watts to 30 megawatts,
including phosphoric acid, proton exchange membrane, alkaline,
molten carbonate, solid oxide and zinc-air.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the report said, a number of companies
are beginning to release products, and many of the market entrants
are backed by large international energy and power production
equipment firms.
</P>
<P>
"Although power from early fuel cells costs more than power
from other generators, a number of applications can be identified
in which price is not the key determinant," the report said.
"Markets for reliable power and quality power are potential areas
of use for the technology, as are applications involving
industrial waste hydrogen, wastewater treatment gas and
agribusiness animal waste gas."
</P>
<P>
According to the research, regions of the United States with
high power rates or no grid access are being targeted by companies
that produce low power fuel cells. These systems can use natural
gas and propane to provide the electricity, hot water and building
heat for single family homes and small businesses. The market will
expand into power supplies for vacation homes and cabins, remote
villages and islands, telecommunications relay towers, industrial
plants, military bases and more.

the World Athletics Championships when she won the women's hammer
throw at 75.20 meters.
</P>
<P>
Olga Kuzenkova of Russia was second at 72.56 and Lisa Misipeka

</P>
<P>
The Romanian had the winning throw in her last attempt, which
measured at 75.20 meters in the event, which made its debut at the

</P>
<P>
"I felt very confident coming here. The only thing I was a
little worried about was Kuzenkova's form," said the 24-year-old
Melinte.
</P>
<P>
Despite the victory, Melinte was not quite satisfied with the
result. "If the conditions were better, the last throw could have
been one to two meters longer," added Melinte, who had her personal
best and world mark at 75.97 meters.
</P>
<P>
For Misipeka, the third place was far beyond her dream before
the competition. "I did not think a medal is possible," said the
American Samoan. "I though it was fourth. I tried to indicate to my
coach but he was so far away in the spectator seats, I could not
see the signs he was making to me."

<HEADLINE> SADC Member States Urged to Sign Defense Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Defense ministers of Zimbabwe and
South Africa Tuesday called upon the leaders of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) member states to quickly sign
a defense protocol.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Defense Minister Moven Mahachi and his South African
 counterpart Patrick Lekota told reporters at a joint press
conference in Harare that the signing of the protocol would ensure
collective peace- keeping efforts in the region.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa has great confidence that the conflicts in the
region will be tackled with more efficiency by the SADC if the
protocol is signed," said Mahachi.
</P>
<P>
He added that there was confusion in SADC intervention in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) war because there was no
binding statute for countries to intervene militarily.
</P>
<P>
The SADC defense protocol was proposed when the civil war in
the DRC broke out about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia sent troops to prop up the DRC
President Laurent Kabila government under siege from rebels
leading to the signing of the Allied Defense Protocol in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi said once the SADC defense protocol was in place it
would supersede the allied countries' defense agreement.
</P>
<P>
Lekota said South Africa would continue to work toward the
peace process in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
He said SADC countries should not wait for the defense protocol
to be signed first before helping the DRC in its search for
democracy.
</P>
<P>
"We must all come together to help the Congo, an important
member of our region. South Africa is already playing its role,"
said Lekota.
</P>
<P>
Lekota was in Zimbabwe on a one-day visit which he said was
meant to discuss several issues with Mahachi that included the war
in the DRC and the two countries' defense agreement.

<HEADLINE> Overall Death Toll Reaches 17,997 in Turkish Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in the monster
earthquake in western Turkey on August 17 reached 17,997 on
Tuesday as the suffering of the survivors are mounting.
</P>
<P>
In the face of threats ranging from a typhoid epidemic to lack
of shelters under heavy rains, the survivors are seized with
depression, especially while seeing bulldozers ripping into the
heaps of rubble which have become the graves of their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
As the estimated 200,000 survivors have turned into refugees,
Turkish officials broadcast appeals on Tuesday for everything from
 tents to bulldozers to help begin rebuilding living shattered by
the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
However, more immediate medical worries began to emerge as
the death toll reached some 18,000.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Ministry Crisis Administration Center stated Tuesday
that the regional coordination center established in Izmit,
epicenter of the devastating earthquake, will start operations
later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, education and entertainment facilities in the
affected regions, and in neighboring provinces, were evacuated and
prepared for the earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to urgently purchase 150 ambulances
and all necessary measures have been taken to prevent any kind of
failure in telephone lines, especially when Turkey is facing bad
weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains lashed the quake-stricken regions for a second
day. The muddy quagmires left by the downpours increased fears
of disease from mosquitoes and flies attracted by the
foul-smelling pools.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of decaying bodies are believed to be still buried
under the rubble.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military decided to cancel the four-day Victory
Day celebrations set to begin on Thursday, marking the Turkish
expulsion of other forces in 1922.
</P>
<P>
Foreign rescue teams started leaving a week after the 7.4
killer quake struck western Turkey.

GAZA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said on Tuesday that no progress has been made in the talks on the
essential issues of the Wye River Accord between the Palestinians
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks at a press briefing held here upon
return from Riyadh, capital of Saudi Arabia, where he offered
condolences over the death of Saudi Prince Faisal Ibn Fahd, the
eldest son of King Fahd.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Israel's reluctance to U.S. intervention in the
Middle East peace process, Arafat said "Israel can not reject such
intervention. We insist on U.S. role in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
The Wye agreement and Oslo accords were signed under the
auspices of U.S. President Bill Clinton, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In Riyadh, Arafat held talks with Saudi Regent Abdullah Ibn
Abdul-Aziz Monday afternoon and briefed him on the latest
developments of the peace process and the problems facing the
Palestinian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat recently attended a meeting in Cairo, Egypt on the
Palestinian national dialogue between Fatah Movement, the mainstay
of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and the
Syrian-based Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. He
also held a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
On the national dialogue, Arafat said it is proceeding very
well and smoothly.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Monday, Arafat expressed gratitude for
the efforts by Egypt and Saudi Arabia to push forward the peace
process.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Vietnam
will try to put the finishing touches on a landmark trade pact
when their officials meet in Washington this week, a spokeswoman
for the U.S. trade representative's office said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said the trade pact, which was reached
preliminarily last month in Hanoi, would be finalized in details
by officials of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if we'll sign it this week, but we'll continue to
work toward finalizing the details," she said.
</P>
<P>
The final agreement on the trade pact would clear the way for
Washington to establish normal trade relations with Hanoi, which
would mean that Vietnamese goods would be allowed to enter the
United States at the same low tariff levels accorded other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam would also be required to open its market over time to
U.S. goods, services and investments and make it easier for U.S.
firms to do business there.
</P>
<P>
Meetings to fine-tune last month's preliminary pact begin
Wednesday and could continue through the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
Once the agreement was finalized, the White House still would
have to send it to Congress for approval.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR: Serbs Continue to Flee Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- With about 200,000 ethnic Serbs
and other non-Albanians having fled Kosovo, there are now only
30,000 remaining in the province of Yugoslavia, according to the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
"We are pretty much approaching the line of an almost Serb-free
Kosovo, which is an extremely sad phenomenon," spokesman Kris
Janowski told a news conference here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 195,000 ethnic Serbs and other non-Albanians have fled
from Kosovo to Serbia and Montenegro, a rise from 180,000 two or
three weeks ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
Most ethnic Serbs and Gypsies left during or immediately after
NATO's 11-week bombing campaign which ended in early June. Ethnic
Albanians in the province have carried out scores of retaliatory
attacks on Serbs over the past two months since thousands returned
to Kosovo after the NATO bombing.

<HEADLINE> Siemens, Fujitsu Announce Computer Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 24 (Xinhua) -- German electric and electronic
giant Siemens AG and Japanese computer company Fujitsu Tuesday in
Frankfurt formally signed their agreement to form a computer joint
venture.
</P>
<P>
Named Fujitsu-Siemens Computer BV and based in the Netherlands,
the new company is expected to start operation on October 1 after
the approval of authorities.
</P>
<P>
In a fax press release, Siemens said the joint venture's
ambitious goal was to be among the world's top three computer
producers. It was in June that the two companies first announced
their alliance plan.
</P>
<P>
The new firm, with 9,000 employees, now will be ranked second
in the European market by production and third by turnover. But
Siemens and Fujitsu expected their joint venture to become
Europe's number one with its full line of products from laptops to
main frames.
</P>
<P>
At the presentation in Frankfurt, the two companies said the
new joint venture would cover computer development, production and
service in the worldwide market.
</P>
<P>
And they set a revenue of 7.5 billion euros (7.88 billion U.S.
dollars) as the joint venture's goal in the first business year,
25 percent higher than the sum of their separate computer
divisions.
</P>
<P>
Each of its parents holding 50 percent stakes, the
Fujitsu-Siemens company will have a double leading structure, with
Robert Hoog from Siemens and Winfried Hoffmann from Fujitsu as
co-presidents of the management board.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Seeks Scrapping of Kosovo "Customs Service" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia Tuesday
launched a protest with the United Nations, saying that the
establishment of a separate customs service for Kosovo, a Serbian
province, is a violation of Yugoslav sovereignty and demanding
that it be disbanded.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the president of the Security Council that was
published Tuesday, Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the
Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations, said the "customs service
of Kosovo," Serbia's largely ethnic Albanian province, charged
customs duties on goods from abroad as well as those originating
from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, no Yugoslav customs procedures were applied "and the
physical integrity and property of Yugoslav customs officers are
threatened," he said.
</P>
<P>
This situation had not changed with the arrival of the U.N.
secretary-general's special representative for Kosovo, Bernard
Kouchner, or the deployment of international police, said the
senior Yugoslav diplomat.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, the United Nations Interim Administration
Mission in Kosovo has set about establishing a separate `customs
service of Kosovo,'" Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav envoy termed the establishment of such a service
as "a flagrant violation" of a June 10 Security Council resolution
authorizing the dispatch of international peacekeeping troops and
a U.N. civil administration to Kosovo, particularly its provisions
regarding Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia requested that "the said `service' be disbanded, the
Yugoslav customs officers be allowed to return to the border
crossings to Albania and Macedonia, and the Yugoslav customs
service in Kosovo... be enabled to function undisturbed,"
Jovanovic said.

<HEADLINE> Rebel Political Bureau Okays Signing of Lusaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The political bureau of the main
rebel movement, the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) - Goma
faction - has authorized founding members to sign the Lusaka Peace
Accord, rebel officials said Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Rwanda, Lambert Mende, head of the
RCD Information Department, said that all the 50 founding members,
including Emile Ilunga, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, Tambwe Mwamba,
Lunda Bululu, Mbusa Nyamwisi and others will go to Lusaka, capital
of Zambia, on the same day and ink the cease-fire document.
</P>
<P>
The 51st RCD founding member is Arthur Z'ahidi Ngoma who left
the rebel movement for Paris where he launched his own opposition
party.
</P>
<P>
The date for signing, however, has not yet been announced but
the rebels said that it will depend on the mediator, adding that
it could take place some time this week.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the Lusaka cease-fire deal on July 10,
1999 by the leaders of six countries involved in the Congolese
war, the problem of legal representation has become the core issue
between the two rebel factions.

<HEADLINE> SAfrica Confirms Congolese Rebels to Sign Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The last signatures needed
to put in action a Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
cease-fire agreement could be forthcoming by the end of the week,
South African Foreign Minister Nkosazana Zuma said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
She said it had been agreed that all 51 founder members of the
rebel group Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) would add their
names to the Lusaka peace accord, including ousted leader Ernest
Wamba dia Wamba and current leader Emile Ilunga.
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters how certain she was that the RCD would keep
its word, she said: "They are going to sign".
</P>
<P>
Zuma traveled to the RCD rebel base in the DRC, Uganda and
Rwanda who supported different factions of the RCD.
</P>
<P>
A leadership squabble within the RCD has kept the rebel
movement from signing the document, which was signed on July 10 by
DRC President Laurent Kabila, together with five other African
countries involved in the year-old conflict.
</P>
<P>
Wamba dia Wamba, who was expelled from the rebel group in May,
has insisted on signing the document, while the current leadership
refused to sign if Wamba dia Wamba did.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said the outstanding signature of the RCD was the only
remaining obstacle in bringing the cease-fire to life.
</P>
<P>
Congratulating the RCD on its decision to add its name to the
document, she said Friday or Saturday were possible dates for the
signing.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very important step that in a way closes the first
chapter of the resolution of the DRC conflict," Zuma told
reporters in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Once the document was signed, the first steps could be taken to
put the cease-fire into action. This would include the formation
of a joint military commission comprising soldiers from all the
countries involved in the conflict, within one week of the
signing.
</P>
<P>
The commission would among other things be responsible for
disarming dissidents in the DRC who threatened the security of
Rwanda and Uganda. This would be done under the supervision of
observers from outside countries.
</P>
<P>
South Africa would not be involved in this immediate phase,
which was expected to last several months, Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
The next step would be the deployment of U.N. peacekeeping
troops in the DRC.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Continues Backing Syrian Stance on Golan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will continue to support
Syria's demand for restoring the Golan Heights under Israeli
occupation, the foreign minister said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is keen on helping revive all tracks of the Middle East
peace process, Amr Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The peace process involves negotiations between Syria and
Lebanon, on the one hand, and Israel, on the other, and between
the Palestinians and Israel. The Syrian-Israeli talks have been in
deadlock since early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on reports that Syria was coordinating with Jordan
and the United States other than Egypt, Moussa said the Syrians
"have every right to coordinate with whomever they want."
</P>
<P>
Egypt "has no reservations over any coordination by the Syrians
(with other parties concerned), as such coordination, after all,
is related to their occupied land," Moussa stressed.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that Cairo shares identical stance with Damascus
on Syria's demand to restore the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel, plays a key role in mediating the Arab-Israeli peace talks
and is keen on coordinating the negotiating position of the Arab
parties.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the strategic heights from Syria in the 1967
Mideast War. The two countries' peace negotiations have been
stalemated due to disputes over the future of this piece of Syrian
territory.
</P>
<P>
Since the election of the moderate Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud
Barak, in May, the two neighbors have repeated readiness to resume
negotiations on the Golan Heights.

hke -- May Considers Retirement After Medals Row
</P>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Italy's 1995 world champion Fiona
May is considering to retire from the sport after controversially
finishing second in the women's long jump event at the World
Athletics Championships.
</P>
<P>
The British-born May was pushed into second place by home
favourite Niurka Montalvo, although her final effort looked like a
no-jump.
</P>
<P>
May hinted her retirement after an appeal by the Italian team
was rejected by the International Amateur Athletics Federation jury
of appeal despite video evidence which appeared to back her case.
</P>
<P>
"She's had enough," said her husband and coach Gianni Iapchino.
"That is the end."
</P>
<P>
A tearful May told a press conference:"I saw it was a foul. I
don't want to sound unsportsmanlike, but everybody saw it. I can't
go on like this."
</P>
<P>
May, who said she was "90 percent certain" she would retire at
the end of the season, said she felt robbed for a second time.
</P>
<P>
At the 1997 World Championships in Athens, Greece, her final
leap was ruled a foul, leaving her with the bronze.
</P>
<P>
"Twice in two years, it's no possible," she added.
</P>
<P>
"One time, maybe you can understand. But the second time it's
just too hard to take. I've worked it hard. I've made a lot of
sacrifices. And this is the reward?" asked the frustrated May, who
became the first women's world champion in any event for Italy at
the 1995 World Championships in Goteborg, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Iapichino said that the judges might be influenced by the fact
that Montalvo was from the host country.
</P>
<P>
"But we are not blaming the judge. The problem is the decision
of the jury of appeal. I'm not saying all this was a conspiracy
but a mistake has been made," said the former Italian pole vault
record holder.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies Softening Position on NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia denied Tuesday that it has
become more tolerant to NATO's eastward enlargement.
</P>
<P>
"Our country's view on the possibility of NATO's further
expansion has been and remains unchanged," the Interfax news
agency quoted a senior Foreign Ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The denial came after Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar's
statement last week in Tallinn that Russia is gradually moving
away from its total opposition to the Baltic countries' entry into
NATO.
</P>
<P>
Laar said he drew the conclusion from Russia's reaction to
NATO's admission of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
First, Russia declared that NATO's expansion eastwards is
impossible, then it said that it was categorically against it.
After that, Moscow's position boiled down to the notion that "even
though we are against it, this is inevitable," Laar said.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Russian Foreign Ministry official said, "The
impression is that the spreaders of such information try to make
their wish look real."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that such a course is a major political mistake not
contributing to the buildup of trust in international relations,"
the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said the subsequent enlargement of the alliance "would
continue brining NATO's military infrastructure closer to the
border of Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States, and
would augment asymmetry in conventional arms in favor of the
alliance."
</P>
<P>
"Russia respects the right of any state in its selection of
ways to ensure national security, but will in any event correlate
the consequences of NATO's enlargement with its national
interests," the official said.
</P>
<P>
"We also reserve the right to draw appropriate conclusions for
its own security," the official said.

<HEADLINE> Energy Watcher Warns Against Oil Price Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Consumers, car drivers and
industry are being warned that the oil market is heading for a
price explosion.
</P>
<P>
Petrol prices at the pumps have already gone up twice in recent
weeks in Britain, as oil prices are about 21 U.S. dollars a
barrel, compared with a 30-year low of about 9 U.S. dollars last
year, after drastic production cuts were introduced in March to
push the price back up.
</P>
<P>
The Center for Global Energy Studies says there will be "a
price crisis" unless oil-producing countries reverse their policy
of cuts in output.
</P>
<P>
High oil prices have knock-on effects for most of society. They
mean dearer petrol for drivers, higher transportation costs for
manufacturers, higher production costs, higher electricity costs
and a greater burden on industry generally. This all leads to one
thing: a rise in inflation, which inevitably brings the threat of
interest rate rises, according to some analysts.
</P>
<P>
Leo Drollas, deputy director of the Center for Global Energy
Studies, predicted petrol prices could go up by 2p a liter in the
next few weeks, if the oil price trend continued, according to a
BBC report.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the U.S., a 25 percent rise in oil prices could
lead to a 1 percent rise in inflation, although the effect was
likely to be less serious in the UK and rest of Europe.
Eventually, any impact on inflation could hit growth.
</P>
<P>
He warned the oil-producing nations should not keep prices
artificially high, saying, "It's not in their longer-term
interests to keep prices as high as this because it encourages oil
production elsewhere, outside OPEC."
</P>
<P>
"It affects inflation and growth internationally and affects
demand for oil in years to come so it's not a good idea," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. may apply pressure behind the scenes at the OPEC
countries' next meeting in September to boost output again and
bring prices down, BBC quoted Drollas as saying.

LUSAKA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Political parties and other

Legal Affairs Minister Vincent Malambo made this appeal while

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Kazakh Presidents Meet on Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin met here Tuesday with his Kazakhstan counterpart
Nursultan Nazarbayev, just a few hours after he landed in this
capital city of Kyrgyzstan for the five-nation summit of China,
Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told Nazarbayev during the hour-long talks that he
believed Kazakhstan would further develop in a stable manner under
his new term of presidency, and that Sino- Kazakhstan friendly
relations of cooperation would continue to achieve new progress.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that China is pleased with the
current developing trend of relations between the two countries,
and that mutual understanding and trust between the two sides have
been strengthened. Especially after they have comprehensively
settled the border problems, bilateral cooperation in various
sectors has further deepened, he added.
</P>
<P>
Trade between China and Kazakhstan has kept growing over recent
years. The trade volume last year reached 600 million U.S.
dollars and has enjoyed a remarkable growth so far this year,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Kazakhstan has become the second largest trade
partner of China within the Commonwealth of Independent States,
Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation between us still has great potential, and
keeping cooperation on a mutually beneficial ground is in the
utmost interests of our two countries," Jiang told Nazarbayev.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that some recent international events have shown
that someone are trying to build a unipolar world, and are
preaching new interventionism under the pretext that "human rights
outweigh sovereignty" and that current norms of international law
are outdated.
</P>
<P>
"That is a dangerous trend," Jiang stressed, "The basic
principles on international relations formulated since the end of
the World War II, especially the principles of respecting
territorial integrity and sovereignty of each country, non-
interference in each other's internal affairs, and resolving
disputes through peaceful means, should be defended so as to build
a just and reasonable new order of international politics and
economy."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he hopes to meet Nazarbayev in Beijing late November
and make further exchange of views with him on bilateral relations
and other global and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev, on his part, said he hopes the survey of the border
areas of the two countries could be finished at an earlier date,
as the two sides had settled all border disputes last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Nazarbayev said that he agreed with Jiang's
comment on current international situation, saying it is very
disturbing that a certain group of forces is trying to build up a
unipolar world and is interfering in the internal affairs of other
countries under the pretext of "human rights" and "democracy."
</P>
<P>
He said Kazakhstan highly values its friendly relations with
China and considers China a trustworthy partner. He promised that
Kazakhstan will be a "closest and most trustworthy friend" of
China.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh president also expressed satisfaction over the close
cooperation between the two countries over the combat against
separatism and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, Minister in charge of the
State Development Planning Commission Zeng Peiyan and Director of
the Policy Research Office of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China Teng Wensheng, were also present at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
In the evening, Jiang attended a working banquet hosted by
Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev for the presidents of China,
Kazakhstan and Tajikistan.

Afghanistan's territory.
</P>

After the return from Kandahar, Taliban's headquarters, on
Saturday, the Pakistani team has gone to Dushanbe again for the

<HEADLINE> India projects 6-6.5 Percent Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) Tuesday projected a six to 6.5 percent economic growth for
the country in 1999-2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
However, it warned that the mounting revenue deficit is
unsustainable due to deleterious effects on interest rates and
private investments.
</P>
<P>
According to the annual report of the RBI, the fiscal deficit
of the central and state governments combined was one of the
highest in the decade.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production is forecast to grow at around seven
percent while the rate of inflation during the year is also likely
to remain low and much below the long term trends, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said that current account deficit is
expected to be within sustainable levels with exports having shown
signs of rebound in the first three months of the current fiscal.
</P>
<P>
The RBI envisages growth in import bill under the impact of oil
price increases. Inward remittances continue to be buoyant, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Capital flows have also been at reasonable levels to bridge the
gap in current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
The services sector will impact fiscal deficit in the long run
to the extent that this constitutes a potential tax base for the
government, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz had two hours of talks Tuesday with the visiting
Afghan Taliban's top official responsible for foreign affairs
Mulla Mohammad Hassan Akhund here.
</P>
<P>
The talks were particularly centered around matters relating to
economic cooperation, transit trade, Afghan refugees and
reconstruction and rehabilitation of Afghanistan, said an official
press release.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said one of the major topic is the Afghan
Transit Trade Agreement (ATTA) which was signed in 1960s to
facilitate the inland country's foreign trade through Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan imposed some restrictions on the agreement in 1997,
complaining that smuggling under the protection of the ATTA is
depriving Pakistan's national exchequer of 5.5 billion rupees (106
million dollars) every year.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban are unhappy about that and have been calling for
the removal of the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Hassan arrived here on Tuesday afternoon as the head of a
14-member delegation. The Afghan official will stay in Islamabad
till August 27.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will also hold talks with the other relevant
ministries of Pakistan to examine ways to further expand bilateral
cooperation between Pakistan and Afghanistan in diverse areas,
said the press release.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- South African Cabinet
ministers on Tuesday faced thousands of public sector workers in
Cape Town as a nationwide strike was underway.
</P>
<P>
Teachers, hospital workers and off-duty policemen are among
those who put down tools on Tuesday to press for a better wage
deal.
</P>
<P>
Union leaders, representing 12 public sector unions from the
Congress of South African Trade Unions and the Federated Unions of
South Africa, will hand over a petition to the government.
</P>
<P>
The unions have rejected the government's unilateral
implementation of a 6.3 percent wage increase for 85 percent of
the public sector workers and demanded an increase of 7.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The local media put the number of strikers at about one
million. It was the public service's first-ever confrontation with
the government over salary increase, job security and labor
rights.
</P>
<P>
The powerful unions have raised issues on the high
unemployment rate inherited from the apartheid regime which
continues to grow, with jobs lost faster than they are created.
</P>
<P>
The union warned at the weekend that the strike would be the
biggest in the history of public service.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebels Agree To Cease-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Foreign Ministry said
that the two congolese rebel groups would both sign the Lusaka
peace agreement at a date to be agreed upon after consultation
with mediator Zambian President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana on Tuesday quoted sources from the
foreign minister as saying that a Zambian delegation was expected
to leave either on Tuesday or Wednesday for Kampala to meet rebel
faction leader Wamba dia Wamba and to Gova in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) to meet the other factions leader
Emile Ilunga.
</P>
<P>
"Both rebel factions have agreed to sign but the date will be
announced soon. It is likely to be very soon. Both factions will
sign the agreement, " one official said.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) split in May when most
of its military contingent announced it no longer wanted Wamba dia
Wamba, supported by Uganda, to head the movement and fell in under
Emile Ilunga backed by Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Due to the personality clashes among the rebel groups, efforts
to end the war had been futile.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe News Agency reported that the decision to sign
comes after marathon talks and several appeals by Chiluba, South
Africa, the international community and other southern African
countries.
</P>
<P>
Angola, the DRC, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Rwanda signed
last month the agreement to end the year-long civil war in the
third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean troops might pull out by the end of this year as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government had indicated that it will only
withdraw its troops after the deployment of U.N. peacekeeping
forces. It said it should take about three to four months after
the enforcement of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, together with Chad, Namibia and Angola, deployed
troops to the DRC when Tutsi rebels backed by Uganda and Rwanda
launched an attack on DRC President Laurent Kabila's forces in
August last year.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Somali Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Tuesday met in a closed-door session to discuss a report by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi, who complained inadequate response from
the world community, donors in particular, to the current
humanitarian crisis in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation council also was briefed by the U.N. Secretariat
on the current situation in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that despite the persistent security threats and
rising distribution costs caused by clan conflicts, mines and
other problems, U.N. agencies and their humanitarian partners
continue to deliver food aid to a high proportion of the most
affected areas, and to most settlements known to have incorporated
families.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report on the situation in Somalia, Annan said,
"The operational capacity of humanitarian agencies has gradually
been eroded, primarily owing to inadequate donor support for
medium-term rehabilitation measures."
</P>
<P>
"For United Nations agencies, this is shown by the weak donor
response to the 1999 Consolidated Appeal, which was severely
prioritized and focused in response to donor wishes," Annan said
in the report, to be presented to the U.N. Security Council
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the capacity of the agencies to provide
efficient, effective humanitarian relief has been weakened, making
response to future crises ever more difficult," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, inadequate medium-term funding reduces the ability
of humanitarian agencies to provide crucial, if more mundane,
activities related to disaster prevention and the building of
social resilience," he said.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been in conflict since the 1991 ouster of the
late leader Mohamed Siad Barre by a coalition of rebels.
</P>
<P>
After Siad Barre's ouster, the rebels turned against each
other, and the country disintegrated into fiefdoms protected by

<HEADLINE> Onex Announces Proposed Merger of Canadian Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Toronto-based Onex Corp. Tuesday
announced its proposed merger of 6 billion Canadian dollars (about
4 billion U.S. dollars) to make Canadian Airlines International
and Air Canada into a new Canadian air carrier.
</P>
<P>
CTV quoted Gerald Schwarts of Onex, one of the most successful
corporations in the country, as telling a news conference about
the merger, which CTV said means the loss of 5,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Schwarts pledged the proposed merger will enable the Canadian
air industry to have a greater share of domestic and international
routes with better efficiency.
</P>
<P>
But Transport Minister David Collenette responded cautiously,
saying that the country's competition bureau will later discuss
the issuer.
</P>
<P>
CTV also quoted passengers as expressing concern that a single
national air carrier will mean higher travel cost without
competition.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Airlines' debt is hovering close to 1 billion Canadian
dollars (about 669 million U.S. dollars) while Air Canada has seen
its share stagnant at the stock exchange.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Angola Locked in Alarming Humanitarian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- For ordinary Angolans,
the struggle to survive has brought a level of despair that exists
virtually nowhere else in the world today.
</P>
<P>
U.N. reports say that there are Angolans who risk ambushes on a
daily basis to forage food. Some are so desperate for firewood to
cook a meal, they harvest the wooden sticks that mark the sites of
land mines.
</P>
<P>
Sergio Vieira de Mello, U.N. undersecretary-general for
humanitarian affairs, Catherine Bertini, director of the World
Food Program, and Carol Bellamy, executive director of the United
Nations Children's Fund all sounded the alarm on the Angolan
crisis as they were addressing the Security Council and meeting
the press here Monday.
</P>
<P>
At present, 1.7 million Angolans are homeless and 200 are dying
each day of malnutrition-related diseases. "In Angola, two million
people are living a precarious existence and are in need of or
dependent on aid," de Mello said. "We estimate that another three
million people are entirely inaccessible and their condition is
therefore impossible to assess."
</P>
<P>
Observers here maintained that major domestic and foreign
factors have contributed to the sad reality in diamond-rich
Angola, plagued by nearly three decades of civil war.
</P>
<P>
First, U.N. analysis points to the seemingly endless conflict
in Angola as the single greatest determinant of the tragedy. Since
the resumption of the civil war in December 1998, the situation
has deteriorated rapidly in the southwest African nation, creating
levels of misery and despair among the people that are virtually
unmatched anywhere else in the globe.
</P>
<P>
The lengthy war have left Angola's children without the most
basic guarantees of human security and without the essential
services need to survive, grow and develop.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Angola's children are currently in serious peril, with
under-five mortality at 292 per 1,000 live births and with 42
percent of the nation's children moderately or severely
underweight for their age.
</P>
<P>
Besides, war has sent food in scarce supply in Angola, which
ranks first on the most at-risk roll among 16 African facing
severe food crises. Farmers fled their fields late in the growing
season as the most recent wave of fighting intensified, signaling
the failure of the Lusaka Peace Process. Food supplies in the
commercial markets are shrinking even as prices spiral beyond
reach.
</P>
<P>
The war also drove 70 percent of the country's population into
the besieged and overcrowded cities, where there is high risk of
outbreak of epidemic diseases due to the lack of sanitation and
safe drinking water. In May, a polio epidemic in the vicinity of
Benguela and Luanda resulted in 113 deaths. A meningitis outbreak
was confirmed recently in Kuando Kubango.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the efficiency of U.N. relief operations in Angola
has been dwarfed by the low level of response from donors to the
U.N. appeal for Angola. This has made U.N. agencies short of fund,
having obtained only 38 percent of the 106 million U.S. dollars
requested for Angola this year.
</P>
<P>
Fund shortage is one of the major concerns for U.N. relief
agencies, who are fighting an uphill battle to provide
humanitarian relief to as many Angolan refugees as possible. For
instance, the World Food Program, which has the largest presence
of any aid organization working in Angola, has so far received
only 40 percent of the funding it nees for emergency operations in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, deteriorating security conditions in Angola are a
major constraint for the international humanitarian community.
Over the past four months, six humanitarian workers have been
killed.
</P>
<P>
Besides, access to those in need is mostly through costly air
transport, or by road, where landmines and ambushes on vehicles
are a regular feature. "Our access is, however, curtailed both by
insecurity and by delays in granting us permission to access all
areas with humanitarian needs," de Mello said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, only people living in 30 percent of the territory
of Angola are accessible for the delivery of humanitarian
assistance. In other words, some 5 million Angolans are in need of
assistance, but only 600,000 are receiving international aid.
</P>
<P>
The tragic reality crys out for prompt international action.
With each day of delay, the situation is growing more precarious,
not only for Angola, for the circumstances in the country are
rapidly deteriorating and the impact is spreading beyond Angola's
borders.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Seeks Investment in Building Cross-border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is seeking a
strategic partner to invest more than 140 million U.S. dollars in
building an electricity transmission line that will connect the
country with an African power grid.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified senior official with the state-owned Tanzania
Electric Supply Company said in Dar es Salaam Tuesday that
feasibility and financial studies have been finalized for the
power project.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tanzania is not a member of the Southern Africa
Power Pool (SAPP) as the east African country has yet to be
connected to the giant power facility shared by the Southern
African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
In order to connect with SAPP, Tanzania needs to build a
670-kilometer- long power line from Mwakibete substation in
southwest Mbeya Region to Pensulo in neighboring Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"The financial report has been submitted this month and we are
only looking for a strategic investor," the official said, adding
that some power companies in the United States have shown their
interest in the cross- border project.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 330-kilovolt power line, when completed, will
ease acute power shortages in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The 14th SAPP meeting started in Dar es Salaam Tuesday,
attended by representatives from more than 10 southern African
countries.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's National Census Kicks Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's biggest ever national
population census kicked off at 8:00 p.m. Tuesday evening across
the east African country and will continue until August 31.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the National Census Steering Committee, Cyrus
Maina, said that after Tuesday night, enumerators and supervisors
will be at liberty to decide the best time to get people in their
neighborhood before August 31, adding that people will not
necessarily be counted at night.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the emphasis was on Tuesday night mainly
because it was the census reference night, saying that people will
be counted according to where they are on this night.
</P>
<P>
The census official made a passionate appeal to members of the
public to keep a record of all persons who will spend the night of
August 24 in their respective households.
</P>
<P>
People will be asked their age, name, religion, tribe, birth
place, martial status, previous residence, duration of residence,
education level attained and occupation, Maina added.
</P>
<P>
To make the census a success, Kenyan Vice-President George
Saitoti once said that more than 100,000 personnel had been
mobilized, including 3,000 senior supervisors, 10,000 supervisors
and 82,000 enumerators.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said his government would spend
approximately 1.8 billion shillings (about 25 million U.S.
dollars) on the big count.
</P>
<P>
The initial results of the census are expected to be publicized
in half a year.
</P>
<P>
This year's census is the sixth national head count in Kenya's
history and the fourth since its independence in 1963.
</P>
<P>
The first census was in 1948, giving the population as five
million, the second in 1962 yielded nine million, with 11 million
in 1969, 15 million in 1979 and 21 million in the 1989 count. The
present population of the country is estimated at around 30
million.

<HEADLINE> Measures Urged for Protection of Lake Tanganyika </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A Tanzanian official
Tuesday called on countries bordering Lake Tanganyika, the second
largest in Africa, to take measures to protect the ecosystem of
the lake.
</P>
<P>
Director of Environment in the Vice-President's Office, Eric
Mugurusi, said that inappropriate fishing methods, excessive
extraction of fish for ornamental uses, industrial pollution, as
well as operation of boats and harbors, are posing threats to the
environmental integrity of the ecosystem of the lake.
</P>
<P>
Mugurusi said this when addressing a four-day workshop on Lake
Tanganyika biodiversity project in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
He noted that inappropriate farming practices and deforestation
within the lake region have caused excessive sedimentation and
habitat destruction.
</P>
<P>
"Within the region, enforcement of existing regulations and
coordination mechanisms for the management of the lake have been
inadequate," he said, adding that these problems threaten the
lake's environment, which is the basis of the livelihood of people
around the lake.
</P>
<P>
The Lake Tanganyika Biodiversity Project Coordinator, Andrew
Menz, said that countries surrounding the lake, Tanzania, Burundi,
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia, should carry out
a joint strategic action plan to mitigate the real and increasing
threats to the lake.

<HEADLINE> Fed Raises Interest Rates One-Quarter Point Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Reserve announced
Tuesday to raise interest rates by a quarter point in an effort to
cool the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said it was increasing its target for the federal funds
rates, the interest banks charge each other on overnight loans, to
5.25 percent from current 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time this Summer that the Fed has raised
this rate. It boosted the funds rate from 4.75 percent to 5
percent on June 30, the first increase in two years.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, to drive home its efforts to fight inflation,
the Fed also raised the discount rate, the interest that it
charges for direct loans to banks, by a quarter of a point as
well. The discount rate was increased to 4.75 percent, the first
increase in the discount since February 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Today's increase in the federal funds rate had been widely
expected, and some analysts had also forecast a raise in the
largely symbolic discount rate.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Fed said that its actions of rate increase
both today and June 30 should "markedly diminish the risk of
rising inflation going forward."
</P>
<P>
"With financial markets functioning more normally and with
persistent strength in domestic demand, foreign economies firming
and labor markets remaining very tight, the degree of monetary
ease required to address the global financial market turmoil of
last fall is no longer consistent with sustained, non-inflationary
economic expansion," the Fed said.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the central bank said it was keeping its policy
directive, which signals possible future actions, on neutral.
</P>
<P>
The Fed actions came after a closed-door meeting today by the
Federal Open Market Committee, Fed governors and bank presidents
who meet eight times a year to set interest rate policies.
</P>
<P>
The new rate increases were expected to be followed quickly by
announcements from commercial banks that they were boosting their
prime lending rate by a similar quarter point, from the current 8
percent to 8.25 percent. The prime rate is a key benchmark for
millions of loans, from home equity and credit card balances to
short-term loans for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said even though the U.S. economy has slowed in recent
months, it is still expected to grow almost 4 percent this year, a
brisk pace that has pushed unemployment down to its lowest level
in three decades.
</P>
<P>
While that's good news for workers, it is worrisome to the Fed,
which is concerned that employers foraging for workers are wooing
them with higher wages and benefits, something that could drive up
prices and spark inflation down the road.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Confident Ethnic Albanians to let Russia Deploy Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Tuesday that the ethnic Albanians in a town in Kosovo will finally
let Russia to deploy its peace-keeping troops, which are supposed
to relace the Dutch.
</P>
<P>
Russia officers met with local Albanian leaders in the town of
Orahovac in Kosovo on Tuesday to resolve the situation and enable
Russian troops to deploy, State Department spokesman James Foley
told a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
However, the meeting did not resolve the situation, Foley said,
adding that Serb residents in Orahovac continued to hand over
weapons to KFOR troops.
</P>
<P>
An advance team of Russian KFOR troops scheduled to take over
patrolling from Dutch troops in the town had to turn back on
Monday after the Albanians set up barricades with tractors, cars
and buses to prevent them from entering the city.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of our view, the view of the United States, about how
this situation should be resolved, we fully expect to see this
situation resolved in a manner that results in the Russian troops
taking over their area of operations in Orahovac," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that we believe that Russian troops will act
evenhandedly. They will fulfill their mandate in Orahovac, just
as they have done elsewhere in Kosovo," Foley added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the protests against Russian troops in
another town in Kosovo died out as the Russians have demonstrated
that they are as committed as all other KFOR troops are to
fulfilling the mandate.
</P>
<P>
The Russian troops in Bosnia were met with "similar
skepticism," but the Russians have comported themselves very
professionally and evenhandedly.
</P>
<P>
"So our expectation is, while this standoff continues, that it
will be resolved, as was the situation in Kosovska Kamenica," the
spokesman said.

<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended
mixed Tuesday in response to higher interest rates announced by
the Federal Reserve after its Open Market Committee meeting in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 16.46 at

Monday's record closing high and then plunged as much as 105.43
points before regaining ground.
</P>
<P>
But broader stock indicators were higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 3.28 at 1,363.50 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 32.80 at 2,752.37.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee voted to raise

<HEADLINE> Security Council Voices "Deep Concern" on Angolan Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Tuesday issued a presidential statement, expressing its "deep
concern" at the deteriorating situation in Angola, calling on
donors to make generous contributions and urging the warring
parties to give international humanitarian workers an access to
people in need.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the
deteriorating political, military and humanitarian situation in
Angola, at the suffering of the people and at the dramatic
increase in the number of internally displaced persons which has
now reached well over two million people, not including the
unknown number of internally displaced persons in areas which are
currently inaccessible to humanitarian agencies," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council reiterates that the primary cause of
the current crisis in Angola is the failure by the leadership of
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
to comply with its obligations under the Lusaka Protocol, and
again demands that UNITA comply with immediately and without
conditions with its obligations to demilitarize and permit the
extension of sate administration to areas under its control,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that it is believed that "the lasting
peace and national reconciliation can only be achieved through
political dialogue."
</P>
<P>
"The Council urges both parties, particularly UNITA, to
guarantee the safety and security and freedom of movement of
humanitarian personnel, including United Nations and associated
personnel, providing assistance to internally displaced persons,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In May a polio epidemic in the vicinity of Benguela and Luanda,
the Angolan capital, resulted in 113 deaths. A meningitis outbreak
was confirmed recently in Kuando Kubango.
</P>
<P>
"Of the two million people known to be in need in Angola,"
600,000 receive humanitarian assistance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Angola has been locked in a civil war shortly after its 1975
independence from Portugal. The Angolan Government and the rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
resumed fighting in December last year, making the humanitarian
situation in the southwestern African country further worse.

<HEADLINE> El Guerrouj and Gebrselassie Retain World Crowns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Hicham El Guerrouj and Haile
Gebrselassie both had a play on the track in the Olympic Stadium
at the World Athletics Championships here on Tuesday, retaining
their world crowns easily.
</P>
<P>
After El Guerrouj of Morocco won the men's 800m with a
championship record time of three minutes and 27.65 seconds,
Gebrselassie made a history by winning the men's 10,000m for the
fourth consecutive times at a time of 27 minutes 57.27 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Guerrouj, two-time world champion and reigning Olympic gold
medalist, only moved to the front after 800 meters and pulled away
for an easy victory with the fifth fastest clocking of all time.
</P>
<P>
With win in hand, the Moroccan slowed down his pace in the
final 50 meters, blowing kisses to the crowds as he sprinted to
the finishing line.
</P>
<P>
After he crossed the line, Guerrouj, 24, kneeled down and
kissed the track.
</P>
<P>
It looked like that the young Moroccan star could cover another
1500m after the race when he jumped and waved hands to the
exciting crowds.
</P>
<P>
"I did not have any difficulty. I was sure about winning the
race before and throughout my run tonight," he said. "It is as
simple as that."
</P>
<P>
Noah Ngeny of Kenya was second at 3:28.73 and Spain's Reyes
Estevez, bronze medalist in Athens two years ago, remained at the
position in 3:30.57.
</P>
<P>
Gebrselassie brought an emotional finish of the day's final
events when he won the men's 10,000m in a sensational style.
</P>
<P>
Staying behind in the pack for 9,000 meters, the tiny Ethiopian
sped up in the penultimate lap and stormed past his challengers
steadily.
</P>
<P>
After the final bend, Gebrselassie, who won the event since the
1993 World Championships in Stuggart, Germany, looked back from
both sides of his head but could not find any chasers in sight.
</P>
<P>
Paul Tergat, world cross country champion, prevented an
Ethiopian medal sweep in the distance with a silver medal at 27:58.
56.
</P>
<P>
Assefa Mezgebu of Ethiopian was third at 27:59.15 and his
teammate Girma Tolla fourth at 28:02.08.
</P>
<P>
While the men's middle distances races produced unforgettable
moments, the women's 800m gave a shock finish when Ludmila
Formanova of Czech Republic defeated 1995 world champion Maria
Lurdes Mutola of Mozambique and defending champion Svetlana
Masterkova of Russia to take the race.
</P>
<P>
Formanova was clocked one minute 56.68 seconds. Mutola had the
silver at 1:56.72 and Masterkova bronze at 1:56.93.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Formanova had managed to win both indoor and
outdoor world titles in the same year, in front of Mutola.
</P>
<P>
Being lagged at the third place in the last straight, Formanova
came up from the outside line and stormed past Mutola and
Masterkova to touch the finish line first.
</P>
<P>
In other final events, Paraskevi Tsiamita of Greece won the
women's triple jump at 14.88 meters, Anthony Washington of the
United States had the men's discus throw at 69.08 meters, a new
championship record, and Romanian Mihaela Melinte won the women's
hammer event at 75.20 meters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier of the day, 100 meters champions Maurice Greene and
Maion Jones continued their pursuit of sprint doubles, winning
their quater-final rounds in the 200 meters when their compatriot
Allen Johnson, defending champion in the men's 110m hurdles, was
forced to retire from the event by injury.
</P>
<P>
After four day running, throwing and jumping, the United States
led the medal table with five golds. Germany was second at two.

<HEADLINE> China, Japan Agree to Enhance Cooperation in Public Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China and Japan agreed Wednesday
to expand cooperation between their police authorities in
combating transnational crimes.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during talks between visiting Chinese
Public Security Minister Jia Chunwang and his Japanese counterpart,
National Public Safety Commission Chairman Takeshi Noda.
</P>
<P>
The two public security chiefs exchanged in-depth views on the
expansion of cooperation between the two countries' police
authorities. Following their meeting, the two sides signed a
summary of talks.
</P>
<P>
The summary, which affirms the basic principle for exchanges
between the two sides and the scope of cooperation, will promote
cooperation between the two countries' security authorities in
fighting transnational crimes such as trafficking in drugs and
arms, and smuggling of people, a Chinese official said.
</P>
<P>
The document also outlines agreements between the two countries
to exchange information on criminal records, investigative
experiences and police systems, and to boost cooperation through
the Interpol.
</P>
<P>
Jia, who arrived here Tuesday for a week-long visit, is the
first Chinese public security minister to visit Japan.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan agreed to beef up cooperation in combating
international crimes during Chinese President Jiang Zemin's state
visit to Japan last November, and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi's tour to Beijing last month.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
began an open debate Wednesday to examine ways and means of
enhancing the protection of children in armed conflict, and to
raise the world awareness to the plight of children in armed
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Representative of all Security Council members, including
China, and 32 non-member countries have inscribed to speak at the
debate, U.N. officials said. The Security Council is scheduled to
vote on a draft resolution at the end of the debate.
</P>
<P>
Olara Otunnu, U.N. special representative for children and
armed conflict, underlined the importance of the debate by saying,
"Children represent hope and future in every society. Destroying
children, you destroy the society."
</P>
<P>
Otunnu told a news briefing Tuesday that he is "very confident"
that the Security Council will adopt a draft resolution, which he
has pushed very hard to include his proposals since last year.
</P>
<P>
If adopted, the proposed resolution would be the first in the
Security Council's history to focus exclusively on children and
armed conflict, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It would constitute a major breakthrough in the efforts by the
international community to protect children caught in the horror
of war," he said.

The ice map helped the expedition team spot an ice floe a few
days ago, on which an observation station was later set up, Qin
said, emphasizing that in order to help the expedition vessel
steer safely among the layers of ice, several agencies in Canada,
Russia and the U.S. have offered important assistance, making the
Chinese Arctic expedition a model of international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The expedition team is well-equipped, with an experienced
Russian guide, a scout helicopter, and optic satellite signal
reception equipment, according to him.
</P>
<P>
Because of bad visibility, less than 100 meters on foggy days,
the helicopter often could not take off and even the optic
equipment didn't work well, scientists aboard ship said. At such
times, the radsat is an indispensable part of the team. Its 24-
hour eyes can even pick out a small boat on the immense ocean.

SNOW DRAGON SHIP, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Arctic
Expedition ship Snow Dragon is being guided by an "invisible hand"
that reaches down from outer space to help it navigate among the
ice floes of the Arctic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The hand is a Canadian communications satellite that was sent
up in the 1990s. The satellite gets information from the ice floes,
scans it for characteristics, weather, and other data of
importance, and reports it to scientists aboard the expedition
ship who can then analyze the thickness, concentration, age, and
rate of melting of the ice and use it to help keep the ship out of
danger.
</P>
<P>
The radsat has the benefit of operating in all weather
conditions, even in inclement weather, explained Qin Weijia, an
official in charge of coordinating research projects on the Snow
Dragon.
</P>
<P>
"Ice maps" that are provided by the radsat every day are the
eyes of the ship's navigators and expedition personnel in the icy
area, he said. Its signals are first received by the International
Arctic Research Center in the U.S. state of Alaska and are then
transmitted on to the Canadian Ice Service for analysis, after
which the ice map is made and transmitted to the Snow Dragon.  (

<HEADLINE> Drought Badly Affects Crop in South Finland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Finland has had a bad harvest
this summer because of a two-month-long drought in the south.
</P>
<P>
Sunny days prevailed in the country all this summer, with the
air temperature in some areas unprecedentedly exceeding 30 degrees
centigrade.
</P>
<P>
Because of the poor harvest, the country has to import large
amounts of wheat and barley, representing 30 to 40 percent and 60
percent respectively of the total demand in next year, according
to forecasts of the local agricultural authorities.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that in south Finland the grain yield will be
under 2,000 kilograms or even 1,000 kilograms per hectare compared
with 4,000-5,000 kilograms in normal years.
</P>
<P>
The lingering drought has also seriously affected the growth of
fodder crops. The lean harvest will dent farmers' income by one
third.

NEW DELHI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Indian rupee remained

exchange market after opening slightly lower at 43.52 against the
U.S. dollar from Tuesday's close of 43.51.

virtually no movement as there was no major demand for the U.S.
currency and the rupee remained steady around 43.25 to the U.S.
dollar.

<P>
The U.S. dollar reference rate of the Reserve Bank of India,

<HEADLINE> Dutch Population Continues to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands' growing
population is expected to reach 15.9 million by January 1, 2000, a
government press release said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The release attributed the population rise to economic
development and immigration. The new figure will be three times
more than the total population in the year 1900 when population
was 5.1 million.
</P>
<P>
The country has 1.2 million non-western ethnic minority
population.
</P>
<P>
Further births and continued immigration are expected to push
the figure up to 2 million over the next 15 years. In 1999 alone,
almost 120,000 immigrants are expected to settle in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Most immigrants come from Turkey, Morocco, Surinam, the
Antilles, Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran.
</P>
<P>
In the Dutch history, said the release, the fastest population
growth occurred in the two decades following the second World War
when a baby boom added an average of 150,000 births a year to the
population.
</P>
<P>
Though the introduction of contraceptives and social trends
like individualization and women's liberation resulted in
population decline in the 1970s, the fall was soon offset by the
rise in immigration.

MOSCOW -- Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander
Avdeyev said Wednesday that the demonstrations by ethnic Albanians
near the town of Orahovac in Kosovo "will not influence Russia's
position on its peacekeepers' mandatory presence in that district.
"
</P>
<P>
Russia is convinced, he said, that "the location of a Russian
contingent near Orahovac meets the interest of Russia and of the
post-conflict settlement in Kosovo," the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"We are well aware that the Albanians' continuing
demonstrations in protest against the location of Russian
peacekeepers in Orahovac are not spontaneous and are organized by
those who oppose our presence in Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the problems for which we were prepared,"
Avdeyev said.
</P>
<P>
The settlement of the situation concerning the Russian
peacekeepers "is fully within the competence of the KFOR command,"
he said, referring to the international peacekeeping force in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"As far as we know, the KFOR command is working on this problem,
" Avdeyev said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Yugoslav Tanjug news agency, ethnic Albanians
have encircled Kosovo's southwestern town of Orahovac over the
past two days in an attempt to halt the deployment of Russian
peacekeepers there. (Russia-Kosovo-Peacekeepers)

BANGKOK, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The rate rise of the United
States will not affect the stability of the baht currency and the
government's policy of pursuing low interest rates, the Bank of
Thailand (BOT) said here on Wednesday.

Assistant central bank governor Kiettisak Meecharoen said that
the 25 basis point rise in U.S. rates will not create problems for

He said the baht exchange rate has not been affected and BOT
remains confident in pursuing the lower interest rate policy,
which will help to stimulate and sustain the economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Foreign capital inflows will also not be affected by the rate
increase due to regaining confidence of foreign investors in Thai
economic prospects, he said.

</P>
<P>
She said that improvement of the anti-missile defense systems
envisaged (by the U.S.) risks jeopardizing the basis of the Anti-
Ballistic Missile Treaty between the United States and Russia and
three other former Soviet republics, which are regarded as an
essential element of the actual mechanism of disarmament and non-
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
France has expressed concern about the so-called Theater
Missile Defense (TMD) system the U.S. plans to deploy in Taiwan
and Japan, fearing it will trigger a strategic nuclear arms race
in the Far East and greatly destabilize the region.
</P>
<P>
France also fears that the U.S. plan could trigger a new arms
race with Russia and result in a proliferation of nuclear arm
technologies around the world.
</P>
<P>
The United States is working on the Theater High Altitude Area
Defense (THAAD) which can intercept a tactic ballistic missile at
a very high altitude.
</P>
<P>
The TMD is a regional version of THAAD.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. failed four times out of seven in its
experimental firings of THAAD anti-missiles, the U.S. Defense
Department plans to make it operational by 2004.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Orders for Durable Goods Rise 3.3 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department said
Wednesday that orders to U.S. factories for durable goods rose 3.3
percent in July to a seasonally adjusted 204 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The July's increase was the biggest gain since December 1998,
when durable goods orders rose 3.4 percent, the department
reported.
</P>
<P>
The advance in durable goods orders followed a 0.5 percent gain
in June, better than what the government previously estimated, and
a 1 percent gain in May.
</P>
<P>
The strong performance in July was much better than many
analysts had expected. The report comes one day after the Federal
Reserve raised interest rates for the second time this year in
an effort to cool the economy and prevent an outbreak of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The report said orders for industrial machinery, the category
that includes computers and machine tools, had the strongest
showing in July, rising a hefty 8.4 percent, the largest increase
since January 1995. That followed sharp declines of 4.5 percent
and 3.9 percent in May and June respectively.
</P>
<P>
Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment, which
includes everything from semiconductors, circuit boards and
telecommunications equipment to home appliances, posted a strong
5.9 percent gain in July, following a 3.5 percent increase in
June.
</P>
<P>
Last month, orders for transportation equipment also jumped 2
percent, following gains of 1.1 percent in June and 9.9 percent in
May. The transportation sector is often volatile from month to
month because it includes such big ticket purchases as airplanes.
</P>
<P>
The department said that an increase in orders for airplane and
aircraft parts more than offset a decline in orders for automobile
and car parts. The summer is traditionally a slow period for the
automobile industry as manufacturers retool assembly lines to
prepare for new models. The auto industry expects record sales
this year.
</P>
<P>
Excluding transportation, overall orders for durable goods
would have risen 3.7 percent, the largest increase since February
1997.
</P>
<P>
U.S. manufacturers have been battered by a global financial
crisis, which has cut sharply into their overseas sales and also
opened them up to stiffer competition from cheaper imports.
</P>
<P>
This year, the overall economy has continued to do
exceptionally well, powered by strong consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
Primary metals, the category that includes steel, saw orders
grow by a solid 2.4 percent in July, following gains of 2.7
percent in June and 0.3 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
Also, shipments of big-ticket durable goods, a good sign of
current demand, increased a solid 0.7 percent in July.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Dips 4.6 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Japan's global merchandise trade
surplus posted a year-on-year fall of 4.6 percent in July, marking
the fourth straight month of decline, the Finance Ministry said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The surplus narrowed to 1,249.4 billion yen (10.3 billion U.S.
dollars) due to the recent appreciation in the yen's value against
other currencies, the ministry said in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
Exports fell 7.6 percent to 4,215.5 billion yen (34.7 billion
dollars). The high-flying yen caused shipments of automobiles,
office equipment and steel to contract by 17.0 percent, 13.3
percent and 21.5 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Imports also retreated 8.8 percent to 2,966.1 billion yen (24.4
billion dollars), with imports of aircraft and crude oil down 67.3
percent and 11.1 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Japan's merchandise trade balance is measured on the basis of
goods clearing customs and is reported before adjustment for
seasonal factors.
</P>
<P>
The yen traded at an average of 121.56 yen in July, a steep
rise from the 140.42 yen a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United
States rose 8.0 percent to 721.3 billion yen (5.9 billion dollars),
marking the third straight month of expansion.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus with other Asian countries increased 13.9
percent, while that with the 15-member European Union posted a 23.
9 percent decrease, the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Able to Produce Essential Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Defense Minister Admiral
Ali Shamkhani declared on Wednesday that Iran is "capable of
designing and producing all essential hardware for the defense
sector."
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating eight projects of the defense industry under his
ministry, Shamkhani said the new defense hardware produced in
Iran is a clear indication of the vital role of defense industry
in the country's development.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been under a U.S.-imposed economic and military
embargo since the early 1980s. Short of spare parts to maintain
U.S.-made weaponry procured during the late shah's regime,
Tehran's new rulers set up their own defense industry to meet the
needs in the eight-year war with the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani said his ministry is making use of all domestic
industrial capacities to realize self-sufficiency. During an air
force drilling last week, Iran took pride in its capability to
produce spare parts for maintenance and upgrading of U.S.-made
F-14s.
</P>
<P>
Four days ago, the Defense Ministry issued a statement, denying
that Iran intends to conduct nuclear tests. Accused by the U.S. of
seeking unconventional capabilities, Iran said it is committed to
preserving the Persian Gulf and the Middle East a region free
of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
In July last year, Iran successfully tested "Shahab-3"
(Meteor-3) with a range of 1,300 kilometers, which meant it can
hit targets in Israel, Saudi Arabia and U.S. military bases in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Refinery Blaze Brought Under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Two refinery workers were seriously
burned when a fire broke out early Wednesday in the gasoline
pumping station of the Api refinery at Italy's Falconara
Marittima, the plant supervisor said.
</P>
<P>
Giovanni Saronne, the supervisor of the plant, which is on the
north-central Adriatic near the port city of Ancona, added that
the fire had been put out.
</P>
<P>
Nearby road, rail and air traffic, to and from the Falconara
Marittima airport, were suspended as firefighters began battling
the fire
</P>
<P>
The blaze, the cause of which has not yet been determined,
"involves the entire pumping station which pumps gasoline into
tankers for distribution," Saronne said.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses to the fire said they heard a sharp report followed
by two others, saw a flame leap to a height of 40 or 50 meters and
felt a blast of searing heat when the blaze got started.
</P>
<P>
While firefighters went to work, about 50 people living near
the refinery left their homes as plant staff advised people in
nearby Villanova and Fiumesino to "stay at home with doors and
windows closed and prepare for a possible evacuation."
</P>
<P>
The Api refinery here covers about 65 hectares and accounts for
some 4 percent of Italy's refining capacity with production of
4 million tons per year by a workforce of 390.
</P>
<P>
The plant extends from the Adriatic shoreline, where the
production facilities are located, to the storage tank area inland
between a provincial highway and the railway line.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the refinery was the nation's first to comply with new
safety legislation by burying liquid gas tanks to reduce the risk
of explosion.

<HEADLINE> Sensex Down in Bombay Stock Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The sensitive index (Sensex)
on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) fell 73.37 points Wednesday in
the wake of panic selling triggered by speculation of another
securities scam involving a big operator.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-30 share sensitive index started off better with the
Sensex breaching the previous record peak to set an all-time high
at 4,826.07 that raised hopes of another rally.
</P>
<P>
However, bulls later reacted strongly to rumors that a big
operator connected with a leading financial institution was
involved in a 25-billion-Indian-rupee (581.40 million U.S.
dollars) scam and resorted to all-round heavy unloading.
</P>
<P>
Operators, failing to confirm the speculation, later rushed to
cover their short positions, resulting in partial but smart
recovery that lifted the Sensex over 109 points to close at
4,718.73 as against Tuesday's close of 4,792.10,, netting a
substantial fall of 73.37 points or 1.53 percent.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-100 index also toed the line and dropped by 43.08
points to 2,120.98 from the previous close of 2,164.06
</P>
<P>
The BSE-200 index and the Dollex were quoted substantially down
at 488.03 and 186.70 compared with their previous close of 498.38

<HEADLINE> Iran, Pakistan to Jointly Combat Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Pakistan signed here
Wednesday a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on combating drug
trafficking, expanding border trade and exchanging information.
</P>
<P>
The MOU was inked by Iranian Interior Minister Abdolvahed
Mousavi Lari and his Pakistani counterpart, Chaudry Shujaat
Hussain, who arrived here Monday for talks on joint fight against
drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Lari said Hussain had a
"favorable attitude toward all the proposals set forth" and hoped
this agreement will enhance future bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Drug trafficking has been rampant in the area overlapping
parts of Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan despite anti-drug
campaigns. Drugs are being shipped from the so-called Gold
Crescent to world markets via Iran and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Hussain told reporters that Pakistan was looking into the
killings of Iranian nationals in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"A special anti-terrorist court has been set up," he said,
to "arrest all the elements and hand out verdicts, including
death penalties, in proportion to the crimes committed."
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami has called on Pakistani
government to deal strongly with murderers of Iranian nationals
and expressed support for Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif's determination to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with Hussain, Khatami said Iran can cooperate and have
relations with neighboring countries better than ever before. "Our
policy is based on detente and strengthening friendship," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hussain denied that his government supports the Taliban, which
now rule most of Afghanistan. Iran and Pakistan have been at odds
for their support to opposing sides in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"A committee has been set up in Pakistan's Interior Ministry
which aims to establish contacts and help carry-out negotiations
between" the warring factions in the decade-old conflict, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran supports the Northern Alliance, an opposition led by
President Burhanuddin Rabbani. The Taliban killed eight Iranian
diplomats and a correspondent when its troops took over
Mazar-e-Sharif, a stronghold in northern Afghanistan from
opposition forces.
</P>
<P>
Iranian president told Hussain that Tehran's policy toward
Afghanistan Taliban regime "has been based on self-restraint and
preventing the problem from turning into big tension."
</P>
<P>
About 200,000 Iranian troops had been massed along the border
with Afghanistan to force the Taliban to return the bodies of the
killed Iranians and release those who were kept captive. Iran is
demanding the murderers be identified and punished.
</P>
<P>
Hussain held two rounds of talks with Lari and met with former
President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who warned against "wide-scale

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Seven people, including a woman
and two children, were killed on Sunday and Monday in acts of
violence in Algeria, according to reports from Algiers on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A 44-year-old woman and her two children, aged eight and 10,
had their throats cut when they were sleeping in their house in
Beni Saf, 500 kilometers west of Algiers, reported several
Algerian dailies.
</P>
<P>
They were members of a family of a "patriot," or civil
militiaman, who discovered the dead bodies when he returned home
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Two village guards were killed in an ambush by Islamic
extremist Sunday night in a village in Dellys, 100 kilometers from
Algiers.
</P>
<P>
An armed Islamic extremist was killed in Tadmait near Dellys on
Sunday by security forces and a policeman was also killed in a
bomb explosion on Monday near Saida, 450 kilometers southwest of
Algiers, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic acts of violence have resumed after Algerian President
Abdelaziz Bouteflika announced one month ago that he will hold a
referendum on a "civil concord" law seeking national
reconciliation in September.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was rejected by two most radical Islamic rebel
groups.

<P>
The association also banned the swimmers' coaches Cheng Zhi and
Xu Huiqin for one year.
</P>
<P>
The CSA's decision was made in the wake of a ban on the two
swimmers earlier this month by swimming's world governing body
FINA. The Chinese association said in a statement issued at the
time that it fully supported the ban and promised to punish all
those involved.
</P>
<P>
Wang and Xiong, both from Shanghai, tested positive for
anabolic steroid clenbuterol in out-of-competition tests in March
in this year. It was the second drug offense for both swimmers.
</P>
<P>
The ban over Xiong takes effect from August 9 this year, when
FINA announced its ban. Wang's ban runs from April 13 next year,
the date when he finishes his current two-year ban.
</P>
<P>
And the two swimmers were each fined 8,000 yuan RMB (963 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Their coaches are banned for one year starting from August 9
this year and were each fined 12,000 yuan RMB (1,445 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Spectacular Art Performances Will Mark China's National Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 Chinese artists
nationwide will stage 100 performances from August 25 to October
15 in Beijing to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The artists are from more than 100 art troupes of central
departments as well as municipalities and autonomous regions
across the country, according to Pan Zhenzhou, vice-minister of
culture.
</P>
<P>
"The performances will include a variety of art forms such as
opera drama, Peking Opera, local Chinese operas, melodrama,
children's drama, dance drama, acrobatics, symphony and puppet
shows," Pan said.
</P>
<P>
"China's culture and art development has experienced a
prosperous era with the country's further reform and opening up
over the past twenty years," the official said, adding that more
and more excellent art performances have been created and large
numbers of outstanding art professionals have emerged.
</P>
<P>
The performances will specifically include a number of
repertoires such as the stage play "the Event of Xi'an", the
Peking Opera "Caocao and Yangxiu" and the dance drama "Silk Road"
as well as a lot of works by local opera companies, which have
played an important role in promoting the country's socialist
culture and ethnic construction.
</P>
<P>
"These performances have also displayed the charm of Chinese
culture and art, attracting wide foreign audiences during
international exchange activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from a dozen drama productions such as "Tea House" and a
Peking Opera "Women Warriors", the performances for the National
Day, which falls on October 1, will include many new shows created
in recent years, such as the Sichuan-style opera "Mask" and the
modern drama "Victory".
</P>
<P>
In addition, art troupes from ethnic autonomous regions of
Xinjiang, Tibet and Inner Mongolia will stage a number of ethnic
dance and singing performances or plays in ethnic languages.

<HEADLINE> China Adds Huge Sum of Investment in Dry Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China is to spend an additional
250 million yuan in dry farming this year in a bid to increase
grain production.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jian, vice-minister of agriculture, told a press conference
today that the fund, which compares sharply with the original
budget of 20 million yuan, will focus on developing dry farming
demonstration zones in northern China, a region often hit by
droughts.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite the ongoing droughts in northern and some
other parts of China, the overall grain output this year will not
be much affected.
</P>
<P>
China is short of water resources, with the per capita share
being only one-fourth of the world average, and the country,
therefore, needs to apply dry farming to 62 percent of the nation'
s cultivated land.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that facts have proved that dry farming techniques can
increase grain output by 600 kg per hectare, adding that China can
increase its grain production capacity by more than 40 million
tons if such techniques are applied to its near 70 million
hectares of dry farmland.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 15 years, China has made 4,000 agro-scientific
and technological achievements in dry farming, more than 500 being
major ones.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1996, China has spent 45 million yuan in building 68 dry
farming demonstration zones," he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century and early next century, China will
build up a sustainable dry farming development system, which will
raise the rate of utilizing water resources to over 60 percent and
that of fertilizers to between 40 and 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Liu also gave a short briefing on a
publication about dry farming in China and a computer management
information system detailing techniques, both edited and developed
by the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the publication and the successful development of
the system symbolize the standardization in publicizing and
promoting dry farming techniques.

BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan,
in a meeting in Beijing today with his Armenian counterpart Vardan
Oskanyan, said that since diplomatic relations were established 7
years ago bilateral relations have maintained a steady development
momentum, mutual understanding has increased, and there has been
mutually beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have consulted and cooperated with each other on
international issues and China is satisfied with that, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to promote cooperation on the basis of
equality, mutual respect, and mutual benefit to push bilateral
relations forward, he said, and expressed appreciation for Armenia
's adhering to the one China policy and its having no official
relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Oskanyan said that bilateral relations have been developing
well and that Armenia gives priority to developing Armenian-
Chinese relations and it will promote bilateral cooperation in
politics, the economy, and other areas.
</P>
<P>
He said that Armenia will continue its one China policy and it
will not have any official relations with Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui Associates with Evil Elements of "Taiwan Independence" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily is to carry a
signed article tomorrow, further refuting Lee Teng-hui's splittist
remarks.
</P>
<P>
The article by Yu Jia says that Lee Teng-hui's "two-state"
remarks were not merely a whim or slip of the tongue but an
elaborate and well prepared declaration of intent.
</P>
<P>
It is no surprise to Chinese people that Lee Teng-hui has
metaphorically burned the bridges of the development of relations
between both sides of Taiwan Straits, says the article.
</P>
<P>
In fact, during the 11 years since Lee Teng-hui assumed office,
he took pains to cover up his attempt to separate Taiwan from
China, although other people have seen through this mask.
</P>
<P>
Lee's separatist attempt is different from other elements of "
Taiwan Independence" only in form and strategies. He claimed that
he was opposed to "Taiwan Independence", even after he made the "
two-state" remarks.
</P>
<P>
But people can find that Lee Teng-hui's words and deeds do not
differ from the splittist concepts and opinions of other "Taiwan
Independence" elements. Many of Lee Teng-hui's political views
were borrowed from those elements of "Taiwan Independence", says
the article.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui's remarks of "special state-to-state relations"
is very close to the political views of the Democratic Progressive
Party in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
After Lee's "two-state" remarks were made, he was widely
condemned by people from both China and overseas and supported
only by "Taiwan Independence" elements headed by the Democratic
Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
Lee attempts to impose his influence on the coming election in
Taiwan next March and tries to maintain the splittist policy in
Taiwan. He has mistakenly caused tension between the two sides of
the Straits and instigated a mood supporting "Taiwan Independence"
amongst certain factions.
</P>
<P>
The article adds that Lee has underestimated the Chinese
government's and people's decision to protect China's sovereignty
and territorial integrity, and stressed that his separatist
attempt is doomed to fail.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislature Debates "Repeated Taxes" for Private Sector (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Fierce debate was sparked today
among lawmakers in the current session of the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress over certain aspects of
legislation for developing the private sector in China.
</P>
<P>
The majority agreed to pass a draft law on solely-funded
enterprises as soon as possible, which was tabled yesterday for a
third review, as they believe it will further reinforce the new
constitutional principle of "protecting and encouraging the
development of non-public-owned sectors."
</P>
<P>
However, there were many others who said the current draft
failed to reflect the new constitutional principle added in March
this year because it would oblige owners of solely-funded
enterprises to pay "repeated taxes," such as tax on their business
operations as well as on their personal income.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, owners of a solely-owned enterprise
shall pay taxes according to law, which means tax for business
transactions. But as individuals, they are also expected to pay
personal income tax anyway under the existing personal income tax
law.
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the draft law, including Committee member Lai
Jinlie and Liang Guangda, pointed out that China is facing
tremendous pressure from the relatively high jobless rates with
large numbers of workers laid off from state-owned enterprises.
They thus believe that early promulgation of the law would help
solve some social problems.
</P>
<P>
Wang Mingshi, an opponent, pointed out that limitations imposed
on the private sector in the draft will threaten the healthy
development of those enterprises.

<TEXT>
<P>
Wang Youhui, another member of the Standing Committee, said
that private businesses are currently under the jurisdiction of up
to seven different government branches and "can barely afford to
exist."
</P>
<P>
"The government restructuring process must be sped up across
the country to provide a better environment for them," he urged.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers also argued over a controversial addition that was
made late to the draft law which stipulates that members of the
Chinese Communist Party should conduct activities in accordance
with the Party Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of this addition, such as Li Boyong and Hou Zongbin,
said that it would help to bring the role of Party members into
full play by countering unethical and illegal practices. But Zhu
Xiangyuan, Xu Dunxin and many others objected insisting that it is
absolutely unnecessary because no matter where they are, all Party
members should abide by Party rules.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, enterprises should not be differentiated by whether
they have Party members or not.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers also proposed strengthened guarantees to ensure the
interests and working conditions of employees in private
businesses.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, among the privately operated
businesses, there were 442,000 solely funded firms and 31.2
million self-employed people registered in China at the end of
1998.

URUMQI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- State Councilor Ismail Amat asked
government departments to be certain that people from flood-
damaged parts of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have a safe
winter.
</P>
<P>
The remark came during his visit to Xinjiang from August 19 to
23, where he said that the disaster relief work has had some
initial success, but a greater effort is still needed to help
people who suffered from the floods return to a normal life.
</P>
<P>
The climate in Xinjiang has been unusual since July. Most
rivers in the region were reported to have risen above the danger
mark because of heavy rains and there were flash floods in the
southern and northern part of Xinjiang that caused heavy damage.
</P>
<P>
He asked that a study of grain shortages be done immediately so
that they can have their grain shortages made up soon.
</P>
<P>
He also asked local areas to try every way to rebuild
irrigation works damaged by the floods so as not to delay autumn
planting and next year's crops.

Members of the Ninth National People's Congress Standing

<HEADLINE> EDS-Recast with correction China Likely to Pass Law on Public Bidding on Construction Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China's first law on opening
bidding on government construction contracts to the public is
likely to pass soon after having gone through three rounds of
debate.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Ninth National People's Congress Standing
Committee in their 11th meeting today discussed revising the draft
and agreed that it should be passed immediately to serve as a
weapon against corruption in the building industry.
</P>
<P>
They blamed faulty construction practices and a lack of
transparency in bidding for poor construction quality in China.
</P>
<P>
They discussed how the law can prevent corruption and possible
punishment for offenders and how to keep the bidding free from
bribery and unsavory practices.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that there be a bid evaluation board composed of
technicians and representatives of trades society concerned to
ensure fairness and transparency, and some members suggested that
some administrative agency be designated as supervisor for the
bidding.

<TEXT>
<P>
Competing in the steamy heat under the firing sun, Skurgyin led
the pace after half point to surge ahead to win the first 50km
walk title in history of the championships for Russia, with a time
of three hours 44 minutes and 23 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Italian Ivano Brugnetti, 23, was the great surprise in the
event by pulling away with the silver medal at 3:47.54, which
bettered his personal best by nearly four minutes.
</P>
<P>
"This silver was as much of a surprise to me as it was to
everybody else," said the Italian. "I knew I was well trained,
however, I couldn't ever expect anythng like this."
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I was coming to Seville with only the 20km on my
mind,but I decided to change to the 50km. I really did not know
where my limits were in this event. Only during the race did I
realize it was possible for me to follow the best walkers," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Matyukhin arrived 24 seconds behind Brugnetti.
</P>
<P>
At the 25km mark, Latvian Aigars Fadejevs, runner-up in the
20km event at the 1998 European Championships, headed the race
with a 49 seconds lead over Skurygin and one minute 47 seconds
over Spain's 1993 world champion Jesus Angel Garcia.
</P>
<P>
However, Fadejevs was later disqualified and at the 30km mark,
Skurygin had already a comfortable lead of 2.13 over a group which
included reigning world champion Robert Korzeniowski of Poland,
who was, however, disqualified at the 38km point.
</P>
<P>
These positions did not have any change until the end of the
race. Skurygin was warned twice during the race.

<HEADLINE> The Post Office Can Work With The Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Post offices may become the most
effective e-commerce locales in the world, according to some
people attending World Customer Day at the 22nd Universal Postal
Congress (UPC) here today.
</P>
<P>
Walda Roseman, the CEO of CompassRose International, Inc., said
at the meeting today that although people prefer e-mail to writing,
they need the postal service as kind of guarantor.
</P>
<P>
As a government entity, the post office is in an excellent
position to act as a "trusted third party" for storage and
verification of digital IDs. John Tait, the chairman of PaperCom
Asia Pacific, says that because of inadequate on-line ID methods,
the United States is using more paper confirmation than ever
before because each electronic transaction may need many
confirming documents, and Wang Zhanning, the chairman of the 22nd
UPC, says that post offices have an extensive delivery network
that on-line companies lack.
</P>
<P>
According to Roseman, the number one complaint of Internet
shoppers after the 1998 Christmas season was poor delivery. The
popular Internet retailer, Amazon.com, has more limited sales
because of its inability to deal in cash.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Leavey, director general of the International Bureau of
the Universal Postal Union (UPU), said that post office in the
future will be like a one-stop shop. It combines the activities of
bank, mail, delivery and information center.

BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Luo Gan, a Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee Political Bureau member, today said that
Party and government officials need to play a greater role in
safeguarding the country's social stability and that it is in fact
their political duty.

The remark came at the second plenary meeting of the Central
Committee for Comprehensive Management of Social Security, which

the CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as the core, different
areas and departments have done well in safeguarding social
stability this year, especially in dealing with the Falun Gong
problem.
</P>
<P>
He said that, generally speaking, China has enjoyed a stable
society so far this year, although there have been some major
criminal activities in certain parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that departments need to have a strict policy in
dealing with all sorts of criminal activities and that particular
attention should be paid to major criminal activities, criminal
gangs, and people attempting to divide the motherland and disrupt
social order.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Expresses Concern Over Indian Military Designs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Defense Committee of the
Cabinet (DCC) of Pakistan Wednesday expressed serious concern over
India's "aggressive militarization program," particularly in the
nuclear field, as recently announced in its nuclear doctrine.
</P>
<P>
The DCC concluded at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif that India's intention to go ahead with the deployment and
operationalization of its nuclear weapons and delivery systems is
fraught with serious risks and dangers not only to the security of
the region but the world at large.
</P>
<P>
"The Committee agreed that the development of Pakistan's
nuclear program will be determined solely by the requirement of
our minimum deterrent capability which is now an indispensable
part of our security doctrine," said an official press release
issued after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The DCC reaffirmed that Pakistan is opposed to an arms race in
South Asia and it has taken concrete initiatives in this regard,
notably the Strategic Restraint Regime proposed to India in
October last year.
</P>
<P>
The DCC urged the international community, particularly the
major powers, to use their influence to persuade India to accept a
comprehensive restraint regime, specially with a view to
preventing an arms race in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
In the context of the Pakistan-India relations, the DCC
underlined the need for an early settlement of the Kashmir dispute
in the interest of durable peace in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
On the Afghan issue, the DCC reiterated Pakistan's support for
the Tashkent Declaration of the "six plus two" group
(Afghanistan's six immediate neighbors plus Russia and the United
States) and said Islamabad will continue its persistent efforts
for promoting peace in Afghanistan through dialogue and
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting reviewed the results of Pakistan's latest peace
initiative on Afghanistan, particularly the Pakistani delegation's
two visits to Dushanbe for meeting representatives of the Afghan
opposition and the visit to Kandhar for discussions with the
Afghan authorities.
</P>
<P>
"These efforts, which will continue, are part of Pakistan's
consistent policy of promoting peace in Afghanistan through
dialogue and negotiations," said the press release.
</P>
<P>
The DCC meeting was attended by the ministers of foreign
affairs, finance, information, Kashmir affairs and the three
services' chiefs, foreign and defense secretaries as well as other
senior officials.

<HEADLINE> French Court to Judge Case of Divorced Cult Mother </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A French court in Dole in the
region of Jura near the Swiss border will judge the case of a
divorced family, where the father wants to take back his two
children from her ex-wife, who is a member of a cult group.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) Wednesday quoted the lawyer of the
adversary party, Philippe Lefant, as saying that the unidentified
father has also sent a letter to the Minister of Justice Elisabeth
Guigou, telling her of the graveness of the situation.
</P>
<P>
After divorcing his wife in 1996, the father fears that his two
sons, aged seven and eight, could be brought into the activities
of a cult community called Shri Ram Chandra Mission, whose
headquarters in Europe are the Castle of Angerans near Dole.
</P>
<P>
The mother has rejected the demand which she called "scandalous,
" the AFP quoted her lawyer, Patrick Uzan, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Shri Ram Chandra Mission, which teaches its members to practice
meditation, is based in India and has more than 2,000 followers in
France, according to a French parliament commission in charge of
investigating cults.

<HEADLINE> Key Projects Boost Development of New China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China began to introduce advanced technology and equipment from
developed countries in the 1970s, when the international and
domestic situation was favorable for economic construction. Key
projects were introduced from Japan, Germany, the Netherlands,
France, Italy, the United States, Switzerland, and other countries,
at a cost of 20.5 billion yuan since 1972.
</P>
<P>
According to observers, the key projects before 1980 helped
form China's basic industrial system, while those in the 1980s
swiftly improved the level of basic industries. This decade, the
country focused on electric power facilities construction and
sped up economic development.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show China put 248.6 billion yuan into 319 key
projects from 1982 to 1989, or 29 percent of total infrastructure
spending during the period. By the end of 1998, coal output
reached one billion tons and the total installed capacity of power
plants hit 135 million kw, making the country one of the leading
coal and electricity producers in the world.
</P>
<P>
The communications and telecommunication industries, which used
to be a bottleneck for economic growth, also registered fast
development.

<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Two major projects -- the new
Capital Airport in Beijing and the Pudong Airport in Shanghai's
Pudong New Area -- will be open for use before October 1, 1999,
when the country celebrates its 50th birthday.
</P>
<P>
The two projects cost more than 20 billion yuan, and there are
more important infrastructure projects of the size. In the 1996-
1998 period alone, China spent 440 billion yuan on such major
projects.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, China began large-scale construction in the
fields of energy, steel, chemical engineering, machinery, and
electricity, with combined investment up to 20.3 billion yuan,
which accounted for 12.4 percent of the total government input in
infrastructure in that period.
</P>
<P>
The government's key projects built in the past 50 years have
resulted in an independent and relatively complete industrial and
economic system.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1960s, the country spent 28 billion yuan on
national defense and a number of military research and production
centers, which helped technological advancement in many fields.
</P>
<P>
Construction of other key projects, including the Daqing oil
field and three trunk railway lines in southwest China, was also
carried out in this period.

Turkey as senior officials of the bloc are scheduled to visit the
country on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen, whose country is
serving the rotating presidency of the European Union, and
European Union Foreign Relations Commissioner Hans van den Broek
are to meet in Ankara with Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
and Foreign Minister Ismail Cem.
</P>
<P>
They are to assess the damage caused by the August 17
earthquake, which has so far claimed a death toll of more than 12,
000 people in northwestern Turkey, and plans of EU's aid to
rehabilitate and reconstruct the devastated region.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the EU granted a 2-million-euro (2.06 million U.S.
dollar) emergency aid to Turkey. The European Commission is to
discuss on Thursday the granting of a second aid package which is
said to be similar in amount to the first one.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission is also to discuss in September a more
elaborate action plan to support Turkey, whose relationship with
the union went awry after the union stopped short of letting it
join the grouping among the first batch of countries.

<HEADLINE> IMF Threatens to Stop Aid Unless Indonesia Settles Bank Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) will stop disbursing its financial aid to Indonesia if the
government fails to settle the Bank Bali scandal, a fund official
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will urge the Indonesian government to settle the case as
soon as possible. The IMF will take the step, if necessary," the
fund's Asia Pacific Director Huber Neiss said here on the
sidelines of a seminar on the Indonesian Economy.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's stance was clearly against corruption and therefore
it would take strict measures, including stopping loans to
Indonesia, Antara News Agency quoted Neiss as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the fund had also urged the Indonesian government to
accelerate the investigation process, take firm measures against
those involved in the scandal as evidence that there is rule of
law in Indonesia, anticipate similar cases in the future by
improving existing rules and report the results of investigation
to the public.
</P>
<P>
Neiss said the fund had given full authority to international
auditor Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC) to help the investigation
being conducted by the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA)
and Bank Indonesia, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the World Bank's chief representative in Indonesia,
Mark Baird, had made a similar statement.
</P>
<P>
Baird said the World Bank would exercise sterner control over
all of its projects in Indonesia, and that the Bank Bali scandal
should be promptly and transparently settled and stern action
should be taken against the culprits.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Bank Bali had illegally transferred 546 billion
rupiah (about 78 million U.S. dollars) to PT. Era Giat Prima
(EGP), a private company linked to several of President B.J.
Habibie's associates.
</P>
<P>
Several ministers and Habibie's younger brother are also
alleged to be involved in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor Miranda S. Goeltom
said the central bank had already identified the bank accounts
related to the Bank Bali scandal.
</P>
<P>
But because of its position as a central bank, it could not
disclose the outcome of its investigation. "If Bank Indonesia
finds any indication of criminal action or violation of the law in
the Bank Bali case, Bank Indonesia will report it to the police,"
she said.

The total length of highways was more than a million kilometers
by the end of 1989 when the telephone networks in the cities of
Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Guangzhou greatly improved
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
China's great construction achievements in the 1990s have
provided a solid foundation for development in the 21st century.
From 1991 to 1995, a period considered the "golden age" of railway
construction, the government spent 84.1 billion yuan on 33 major
projects, including the Beijing-Kowloon railway.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years of the 1990s, China began its cross-
century work on the Three Gorges Water Conservation Project on the
Yangtze River and the Xiaolangdi Water Control Project on the
Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project, one of the largest projects in the
world, will cost an estimated 50 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The country's two nuclear power plants were also put into
operation in the five-year period, when construction of water
conservancy works was stepped up greatly.
</P>
<P>
People who have watched China for the past 50 years say that
the half century of New China is also a great history of
construction and that all key projects are landmarks.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Unwraps Package of Projects for Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
announced Wednesday in Mindanao, southern Philippines, a package
of projects worth 3.5 billion pesos (87 million U.S. dollars) for
the island, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the ground-breaking ceremony of a fish port
project, Estrada said his administration will turn the "island of
promise" into a reality, the Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
This is the last day of Estrada's three-day visit to Mindanao,
his third visit to the island as president.
</P>
<P>
He said it is the national government's priority to transform
Mindanao, which is rich in natural resources but poor in
infrastructure, into the nation's "food basket."
</P>
<P>
To this end, inter-regional linkages in Mindanao will be
hastened by the rehabilitation of the Pan-Philippine Highway which
will cost some 2.97 billion pesos (74 million dollars), Estrada
noted.
</P>
<P>
He said this major project involved the rehabilitation of some
156 kilometers of the Mindanao section of the highway.
</P>
<P>
The president also witnessed the turnover of 100 million pesos
(2.5 million dollars) from the Japanese Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund for the implementation of a food security program
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The president said the national government has also allocated
some 427 million pesos (10.7 million dollars) for the procurement
of road construction and maintenance equipment in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The government, Estrada said, is also constructing several
school buildings in some provinces of the region to cope with the
growing number of students.
</P>
<P>
"Through all of these projects, we hope that you will be able
to increase your harvest and your income. This will be the
beginning of your rise from poverty," Estrada added.

<HEADLINE> Northern Irish Police Chief Blames IRA in Belfast Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Northern Irish police chief
Ronnie Flanagan said on Wednesday that he believed the IRA
guerrillas were involved in the murder of a Belfast taxi driver
last month.
</P>
<P>
Flanagan said Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam
knew his view and it was up to her to decide whether the murder of
Charles Bennett was a breach of the Irish Republican Army's (IRA)
two-year-old truce.
</P>
<P>
Flanagan, publicly linking the IRA to the killing for the first
time, said: "I have no doubt that the IRA were involved in the
murder of Charles Bennett."
</P>
<P>
Flanagan, head of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), made the
comment at a television discussion program of the BBC.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Bennett, an alleged police informer, was found
shot in the head in Northern Ireland's capital Belfast last month.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam, who has been assessing the ceasefire, is expected to
make an announcement later this week on the state of the truce.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, says it believes that the
IRA has not breached the ceasefire declared in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
But pro-British unionist politicians accused the IRA of being
involved in the shooting and the smuggling of weapons from the
United States to Ireland.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Insolvent retailer T. Eaton Co.
starts liquidation sale Wednesday, according to Canadian news
media.
</P>
<P>
After a bustling night, the 130-year-old company opened at
regular hours, with 20 to 40 percent discounts off the lowest
ticketed price on all clothing, accessories and home furnishing.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Eaton's has not yet determined discounts on other
items.
</P>
<P>
About 600 employees at Eaton's Toronto head office and the main
warehouse have been let go. That includes three of the five
division vice-presidents, the media said.
</P>
<P>
The once-dominant department store chain, which now still has
64 stores, will gradually let its 13,500 employees leave during
the liquidation sale period until November 30.
</P>
<P>
Toronto Stock Exchange suspended trading in Eaton's shares
Tuesday due to their "failure to meet continued listing
requirements." Eaton's shares lost 31 cents (about 21 U.S. cents)
to close at 40 cents (about 27 U.S. cents) Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the federal Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, Eaton's has 30
days to make a proposal for shares of repayment to its creditors.
If the proposal is rejected, Eaton's will be declared bankrupt
with 329 million Canadian dollars (about 220 million U.S. dollars)
in debt.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Signs Gas Agreement with Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC) and Ghana National Petroleum Corporation
Tuesday signed a gas supply agreement in Abuja to further
implement the West African Gas Pipeline project.
</P>
<P>
This was another document following the signing of agreements
among Nigeria, Ghana, Benin, Togo, and the Nigerian Gas Company in
Cotonou, Benin, on August 11, according to the Guardian, one of
Nigeria's leading newspaper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Chief Executive Officer of
the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation, Tatsu Tsikata, said the
project would be a model for sub-regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He observed that there was significant expertise in the West
African Sub- region to ensure successful execution of the project.
</P>
<P>
Tsikata said Ghana would be conserving between 15,000 barrels
and 20,000 barrels of crude oil per day by taking gas from
Nigeria to run its power plants.
</P>
<P>
Ghana will be taking 84 percent of the 120 million standard
cubic feet of gas that Nigeria would be selling to the other
three countries under the project.
</P>
<P>
"Nigeria, in fact, will not be competing with any country in
the sub- region in the energy business. At the very best, we will
work together to optimize the exploitation of resources of the
sub-region for our mutual benefits," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aimed at boosting Nigeria's revenue and protecting environment
by reducing gas flaring, the west African gas pipeline project
is among the first major projects Nigeria's new civil
administration launched since its inauguration on May 29.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Police Offer Psychological Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The police clinical
psychologists of Hong Kong have begun to offer criminal profiling
services to assist investigators in dealing with cases.
</P>
<P>
"The behavior of offenders at a crime scene can reflect their
mental state and can allow us to predict what sort of person they
may be," said Ephraem Tsui, a police clinical psychologist of the
Child Protection Policy Unit (CPPU), here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We can give educated guesses based on our experience and
knowledge, and use deductive analysis to try to narrow down the
type of offender the person may be using the available information
of the case," Tsui said.
</P>
<P>
"From that, we try to suggest areas in which investigators
should look into. We are also planning to set up a criminal
profile computer system to help us analyze crime patterns," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Tsui has been assigned to assist crime units with their
investigations by offering his expertise in psychological
profiling under a six-month trial which started last month.
</P>
<P>
Scenarios in which Tsui assists case commanders include serial
or bizarre sexual offenses or homicide, unexplained arson,
threatening or bizarre messages, and unexplained deaths requiring
psychological autopsy.
</P>
<P>
"I do a general analysis of the crime. They give me the basic
case facts, photos and maps of the scene, victim and witness
statements and video evidence to help me try to understand the
personality and psychological state of the offenders," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I also help crime formations understand arrested people and
assess whether they have a psychological condition or are mentally
disturbed," Tsui said. "Many offenders try to minimize their guilt
through claims of psychological problems."
</P>
<P>
Tsui said it is not only culprits who can be analyzed, the
characteristics of the deceased can also be examined through a "
psychological autopsy" which helps give a picture of the lifestyle
or mental state of the people before their suspicious death.

<TEXT>
<P>
BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of China,
Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan have all stressed
the need to make joint efforts to fight against separatism,
religious extremism and international crimes in the region.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin said in a speech at the 4th
summit of the five nations held here on Wednesday that the five
countries should continue the fight against destabilizing factors
to regional security such as religious extremism, national
separatism, international terrorism and other international
criminal activities in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said relevant functional departments of the five countries
should gradually establish an effective cooperation mechanism to
this regard.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin said that an urgent task facing
the five countries is to take coordinated actions against
international crimes, drug trafficking, arms smuggling, religious
extremism and separatism.
</P>
<P>
He said it is necessary to set a date for a meeting of leaders
of the law-enforcement authorities of the five countries.
</P>
<P>
Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of Kazakhstan, said that the
five-nation summit has become an important factor in maintaining
stability in the Eurasian landmass.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev stressed those problems of organized crimes, drug
trafficking and religious extremism are disturbing factors.
National separatism, in particular, he said, is a very dangerous
trend.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan firmly supports China and Russia in their struggle
against separatism and extremism, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
President Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan said those problems have
become important factors threatening the stability and security of
the region.
</P>
<P>
Akayev and President Emomali Rakhmonov of Tajikistan urged the
five countries to make joint efforts and establish a coordination
system to fight against those problems.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmonov said that Tajikistan will not allow any activities
hostile to other countries happening on its land. He also
promised to firmly crack down on any form of separatism, extremism,
international terrorism, organized crimes, arms smuggling and
illicit drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also called for the construction of air, rail and
highway transportation facilities in the region so as to enlarge
regional economic development for a common prosperity.
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate their determination, the five leaders signed a
joint declaration at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists End First North Pole Expedition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SNOW DRAGON SHIP, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China's first
government sponsored North Pole expedition ended today and the
ship, Snow Dragon, which carried the teams of scientists and
journalists is homeward bound.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made aboard the ice-breaking ship today, Chen
Liqi, chief scientist of the expedition, said that the research
goals had been achieved.
</P>
<P>
The scientists, who sailed from Shanghai on July 1, have
conducted various research tests into ocean activity, biology and
atmosphere in the Chukchi and Bering seas and the Arctic Ocean
during the 56-day voyage.
</P>
<P>
The expedition aimed to study the effect of the North Pole on
the global climate, especially on that of China, the ecological
system in Arctic waters as well as on the atmosphere, geology,
fishing and marine environment of the area.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving the Arctic region the 122 members of the
expedition held a ceremony on a huge ice floe 75.30 degrees north
latitude and 163 degrees west longitude in the Arctic Ocean and
flew a Chinese national flag.
</P>
<P>
Over the past week, Chinese scientists have established an
observation station on this huge chunk of floating ice and tests
into the atmosphere, biology and conditions of the ice have been
jointly conducted by over 20 scientists.
</P>
<P>
The scientists were flown to an ice area at 77.78 degrees north
latitude, the most northerly point they have ever reached, in a
Chinese-made helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Kang Jiancheng, a doctor from the Shanghai-based Polar Research
Institute, said it had long been his dream to carry out research
at the North Pole and he was very satisfied with the results.
</P>
<P>
Eight team members jumped into the freezing cold sea to
demonstrate their vigor before the expedition wound up today.

<HEADLINE> HK to Put 120B Dollars to Complete Five New Rails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will invest 120
billion HK dollars (15.38 billion U.S. dollars) to complete five
new railway projects in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Leung Chun-ying, convenor of the
Executive Council, Wednesday at a luncheon hosted by the American
Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Leung said that the local government's decision at various
stages in the past to go ahead with the construction of five new
railway lines in addition to the existing network would bring
about significant changes to the pattern of passenger traffic.
</P>
<P>
He said that in addition to the environment benefits that these
new railway lines would bring to Hong Kong, new areas of the New
Territories would become more accessible and that the travel time
would be shortened.
</P>
<P>
Given the fact that the direct catchment areas of these five
new railways would have a total population of 1.45 million or 21
percent of Hong Kong's total, Leung said, the economic and social
impacts of these projects would be significant.
</P>
<P>
Among the construction projects was the Shenzhen Bay bridge,
which is several times longer than the Tsing Ma Bridge, providing
a short-cut from Hong Kong onto the Guangzhou Expressway, Leung
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Swiss aviation conglomerate
SAirGroup has said that it could not match its strong 1998
earnings after a 31.5 percent profit fall in the first half of
1999.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Wednesday, SAirGroup Chief Executive Philippe
Bruggisser said that he expected 1999 to be a difficult year for
the company that operates flag carrier Swissair.
</P>
<P>
"The group will be unable to match the strong results achieved
for 1998," the company said in reporting net profit fall of 31.5
percent in the first half to 87 million Swiss francs (about 57.24
million U.S. dollars
</P>
<P>
Of SAirGroup's four divisions, only SAirRelations and
SAirServices posted encouraging results, while Swissair parent
SAirLines and SAirLogistics "were substantially below both prior-
year levels and budgeted objectives," according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
SAirGroup, which posted 1998 net profits up 11.4 percent at 361
million francs (about 237.5 million dollars), said earlier this
year it hoped to be able to deliver similarly good results in 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Ten rebels of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) have been killed in recent military
operations staged by the Turkish security forces in southeastern
Turkey, an official statement said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued by the Office of the Emergency Regional

militants in Yuksekova town of Hakkari province bordering Iran
and one in the Catak town of Van province.
</P>
<P>
The security forces also captured three PKK militants in Silopi

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Signs Gas Agreement with Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC) and Ghana National Petroleum Corporation
Tuesday signed a gas supply agreement in Abuja to further
implement the West African Gas Pipeline project.
</P>
<P>
This was another document following the signing of agreements
among Nigeria, Ghana, Benin, Togo, and the Nigerian Gas Company in
Cotonou, Benin, on August 11, according to the Guardian, one of
Nigeria's leading newspaper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Chief Executive Officer of
the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation, Tatsu Tsikata, said the
project would be a model for sub-regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He observed that there was significant expertise in the West
African Sub- region to ensure successful execution of the project.
</P>
<P>
Tsikata said Ghana would be conserving between 15,000 barrels
and 20,000 barrels of crude oil per day by taking gas from
Nigeria to run its power plants.
</P>
<P>
Ghana will be taking 84 percent of the 120 million standard
cubic feet of gas that Nigeria would be selling to the other
three countries under the project.
</P>
<P>
"Nigeria, in fact, will not be competing with any country in
the sub- region in the energy business. At the very best, we will
work together to optimize the exploitation of resources of the
sub-region for our mutual benefits," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aimed at boosting Nigeria's revenue and protecting environment
by reducing gas flaring, the west African gas pipeline project
is among the first major projects Nigeria's new civil
administration launched since its inauguration on May 29.

<HEADLINE> World Postal Services Must Change for Survival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The world's postal organizations
will have to speed up modernization and improve their services for
survival in an ever competitive market, warned Boris Boutenko,
vice-chairman of the 22nd Universal Postal Congress (UPC) here
today.
</P>
<P>
Boutenko, who is also chairman of the Postal Operation Council
(POC), convened a meeting of representatives of users on this
World Consumer Day to offer a bridge for the postal bodies and
users to discuss their needs.
</P>
<P>
He urged postal organizations to adopt modern
telecommunications technology in their daily business and quicken
the pace of automation so as to offer customers a fast and
efficient service.
</P>
<P>
"We should build a highly automated and modern postal service
network worldwide so that money can flow between different postal
saving organizations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said that state-owned postal services, which are
obligated to undertake low-profit mail and newspaper distribution,
are now confronted with competition from private companies which
are profit driven and enjoy more flexible management.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that postal services still have a long life
ahead of them especially in developing countries, where modern
information technology cannot reach every household.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Universal Postal Union said that in the next
five years, the volume of postal use is expected to rise at an
annual rate of two-three percent. However, it added, the structure
of the service will see changes, with personal mail dropping in
volume and commercial mail on the rise.

drops in the interest rates of the one-year and two-year treasury
bills, the Daily Star reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Youssef el Khalil, head of the financial department at the
Central Bank, said the drop in yields of both bonds mainly stems
from signs of economic improvement in the first seven months of
this year.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to forecast the percentage of drop on the
T-bills.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's exports rose to a record six-year high of
420 million U.S. dollars in the first seven months of this year,
beating the previous record of 413 million dollars back to 1996,
the al Nahar newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The exports up to July were also up 46 million dollars, or
12.3 percent, higher than the amount recorded in the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Imports over the same period fell to 3.595 billion dollars, a
11.5 percent drop compared with the 4.061 billion dollars
registered in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fall in imports, the country's Custom revenues
rose by 6 percent to 803 million dollars from 758 million dollars
for that period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In general, the trade deficit dropped by 14 percent to 3.175
billion dollars, compared to 3.687 billion dollars registered at
the end of July in 1998, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- Iraq and Egypt have signed an agreement on
industrial cooperation to promote transactions between the
industrial sectors of the two countries, the Alam Al Yom newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will provide Iraq with semi-manufactured commodities that
will be finished in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The deal also aims to meet Iraq's needs for various electrical
appliances as well as the requirements by the agricultural,
health, transport and communications sectors.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's budget deficit for the first seven months
of this year fell to 38.5 percent, down from 43.91 percent in the
first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Spending up to July in 1999 stood at 3,771 billion Lebanese
pounds (about 2.514 billion U.S. dollars) while revenues were
2,317 billion pounds (about 1.544 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government has set a deficit target of 40.5
percent of spending for 1999 compared to 43 percent in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Keep One Pct GDP Growth Forecast for 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Wednesday that Malaysia will not revise its
one percent growth forecast for 1999 despite the strong second
quarter growth of 4.1 percent announced by Bank Negara (State
Bank).
</P>
<P>
"No, we cannot do it because we do not know the GDP (gross
domestic product) figures for the third quarter and the fourth
quarter as there are still forces trying to undermine our
economy," Mahathir told reporters after his talks with visiting
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie in Putrajaya, Malaysia's new
federal administrative capital near here.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement when asked to comment on the strong
second quarter performance of 4.1 percent GDP growth as announced
by Bank Negara against a contraction of 1.3 percent in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said: "It is happiness for us," hoping that the
positive growth in the economy would go on.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian economy saw a growth of 1.4 percent in the first
half of 1999 compared with a contraction of 4.2 percent in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
For the whole of last year, the Malaysian economy shrank by 6.7
percent as a result of the Asian financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Diplomat on Iranian-Egyptian Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's chief representative in
Iran hoped the two countries would remove obstacles to normalize
ties, because "enhanced cooperation between the two will benefit
all Muslim nations of the world."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a Persian-language daily, Mohammad Fathi
Al-Tahtavi, head of Egypt's interest section, said both sides are
responsible for the current dilemma in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"If there are any obstacles, they are not only from the
Egyptian side," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries cut off ties after Egypt granted asylum to
Iran's late shah, who was deposed in the 1979 Islamic
Revolution. They agreed to open interest section in each other's
capital in 1991, but have stopped short of resuming full
diplomatic relations since.
</P>
<P>
Al-Tahtavi said Egyptians believe that naming a Tehran street
after Khaled Islammboli, one of the assassins of Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat in 1981, is the main obstacle in bilateral
ties while Iranians see Egypt's relations with Israel as the
prominent one.
</P>
<P>
He hinted that lack of political will plays the major part in
preventing bilateral ties from improving.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has on many occasions
explicitly voiced his respect for President Mohammad Khatami, he
said, "however, similar remarks were never heard from Iranian
officials."
</P>
<P>
Despite Khatami's effort to improve Iran's relations with
world countries, Arab nations in particular, since his landslide
victory in the 1997 presidential election, Iranian-Egyptian ties
remain deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian diplomat's remarks may send a signal to Iranian
authorities that Cairo is willing to do business with Khatami and
take some steps toward Tehran.

<HEADLINE> Massive Drug Hauls Reported in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Massive drug hauls have been
reported in Iran's Gulf province of Bushehr and neighboring Fars,
as well in the southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan
bordering Afghanistan and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
About 474 kilograms of drugs were seized over the past four
months in Bushehr, while more than 282 kilograms of drugs were
caught in different cities of Fars province over the past 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The drug hauls include opium, heroin, hashish, and some other
kinds of narcotics destined for Gulf countries. Along with drugs,
guns and ammunitions were also seized.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that great demand for hashish in the Persian
Gulf littoral states has made Bushehr province a transit route.
</P>
<P>
In the province of Sistan and Baluchestan, close to the
so-called "Gold Crescent" overlapping parts of Iran, Pakistan and
Afghanistan where drugs were cultivated, 6,350 kilograms of drugs
have been seized over the past 11 days.
</P>
<P>
Local police said that after gun battles with traffickers, 22
rifles, 1,410 rounds, 18 vehicles and 240 motorbikes were also
confiscated in the province, hit hardest by drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Iran has long been a transit route for drug trafficking from
west Asia to Europe, and a booming market in nearby Gulf
countries has increased the task of anti-drug campaign.

KAMPALA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan and Rwandan troops in
Kisangani, who exchanged fire at each other for four days last
week, plan to swap prisoners of war (POWs) as a means of massaging
the bruised relations.
</P>
<P>
A total of over 100 POWs would be exchanged this time, the New

<HEADLINE> China's Machinery Industry Maintains Strong Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China's machinery industry, the
main equipment provider of the country's industrial sector, is to
experience another round of rapid growth fueled by huge demands
for machinery in the ongoing process of restructuring State
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Wang Bingnan, a spokesman for the State Administration of
Machinery Industry (SAMI), said at a news conference today that a
series of new policies the central government formulated on
restructuring state enterprises and stimulating domestic demand
will give a boost to the development of the country's machinery
industry.
</P>
<P>
Wang also said that the improvement of the national economic
returns is based on a well-developed machinery industry as the
country is set to promote the use of home-made equipment in key
sectors of large projects.
</P>
<P>
Vice-premier Wu Bangguo pointed out recently that development
of the machinery industry should focus on the needs of industrial
sectors such as the metallurgical, petrochemical,
telecommunications, textiles, and military industries.
</P>
<P>
As one of the pillar industries in the national economy, the
machinery industry plays a strategic role in China's economic
growth. Over 80 percent of the production capability in the basic
industrial sectors is provided by the machinery industry and
almost all agricultural machinery is domestic made.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the machinery industry accounted for 21.5 percent of
China's exports in 1998, and the export of machinery and
electronic products has been at the forefront of the country's
exports since 1995.
</P>
<P>
"However, China still needs to upgrade the technology of its
machinery products and increase exports of equipment to improve
the economic results of the sector," said Li Ye, deputy director
of the Development Planning Department of SAMI.

ISLAMABAD, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Karachi Stock Exchange
(KSE) index plunged Wednesday on statement of Finance Minister
Ishaq Dar that Hubco (an independent power producer) issue would
take time to be settled and it has no link with IMF conditions.
</P>
<P>
The KSE-100 index ended 45.77 points, or 3.61 percent, lower to
1,221.69 against Tuesday's 1,267.46 points.
</P>
<P>
The total volume traded Wednesday stood at 230.922 million
shares against 241.240 million shares the previous day.
</P>
<P>
"The market came under selling pressure right from the start as
the statement of Finance Minister Dar damaged the optimistic
sentiment of the investors regarding an early settlement of Hubco
dispute," said Shakeel Anwar Kamal, a dealer with Prudential
Securities Pvt. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Dar is reported to have said that the Hubco issue could not be
settled overnight as it would take time. The issue is not related
with IMF conditionalities and market people should not speculate
in the scrip.
</P>
<P>
Shakeel said the news made the investors jittery and they
started selling. The foreign fund selling in PTCL further caused
panic and then the whole market came under selling pressure, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The market could make a recovery in the coming session
provided there is some positive news but the recovery would be
mainly through short covering," said Imran Afzal, a dealer with

<HEADLINE> Uygur People Move Toward Modernization (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- When Hamlat Gupur, a medical
professor of Uygur background, discussed his latest research
achievements at academic forums in the United States and Europe in
fluent English and Russian, audiences admired him and the progress
his ethnic group has made in the process of China's modernization
drive.
</P>
<P>
Hamlat, now deputy president of the Xinjiang Medical Science
University and head of the Xinjiang Uygur Medicine Institute,
obtained his doctorate in medical science in Russia.
</P>
<P>
He has gained the attention of the medical community by
establishing a theoretical system on the basis of combining Uygur
medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, and Western medicine, and
in September 1996 he was named one of the ten outstanding young
people in China.
</P>
<P>
"I deeply understand the greatness of our national medical
culture and my success comes from the support of the motherland
and the nurturing of the unique medical sciences of China," said
Hamlat, who continued that "after going abroad, my sense of
patriotism as a Chinese and of repaying the motherland's kindness
has become even stronger."
</P>
<P>
Unlike Hamlat Gupur, who gained fame for his achievements in
the medical sciences, Rozi Nyaz, a Uygur farmer, is a household
name in Xinjiang's Turpan, known as the place where the world's
best grapes are produced.
</P>
<P>
"I apply scientific methods to every step of grape growing,"
said Rozi. Last year, he set a record by producing 1,250 kg of
raisins from seedless white grapes per mu (0.067 hectares) of land.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas of the present-day Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, where about eight million Uygur people live, advanced ways
of farming, including the wide use of farm machinery, have
replaced traditional tilling tools, leading to marked increases in
the output of grain, cotton, and other major crops.
</P>
<P>
The years of reform have presented people with unprecedented
opportunities for success. Many people of Uygur background no
longer just cling to their oases, but are now engaged in a wide
spectrum of activities.

<P>
PARIS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The leader of the French Greens, Dominique Voynet, has asked
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin to hold a referendum on his nuclear
policy, or face a "nuclear explosion" of the left-wing pluralistic
majority. The minister of management of territory and environment
ruled out the possibility of resigning from her post, and called
on the Greens to "go out of the culture of small groups".
</P>
<P>
-- For the second consecutive day, the inhabitants of the
ethnic Albanian part of the Kosovo city Orahovac kept leaving on
Tuesday the town in protest of the arrival of Russian troops
serving in KFOR. Ironically, the Serbs of the city also want
Russians to go because they think the Russians cannot provide them
with enough security in fear of offending the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- While the French population is becoming more and more old,
the behavior of consumption is changing with difference of age.
Experts have observed a reversal of solidarity between the old and
the young, as more and more young people in the country are living
off their parents. The group of people aged between 18 and 24 is
much influenced by technological innovation, with 40 percent of
the people carrying mobile phones in France being younger than 25.
</P>
<P>
The method of treatment against pain is ill adapted to the
needs of many patients, said specialists meeting at the 9th World
Congress consecrated to the subject in Vienna, Austria, from
Monday till Friday. American and Dutch doctors presented tests
through intravenous injection to diagnose and identify the precise
nature of pain and to change its treatment.

<P>
The city of Kashgar in southern Xinjiang is now home to a great
number of modern Uygur merchants. Askar Abdulla, a native of
Kashgar and known as the "king of hides and wool," has been doing
business in the Commonwealth of Independent States since the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
Other Uygur businessmen have chosen to do business in such
major Chinese cities as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, or in
cities overseas. Some have made fortunes in the outside world and
have brought back modern concepts of value to Xinjiang, helping
local residents widen their visions.
</P>
<P>
Abulahat Abdurixit, chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, attributes the great progress made by the Uygurs and
people of other ethnic background to national unity and mutual aid,
China's national policies of encouraging common prosperity among
people of all backgrounds, and powerful support from the state.
</P>
<P>
The state has mobilized large numbers of people and pumped huge
investments and materials into supporting the construction of
Xinjiang since the founding of the People's Republic of China in
October 1949. This support has increased since 1978, when the
country initiated its reform and opening policies.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 302.37 billion yuan was spent for fixed
assets in Xinjiang from 1978 to 1998, of which, 57.2 percent came
from the State.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the State and other Chinese provinces,
Xinjiang has been blessed with completion of a great number of
major projects, including the Lanzhou-Urumqi Railway and the Xi'an-
Lanzhou-Urumqi telecommunications fiber optical project. The
autonomous region has also become an important production base for
petroleum and cotton.
</P>
<P>
Economic progress has advanced the development of other causes
for Uygur people and people of other ethnic backgrounds. Now, some
310,000 out of 610,000 workers of ethnic backgrounds are "cadres"
or public servants.
</P>
<P>
Take education as an example. Students of Uygur background and
other ethnic nationalities make up 64.3 percent of the students
enrolled in Xinjiang universities.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 universities in other areas of the country have
opened classes for students of ethnic backgrounds from Xinjiang
since 1980, which has helped Xinjiang train more than 10,000
qualified personnel.

<HEADLINE> Russian Peacekeepers Determined to Enter Orahovac in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian First Deputy Foreign
Minister Alexander Avdeyev said Wednesday that the demonstrations
by ethnic Albanians near the town of Orahovac in Kosovo "will not
influence Russia's position on its peacekeepers' mandatory
presence in that district."
</P>
<P>
Russia is convinced, he said, that "the location of a Russian
contingent near Orahovac meets the interest of Russia and of the
post-conflict settlement in Kosovo," the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"We are well aware that the Albanians' continuing
demonstrations in protest against the location of Russian
peacekeepers in Orahovac are not spontaneous and are organized by
those who oppose our presence in Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the problems for which we were prepared,"
Avdeyev said.
</P>
<P>
The settlement of the situation concerning the Russian
peacekeepers "is fully within the competence of the KFOR command,"
he said, referring to the international peacekeeping force in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"As far as we know, the KFOR command is working on this problem,
" Avdeyev said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Yugoslav Tanjug news agency, ethnic Albanians
have encircled Kosovo's southwestern town of Orahovac over the
past two days in an attempt to halt the deployment of Russian
peacekeepers there.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency said the fighters of the so-called
Kosovo Liberation Army set up roadblocks and sentry posts along
the roads leading to the town.
</P>
<P>
The town is currently patrolled by Dutch peacekeepers who were
scheduled to be replaced by Russian peacekeepers.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's GDP Grow 4.1 Pct in 2nd Quarter of 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is now comfortably
out of  recession, having chalked up a remarkable gross domestic
product (GDP) growth of 4.1 percent in the second quarter of this
year after contracting by 1.3 percent in the first quarter of this
year and 7.5 percent for the whole of last year.
</P>
<P>
In declaring this Wednesday, Malaysian State Bank Governor Ali
Abul Hassan said the economy as a result grew by 1.4 percent in
the first six months of this year compared with a 4.2 percent
contraction in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Leading the second quarter growth was the manufacturing sector
which rebounded to increase strongly by 9.3 percent from minus 1.1
percent in the first quarter. This was driven mainly by sustained
strong external demand, especially for semi-conductors and
electronic components, and to a lesser extent, a pick-up in
domestic demand for transport equipment and construction-related
materials, he said.
</P>
<P>
For the third quarter of this year, the GDP figure could be
better but "we are sticking to the one percent growth forecast for
1999 and 5.0 percent for 2000," he told a press conference on the
second quarter's economic indicators here.
</P>
<P>
He described the growth as commendable for it was achieved
against a backdrop of price stability as measured by the Consumer
Price Index which fell further to 2.7 percent from 4.0 percent in
the first quarter and 5.7 percent in the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
Ali said that the government's pump-priming measures and the
much-criticized selective capital controls were pivotal in
providing the right environment in hauling the economy out of
recession.

<P>
Luanda, August 25 (xinhua) -- Angolan Commercial Ministry is
studying the feasibility of creating free zones in coastal areas,
Vice-minister Cruz Neto was quoted Wednesday by the Jornal de
Angola as saying.
</P>
<P>
Neto, who will leave here Wednesday for Mozambique and
Mauritius on a visit to free zones in the two countries, said the
project is aimed at promoting the agro-industrial development,
essentially in the productive areas of the south Huila Province
and plateau zones.
</P>
<P>
Due to the unstable political-military situation of the
country, it is impossible to implement the project of free zones
in the interior areas of the country, said Neto when explaining
the option for the coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
He said that according to the project, the interior areas would
 fundamentally depend on agro-industrial development while the
coastal areas have the priority in industry.
</P>
<P>
The project will permit the construction of more infrastructure
in the fields of energy, telecommunications, water and
transportations, said the vice-minister.
</P>
<P>
In free zones, a special customs regime will be established and
the customs cost will be cheap, as most of the products of the
zones will be exported, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan commercial delegation will stay in Mozambique for
six days, visiting free zones and studying advanced experience of
the reform of its commercial policy, according to Jornal de
Angola.

JAKARTA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's House of
Representatives (DPR) Wednesday passed a bill on
telecommunications in a bid to promote the development of domestic
telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
"With this new bill, we will have a stronger legal basis in
facing global change of telecommunications issues and responding
to the fast-growing telecommunications technology," Minister of

The new bill would end the monopoly right of state-owned
telecom companies, PT. Telecommunication Indonesia and PT.
Indosat, in providing telecommunication call service as stipulated
under a bill in 1989.
</P>
<P>
"The new bill will also give opportunities to private companies
or cooperatives in providing telecommunication network," the
minister said, adding that there would no longer be monopoly right
owned by the state companies.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1989 bill, PT. Telecom was the only provider of local
call service and long distance direct call service while PT.
Indosat provided overseas direct call service.

<HEADLINE> ADB to Help Enhance Philippine Non-Bank Financial Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
said Wednesday that it has agreed to grant a 2-million-U.S. dollar
technical assistance to help modernize Philippine non-bank
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
A press statement released here by the ADB said the technical
assistance is mainly aimed at strengthening the organization and
monitoring functions of the Philippine Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC).
</P>
<P>
The ADB's move also involves the effort to upgrade prudential
standards in this sector to international levels and to develop
the nation's money and debt markets, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Growth of the non-financial sector, which represents 15 percent
of total sector assets in the nation, has been stifled for a
number of reasons, including inadequate regulations and
insufficient capacity for monitoring and enforcing the rules, the
ADB said.
</P>
<P>
The Manila-based financial body said it will also help
establish better coordination between the SEC and the Philippine
Central Bank in regulatory oversight and market supervision.
</P>
<P>
The ADB held that the development of non-bank financial sector
is critical to enhance domestic resources mobilization and to
foster competition in the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
A number of countries have achieved savings growth outside the
banking system by developing such kind of non-bank financial
sector, the statement added.

<P>
NAIROBI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Over 100 Kenyan businessmen are
stranded in Somalia following the recent closure of the entire
Kenya-Somalia border.
</P>
<P>
Public servants in Kenya's North Eastern Province Tuesday were
required to compile a list of all Kenyans being stranded in
Somalia, according to Wednesday's Kenya Times.
</P>
<P>
Following the presidential directive on the immediate closure
of the border on August 22, "we effected the closure in total,
making it impossible for anyone to cross the border into Kenya,"
said chief public servant Maurice Makhanu in the province
neighboring somalia.
</P>
<P>
Makhanu said that the stranded Kenyans had gone to Somalia on
normal cross-border business, adding that at the time of the
border closure, they had not returned to the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Those whose relatives cannot be allowed to be back home have
recorded complaints at some police stations, according to sources
in the province.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi ordered last Sunday the
closure of the border with Somalia as a move to curb the rampant
smuggling of illegal firearms and other goods from the war-torn
Horn of Africa country.

<P>
BISHKEK, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
put forward a five-point proposal here Wednesday at the five-
nation summit of China, Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and
Tajikistan to strengthen cooperation on regional security and
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Main points of Jiang's proposal are:
</P>
<P>
-- Continue to consolidate cooperation on regional security,
peacefully settle disputes through consultations, prompt the
process of convening the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-
Building Measures in Asia, and achieve a nuclear-free zone in
Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
-- Continue to fight against destabilizing factors to regional
security, such as religious extremism, national separatism,
international terrorism and other cross-border criminal activities
in the region. Relevant functional departments of the five
countries should gradually establish an effective cooperation
mechanism in this regard.
</P>
<P>
-- Continue to promote economic cooperation and development in
the region. The five countries should make use of their respective
advantages and strong points to offset the other's weakness and,
through bilateral and multilateral channels, enhance the economic
and technological cooperation in various fields, especially in
fields of energy and high technology.
</P>
<P>
-- Continue to push forward the revival of the ancient "Silk
Road." Relevant countries should step up the construction of
railways and highways to establish a modernized transportation
network in the region at an earlier date.
</P>
<P>
-- Continue to increase consultations, dialogues and
coordination among the five nations on major international issues
and the affairs of the United Nations and to uphold international
justice and the justified rights and interests of peoples of all
countries.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Continue to Support Kashmir Freedom Struggle: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said here Wednesday that his country would continue to
provide "unflinching political and diplomatic support to the
Kashmiri freedom struggle."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Second Convention of Overseas Pakistanis, Sharif
said, "We will continue to lend our all out political, diplomatic
and moral support to Kashmiri people because they are waging a
just and legitimate struggle."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that the Kashmir dispute would be
resolved in line with the aspirations of the people of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Sharif noted that he had drawn the attention of the U.N.
secretary general over the unimplemented resolutions of the world
body over the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
"These resolutions clearly provide for the provision of right
of self-determination to the people of Kashmir," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said he had told U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan in a
meeting last year that "these resolutions were passed by the
United Nations and not by Pakistan and the United Nations should
play its role in the implementation of these resolutions."
</P>
<P>
He noted that some of the U.N. resolutions had been implemented
without any delay while some had been pending for the last 50
years.
</P>
<P>
"The world community should ask India why it had not
implemented these resolutions so far," said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that Pakistan had called for the
settlement of the Kashmir dispute either by the United Nations or
by third-party involvement.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan never intended to trigger an arms race in South Asia,
said Sharif, adding that "it is India that is trying to drag
Pakistan into arms race."
</P>
<P>
"The world should decide as to who is responsible for the arms
race (in South Asia)," he said. "Pakistan took all measures in
self defense."
</P>
<P>
Sharif also said that "had the Kashmir dispute been resolved,
there would have been no arms race in South Asia."

<HEADLINE> RCD Rebels' Pledge to Sign Agreement Praised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The pledge by Rebels of the
Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) based in Goma, eastern Congo,
to sign the Lusaka cease-fire agreement is pushing the peace
process forward.
</P>
<P>
Hope Kivengere, presidential press secretary, told Xinhua in a
telephone interview Wednesday morning:"Their agreement to sign the
pact is a good thing. It will push forward the peace process."
</P>
<P>
When asked about Uganda's response to the latest development of
the event, she said:"This is part of the process. They should
endorse the peace agreement."
</P>
<P>
The RCD-Goma announced Tuesday that it would sign the Lusaka
accord on August 31, a peace pact already inked by six African
countries involved in the war in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo on July 10.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the rebels made the decision after two days
of meeting and intensive mediation efforts by South African
Foreign Minister Nkosazana Zuma.
</P>
<P>
The two factions of the split RCD did not pen the pact due to
internal wrangles among leadership.
</P>
<P>
RCD-Goma leader Emile IIunga said that he would not honor the
pact if Wamba dia Wamba, leader of RCD-Kisangani, signed it.
</P>
<P>
The rebels' refusal to sign the pact has widely been regarded
as the biggest bottleneck hindering the peace process in the
Congo.
</P>
<P>
The RCD split into two opposing factions in mid-May. RCD-Goma
is backed by Rwanda while the RCD-Kisangani supported by Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Keeps Eyes on Commodity Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Department of
Trade and Industry (DTI) said Wednesday it is closely monitoring
the movement of prices of the commodity goods in the market in
order to protect the consumers' interests.
</P>
<P>
DTI Assistant Secretary Zenaida Maglaya said the move was in
response to published reports that prices of commodity products
will increase due to the price hike of petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
Among the products that are vulnerable to price movements are
the basic commodity goods like fish, rice, meat and vegetables
which are delivered to Manila from local provinces, she said.
</P>
<P>
Maglaya confirmed that no price movement has been observed yet
as a result of the oil price hike in the market.
</P>
<P>
However, she assured that those who will be caught overpricing
their products more than what is allowed in the price list of the
government will be penalized.
</P>
<P>
Maglaya said that her office has already dispatched its
personnel to keep a close watch on businessmen and entrepreneurs
who are taking advantage of the situation.
</P>
<P>
The DTI official warned that those caught violating the
government's price control law will face criminal sanctions which
could lead to permanent closure of their businesses.

<HEADLINE> Operation in Daghestan Enters Final Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev said Wednesday that the federal operation against Islamic
extremists in the Daghestan republic has entered "the final stage.
"
</P>
<P>
Federal troops have liberated the villages held by the
militants from Chechnya for two weeks, the Interfax news agency
quoted Sergeyev as saying in Bishkek, where he is accompanying
President Boris Yeltsin in a summit meeting of China, Russia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the areas are being "mopped up" and
demined, adding that "all movements of militants are monitored."
</P>
<P>
However, a new provocation is possible as the extremists have
altered their tactics to a partisan war, according to Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
Interfax reported Tuesday that the Islamic militants
infiltrating into the villages in the Daghestani district of
Botlikh two weeks ago have retreated to neighboring Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Around 1,000 militants have been reportedly killed since the
beginning of the armed conflict.

<HEADLINE> Hospitals Seethed With Quake Victims in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, August 25 (Xinhua) -- More than a week after the
August 17 killer earthquake in northwestern Turkey, people with
quake-related injuries were still flooding to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
In Istanbul, Turkey's largest city which straddles Europe and
Asia, alone, the number of people suffering from quake-related
diseases surpassed 4,100.
</P>
<P>
Quake survivors with injured heads, broken arms and legs
overflew the 120 private and 38 state hospitals in the
metropolis. Nearly half of the patients in Istanbul's hospitals
are suffering from bone fractures.
</P>
<P>
Some of them were sent here by ambulances or helicopters from
other quake-hit areas where public hospitals were demolished and
the makeshift field hospitals, set up by medical staff from
internal or foreign countries, did not have necessary facilities
to deal with some serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
In a number of state hospitals, the personnel had to go
without sleep for 40 hours or more.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people were treated for minor injuries and then
discharged.
</P>
<P>
Some of the survivors, who had been buried under rubble for
days and were rescued recently, had developed kidney problems due
to lack of water.
</P>
<P>
Medical conditions were tougher in other quake-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
In Adapazari, about 130 kilometers east of Istanbul, several
field hospitals were operating along with a public hospital which
was half-ruined in the quake but returned to partial functioning
lately.
</P>
<P>
In a field hospital by a busy intersection, a woman doctor said
she and her colleges, all volunteer medical personnel from
surrounding areas like Istanbul, Izmit, Bolu or Yalova, were
working here in clinic tents in groups of three persons. They
would be working for three-four days non-stop before being
replaced.
</P>
<P>
Due to limitations of medical facilities, some patients were
transferred to the nearby Israeli military field hospital which
was better equipped. Those patients who were beyond the treatment
were sent to Istanbul or the Turkish capital of Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Another doctor said he and his two colleges in a tent had
received over 70 patients since eight o'clock in the morning through
afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Border Closure Traps 100 Kenyans in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Over 100 Kenyan businessmen are
stranded in Somalia following the recent closure of the entire
Kenya-Somalia border.
</P>
<P>
Public servants in Kenya's North Eastern Province Tuesday were
required to compile a list of all Kenyans being stranded in
Somalia, according to Wednesday's Kenya Times.
</P>
<P>
Following the presidential directive on the immediate closure
of the border on August 22, "we effected the closure in total,
making it impossible for anyone to cross the border into Kenya,"
said chief public servant Maurice Makhanu in the province
neighboring somalia.
</P>
<P>
Makhanu said that the stranded Kenyans had gone to Somalia on
normal cross-border business, adding that at the time of the
border closure, they had not returned to the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Those whose relatives cannot be allowed to be back home have
recorded complaints at some police stations, according to sources
in the province.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi ordered last Sunday the
closure of the border with Somalia as a move to curb the rampant
smuggling of illegal firearms and other goods from the war-torn
Horn of Africa country.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Reform Pushes Ahead Scientific Development-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China has adopted a series of
science policies since its implementation of reform and opening-up
drive in the past 21 years and launched a number of scientific
development programs.
</P>
<P>
The National Conference on Technological Innovation, which
opened Monday, will work out new measures for encouraging
technological innovations and fostering more high-tech ventures.
</P>
<P>
The conference is expected to become another milestone in China
's history of science development.
</P>
<P>
Major government policies adopted and major science development
programs launched in the past 20 years include:
</P>
<P>
-- In March, 1978, the First National Science Conference was
held in Beijing during which Deng Xiaoping made it clear that "
science and technology constitute the productive forces." The
conference witnessed a turning point in China's scientific
development.
</P>
<P>
-- In 1982, China announced the strategic thinking of "economic
construction must rely on science and technology and scientific
research must be carried out according to the needs of economic
development."
</P>
<P>
-- In 1983, China began to launch the "National Plan for Key
Scientific and Technological Projects". The plan focused on
programs that would produce much economic profits and were badly
needed by society.
</P>
<P>
-- In March, 1985, the National Conference on Science and
Technology was convened and plans for the restructuring and reform
of the country's scientific research organs were drafted at the
conference.
</P>
<P>
-- In 1985, the State Council announced the launch of the "
Spark Program" aimed at providing advanced technologies to
township enterprises in the interests of rural economic
development.
</P>
<P>
-- In March,1986, four scientists proposed the initiation of "
Program 863", urging the government to concentrate the best part
of its research resources on developing high technologies. China
also decided to put the emphasis on seven hi-tech research fields.
</P>
<P>
-- In 1988, Deng Xiaoping further made it clear that "science
and technology constitute the primary productive forces."
</P>
<P>
-- In 1988, China began to implement the "Torch Program" aimed
at encouraging development of high-tech ventures and increasing
the proportion of the high-tech industry in China's GDP and
exports.

<HEADLINE> Over 1,000 Immigrants to Arrive in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 Jewish
immigrants are expected to arrive in Israel on Wednesday, the
highest number to arrive in one day in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, a flight chartered by the Jewish Agency will
arrive with 342 immigrants on board from Russia.
</P>
<P>
During the day, additional flights from the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) will carry 945 immigrants in all, about
800 of them from Russia.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic rise in immigration from Russia to Israel is
apparently the result of the severe economic crisis in Russia and
the wave of anti-Semitic incidents triggered by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Jewish Agency has been working in high gear
recently in a bid to bring many immigrants to Israel before the
Jewish new year next month.
</P>
<P>
In all, 16,439 immigrants have arrived in Israel from Russia
since the beginning of the year, 2,000 more than those who arrived
in Israel in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The number of immigrants from the CIS has reached 35,095 since
the beginning of the year, compared to 25,350 in the same period
of last year, up by 38 percent.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Detects Largest Drug Trafficking Syndicate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's anti-drug police have
detected the largest ever drug trafficking syndicate in the
country, local press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese anti-drug police have arrested 120 suspects in the
syndicate that had operated in 14 cities and provinces, according
to the Ministry of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
The arrested include police officers and civil servants.
</P>
<P>
About 30 of those arrested will be brought to court for trial
in early September, said a Ministry of Public Security source.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the bust followed the arrest of a courier
attempting to deliver two packages containing more than 400 grams
of heroin.
</P>
<P>
The alleged courier, Nguyen Van Chinh, was arrested in Nam Dinh
Town, 80 km south of Hanoi, and the police said the heroin was
contained in the school-bag of his eight-year-old niece. Chinh
was taking the little girl to school.
</P>
<P>
Acting on information supplied by Chinh, the detectives of
Vietnam's Police Anti-Drug Squad then swept on the alleged
narcotics syndicate.
</P>
<P>
One of those arrested has confessed that he has sold more than
272 kg of heroin and more than one ton of opium since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Le Minh Huong said that the police
confiscated 41,000 U.S. dollars, 80 million Vietnamese dong (more
than 5,700 U.S. dollars), 335 ounces of gold and 11 buildings
following the arrests.
</P>
<P>
A senior police officer said a number of northern provinces in
the country surprisingly turned out to be the transit points for
drugs from overseas before they are distributed to major cities
and abroad.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Teachers Union of Israel
has announced that its members will not open the school year on
September 1 unless it receives assurances by the end of the month
that the education budget will be left intact.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to lower state deficit, the Finance Ministry has
proposed to cut the Education Ministry's budget by 400 million
shekels (about 95 million U.S. dollars) as part of the overall
cuts planned for the 2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Yossi Sarid is trying to persuade teachers
to postpone any action until September 5, when the cabinet is
due to decide on proposed budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
But local daily Haaretz quoted Sarid as saying on Wednesday
that he was unable to guarantee that his ministry's budget would
escape unscathed.
</P>
<P>
Sarid, who has threatened to resign if the education budget is
trimmed, recently spoke with Prime Minister Ehud Barak to try to
persuade him not to cut the budget.
</P>
<P>
Barak refused to commit himself, despite the fact that
upgrading the country's education system was a major plank of his
campaign platform.
</P>
<P>
Sarid Tuesday met with officials of the Finance Ministry to
tell them that the education system is in dire straits, and will
be severely hurt by any additional cuts.
</P>
<P>
He said that he "is not interested in presiding over an
Education Ministry whose budget has been emasculated."

<HEADLINE> New Zealanders Getting Fatter: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand teenagers and
adults are getting fatter, according to a nearly 4-year survey
conducted by Otago University researchers for the NZ Ministry of
Health, which was released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The National Nutrition Survey, the biggest nutrition survey
ever done in New Zealand, has found that the average body weight
of New Zealanders has risen 3.2 kilograms between 1989 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
It shows that people in New Zealand are also more likely to be
obese, with 17 percent of people surveyed considered obese
compared with 11 percent in 1989. A further 35 percent of people
were considered overweight.
</P>
<P>
The findings worry local health professionals and nutritionists
 who fear the country is breeding a generation of fatties.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Associate Health Minister Tuariki Delamere said the
growth in obesity is a "future health problem of massive
proportions".
</P>
<P>
The ministry's food and nutrition advisory committee will
consider the results and give advice on ways to improve people's
eating habits, he said.

<P>
Months after her successful first run, Tian was selected as a
national model worker and chosen to present a silk banner to
Chairman Mao Zedong on behalf of all model workers from northeast
China provinces.
</P>
<P>
"I was so excited that I was all tears and could not say a
single word when standing before Chairman Mao," Tian recalled. "I
felt like I was in a dream and could hardly believe it was reality
until I pinched my hands and felt the pain."
</P>
<P>
Since becoming the nation's first female engineer, Tian's luck
has never faltered. She was later sent to study at a local
secondary school and then was recruited by the Tangshan Railway
Institute in 1952. After graduation, she was assigned to work as a
railway engineer with the railroad in Shenyang, the provincial
capital of Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
Tian's family life was another blessing in her sisters' eyes.
Unlike her sisters, who married men chosen by their parents, Tian
Guiying married an undergraduate her own age whom she met at
university.
</P>
<P>
"My eldest sister is a very capable woman, even more capable
than me," Tian Guiying said, "but I was younger and I did not miss
anything as a result of the founding of New China."
</P>
<P>
Tian Guiying retired in 1984 and became an active social worker.
She has worked as a fashion model, choir member, and voluntary
cleaning lady, and even participated in a national model contest
wearing clothes of her own design.
</P>
<P>
Among friends and family, she has the nickname "woman
politician" because of her enthusiasm for political affairs and
current events.
</P>
<P>
Including her husband's retirement pension, Tian is enjoying a
monthly income of more than 2,000 yuan (about 241 U.S. dollars). "
My experience is clear evidence of the sharp difference between
life in New China and that in the old society, which can well be
described as the difference between heaven and earth."

Editor's note: This year is the 50th anniversary of the People'
s Republic of China. Xinhua News Agency is releasing a series of
50 stories on Chinese men and women, young and old, to present a
picture of the changes that have taken place in China over the
past half century. These different people will describe their own
experiences and how they fit into the changes in the motherland.
This is the fourth article.
</P>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China's first female railroad
engineer said she had never imagined that her destiny would be so
closely linked to that of the People's Republic.
</P>
<P>
"The founding of New China has changed my life's path entirely,
" said 70-year-old Tian Guiying.
</P>
<P>
A fisherman's daughter from a poverty-stricken village near
Dalian, a coastal city in northeast China's Liaoning Province,
Tian had five older sisters and was seen as an unexpected burden
on her parents when she was born.
</P>
<P>
"Girls were deemed inferior in those times," Tian said,
recalling how she was ridiculed by her parents for breaking a
plate when washing the dishes.
</P>
<P>
Life was hard for Tian; she never wore new shoes or clothes
during childhood, and the ache of hunger was acute. Rough times
tempered the little girl, who traveled to Dalian to make her way
in 1945.
</P>
<P>
At 16, she became a worker at a local railway company. She
joined the trade union there and later became an underground
member of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
After the People's Republic of China was founded, the local
railroad company began recruiting female engineers. Tian applied
for the position, and after three months of training, was named
chief engineer over nine other female applicants.
</P>
<P>
At 6:00 am on March 8, 1950, Tian started the steam-driven
engine and eased the train away from the Dalian station.
</P>
<P>
The story of China's first lady train engineer spread fast
throughout the country, and Tian soon became a celebrity.

"We are hoping that by the end of August or September we will

Mate said Zambia should be commended for adopting a highly

implementation.
</P>

Among the resolution the board had agreed that any company
wishing to be listed on the stock exchange should have at least 25
percent of its shares in public hands.
</P>
<P>
During the harmonization of SADC rules workshop held in May in
Lusaka, the suggestion was that the minority share-holding portion
be increased from the current 10 percent to reduce manipulation by

<HEADLINE> Powerful Truck Bomb Explodes Near Afghan Taliban Leader's Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A truck loaded with explosive
materials exploded Tuesday night near the residence of the Taliban
supreme leader Mulla Omar in the south Afghan city of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
At least ten people including six Taliban soldiers and four
passers-by were killed in the powerful blast, a report by the
Afghan Islamic Press said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Kandahar, headquarters of the
Taliban militia, put the casualties at four.
</P>
<P>
The explosion, shortly after 10 p.m. local time Tuesday (1630
GMT), shattered windows and doors and sent frightened residents
scurrying for cover.
</P>
<P>
The truck was parked just three houses away from Omar's home,
and it went off when the Taliban tried to remove it, a report from
Kabul quoted Taliban spokesman Abdul Muttamin as saying in
Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Omar was not at home at the time of
explosion. The extent of the damage is not clear.
</P>
<P>
So far, no one took responsibility for the explosion. And the
Taliban did not accuse any body or any country, saying that an
investigation was under way.
</P>
<P>
Taliban officials said that first they wanted to know how this
truck loaded with explosive materials could have reached near
Omar's residence, and who was the driver.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban said that it was not a missile or rocket attack.
They said that the truck was parked in the evening by a driver who
informed guards that the engine had developed some problem.
</P>
<P>
Later the driver left and soon the truck exploded, the Taliban
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports reaching here from Kandahar said that scores of
people were feared dead as the Taliban headquarters came under
what was presumed a U.S. missile attack.
</P>
<P>
However, the White House denied reports Tuesday it was involved
in a huge explosion in Kandahar, saying "there is no truth at all
to any report of U.S. government involvement."
</P>
<P>
The blast that rocked Kandahar Tuesday night led the panicky
inhabitants to believe that the United States had launched the
much-feared air strikes against Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden's
bases.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Ration Power Supply In September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will start
power rationing in the country from September 1 due to the poor
long rains between March and June which left water levels low in
Kenya's three main energy reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
Energy Minister Francis Masakhalia Tuesday announced the plan,
saying the cuts, of either four or five hours each, will affect
480,000 customers countrywide.
</P>
<P>
Major newspapers Wednesday quoted the minister as saying the
cuts are being made because there had been insufficient rain to
fill the reservoirs used in producing hydro-electric power.
</P>
<P>
According to Kenya Power Company, the country's current peak
demand stands at 760 megawatts against available capacity of
676.5 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister promised that essential services and
installations would not suffer from the new cuts. They include
hospitals, schools, military sites and vital industries like oil
refineries.
</P>
<P>
The supply is expected to improve toward the end of next month
when the new 75-megawatt Kipevu diesel power plant is fully
commissioned, said the Kenya Power Company.
</P>
<P>
The supply situation, the company said, would be further
improved at the end of October when repairs will be completed to
the 43-megawatt power plant which has been out of commission
following a mechanical breakdown.

<HEADLINE> Major Memorial to Mark 50th Founding Anniversary of New China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin has
inscribed the name for China's newly-completed 21st Century Altar,
a huge memorial in Beijing to commemorate the 50th anniversary of
the founding of the People's Republic and to greet the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
Located to the west of the Chang'an Avenue and the Military
Museum on the north side of Fuxinglu Road, the 4.5-hectare area
incorporates an elegant dome-shaped structure, which is approached
along a bronze clad walkway through a landscaped square. Within
the building sturucture is a major meeting hall and the memorial
site is dotted with special statues and sculptures.
</P>
<P>
Similar to the famous Temple of Heaven in southeastern Beijing,
but fashioned in a more modern style, the plaza within the area
will be used mainly for political gatherings.
</P>
<P>
Construction work on the 21st Century Altar began in November
1998, and all the civil engineering projects involved were
completed last month. And carved in a stone tablet in front of the
main building structure is the official title awarded by President
Jiang Zemin who will officially open the memorial during the
celebrations to mark October 1st.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally altars in such settings were structures where the
imperial emperors offered sacrifices to heaven. The Temple of
Heaven is now a world-acclaimed historical monument as well as a
tourist site that has been listed under the State protection.

<HEADLINE> Northern Tibet Grows Vegetables </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region used
to have to get vegetables from other parts of China, but last June
it began experimenting with vegetable growing in its northern
region to meet local demand.
</P>
<P>
In Amdo County of Nagqu Prefecture, which is 5,300 meters above
sea level, spinach, pumpkins, potatoes and other vegetables are
now growing well in greenhouses which cover an area of 2,000 sq.m,
covered by plastic sheets to protect the vegetables from hail and
frost.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the county grew no vegetables, since that was
considered impossible to do on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, known as
the "roof of the world." Mutton and beef were the major food of
the local herdsmen.
</P>
<P>
According to a local senior official, the county plans to
expand its vegetable-growing area from the present 2,000 sq.m to
15,000 sq.m next year. By then, the vegetable output is expected
to reach 50,000 kg.
</P>
<P>
Several other counties in northern Tibet, including Baqen and
Sog, have also begun growing vegetables on a trial basis.

<P>
LUSAKA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- COMESA Clearing House is being
restructured to provide three services including political risk
cover to trade and investment, according to Financial Mail.
</P>
<P>
The other tasks include ensuring the fast payment facility
which will ensure security and speedy payments within the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) without recourse
to letters of credit while a swift facility will ensure safe and
speedy payments, said Sindiso Ngwenya, acting secretary general of
the COMESA.
</P>
<P>
On the Preferential Trade Areas (PTA) Re-Insurance Company
(ZEP-RE), the weekly newspaper quoted Ngwenya as saying that the
company is now transacting business in 19 COMESA member countries
and is playing a vital role of offering training and improving
technical capacity of insurance companies of the region.
</P>
<P>
This vital role is also through provision of protection,
stability, and capacity to many emerging insurance companies whose
risk bearing and retention capacity is very low, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said ZEP-RE has strengthened the capacity and solvency of
insurance industry in the region and enhance the competitiveness
of domestic insurance firms with foreign insurers.

<HEADLINE> China to Rectify Fees for Overseas-funded Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China will take further steps to
stop the unauthorized charging of fees from overseas-funded
enterprises in a move to improve the investment environment and
make the best use of foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission and the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation urged localities in a
recent notice to administer severe punishment to those held
responsible for any unauthorized fee collections from overseas-
funded businesses.
</P>
<P>
Illegal fee-charging items mainly include raising fee-charging
standards and expanding fee charging scope at random, and fee
charging against the state's preferential policies, the notice
said.
</P>
<P>
Any fee-charging activities by government departments,
institutions and agents since 1998 will be examined, and some
major cases may be traced back earlier, the two departments said.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-backed enterprises are encouraged to tell the truth
about the fees they have been charged and any illegal fee-charging
items. The notice also urges these firms to refuse to pay illegal
fees and to resort to the law.
</P>
<P>
Local pricing departments have been asked to set up a system
for reports and legal actions, and to educate people on fee-
charging policies and regulations through the media.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Struggling to Shrug off FIVB World Grand Prix Curse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YUXI, southwestern Yunnan Province, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Will
a tiny Chinese town become the land of fortune to break a
mysterious spell that has haunted the Brazilian women
volleyballers for seven years?
</P>
<P>
It is the biggest question to be answered at the World Women's
Volleyball Grand Prix Finals to be staged in Yuxi here this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The defending champions are making their last bet within this
century to get rid of the curse, which has prevented them from
winning the title in odd years since it was launched by the
Federation International De Volleyball (FIVB) in 1992.
</P>
<P>
After scoring a clean 6-0 record during the elimination phase
of the FIVB World Grand Prix in the last two weekends, the
Brazilians are making their final preparations here to claim the
title for the fourth time.
</P>
<P>
Regularly winning every even years (1994/96/98), Brazil never
succeeded in retaining its honor the following years. But head
coach Bernardo Rezende and his players vowed to gear up to shake
off the curse circle no later than the end of this millennium.
</P>
<P>
It seems that the South Americans are getting closer to their
target this time since the World Championships, Olympic and World
Cup winners Cuba was unexpectedly edged out of the Finals earlier
due to their poor performance in the elimination phase matches.
</P>
<P>
Before defending their crown in the grand finale here on August
29, Brazil must overcome Italy in the semifinal one day earlier,
while the local Chinese team will face off last year's World
Championships bronze medalist Russia.
</P>
<P>
Since taking over of the Chinese women's team from his
predecessor Lang Ping, head coach Hu Jin has been under great
pressure to keep the team among the tops of the world volleyball.
</P>
<P>
Lang Ping, the 1997 FIVB best coach, and the only woman to be
granted such an honor by FIVB in history, returned to China from
the United States in 1995, at a extremely critical moment after
the former five times world title holders Chinese team plunged
into chaos.
</P>
<P>
Under her guidance, the Chinese team finished second both at
Atlanta Olympics in 1996 and World Championships in Japan last
year. But Lang quit in March citing reasons of health.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, Lang's long time friend Angiolino Frigoni,
the head coach of the newcomers Italy, is helping his team to make
great leaps from time to time.
</P>
<P>
Former assistant coach to the triumphant Italian men's team
from 1989 to 1996, Frigoni brought his girls to a historic fifth
place at last year's World Championships in Japan and made its
first appearance in World Grand Prix finals this year. They beat
both the Netherlands and China in Macao, and defeated South Korea
in Manila during the elimination phase.
</P>
<P>
The one million U.S. dollars World Volleyball Grand Prix is the
most expensive event ever organized by FIVB in a bid to maintain
volleyball as a major sport into next millennium.
</P>
<P>
Cha Dalin, Deputy Mayor of Yuxi, said earlier that: "Yuxi has
contributed 400,000 U.S. dollars to bring the finals to this tiny
town, known for its honorable citizen Nie Er, the composer of
China's national anthem."
</P>
<P>
The 370,000 US dollars will go to the four teams as prize money
while the remaining 30,000 dollars will be claimed by the best
players at the end of the competition.

<HEADLINE> Eichmann's Son to be Denied Father's Diary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Attorney General
Elyakim Rubinstein will apparently reject the request by Dieter
Eichmann, son of executed Nazi criminal Adolph Eichmann, to hand
over the diaries written by his father.
</P>
<P>
Eichmann wrote a 1,200-page manuscript in his jail cell during
his trial in Israel, local daily Haaretz reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein is convinced that Eichmann cannot be considered an
ordinary criminal and that it is inconceivable that conventional
property laws should be applied to the memoir.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein feels that the manuscript should be discussed in
light of far broader considerations, taking into account the
historic dimensions of the crimes against humanity for which
Eichmann was convicted.
</P>
<P>
Eichmann was hanged in Jerusalem in 1962 for directing the
Nazi extermination of Europe's Jews.
</P>
<P>
The memoir has been locked in Israel's state archives ever
since, and only a few selected historians have been allowed to
read excerpts from the text.
</P>
<P>
Eichmann's son is now demanding that Israel hand over the
memoir to him.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein is currently consulting on the matter with former
chief of justice Moshe Landau, who presided over the court during
the Eichmann trial, and with retired Supreme Court justice
Gavriel Bach, who was assistant to the late Gideon Hauser, the
man who prosecuted Eichmann.
</P>
<P>
At the first meeting Rubinstein held on the issue on August 9,
it was decided that the memoir would be handed over in full to
German scholars or to a German research institute for study and
annotation.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein plans to convene another meeting on the issue
soon.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese TV Station to Face Punishment After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese leading television
network LBCI is to face a three-day shutdown after it covered a
news conference featuring Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy in
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
After a three-hour emergency meeting on Tuesday, Lebanon's
National Audivisual Media Council unanimously agreed that the
station's local broadcasting be suspended for three days and
satellite transmission interrupted for 24 hours, the Daily Star
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But, the council's recommendations have yet to be endorsed by
Information Minister Anwar Khalil.
</P>
<P>
Nasser Qandil, the council's president, said the LBCI allowed
its news crew to film a news conference held by the Israeli
foreign minister, thus violating the boycott against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is technically at war with Israel which has occupied
part of south Lebanon since 1978 and set up a self-declared
security zone in the south to protect its north from cross-border
attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government forbids its citizens to make any
contact with the Jewish state. Otherwise, they will be given the
harsh punishment, including death sentence.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a reporter of LBCI's Jordan branch attended the
inauguration of a new bridge that links Jordan and Israel across
the Jordan River.
</P>
<P>
The bridge was officially re-opened by Levy and his Jordanian
counterpart Abdel al-Khatib.
</P>
<P>
When Levy addressed the media, somebody told him that a
Lebanese reporter was present, prompting him to call for peace
with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
LBCI has announced in its first statement that it intended to
take the disciplinary action against the head of its office in
Amman.
</P>
<P>
But after the council made the punishment decision, the
station said "it will not be responsible for the behavior of a
correspondent or photographer which took place without LBCI's
prior consent."

<HEADLINE> UAE Takes Steps to Reduce Traffic Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) is working on a plan to initiate long-term measures to
drastically reduce the high rate of deaths in traffic accidents
in the country, the Khaleej Times daily reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to reduce the traffic accident deaths to 2 percent by
the year 2010. The high percentage of deaths on the roads has to
be reduced considerably over the coming years," said Abdul Karim
Al Zarouni, director of the Curative Medicine Department at the
Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are to be made to further strengthen the Emergency
Medical Services (EMS) to ensure that ambulances reach accident
spots in five minutes in cities and 15 minutes in outlying areas,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
A plan was being made to set up a unified department for the
EMS to cover all cities and highways in the country, which has one
of the world's highest rates of road accidents and casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry also planned to form a national committee
consisting of representatives from police organizations,
municipalities, health and educational institutions, social and
community associations to launch road security awareness programs.
</P>
<P>
Noting that road accidents would constitute one of the biggest
challenges to the health care sector in the next century, the
official said road accidents claimed 631 lives and injured 9,629
people in the country last year.
</P>
<P>
According to a World Bank report, the UAE loses about 378
million U.S. dollars each year to road accidents, the second
highest in the Gulf region after Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows New Zealand Companies' Lack of Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Seven out of 10 New Zealand
companies are performing so poorly that their profits fail to
cover the true cost of their capital, according to the latest
study by Australia-New Zealand Bank (ANZ).
</P>
<P>
Last year operating profits after tax fell 6.5 billion NZ
dollars (3.4 billion U.S. dollars) short of the cost of capital
for the under-performers among 300 listed and private companies
reviewed by ANZ.
</P>
<P>
Only a handful of companies generated significant profits
above the benchmark. The total for that small group was 800
million NZ dollars (424 million U.S. dollars) last year, with
Telecom, New Zealand's biggest listed company, as the best
performer, contributing 430 million NZ dollars (228 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
As a group, the NZSE-40 companies excluding Telecom have
destroyed 15 billion NZ dollars (7.95 billion U.S. dollars) of
value in the past eight years. In contrast, Telecom has produced
two billion NZ dollars (1.06 billion U.S. dollars) of economic
value added.
</P>
<P>
"Poor management was to blame. Failing to take into account the
 true cost of capital meant inefficient decisions were made about
a firm's assets," the study quoted an economist as saying.

<P>
HONG KONG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The TransAsia '99 conference
opened Wednesday in Hong Kong, drawing high-level speakers from
over 40 prominent companies around the world.
</P>
<P>
The speakers will talk about best practice in logistics,
competition strategy, technology and supply chain management.
</P>
<P>
The forum is aimed at opening up new forms of cooperation on
the global and regional basis.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that TransAsia '99 pan-regional emphasis and
total business focus will establish it as Asia's premier annual
logistic event," an organizer for the Georgia Freight Bureau, said
at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Robert Jervis, managing director of IIR Exhibitions, said Hong
Kong was selected as the venue for the show as it is easily
accessible and is the premier gateway and the world's eighth
largest trading economy in its own right.
</P>
<P>
"Whilst Asia's economic crisis may not be over, long-term
prospects for intra-Asian trade are excellent, and efficient
logistics and supply chain management will become critical," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Issues to be addressed include how Hong Kong will renew its
export drive and competitive advantage and how to build a supply
chain infrastructure for world-wide trade.
</P>
<P>
Other major topics will be how to use Internet-based
technologies and electronic commerce to improve business
performance and how to care for temperature sensitive cargoes.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition is also being staged during the forum. Exhibitors
range from national and international purchasers, shippers,
manufacturers, the third party logistics providers, government
organizations, trade delegations, trade facilitators and banks to
logistics consultants.
</P>
<P>
Of the exhibitors, two were Chinese companies, the China
Railway Container Transport Center and the Qingdao Harbor
Container Corporation, the biggest in China.
</P>
<P>
"We are here to show the world our strength and to seek
cooperation as we have a handling capacity of total 1,000 million
tons of various kinds of cargoes including more than 1.5 million
containers," said Chang Dechuan, director of Qingdao Port
Authority.

<HEADLINE> HAI to Set up Relief Camp for Turkish Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Human Appeal International
(HAI), a relief organization based in the United Arab Emirates
(UAE), will set up a relief camp in western Turkey that was struck
by a strong earthquake last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The organization will specify a location in the quake-stricken
areas to assist the earthquake victims and provide them mainly
with medicine, food, clothes, blankets and tents, Rahma Al Shamsi,
an official of HAI, was quoted by Khaleej Times daily on Wednesday
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We need to secure a shelter for the homeless who will be
vulnerable to many diseases like cholera and typhoid," Shamsi
said.
</P>
<P>
Following a recent visit to Turkey, the official described the
situation there as very bad. The quake has left tens of thousands
of residents without homes or amenities to meet their basic needs.
</P>
<P>
"Many small villages have not received any relief until now
and we feel the need to send relief to these areas as soon as
possible," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the quake struck Turkey, HAI sent its first aid of
50,000 U.S. dollars to the country to buy blankets for the people
who were living in the open, suffering from the harsh weather
conditions and from hunger.
</P>
<P>
Shamsi called on well-wishers to contribute to the relief
program.
</P>
<P>
Until now the UAE has sent at least three planeloads of tents,
blankets and other relief supplies to Turkey. A further four
flights carrying emergency aid are expected to leave the country
shortly.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Railway between Addis Ababa,
the capital of Ethiopia, and the Red Sea Port city of Djibouti has
resumed after a three-day interruption due to a terrorist blast.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopia Railway Corporation confirmed Tuesday that two
engines had left Dire Dawa, the second largest city in Ethiopia,
for Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
A train with some 250 passengers going to Djibouti from Addis
Ababa was derailed by a terrorist bomb one hour after the train
left Dire Dawa on Saturday, injuring the train's driver and his
assistant.
</P>
<P>
No people has claimed responsibility for the incident.
</P>
<P>
The blast halted traffic on the single-track line which carries
much of Ethiopia's fuel imports.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources disclosed that three devices were placed on
the track, but only one exploded.
</P>
<P>
The police and security guards have stepped up with more
patroling on the railway line to check other possible attacks,
they said.

<HEADLINE> Pyongyang Slams Israel for Selling Missiles to South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Pyongyang has accused Israel
of exporting missiles to South Korea and denounced the United
States and South Korea for trying to "strangle" the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea, the official Korean Central News
Agency quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that according to reports by Israeli
newspapers, the Israeli authorities have agreed to provide air-to-
surface missiles worth 100 million US dollars to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which has frequently asked Pyongyang to stop exporting
missiles to the Middle East, now has no rights at all to make
remarks on Pyongyang's missile issue, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, U.S. arms manufacturers were directly involved in
producing the missiles. This means that the United States and
South Korea have stepped up their efforts to "strangle" the DPRK
by beefing up their military power in the peninsula and plotting
military provocation on Pyongyang, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman demanded the U.S. and South Korea immediately
stop deploying new military equipment in the Korean peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Russian Presidents Confer in Bishkek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BISHKEK, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and Russian President Boris Yeltsin held an hour-long talk during
breakfast Wednesday in the capital city of Kyrgyzstan, just before
the summit meeting between China, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Kazakhstan
and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who arrived here Tuesday night, described the Russia-
China relationship as "strong" and "powerful." He said the two
countries will increase cooperation in trade and other areas to
new levels.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president said he is looking forward to visiting
China later this year to exchange views more extensively with
Jiang, who said he is also looking forward to that meeting.
</P>
<P>
Since the five-nation summit in Shanghai in 1996, the five
countries have done tremendous works, Yeltsin said, adding that as
a result, they have reached a consensus on border issues, scored
progress in a border demarcation survey, stepped up measures in
building up mutual trust, withdrawn their troops from borders and
established good political relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told Yeltsin that he is satisfied with the fast-
developing Sino-Russian relations since he met him at the first
informal meeting in Moscow last November, adding the two countries
have increased common grounds and coordination on international
issues.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to Russia in February this year
injected new vitality in bilateral relations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"China is willing to make joint efforts together with the
Russian side to constantly expand the relations of strategic
partnership between the two," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said China values the summit meeting,
because the five participating countries constitute a vast land
proportion of the world, and stronger cooperation among them will
benefit their people and help promote economic development in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also exchanged views on bilateral trade,
changes in the international situation since the Kosovo crisis,
and other issues of mutual interest.

<HEADLINE> Four Killed, Scores Injured in Blast in Kandahar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 25 (Xinhua) -- At least four people were
killed and scores of others injured in a car bomb blast overnight
in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar, the Taliban headquarters,
a Taliban official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jahangeer Wall, a Taliban official for information in the city,
told Xinhua Wednesday morning that the bomb was placed in a motor
car and it went off around 10:00 p.m. Tuesday night outside a
guest house near the residence of Taliban supreme leader Mulla
Omar.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban official put the number of dead at four, and said
that the Taliban authorities did not accuse any body or any
country.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the four killed were passers-by. An
investigation into the bomb blast was under way, he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports reaching here from Kandahar said that scores of
people were feared dead as the Taliban headquarters came under
what was presumed a heavy U.S. missile attack.
</P>
<P>
However, the White House has denied reports Tuesday it was
involved in a huge explosion in Kandahar, saying "there is no
truth at all to any report of U.S. government involvement."
</P>
<P>
The blast that rocked Kandahar Tuesday night led the panicky
inhabitants to believe that the United States had launched the
much-feared air strikes against Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden's
bases.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Promote Bond Market Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Bond issuers and investors
have been urged to seize the opportunity to take advantage of the
bond market in Malaysia as part of the collective effort to
develop the market and facilitate the sustainable growth of the
economy in the longer-term.
</P>
<P>
"The potential of growth of the market is enormous given the
low bond to gross domestic product (GDP) and high savings to GDP
ratio," Malaysia's Second Finance Minister Mustapa Mohamed said
Wednesday at a conference on "Bond Market in Malaysia" here.
</P>
<P>
Among the issues the government is studying is developing an
active secondary bond market in government securities to enable it
to play a role in pricing credit risks, he said in an opening
speech read out by Deputy Finance Minister Wong See Wah at the
conference.
</P>
<P>
The government believes that the ringgit bond market is poised
for rapid growth, given the current momentum of growth and the
return of stability to the financial markets, Mustapa said.
</P>
<P>
Bond issuance on the local bond market represented 54 percent
of the GDP as at the end of 1997 as compared to 90 percent in
developed countries.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Tribunal Delegation Arrives in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A five-member U.N. legal
delegation arrived here Wednesday to confer with the Cambodian
government on international involvement in any trial of Khmer
Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, led by United Nations Assistant
Secretary-General for Legal Affairs Ralph Zacklin, also includes
Senior Legal Officer Daphna Shraga, Political Affairs Officer
Jonathan Prentice, Expert Doninique Coujard and Consultant David
Ashley.
</P>
<P>
Zacklin told reporters at the airport that "the purpose of the
visit is to discuss with the Government of Cambodia the possible
establishment of a mixed tribunal that would look into the
question of trials of the Khmer Rouge."
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to discuss all issues with the Cambodian
authorities here. And we have come with some texts that we intend
to discuss with them and to consult with them," said Zacklin.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen last week rejected a draft
U.N. plan that called for a majority of international judges on
the tribunal, arguing that any trial of Khmer Rouge leaders should
be controlled by the Cambodian courts.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the question, Zacklin said "I am always
optimistic at the beginning of a mission on this kind."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. delegation is scheduled to meet over the next few days
with ambassadors and government officials as well as a nine-member
government committee led by Minister of Cabinet Sok An. The team
was appointed by Prime Minister Hun Sen for discussion with the
U.N. legal team on the establishment of the mixed tribunal.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Hongkong Post has set new
and higher pledges for customer service for the coming year as
part of its ongoing commitment to service excellence, said acting
Postmaster General Allan Chiang Yam-wang Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He noted Hongkong Post's service performance in 1998/99
achieved or even exceeded the targets in most of its pledges.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, Hongkong Post has exceeded its target of 98
percent and achieved 98.8 percent in next day delivery of local
mail, which is one of the most difficult targets to meet.
</P>
<P>
"By introducing productivity improvement measures such as
overnight operations at our major sorting centers and evening mail
collection from street posting boxes, we are able to further
improve our performance in next day delivery of local mail," said
Chiang.
</P>
<P>
According to the annual public perception survey conducted in
March 1999 by an independent consultant, some 95 percent, 97
percent and 96 percent of customers from the general public,
business and philately groups respectively are satisfied or very
satisfied with Hongkong Post's services.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the Hongkong Post will extend the installation
of large letter posting boxes to more locations and extend
Internet mail tracking inquiry for parcels in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
The new e-Cert will also be ready by the end of 1999 to support
the electronic commerce activities of Hong Kong, he added.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Suffering From Petroleum Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ulan Bator, August 25 (Xinhua) -- For more than a month,
Mongolia has suffered a petroleum shortage, with transportation
and production being the most affected.
</P>
<P>
A fourth of Mongolia's counties have run out of petroleum. In
the capital Ulan Bator, fuel is available for only the police,
medical units, the transportation sector, government offices and
diplomatic missions in limited amounts. In provincial capitals,
only medical units and the police are available to access small
amounts of fuel.
</P>
<P>
The crisis has made travel inconvenient, prices of food,
merchandise and other daily necessities higher, and the autumn
harvest difficult.
</P>
<P>
The fuel shortage is blamed on a recent increase in crude oil
prices on the world market, and a decline in exports from Russia,
which supplies the majority of the 400,000 tons of gasoline
consumed by Mongolia each year.
</P>
<P>
Russian suppliers complain that Mongolian importers are behind
in payment. In addition, Moscow is currently promoting the export
of crude while restricting oil products.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia has asked Moscow to guarantee the gasoline provision
and has also sought to buy fuel from China in order to overcome
the current energy crisis.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Russia increased its oil supply to Mongolia but the
amount was far from meeting the country's needs. According to
Mongolian government officials, the petrol shortage, which started
in late July and worsened in August, will continue for a time.

<HEADLINE> Two dead, Scores injured in blast in Taliban Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 25 (Xinhua) -- At least two people were
killed and scores of others injured overnight in a major explosion
which rocked the southern Afghan city of Kandahar, the Taliban
headquarters, independent sources confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports reaching here from Kandahar said that scores of
people were feared dead as the Taliban headquarters came under
what was presumed a heavy U.S. missile attack.
</P>
<P>
However, the White House has denied reports Tuesday it was
involved in a huge explosion in Kandahar, saying "there is no
truth at all to any report of U.S. government involvement."
</P>
<P>
Until now, the cause of the blast was still unknown. The
Kandahar administration, meanwhile, said that the exact number of
casualties was hard to assess, given the chaotic situation
blanketing the city.
</P>
<P>
The blast that rocked Kandahar at around 10:45 p.m. led the
panicky inhabitants to believe that the United States had launched
the much-feared air strikes against Saudi dissident Osama bin
Laden's bases.

<HEADLINE> S.Lanka to Launch Pilot Nutrition Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government will
launch a pilot program to provide nutritious milk biscuits for
students in four malnutrition affected districts, the Presidential
Secretariat said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
From September 1, the government will spend 70 million rupees
(1 million U.S. dollars) to offer biscuits for more than 60,000
grade-one students in the districts of Badulla, Moneragala,
Hambantota and Ratnapura, the secretariat said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Each student will receive a nutritious milk biscuit of 35 grams
containing a nutritive value of 200 milliliters of milk, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
The program is being introduced following the recommendations
of a Presidential Committee on Nutritional Policy.
</P>
<P>
A study conducted by the committee showed that more than 25
percent of pre-school children in 12 out of 24 districts in Sri
Lanka are facing severe malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medicine has done a
baseline survey, which will be of use when evaluating the success
of the program after a six-month period, said the release.
</P>
<P>
School attendance, class room attentiveness and acceptance by
children and parental support, are some of the indirect indicators
that will be used in the evaluation.
</P>
<P>
The program is expected to extend to other districts after
evaluating its feasibility.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Hosts Regional Meeting on Tuberculosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A regional meeting on
tuberculosis (TB) is being held here to find ways and means to
develop strategies and plans for combating the infectious disease
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting is being attended by delegates of 9
Southeast and South Asian countries -- Thailand, India,
Bangladesh, Bhutan, Indonesia, the Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka and
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which began Tuesday, is addressing the "Stop TB"
initiative and identifying key opportunities and challenges faced
at the national level in combating TB.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is also aimed at developing a consensus on possible
strategies and promoting the "Stop TB" initiative so as to
accelerate the expansion of Direct Observation Treatment Strategy
(DOTS).
</P>
<P>
In his opening address at the meeting Tuesday, Myanmar Health
Minister Major-General Ket Sein said Myanmar has been implementing
the DOTS since 1995 and its national TB program has been carried
out in 168 townships out of 324, covering 65 percent of the total
population.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is striving to achieve the WHO targets
of ensuring 70 percent case detection and 85 percent cure rate in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
To meet the targets, Myanmar is working in collaboration with
national and international agencies, he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is a preliminary one for the Health Ministers'
Meeting on TB control in the region scheduled for March 2000 in
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
TB, a leading cause of mortality among infectious diseases,
continues to remain as a major public health problem in the
region which accounts for 40 percent of the global burden of TB.
The control of the disease is now further complicated by the
rapidly spreading HIV and the emergence of drug-resistant TB.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Encourage Domestic Savings and Deposits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government is
taking measures to encourage domestic savings and deposits by
designing a Deposit Guarantee Decree.
</P>
<P>
The State Bank of Vietnam has drafted the decree that should
make it safe to deposit money with Vietnam's credit institutions,
Vietnam News reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decree is designed to ensure that savings and deposits are
guaranteed by the State of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
An official of the State Bank of Vietnam said that the drafted
decree, if endorsed by the government, will become the legal
platform for a state-owned deposits and savings guarantee company
which will protect depositors if financial institutions fall into
the "red."
</P>
<P>
All banking and credit institutions of the country would be
requested to join the guarantee service and publicly announce
their participation.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a credit-guarantee organization will also
help prevent a "chain-collapse" once a commercial bank or credit
fund goes bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's bankers are hoping that the a credit guarantee
company will not only improve the reliability of banking but also
persuade potential depositors to lodge their idle money with them.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1980s, there was a chain-crash of credit funds in
the country causing losses of thousands of billion Vietnamese dong
(hundreds of million U.S. dollars) by a majority of the
population.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Credit Law governing credit institutions went into
effect on October 1, 1998. One of its major purposes was the
protection of depositors.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government has been introducing tighter measures
to enforce it.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Sports Council Urged to Improve Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's dismal performance
at the recently concluded Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Brunei
Darussalam has left the country's sporting figures calling for
reform in athletic development.
</P>
<P>
"Scouting through sports development and training centers
should be more heeded. In this case, we have to gear up a team-up
with the Education and Culture Department," Sports expert
Mangombar Ferdinand Siregar said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia could only grab as many as 44 gold medals in Brunei,
losing the championship trophy to Thailand. And what left the
squad in even more pain was that it was overtaken by Malaysia in
the standings for the first time since when Indonesia joined the
Southeast Asian biennial games.
</P>
<P>
While warning against blaming an individual figure for the loss,
Siregar said the lowly result should prompt the National Sports
Council (KONI) to upgrade the quality of human resources in the
sports federations.
</P>
<P>
"The low quality of the human resources should be worked out
given the speedy improvement made by our rivals," he said, adding
that a solution to financial matters should also be prioritized.
</P>
<P>
Siregar said the three-month training session prior to the
Games was held by KONI to improve the skill and condition of
athletes.
</P>
<P>
"But each sports organization should have prepared them long
before the athletes were called to join the centralized training
program. We have problems establishing a conducive situation for a
continuous training program in any sport due to the problems in
the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we compare our athletes' performances two weeks ago with
athletes from Thailand and Malaysia, I believe the sports
community in the country must work harder to be able to challenge
our rivals. Ideally, each sports organization must have a
permanent budget to stage the continuous and integrated athlete
development programs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chef de mission for the SEA Games Mochammad Hindarto called on
each sports organization to reveal their problems.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.N., Indonesia Disagree Over Ballot Observers in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and the United Nations
Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) are at odds over the presence of a
number of local poll observers in Dili, capital of East Timor,
ahead of the August 30 self-determination vote, reports reaching
here Wednesday from Dili said.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the tension, some 400 members of 24 Indonesian
organizations who arrived Dili on Monday have threatened to occupy
the UNAMET headquarters if their applications for accreditation to
monitor the ballot are rejected.
</P>
<P>
UNAMET chief Ian Martin on Tuesday refused to comment on the
threat, pledging only to remain neutral in organizing the ballot.
</P>
<P>
UNAMET spokesman David Wimhurst said in Dili Tuesday the
Indonesian observers were welcome to apply for accreditation but
their number would be kept to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian observers including those from the ruling Golkar
party warned that "If UNAMET (maintain) its stance we will
demonstrate and occupy the UNAMET headquarters."
</P>
<P>
The reports said UNAMWET has accredited 1,300 observers, with
100 of them representing the Indonesian and Portuguese
governments. However, the mission refused to authorize 370
observers who claimed to represent Indonesian non-governmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Indonesian Task Force for the Implementation of
the Autonomy ballot in East Timor (P3TT) has expressed regret over
the reported refusal of UNAMET to accredit the organizations.
</P>
<P>
"Since the beginning, we have stressed the autonomy ballot
(must be) a transparent and democratic process, and all
independent and credible monitoring agencies should be given the
right to monitor it," P3TT spokesman Dino Patti Djalal said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 451,792 people have registered for the ballot
scheduled for August 30. Out of them, 438,513 people from East
Timor and others from outside East Timor.
</P>
<P>
UNAMET is planning to set up a total of 700 ballot stations
across East Timor. The consultation is meant to let the East
Timorese people indicate whether they accept or reject
wide-ranging autonomy within Indonesia's fold. If they vote
against autonomy, the Indonesian government will let the territory
get independence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an East Timorese leader predicted there would be a
bloodbath in Dili regardless of the outcome of the forthcoming
ballot.
</P>
<P>
"The post-ballot period will be very crucial because neither of
the conflicting factions will accept defeat in the ballot. A
greater war than the one in 1975 and mass killings are expected to
happen again in the troubled territory," Timorese National Party
chairman Abilio Araujo said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the Indonesian government agreed to offer
wide-ranging autonomy for East Timorese people through a direct
ballot. On May 5, Indonesia, Portugal and the United Nations
decided to hold the ballot in August.
</P>
<P>
Araujo said the conflicting factions and the East Timorese in
general would never accept the ballot result because they have
never been part of the negotiation and proposed solution.
</P>
<P>
"The May 5 tripartite agreement was reached by Indonesia,
Portugal and UN, (while) the East Timorese people were never
invited to participate in the making of it," he added.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of some 800,000 and an area of
about 15,000 square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until
1975. It became an Indonesian province in 1976, but the U.N. never
recognized the move.

NANJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Jiangsu Province in east China
will continue to expand trade and economic cooperation with Taiwan
and to ensure the legal rights of Taiwan businessmen, a senior
provincial official said recently.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- More and more homeless Filipinos
have been granted housing shelters under the Philippine National
Shelter Program (NSP), The Philippine Star reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Latest records from the NSP showed that for the first 12 months
of the Estrada administration, 33,517 low-income families were
granted socialized housing assistance, the report said.
</P>
<P>
From July 1998 to March 1999, the NSP provided 127,886 housing
units to 57,236 households, the newspaper quoted the Presidential
Management Staff (PMS) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The number of households granted serviced home lots under the
resettlement program reached 9,7079, while 30,661 families were
granted direct housing provisions.
</P>
<P>
The PMS also said that a total of 28,544 families were granted
financial assistance worth 6.17 billion pesoes (154 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government's housing program which has focused more on
socialized housing instead of economic housing already accounted
for a bulk or 34.21 percent of the total NSP expenditures of 12.12
billion pesoes (300 million dollars), the report added.

<P>
DALIAN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Noted Chinese physicist Gui
Yuanxing has lashed out at the "doomsday theory" advocated by Li
Hongzhi, founder of Falun Gong, which says that the Earth has
exploded and could explode again and bring the world into its
doomsday.
</P>
<P>
Exposing Li Hongzhi's malicious motives using basic knowledge
and facts concerning celestial bodies, professor Gui from the
Dalian Polytechnic University said that Li Hongzhi's "doomsday
theory" is not original but a deception shared by various cults
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Hongzhi's doomsday theory, the Earth has
exploded 81 times and could blow up again in the future. Li also
deemed himself the paramount savior of the Earth and he has the
power to control the explosion of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
"It's as absurd to say that a cannon without dynamite can
explode just as the Earth could blow up." Gui Yuanxing said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Gui also criticized Li Hongzhi's claim that modern
science is not science in the real sense and can not solve the
mysteries in the universe.

<P>
His remarks were made a day after a small explosion occurred

<HEADLINE> W.Bank Threatens to Stop Support to Indonesia Over Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has threatened to
halt its assistance to Indonesia if the Indonesian government
fails to resolve the Bank Bali scandal satisfactorily, the Jakarta
Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
World Bank country director for Indonesia Mark Baird said that
given the magnitude of the case, it was not enough for the World
Bank to simply express concern over the alleged fraud.
</P>
<P>
"If this case is not resolved satisfactorily, it will be
difficult for us to provide budgetary support to the government of
Indonesia," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has been under pressure to resolve
the "illegal" transfer of 546 billion rupiah (78 million U.S.
dollars) from Bank Bali to PT Era Giat Prima (EGP), a private
company linked to several of President B.J. Habibie's associates.
</P>
<P>
Several ministers and Habibie's younger brother are also
alleged to be involved in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Although the money has been returned to Bank Bali, there are
still demands that all those involved in the scandal be legally
processed because a crime may have been committed.
</P>
<P>
World Bank vice president for East Asia and the Pacific
Jean-Michel Severino said that the World Bank remained deeply
concerned over the Bank Bali affair and its broader implications
for Indonesia's bank restructuring efforts.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the Bank Bali case has major macroeconomic
and microeconomic implications. I imagine that the World Bank
cannot carry on its activities unchanged if the issue isn't
satisfactorily resolved," Severino said.
</P>
<P>
The matter needs to be resolved, not only because of the large
sums of money involved, but also because of the greater confidence
and credibility issues at stake, he was quoted by The Indonesian
Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
While the House of Representatives has demanded the sacking of
Finance Minister Bambang Subianto, central bank governor Sjahril
Sabirin and head of the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency
(IBRA) Glenn Yusuf, major donors including the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) have also urged the government
to act quickly and transparently on the scandal.
</P>
<P>
The IMF called on the Indonesian government to allow the
Australia-based PricewaterhouseCoopers to audit Bank Indonesia in
an attempt to trace the flow of the funds from Bank Bali, in an
effort to identify those involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers to
audit the IBRA.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Habibie's senior adviser Dewi Fortuna Anwar Tuesday
said the president must immediately clear his name and take firm
action against people around him who are involved in the Bank Bali

<HEADLINE> Robust Economic Growth in Chinese Small Rural Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Small rural towns account for
approximately 25 percent of China's total GDP and are rapidly
emerging as important bases for boosting rural economic
development.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the Ministry of Construction said today
that China has developed more than 55,000 small rural towns which
are home to over 70,000 specialized and wholesale markets with
accumulative annual trade volume of more than 500 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
More than one million township enterprises in these towns
employ over 150 million farmers and account for over 70 percent to
the country's total rural output value.
</P>
<P>
The township employers will be able to hire an average seven to
eight million rural laborers annually.
</P>
<P>
The rapidly increasing number of small towns will not only help
absorb large numbers of surplus rural laborers, but will also
stimulate efforts to restructure agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that some 60 percent of the country's 20
million township enterprises are concentrated in small rural towns.
In addition, a large number of enterprise groups in developed
areas have annual output values of over one billion yuan each,
with the figure for some rising as high as several billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Plans call for China to develop 10,000 key satellite towns
nationwide in order to raise social and economic development in
rural areas to a new level.

</P>
<P>
PBSI deputy for athletes development Hadi Nazri said that
although the association primarily expected its shuttlers to use
the event to improve their world rankings to qualify for the
Olympics in Sydney next year, it also hoped to retain its
dominance in the sport, especially in the men's doubles.
</P>
<P>
"Our athletes are not allowed to make an early exist in the
first or second rounds. If they are not serious, they will lose
points needed to qualify for the Olympics," he was quoted by The
Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is sending Hendrawan, Budi Santoso, Taufik Hidayat,
Hariyanto Arbi and Marlev Mainaky in the men's singles and three

<P>
In the women's event, PBSI entered Yuli Marfuah in the singles
and Elysa Nathanael and Deyana Lomban and Indarti Issolina and
Carmelita in the doubles.
</P>
<P>
Hadi said all players in the National Badminton Center in
Cipayung, East Jakarta, were required to compete in eight
tournaments until the deadline for the qualifying round in April
next year.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of this year, we hope some of them will manage to
reach the top 10 in each event, if we are really serious in our
target to retain the gold medal in badminton. In April, we expect
them to be in the top four to enable us to reap the greatest
benefit from the making of the draw during the Olympics," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hadi named Hendrawan, Budi and Taufik in the men's singles and
Cindana Hartono, Lidya Djaelawidjaja and Ellen Angelina in the
women's singles as the best candidates to qualify for the Olympics.

<P>
BELGRADE, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Power supply in areas around
Belgrade was resumed as number 9 transformer substation, damaged
in NATO air-strike, was restored and put into operation, Yugoslav
official news agency Tanjug said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The transformer substation has regained its full ability of
supplying the Zemun, Batajnica and other districts of Belgrade.
But as some other transformer substations in the region are still
under reconstruction, power supply is not yet as stable as that
before the air-strike.
</P>
<P>
A manager in charge of transformer substations said, number 3,
number 5 and those in Novi Sad and Nish, which were also destroyed
by NATO, will resume power supply to most areas of Serbia before
winter sets in.
</P>
<P>
Currently, most areas of Yugoslavia, including Belgrade, are
still under part-time power supply.

FUZHOU, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A growing number of tourists from

In the first six months of the year, 16,000 Taiwan compatriots
toured the Wuyi Mountains, up 97.5 percent from the same period

"If Taiwan is separated from the motherland as Lee Teng-hui has
advocated in his 'two-states' statement, it will be no good for

BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital, which had
expected a bitter battle against heavy floods during this year's
rainy season, is now suffering from severe drought.
</P>
<P>
According to the Beijing Municipal Anti-Flood and Drought
Relief Headquarters, the city had only 263 mm of rainfall in this
year's rainy season, half of that of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Water reserves in the city's main sources of water, the Miyun
and the Guanting reservoirs, have also kept declining, as a result
of less rainfall this year.
</P>
<P>
Only 15 million cubic meters of water flew into the Miyun
Reservoir from June to July this year, the least amount over same
periods in the past few years. Meanwhile, water influx into the
Guanting Reservoir also dropped by about 76 percent from the
average over recent years.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that Beijing's underground water level has also
dropped by 0.45 to 2.39 meters, and they suggested that measures
be taken to encourage economic use of water.

<HEADLINE> Three Former South China Officials Imprisoned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Three officials of Jiangmen
City, south China's Guangdong Province, have recently been given
four to 13 years' imprisonment for neglect of duty, corruption and
embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
Kuang Reng, former vice mayor of Jiangmen City, will be jailed
for four years for neglect of duty. He was found guilty of
formulating local regulations that violate state financial
policies when he was Party secretary of Enping City during 1990 to
1994. This caused heavy economic losses to the state, according to
information from the Intermediate People's Court of Jiangmen City
which made the rulings.
</P>
<P>
The local regulations introduced by Kuang are said to have
affected financial decisions, encouraging borrowing and lending
with high interest rates. This artificially boosted Enping's scale
of investment in economic development over the four year period
placing unnecessary financial burdens on local enterprises.
Banking and trust and investment organizations found it hard to
retrieve their loans, eventually resulting in a number of
financial problems.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Wang, former Chairman of the Board of Jiangmen
International Trust Group Company, and Zhang Fengding, head of
Sanbu Health Inspection and Quarantine Bureau were both given 13
years' imprisonment for corruption and embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
Zheng was found guilty of illegally possessing 280,000 yuan and
Zhang guilty of embezzling 650,000 yuan which he spent on gambling
and a string of mistresses.

JI'NAN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- With the click of a mouse or the

from his homepage on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's case is not unusual in his hometown of Shouguang, in
east China's Shandong Province, which is the largest wholesale
market of vegetables in China. More than 600 farmers there are
profiting from on-line business.
</P>
<P>
These Internet-savvy farmers can now follow and analyze the
market, and pinpoint where sales opportunities exist both
domestically and overseas.
</P>
<P>
On-line business has brought more than six million yuan (about
720,000 U.S. dollars) in returns for local farmers.
</P>
<P>
Shandong's Jinxiang County, also known as China's "Hometown of
Garlic," is the first county in the province to be linked with the
Internet. Farmers there sell nearly 200,000 tons of garlic and
finished garlic products through on-line sales annually.
</P>
<P>
Many farmers in less-developed Zhanhua County are also eager to

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Deputy PM Affirms Bright Prospects for Egypt-China Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Agriculture and Land Reclamation Youssef Wali has
extolled bilateral relations between Egypt and China as an
exemplary model of international relations and believes the two
countries will share a bright and constructive future.
</P>
<P>
In a recent exclusive interview with Xinhua in Cairo, on the
occasion of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's
Republic of China on October 1, Wali said Egypt was the first
country in both Africa and the Arab region to establish diplomatic
relations with the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
He said both countries are seeking to establish the principles
of peaceful co-existence among all peoples of the world on the
basis of mutual equality, respect and cooperation for the good of
mankind.
</P>
<P>
Wali has visited China several times, the first in the early
1970s, and the last when he accompanied President Hosni Mubarak in
the early 1980s. During the two visits, he said he has followed
closely China's great economic achievements as well as the culture
of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Praising China's achievements in international and diplomatic
fields since its founding, Wali said that China's biggest
accomplishment in modern history was the winning of its permanent
seat in the U.N. Security Council by virtue of its policy and
adherence to the principles of peaceful co-existence among all
peoples.
</P>
<P>
China has, therefore, earned its high standing in the
international community, as demonstrated by its equal relationship
with such great power as the United States and, at the same time,
with peoples of the developing world, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China's importance will continue to grow under the
umbrella of globalization which will ultimately generate a multi-
polar world.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian deputy premier said that when China decided to
apply an economic open-door policy, it was keen on implementing
its own experiment based on domestic conditions and its particular
international relations, while considering the social dimensions
of economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Thus, he said, China's economic growth rate and its extensive
economic activity met with great success and made the Shanghai
Stock Exchange one of today's most prominent exchanges in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Asked to assess China's role and standing in regional and
international affairs, Wali said that China's attitude for the
past 50 years has always been objective and has relentlessly
pursued efforts to promote the interests of developing nations and
peoples, and to entrench stability and peaceful coexistence among
different peoples throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Wali expressed his belief that China's role will
further grow in world affairs, both in depth and in scope, in the
midst of the current successive world changes.

<HEADLINE> Oil Discovery Boosts Foreign Investors' Confidence in Bohai Bay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Penglai 19-3 oilfield is the first discovered in a Sino-
foreign cooperative area and the largest of four oilfields with
over 100 million tons of reserves in Bohai. The discovery has
inspired the world's oil giants with investment in the area like
Esso, Chevron, Kerr-McGee, and Texaco.
</P>
<P>
The 50-square kilometers oilfield is 23 meters deep. A series
of tests by Chinese and American geologists have suggested that
the oil is in high quality and easily exploited.
</P>
<P>
Deng Yunhua, a company geologist, says that 56,000 square
kilometers of the Bohai area are for exploitation, and a billion
tons of oil and 30 billion cubic meters of natural gas have been
discovered in the last 33 years. Annual crude production capacity
is more than 2.5 million tons and natural gas production, 400
million cubic meters. Crude oil production in the year 2004 is
expected to exceed 10 million tons, making the area the largest
oil base in north China.
</P>
<P>
Deng says that foreign oil companies have invested over a
billion U.S. dollars since 1980 but some multinationals have lost
confidence and left the area with no results.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Sprinter Faces Two Years Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Davidson Ezinwa faces a
two-year ban after the sprinter tested positive for a banned
hormone at the World Championships, IAAF officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Another athlete, Somali 1,500-meter runner Mohamed Ibrahim Aden,
tested positive for a stimulant and received a warning, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
These were the first two positive drug cases so far at the
championships, which opened Saturday and run through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ezinwa, who finished seventh in the 100-meter semifinals Sunday,
tested positive hCG, which stands for Chorionic Gonadotrophin and
is listed under the same class of prohibited substances as human
growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
The substance is considered a serious performance-enhancer
which,like steroids, draws a two-year ban.
</P>
<P>
It's the second positive test for Ezinwa, who in February 1996
received a three-month ban for the use of the stimulant ephedrine.
His twin brother, Osmond, also was suspended for three months for
ephedrine in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
27-year-old Ezinwa was the 1990 world junior champion in the
100. He was a bronze medalist in the 60 at the 1997 world indoor
championships.

The 15 council members welcomed the successful completion of
the registration process and stressed that the remainder of the
process should take place in a secure environment.
</P>
<P>
They reiterated support for the work of the United Nations

conduct the ballot to see whether the majority of 800,000 East
Timorese want special autonomy within Indonesia or independence.
</P>

parties to abide by their commitments in respect of disarmament
and cantonment, while expressing concern at the continuing
campaign of intimidation and violence in East Timor.

<P>
SEVILLE, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's super star and world
record holder Haile Gebrselassie won his fourth world 10,000
meters title at the 7th World Athletics Championships Tuesday,
becoming from a human to a legend.
</P>
<P>
Gebrselassie, gold medalist in the last three World
Championships, pulled away in the final 450 meters to blaze to
victory in 27 minutes 57.27 seconds, outside his world record of
26:22.75 set in the Netherlands on June 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Former world record holder and five-time world crosscountry
champion Paul Tergat of Kenya, second placer in the 1997 Athens
World Championships, repeated the feat with a time of 27:58.56,
followed by another Ethiopian Assefa Mezgebu in 27:59.15.
</P>
<P>
"My feet are bleeding," Gebrselassie said and poured water over
both feet and put a pack of ice on top of them.
</P>
<P>
"It is always the same with these hard tracks," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Gebrselassie, also champion in the 1996 Olympic Games, said
that the four world titles were no match than a second Olympic
gold.
</P>
<P>
"Four titles at the World Championships is special but now I
must think of the Olympics."
</P>
<P>
Gebrselassie stayed in the second position for most of the time
while South African Hendrick Ramala did most of the work for 4,000
meters with young Kenyans David Chelule and Ben Maiyo alternating
the challenge.
</P>
<P>
But Ethiopians Assefa Mezgebu and Girma Tolla did most of the
pace setting as it to guard their better known compatriot. In the
20th lap Kenyans lookd like they had contained Gebrselassie as
Maiyo moved ahead with Tergat in third place but that was only
shortlived.
</P>
<P>
Gebresilassie led for 1,000 meters between the 5,000 and 7,000
meters. With Chelule taking the next 1,000 at the 22.43.62 mark.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Pinto of Portugal produced a remarkable pace in the 9,
000 meters mark as the clock unbeaten in the 10,000m event since
1993, stood at 25.32.07.
</P>
<P>
As Chelule faded Gebresilassie began sprinting with a dramatic
speed and finally took the victory in style.
</P>
<P>
"The race was a strange affair as it was not too quick," he said.
"The first 5,000 meters was exceptionally slow. However, at
championships times do not matter, medals count."
</P>
<P>
But the slow pace and the the heat spoiled Tergat's chance to
win the gold.
</P>
<P>
"It was so tactical, too slow for me and with that speed I knew
the medal was lost, " he said. "Maybe I should have tried to have
taken control of the race four laps from home. And even for a
Kenyan it was very hot out here tonight," he said.
</P>
<P>
For Mezgebu, Gebreselassie was really too much and he never
thought of winning the race.
</P>
<P>
"I was running with the Emperor as you say about Haile," he
said. "He is now the master. But it's an inspiration to run with
Haile but even the greatest man will one day be beaten and I hope
to have this honor one day."
</P>
<P>
And Gebreselassie said he has always believed he could take the
title even if the rivals launched a tough challenge.
</P>
<P>
"I'm always confident that I have all that it will take to win,
" he said. "I just relax and let my mind and feet do the work. As
soon as I made my move in the final lap I knew there was nothing
they would be able to catch me.
</P>
<P>
"The gold was then mine."
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian all-time great has kept unbeaten since 1993 and
shared the one million U.S. dollars jackpot last year with
American Marion Jones and Morocco's just-crowned 1,500 meters
world champion Hicham El Guerrouj for winning all seven stages of
the Golden League.
</P>
<P>
Gebreselassie, who was named Men's Athletes of the Year 1999
and winner of the Owens Award, completed a gold double in the
World Indoor Championships by winning the 1,500 and 3,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
"I could break many more records," said Gebreselassie, who has
broken 15 world records. "But they could all be taken away. But
you can never forget titles and that's why I would like to be the
world champion for the fourth time here."

<HEADLINE> Last of Kosovo Refugees Leave Ex-NATO Base in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The last of the Kosovo refugees
based at the former NATO base at Comiso of Italy's south island of
Sicily, have departed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The only ones to remain behind Tuesday, out of a last group of
89 refugees from the Balkans, was the family of a woman who gave
birth to a baby boy Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The others have headed for reception centers up and down the
peninsula, in Italy's other towns of Nettuno, Civitavecchia,
Labico, Rocca di Papa, Ivrea and Asti.
</P>
<P>
These structures were set up by the Italian Council for
Refugees and the Italian Solidarity Consortium to handle those
arriving from the Balkans without papers.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, August 19, 59 refugees left here to return to
Kosovo. Between July 6 and 21, almost 4,000 were repatriated.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,600 left the camp on their own and in groups, either
headed for other locations in Italy or elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The date for when the camp will be shut down entirely is to be
announced soon. The warehouses on the base are still full of goods
which must be disposed of in one way or another.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Hold Open Debate on Protection of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
is scheduled to hold an open debate Wednesday to examine ways and
means of enhancing the protection of children in armed conflict,
Olara Otunnu, U.N. special representative for Children and Armed
Conflict, announced.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was further confirmed by the president of the
15-nation Security Council, Martin Andjaba of Namibia, in his
answers to press questions.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu told a news briefing he is "very confident" that the
Security Council will adopt a draft resolution, which he pushed
very hard to include his proposals since last year.
</P>
<P>
If adopted, the proposed resolution would be the first in the
Security Council's history to focus exclusively on children and
armed conflict, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It would constitute a major breakthrough in the efforts by the
international community to protect children caught in the horror
of war," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Every citizen is entitled to be protected in armed conflict,"
he said. "In every society, children is the hope and future. If
you destroy children, you destroy the hope and future."
