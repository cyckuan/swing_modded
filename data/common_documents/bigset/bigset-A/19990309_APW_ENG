<HEADLINE> Microsoft Will Fix Privacy Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reacting to privacy concerns over a flaw in  
Windows, Microsoft Corp. is promising to offer software to strip 
out an identifying number that could be used to trace the 
authorship of some electronic documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Sinofsky, a vice president for Microsoft's Office  
products, said late Monday the company also almost certainly will 
offer a patch for the tens of millions of customers who use its 
popular collection of Office 97 business programs, which include 
Word and Excel. 
</P>
<P>
	That software fix, to be administered by customers themselves,  
would prevent the identifier number from being quietly embedded 
within electronic documents in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take these things very seriously,'' Sinofsky said.  
</P>
<P>
	The company previously promised only to allow customers to  
remove the serial number from their computers, not from individual 
documents, such as business letters and spreadsheets. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft confirmed over the weekend that its latest version of  
Windows generates a unique serial number for each computer that is 
partly planted within some documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the company also acknowledged it may have been  
harvesting those serial numbers from customers -- along with their 
names and addresses -- even when customers had explicitly indicated 
they didn't want the numbers disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy groups complained that the list of serial numbers,  
together with names and addresses, could be used to trace 
electronic documents to a specific computer even when an author 
wished to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard M. Smith of Brookline, Mass., the software programmer  
who first noticed the numbers hidden within his Microsoft files, 
compared the situation to a person's Social Security number being 
stamped on every document he creates. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said Monday that Microsoft was acting appropriately.  
</P>
<P>
	``For the document problem, that's what they need to do,'' Smith  
said. ``There are a lot of documents that already have the stuff in 
it. You don't want to be storing those (numbers) in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those numbers are part of a 32-digit identifier created by  
Windows 98 whenever customers register their software with 
Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said late Monday it still was investigating whether  
it might be inadvertently collecting the numbers during the 
electronic registration process for Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft announced Monday on its Web site that it will  
change the procedure ``to not send the hardware ID, unless the user 
checks the option to send hardware information to Microsoft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It acknowledged ``there are hypothetical scenarios in which this  
number could be used to learn something about the user's system 
without his or her knowledge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The number appears in a log of information transmitted to  
Microsoft, even when customers say they don't want details about 
their computers sent to the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy was aggravated by the prominence of Microsoft's  
products: Its bundle of affected business programs is used by 
nearly 90 percent of consumers of such programs, and its dominant 
Windows operating systems run most of the world's personal 
computers.

<HEADLINE> Padres End Star Exodus With Hoffman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The ominous strains of ``Hell's Bells'' rang  
out in Qualcomm Stadium once again as Trevor Hoffman strode toward 
the middle of the field. Not to pitch, but to become the best-paid 
reliever in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres flew Hoffman and general manager Kevin Towers from  
spring training back to San Diego Tuesday afternoon to announce 
Hoffman's $32 million, four-year contract extension, the richest 
deal in club history. 
</P>
<P>
	After an offseason that saw many of San Diego's marquee names  
leave via free agency or trade, the Padres felt they sent a message 
by locking up the premier closer in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kind of puts to rest the unfair and inaccurate notion  
that we were a reprise of the Florida Marlins,'' club president 
Larry Lucchino said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pitching and Trevor Hoffman will be the rocks on which we will  
build the San Diego Padres of the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By securing a deal with a no-trade clause, Hoffman becomes the  
first Padres player locked up through the scheduled 2002 opening of 
a new downtown ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of the fact I'm going to be a part of the next  
generation, you might say,'' Hoffman said. ``That new stadium is 
coming, and I'm awfully excited to be the one guy that we know 
right now is going to be there. I'm sure the sound system will be 
loud for those bells, and it will be interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres started playing AC/DC's ominous rock song in  
midseason to announce Hoffman's arrival on the mound. Hoffman tied 
the NL record with 53 saves in 54 chances and finished second to 
Tom Glavine in the Cy Young voting. He's the club's career leader 
with 186 saves. 
</P>
<P>
	The news conference was held up for an hour because the flight  
carrying Hoffman and Towers was delayed in Phoenix. That allowed 
the GM a chance to take a playful poke at the richer division rival 
Los Angeles Dodgers, who spirited away Kevin Brown for $105 million 
over seven years. One of Brown's perks is to have his family flown 
in from Georgia 12 times a year on a corporate jet. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the deals we forgot was 10-to-12 flights on Southwest  
Airlines, and double the peanuts,'' Towers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman won't be hurting. The contract, the largest in Padres  
history, calls for the highest average annual salary ever for a 
relief pitcher, $8 million. Hoffman, already signed for $4.1 
million this year, gets a $3 million signing bonus that is payable 
in 2002, $6 million in each of the first three years of the 
extension and $9 million in 2003. San Diego has a $10 million 
option for 2004 with a $2 million buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that the Padres weren't able to keep together their NL  
championship club -- Brown, Ken Caminiti, Steve Finley, Greg Vaughn 
and Joey Hamilton are gone -- might have helped Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Timing is everything,'' he said. ``Obviously they weren't able  
to keep all of us, so maybe the fact that some of the guys weren't 
here freed up a few extra dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contract has a no-trade clause, something new for the Padres  
and something that was important to Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to go anywhere when this thing (his current  
contract) was done,'' Hoffman said. ``It was something I wanted to 
stay with. I think they realized that I was really committed to 
being here for a long time. I think that showed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, country singer-turned-baseball player Garth Brooks,  
who left the Padres to be with his ill mother, could be back in 
training camp by the end of the week, club sources said. Official 
word could come Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Defends $150,000 Dog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- How much is that doggie in the window? At  
the United Nations, he costs $150,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	And U.N. officials said Tuesday he's worth every penny.  
</P>
<P>
	Costa Rica complained to the U.N. budget committee Monday that  
the world body was spending too much money on a high-security dog 
when it was so short of cash. 
</P>
<P>
	But Assistant Secretary-General Toshiyuki Niwa defended Jerry,  
the bomb-sniffing security pooch. 
</P>
<P>
	The costly canine is an effective security measure in light of  
the number of suspicious packages and letter bomb threats the 
United Nations receives, he told the U.N. budget committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Could be, but at the rate of $60 an hour, 10 hours a day, 252  
days a year, Jerry and his handler Tom were earning more than a 
U.N. undersecretary-general -- about $140,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the New York City Police and the U.S. military  
supplied bomb-sniffing dogs only for the annual General Assembly 
debate, when heads of state from around the world gather for a few 
weeks of speechmaking. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. inspector-general recommended last year that the United  
Nations hire a full-time security dog after the twin U.S. embassy 
bombings in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry, a black Labrador retriever, is still working on a trial  
basis at the United Nations, along with his new handler Jack. 
They'll know if they have a permanent job after the General 
Assembly approves the budget later this year.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rules on Alabama Senate Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Intervening in a standoff that has  
paralyzed the Alabama Senate for the past week, a Democratic judge 
ruled Tuesday that the Republican lieutenant governor broke the law 
by gaveling through new Senate rules to increase his power. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Charles Price said Lt. Gov. Steve Windom had no  
right to pass the new Senate rules on an unrecorded voice vote 
while 18 Democratic senators -- a majority of the 35-member Senate -- 
screamed in protest. 
</P>
<P>
	Windom immediately appealed Price's ruling to the Alabama  
Supreme Court, where the Republicans hold a 5-4 majority. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court agreed to hear oral arguments on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	In his appeal, Windom argued that the judicial branch of  
government has no business interfering with the rules of the 
legislative branch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect the court will uphold over 100 years of precedent in  
supporting the separation of powers,'' the lieutenant governor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alabama Constitution gives the lieutenant governor only two  
duties: presiding over the Senate and voting in case of a tie. But 
the Democrat-dominated Senate has traditionally let the lieutenant 
governor appoint Senate committees and decide which committee 
considers each bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything changed Nov. 3 when Windom was elected Alabama's  
first Republican governor this century and Democratic Lt. Gov. Don 
Siegelman was elected governor. Before taking office as governor, 
Siegelman pushed through rules stripping the lieutenant governor's 
office of most of its powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Windom promptly grabbed back his powers with a voice vote and  
rapid gavel when the Legislature's annual session opened March 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18 Democratic senators sued him and started boycotting the  
Senate. With the Legislature limited to 30 meeting days each year, 
the standoff has wasted eight days so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the legislation at stake is Siegelman's proposed state  
lottery for education. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're reaching the point of no return,'' said Siegelman's  
chief of staff, Paul Hamrick.

<HEADLINE> Judge: NCAA Can't Use Minimum Score </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A federal judge ruled Monday that the NCAA  
may not use a minimum test score to eliminate student-athletes from 
eligibility to play college sports because the practice is unfair 
to blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	District Judge Ronald L. Buckwalter cited the National  
Collegiate Athletic Association's own research showing that the 
practice harmed black students' chances of being declared 
academically eligible. He said there were other methods available 
to reach the goal of higher graduation rates that would be fairer 
to blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Four black student-athletes who were denied eligibility to take  
part in college sports challenged the rule, which is commonly known 
as Proposition 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Georgetown coach John Thompson, who boycotted two games  
in 1989 over legislation that preceded Proposition 16, said he had 
mixed emotions over the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad the judge stood up and addressed what a lot of us  
know to be true,'' he said Monday night from his home in 
Washington. ``The pitiful thing about all of this is that as far 
back as Proposition 48 we never gave it an opportunity to run its 
course and find out what the research showed before we ran on to 
another proposition. We have been reacting to public perception 
rather than what was correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA had required that incoming freshmen have a minimum  
score of 820 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, no matter how high 
their high school grades were, in order to participate in college 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
	An NCAA attorney said the organization will seek a suspension of  
the judge's order ``because at this point there is no rule at all'' 
-- which she called a disservice to student-athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means that there is no standard to guide the schools,''  
NCAA General Counsel Elsa Kircher Cole said. ``Each school will 
have to decide itself whether a student can play the first year. It 
could lead to inconsistencies between standards at the schools and 
leaves the possibility of student athletes being exploited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cole added, however, that she was pleased that the court  
recognized that improving graduate rates was a legitimate goal of 
the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the court struck down the rule setting forth initial  
eligibility, it left the door open for the NCAA to adopt a rule in 
the future'' using SAT scores as long as there was enough of a 
correlation between scores and the graduation rate, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs' lawyers said the decision will be good for both  
blacks and whites. 
</P>
<P>
	``Low-income white student-athletes will also benefit because  
the rule has had a disparate impact on them as well,'' said the 
plaintiffs' lead counsel, Andre Dennis of the Philadelphia firm of 
Stradley, Ronon, Stevens &AMP; Young. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court was focusing on the lack of a rational basis for  
selecting that particular score,'' said Dennis' co-counsel, Adele 
P. Kimmel, a staff lawyer with Trail Lawyers for Public Justice, a 
Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group. She described the SAT cutoff 
figure as arbitrary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our lawsuit never said they couldn't consider SAT scores at  
all,'' Kimmel said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said NCAA staff researchers had recommended a ``sliding  
scale,'' in which test scores and grade-point averages in core 
academic courses would be given equal weight. That practice, she 
said, would achieve the NCAA's goal of raising graduation rates and 
would allow more blacks to be academically eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NCAA has ignored that, we think, in part because of a  
public relations problem,'' Kimmel said. ``They can say, 'We're 
raising standards.''' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the NCAA surveyed its member schools last year, and a  
majority of them decided to reject the NCAA staff's proposed 
sliding scale and keep the Proposition 16 rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who resigned for personal reasons in January in his  
27th season at Georgetown, said the decision is too late for a lot 
of student-athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel more upset than anything,'' he said. ``Being right  
doesn't mean anything to me. What do you do for the kids who have 
been deprived, who needed athletics to be able to get out of their 
situations? Changes will obviously come about, but how do you go 
back and change the kids this hurt? All you can say is `Sorry,' and 
there's something wrong, very wrong with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said there is no quick answer.  
</P>
<P>
	``We should at least have individual evaluation mean more at  
individual institutions. I'm not for open admissions and I never 
have been,'' he said. ``I never said you shouldn't use SAT scores, 
but I did say you shouldn't misuse SAT scores, and all along we 
have as we generated statistics trying to fool the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to ruling on test scores, the judge decided that the  
plaintiffs could sue the NCAA under the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 
1964. The U.S. Supreme Court had declined to rule on that question 
last month, but Buckwalter noted that the plaintiffs' lawyers in 
this case had presented a lot of information not given to the 
Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> French Bank Makes Bid for 2 Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- France's Banque Nationale de Paris has made a bold  
bid to create the world's largest bank, offering $37.2 billion in 
stock to buy Paribas SA and Societe General SA. 
</P>
<P>
	The surprise offer comes just weeks after Societe General moved  
to buy Paribas for $17.07 billion to create Europe's second-largest 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The takeover bid, announced late Tuesday night by regulators for  
the Paris stock exchange, comes amid widespread consolidation among 
banks across Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Henri de Clisson, a spokesman for Banque Nationale, said the  
move is aimed at creating ``a champion of the European banking 
sector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If successful, the merger would create the largest bank in world  
with nearly $1 trillion in assets. That would surpass the $800 
billion in assets from the bank that would be created by the 
pending merger of Deutsche Bank AG and Bankers Trust Corp.

<HEADLINE> London Cop Nabs N.Y. Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A vacationing London police officer braved  
gunfire to help nab a robbery suspect on a Manhattan street and 
says he was only doing his fraternal duty. 
</P>
<P>
	``My main concern was to try to apprehend him,'' Detective  
Inspector Howard Groves said at a news conference Monday with Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	Groves was walking out of his midtown Manhattan hotel with a  
friend Saturday morning when he saw a man being pistol-whipped by 
two others outside a check-cashing store. 
</P>
<P>
	Groves, a 19-year veteran of London's Metropolitan Police,  
headed toward the storefront while his friend ran to call police -- 
New York's version. 
</P>
<P>
	Unarmed, Groves ran after the crooks himself. ``One of them shot  
at him -- that didn't stop him,'' Giuliani said. 
</P>
<P>
	The British bobby, joined by three New York officers, tackled  
one suspect and handcuffed him. A 9 mm handgun was recovered. The 
second man got away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing just like what any officer would have done under  
those circumstances,'' Groves said. ``I was a bit apprehensive as 
to whether or not he would probably fire at me again. But that was 
possibly the last thing on my mind. My main concern was to try to 
apprehend him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor is giving the brave Englishman in New York a pair of  
tickets for a New York Knicks basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time a suspect had fired a gun at Groves in his  
police career. Guns are far less common in England. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it's the last,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Poland To Protect Death Camp Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- The Polish government on Tuesday backed a  
proposal that would establish a 100-yard protection zone around the 
sites of former Nazi death camps. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed law was developed after conservative Catholics  
erected hundreds of crosses just outside of the former death camp 
at Auschwitz. Jewish organizations have protested the crosses, 
which they say insults the memory of Jews killed there. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, which is expected to go to parliament this month,  
will restrict business and building activity around the camps, as 
well as limit public gatherings at the sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also is designed to allow government to maintain an  
atmosphere of peace and dignity at the sites, a government 
communique said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government lost a court fight to get the crosses taken down,  
but is currently appealing. Government officials hope the new law 
would give them final authority to order the crosses removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewish organizations also protested earlier plans to build a  
mall across from the Auschwitz museum. The project has since been 
limited to a visitors center. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1.5 million people, mostly Jews, perished in Auschwitz  
and the adjacent camp of Birkenau in 1940-45. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Auschwitz, the bill covers the sites of former Nazi  
death camps at Majdanek, Sobibor, Belzec, Treblinka, Gross Rosen, 
Sztutowo and Chelmno. Some 6 million European Jews, half of them 
from Poland, perished in the Nazi Holocaust, and the majority of 
death camps were set up in occupied Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also concerns the camp at Lambinowice, where the Nazis  
held Polish prisoners of war. After the fall of the Third Reich, 
Poles used the facility to keep Germans awaiting resettlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of cities near the camps have criticized the  
government for its plan. They claim the broad zones would drive 
away investors and jobs.

<HEADLINE> NBC Buying Stake in Cable Channel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC owner General Electric Co. is buying a  
minority stake in ValueVision, the third largest home-shopping 
cable network, with an eye toward boosting the companies' Internet 
commerce business. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced today, brings NBC into televised home  
shopping for the first time and furthers its online expansion at a 
time when big media rivals are rapidly increasing their investments 
in the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the TV and PC converge, access to electronic revenue  
streams like home shopping through cable and Internet will become 
extremely valuable,'' said Tom Rogers, president of NBC's cable 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	ValueVision International Inc. operates the No. 3 cable shopping  
channel behind QVC and Barry Diller's Home Shopping Network -- 
peddling fake furs, porcelain dolls and computer desks among its 
many wares. ValueVision is shown in 21.8 million U.S. homes on 
either a full- or part-time basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBC deal employs a similar strategy to Diller's plan to  
acquire Internet company Lycos Inc., then combine it with his Home 
Shopping Network and Ticketmaster operations to create a wealth of 
cross-promotion opportunities. That deal, however, has been plagued 
by opposition from Lycos' biggest shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
	Under today's deal, GE will pay $56 million for a 19.9 percent  
stake in ValueVision, with an option to raise that stake to 39.9 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the deal pushed ValueVision shares up $2, or 20 percent,  
to $12.12 1/2 in morning trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. GE shares 
were down 37 1/2 cents at $104.43 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC will use its much-greater television experience to try to  
improve the quality of ValueVision's programming and expand the 
cable network's distribution. NBC already owns two successful cable 
networks, the CNBC business news network and the all-news MSNBC 
co-owned by Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	ValueVision, an 8-year-old company based in Minneapolis, also  
sells its goods over the Internet and through print media. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC will redesign ValueVision's current Web site and will seek  
opportunities over the next year to combine the site with a portal, 
the popular Internet sites such as Yahoo! and Lycos that offer 
searches, e-mail, news, chat and other services. 
</P>
<P>
	An NBC spokeswoman said the company may combine ValueVision's  
online business with Snap! -- a portal in which NBC acquired a 
minority stake last year -- or may seek deals with other Internet 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	ValueVision's sales and profits had been rising steadily for the  
past few years, but its sales dropped 13 percent to $138 million in 
the first nine months of 1998. Year-end figures are due out later 
this month.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed mixed Tuesday, with  
share prices surging both in Tokyo and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 317.65 points, or  
2.15 percent, to close at 15,096.70. On Monday, the average slid 
114.95 points, or 0.77 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time the Nikkei finished above 15,000 since  
Nov. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese market was boosted by a Sony Corp.-led rally in  
high technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony soared 890 yen ($7.36) to 10,940 yen ($90.41) after the  
company said it would turn three of its listed units into 
wholly-owned subsidiaries by January and slash its work force by 10 
percent by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the stock market remains strongly supported by  
continued foreign buying, as well as the recent fall in long-term 
interest rates and the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 121.76 yen at 5 p.m.,  
down 0.02 yen from late Monday in Tokyo but slightly above its late 
New York level of 121.66 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices also surged in Hong Kong, with the key index rising  
2.6 percent on sharp gains posted by banking giant HSBC Holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 268.96 points to close at 10,532.95. On Friday, 
the index gained 22.87 points. 
</P>
<P>
	There was continued heavy buying of HSBC Holdings shares after  
several brokerages upgraded their forecasts for the bank's 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said HSBC Holdings' plan to list on Wall Street might  
improve the international bank's outlook. The banking group's 
shares have gained 18 percent since it announced the listing plan 
late last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed sharply higher on a  
technical rebound following recent losses. The benchmark Composite 
Index, which tracks 100 blue-chip stocks, rose 10.67 points, or 2.0 
percent, to 530.53. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed sharply lower on rumors that a  
big telephone company is in deep financial trouble. The Stock 
Exchange of Thailand, or SET, index fell 7.09 points, or 2.1 
percent, to 329.59. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher for the third consecutive  
session. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index rose 61.47 
points, or 0.96 percent, to 6,493.43. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower, with brokers  
attributing the fall to a lack of investor participation on the 
back of two pending public offering of shares due later this year. 
The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 17.94 points, or 0.8 
percent, to 2,155.80. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower, pulled down by  
profit-taking. The 30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 
29.87 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,998.41. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian share market closed lower after dealers  
sat back waiting for corporate announcements and investor took 
profits in selected blue-chip stocks. The All Ordinaries Index fell 
8.8 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,920.8. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed mixed. The key Korea Composite Stock  
Price Index rose 1.01 points, or 0.1 percent, to 572.85. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly lower. The Straits Times  
Index fell 11.32 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,440.52. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> New Heart Attack Drugs Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Two new clot-busting drugs appear to be just  
as effective as the standard medicine for treating heart attacks 
and much easier to administer. 
</P>
<P>
	TPA revolutionized the treatment of heart attacks, the nation's  
biggest killer. When given within a few hours of the start of pain, 
Genentech Inc.'s flagship medicine dissolves the clot that chokes 
off the heart's blood supply, preventing permanent damage. 
</P>
<P>
	A major drawback is that TPA must be given as a continuous  
90-minute infusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers say the two new drugs are equally potent clot  
dissolvers, and they can be given as quick single injections. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say the new drugs are likely to mean that heart attack  
victims can be treated faster, perhaps even before they reach the 
hospital, and this may save more lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Results of major studies with the two drugs were presented  
Tuesday in New Orleans at a meeting of the American College of 
Cardiology. 
</P>
<P>
	The drugs are lanoteplase, developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb  
Co., and tenecteplase, developed by Genentech and Boehringer 
Ingelheim. In the studies, both drugs were compared against TPA but 
not against each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all anxious to move beyond TPA,'' said Dr. Robert  
Califf of Duke University, who was not involved in the studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenecteplase was tested on 16,950 patients in 29 countries.  
Deaths after one month were an identical 6.2 percent in patients 
getting tenecteplase or TPA. 
</P>
<P>
	Lanoteplase was tested on 15,078 patients in 35 countries. After  
30 days, 6.8 percent getting lanoteplase had died, compared with 
6.6 percent getting TPA. This difference was not statistically 
meaningful. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think more patients will be treated more effectively with a  
simpler treatment,'' said Dr. Paul Armstrong of the University of 
Alberta, one of the tenecteplase researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither new drug is available yet for routine use. Both studies  
were designed to persuade the Food and Drug Administration to 
approve the medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	TPA costs about $2,200 per patient. The companies have not  
announced how much they will charge for the new drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	TPA, short for tissue plasminogen activator, is a genetically  
engineered version of a natural clot-dissolving protein. The two 
new drugs are slightly modified versions of the same protein.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Olympic Official OKs Audit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Carol Anne Letheren says she has done nothing  
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian Olympic Association's chief operating officer on  
Tuesday said a potential conflict-of-interest crisis has not drawn 
her into the ever-growing Olympic scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Letheren reportedly received substantial consulting fees while  
serving as a member of the '96 Olympic bid committee. But two 
former members of the Toronto group said Tuesday that Letheren 
resigned prior to accepting the paid position. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Paul Henderson and Norman Seagram contend that while  
Letheren was serving as a paid consultant with the Toronto Olympic 
bid, she held a similar job with a Hamilton group attempting to 
land the '94 Commonwealth Games. That has led to additional 
suggestions of conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident there has been no conflict of interest,''  
Letheren said confidently in a telephone interview. ``I think there 
is a lot of confusion out there around the facts and I think it's 
appropriate to get a third party to have a look at these, review it 
and clear the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm anxious to get it done once and for all.''  
</P>
<P>
	Toronto Mayor Mel Lastman announced earlier this week that his  
office will conduct an audit of Toronto's '96 bid committee 
records.

<HEADLINE> Another Injured Starter for Hornets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The Charlotte Hornets' already dark  
injury picture got even more gloomy Tuesday night when starting 
wing guard Bobby Phills was sidelined with a possible stress 
fracture in his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Phills complained of soreness in his lower left leg in the hours  
leading up to their game against the Boston Celtics, and he was 
scratched from the lineup. X-rays were inconclusive, and more tests 
were scheduled for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury, which Phills believes may have originally occurred  
in the Hornets' Feb. 24 game against Miami, left point guard David 
Wesley as Charlotte's only remaining healthy player from what had 
been planned as the team's starting five. Forwards Glen Rice and 
Anthony Mason are on the injured list, both recovering from arm 
surgery, and center Derrick Coleman sat out the game to rest a 
sprained right foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Phills was replaced in the lineup by Ricky Davis, a rookie out  
of Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The game marked the Charlotte coaching debut of Paul Silas, who  
took over the Hornets on Monday following the resignation of Dave 
Cowens.

<HEADLINE> Merck's Drug Study Boosts Rival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Drug giant Merck thought putting its cholesterol  
drug Zocor against market leader Lipitor in a head-to-head study 
would help improve its sales. The strategy may have backfired. 
</P>
<P>
	The Merck-funded study did show that Zocor works better than  
Warner-Lambert's Lipitor at increasing the level of HDL or ``good'' 
cholesterol. But unfortunately for Merck, the world's largest drug 
maker, the study also found that Lipitor works slightly better at 
reducing LDL or ``bad'' cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study involving 842 patients in 19 counties,  
Warner-Lambert's Lipitor cholesterol drug reduced LDL cholesterol 
levels by 45 percent to 51 percent compared to Merck's Zocor, which 
cut levels 43 percent to 49 percent. The study's chief investigator 
called the differences small, yet statistically significant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very pleased with the findings,'' said Warner-Lambert  
spokeswoman Christy Davis, ``It confirms that we provide superior 
LDL reduction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were disclosed this week at the American College of  
Cardiology meeting in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Zocor and Lipitor are the leading cholesterol-lowering drugs on  
the market. Before Lipitor was introduced in early 1997, Merck 
dominated the cholesterol drug market and it still has annual sales 
of almost $4 billion worldwide. But Lipitor quickly became the best 
seller in the United States after Warner-Lambert showed doctors it 
had a more potent medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Zocor sales still top the $2.2 billion in Lipitor receipts  
because Zocor is available in more countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Lipitor controls about 44 percent of the U.S. market for  
cholesterol drugs compared to 25 percent for Zocor, according to 
IMS Health, a market data firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the best Merck can hope for is to stem its loss of  
market share. Merck thought pitting a higher dosage of its Zocor 
drug against Lipitor in the study would have helped. But that's 
unlikely now, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a pro-Lipitor study,'' said David Saks, an analyst  
with Gruntal &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck officials acknowledged that Warner-Lambert's Lipitor had  
an edge in reducing bad cholesterol levels, but said increasing HDL 
or ``good'' cholesterol levels is also important. Zocor increased 
HDL levels by nearly 17 percent in patients with low HDL levels, 
compared to a 6.5 percent increase for patients taking Lipitor, the 
study found. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than a decade, doctors have considered LDL or bad  
cholesterol an indicator of poor health because it becomes 
deposited in blood vessels and boosts the risk of heart attacks and 
strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two years, some studies have shown that increasing  
HDL levels is desirable because it picks up fat and carries it out 
of the body, reducing heart attack risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, health experts say reducing bad or LDL cholesterol levels  
remains the main event in the cholesterol wars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lowering LDL is still the primary goal,'' said Dr. Sidney  
Smith, chief of cardiology at the University of North Carolina 
Medical Center and past president of the American Heart 
Association.

<HEADLINE> Duke's Coach K Named Best in ACC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Mike Krzyzewski hobbled through the Atlantic  
Coast Conference season with a painful hip injury. No. 1 Duke 
certainly didn't limp along behind its leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran coach, who led the Blue Devils to a 32-1 record, and  
the ACC regular-season and tournament titles in smashing fashion, 
was rewarded Tuesday by being named the ACC Coach of the Year by 
The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski was the runaway winner of the award voted on by  
members of the Atlantic Coast Sports Writers Association, receiving 
77 of a possible 95 votes. Pete Gillen of Virginia was second with 
10 votes, while Gary Williams of Maryland got six. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think whenever a player or coach gets these awards it's a  
reflection of a belief that your team has had and their 
performance,'' Krzyzewski said. ``In particular for me this year, 
it's a reflection of my staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski also won the award in 1984, 1986 and 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	Duke began the season as the nation's No. 1 team, but not  
without questions revolving around team chemistry, the loss of team 
leader Steve Wojciechowski, and the play of new point guard William 
Avery. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, the Blue Devils were still a young team, starting a  
senior, a junior and three sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
	After an early-season loss to Cincinnati that dropped the Blue  
Devils from the top of the rankings, Duke reeled off 27 straight 
victories and head into this week's NCAA tournament as the No. 1 
seed. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke's 16-0 regular-season run through the ACC by an average  
margin of 24.3 points were both records, and the team's ACC tourney 
title capped the league's first ever 19-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are a great team, and everybody is always telling them  
that -- it's so well documented -- yet they handled the continual 
praise, almost the angelic status they are given, with tremendous 
maturity,'' N.C. State coach Herb Sendek said of Krzyzewski's team. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski's mobility in practice and on the bench was limited  
this season. The 52-year-old coach will have hip replacement 
surgery in early April. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski, 537-213 in 24 years at Army and Duke, said he leaned  
on assistants Quin Snyder, Johnny Dawkins and David Henderson, all 
former Duke players, more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have really depended on this staff more than I've depended  
on a staff my entire career,'' Krzyzewski said. ``I hope they get a 
sense of real satisfaction of having known they are responsible for 
(this award).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski singled out Snyder in particular, calling him a true  
associate head coach who at times ran practice while the head coach 
was ailing. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of it has to do with the physical aspects of what I'm  
going through, but also just age and the gap between you and the 
player's age,'' Krzyzewski said of his assistant's roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although I think I communicate well with my players, it is  
nice to have other great communicators on the staff. They may be 
able to get the points across that I may not be able to get across 
to my team. These guys have been able to do that. They have just 
been a huge factor for us.''

<HEADLINE> Case Dropped in $2 Robbery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Prosecutors have dropped their case  
against a 15-year-old retarded boy who grabbed $2 in lunch money 
from a classmate, after weeks of defending their decision to treat 
him as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Laster, who communicates on the level of a 5-year-old,  
spent four weeks, including Christmas, in a jail for adults because 
his sister was unable to raise $500 to get him out. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges were dropped last week, two days after ``60  
Minutes'' arrived to do a story on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor offered no apologies for his zero-tolerance stand  
in the case of Anthony, who never knew his father and whose mother 
died in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``You do not cherry-pick the cases, you do not say you feel  
sorry for this person because there's a developmental disability or 
this person has had a bad family life so we won't charge him as an 
adult,'' said Mike Edmondson, a spokesman for Palm Beach County 
prosecutor Barry Krischer. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to drop the charges of strong-arm robbery,  
extortion and petty theft Thursday had nothing to do with ``60 
Minutes,'' Edmondson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-year-old victim changed his story and his new version did  
not back up the severity of the charges, Edmondson explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The child originally told police he felt threatened and in fear  
of physical harm when Anthony demanded his money during art class 
Dec. 1 at a Boynton Beach middle school. Later, he said he did not 
feel he was in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	State law gives prosecutors authority to decide which juveniles  
are treated as adults. Edmondson said in Palm Beach County, the 
policy is to treat as adults all offenders who are at least 14 and 
have committed a felony. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it is automatic, they've got a lot of holes in their zero-  
tolerance policy,'' said John Walsh, an attorney with the Juvenile 
Advocacy Project who was appointed by a court to represent Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony did not deny taking the money. He said he was hungry and  
used the money to buy candy, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
	``You scan the country, you rarely find cases this outrageous,''  
said Dan Macallair, associate director of the Justice Policy 
Institute in San Francisco. ``This particular prosecutor is 
prosecuting kids in adult court that probably shouldn't even have 
gotten past the school principal.''

<HEADLINE> Steven Tyler Sues His Ex-Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Steven Tyler, lead singer of the rock band  
Aerosmith, has sued his ex-wife in an attempt to make her return 
photographs taken of him in the nude. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyler, whose last name is Tallarico, said Kathleen Tallarico was  
supposed to give him the photos as part of their divorce agreement 
in 1987. Last summer, he said he saw a news item indicating she 
planned to publish ``pornographic'' pictures in a memoir. 
</P>
<P>
	State Supreme Court Justice Walter Tolub on Monday granted a  
temporary restraining order that blocks publication of the 
photographs until the issue is settled at trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tallarico, an actress, intended to use the photos in the  
paperback edition of a book about her life titled ``Dream On,'' 
said her lawyer, Jay Butterman. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyler's lawyer, Stanford Lotwin, said the next step is a trial  
where ``we'll try to get Steven's property back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyler, 50, said in court papers that publication of the photos  
would embarrass and harm him, and she has no right to use pictures 
of him for commerce without his permission. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tallarico said she gave Tyler all of his personal  
photographs at the time of the divorce agreement and that the 
dispute centers on ``one of two campy photographs that he and I 
took of each other ... in the buff.''

<HEADLINE> Bad Funds Yield Good Lessons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- You can learn a lot about a mutual fund, and  
your investment in it, when the fund struggles through a spell of 
poor performance. 
</P>
<P>
	In happy times of high returns, people may not bother to ask  
tough questions, either of a fund manager or themselves. The net 
asset value is rising -- all is right with the world. 
</P>
<P>
	But investors' minds take a much more inquisitive turn when a  
fund investment isn't paying off, especially if the market, as 
measured by the popular averages, seems to be doing fine, but your 
fund for some reason is lagging behind. 
</P>
<P>
	That has been happening with many funds in the past year, given  
the unusual market climate in which a select few stocks are shining 
while most others have barely broken even, or worse. Soaring 
Internet stocks convey the impression that a bull market is running 
rampant, and new highs in the blue-chip-dominated indexes reinforce 
that idea. 
</P>
<P>
	But disappointment has been the common experience among owners  
of so-called value funds, mid-cap and small-cap funds, 
international funds, growth and income funds, balanced funds -- in 
short, the majority of all stock funds -- that have failed to keep 
pace with the blue chips or the technology indexes. 
</P>
<P>
	In circumstances such as these, some important questions arise:  
Should the manager of a fund stand firm in his or her strategy, or 
overhaul the portfolio to try to adapt to changing times? 
</P>
<P>
	And how do you as a fund investor respond? Do you sit back  
patiently, reaffirming your confidence in the manager's long-term 
approach, or do you subject the fund to a stern reappraisal? 
</P>
<P>
	That may lead you to a bit of self-examination: Did you get into  
this fund in the first place because its style fit your needs and 
temperament, or were you dazzled by past-performance numbers? If 
you realize that you never took the trouble to understand how a 
fund and its manager operate, now is a good time to remedy that 
omission. 
</P>
<P>
	As Martin Whitman, manager of the Third Avenue Funds and a famed  
``value'' advocate, put it recently, ``You're better served if you 
try to understand what we do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the questions we have been asking don't always have a  
single right answer. Depending on a fund manager's whole approach, 
one situation may be a good time to stand fast and another to clean 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	At the largest fund of them all, Fidelity Magellan, the  
sponsoring firm responded to a period of underperformance a couple 
of years ago by changing managers, and the new one, Robert Stansky, 
overhauled the entire portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Magellan's latest performance numbers are coming in better  
than the S&AMP;P 500's gains, and everybody seems happy again. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, managers of many value and small-cap funds have  
made few or no changes in the way they do things, while they try to 
ride out a market climate hostile to their specialties. 
</P>
<P>
	They reason that if they don't stick to their guns now, their  
whole strategies will be negated. Said Jean-Marie Eveillard of the 
SoGen Funds, a long-established manager whose preferences for 
value, smaller companies and international investing yielded few 
positive results in 1998:

	``With the benefit of hindsight, should we have changed our

1998 that one might think this is the way the world usually works. 
It isn't.

<P>
	``Because of the market action in 1998, small-company stocks are  
at record discounts to big companies. Discounts like this always go 
back to equilibrium over time.''

<HEADLINE> IOC To Get Final Recommendations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One case remains to be resolved among members of  
the International Olympic Committee under investigation in the Salt 
Lake bribery scandal, the chief investigator says. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice president Dick Pound refused Monday to identify the member  
whose case is still being debated by his six-man panel, or to say 
what recommendations the inquiry would make on any of the 19 IOC 
members under review. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel will holds its final conference call today, ``and I  
hope we can come to substantial closure,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission then will send its recommendations to the IOC's  
ruling executive board, probably in a conference call on Wednesday, 
with the board announcing its actions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is one case on which we have not come to a resolution,''  
Pound said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	He would not say what the odds were of coming to a final  
decision on that case or if the inquiry commission would send its 
recommendations to the board if that case remained unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members already have resigned or been expelled in the  
worst scandal in IOC history. Three other members, including 
executive board member Kim Un-yong, remained under investigation 
after that initial phase of the inquiry, and 16 more names were 
added after a Salt Lake ethics panel report into the vote-buying 
that surrounded the city's winning quest for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound earlier described the latest list of offenses as far less  
serious than the first batch. 
</P>
<P>
	The five members ousted by the executive board in January, along  
with any other recommended for expulsion this week, will have to go 
before a special IOC general assembly in Lausanne, Switzerland, 
March 17-18 to try to win reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch has sent weekly  
letters to all members, explaining the status of the string of 
investigations into the alleged corruption and the changes in 
structure and rules that will be proposed next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Those reforms are expected to include an end to the wide-open  
campaigning by cities hoping to stage the Olympics, beginning with 
June's vote for the 2006 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said a proposal for a review panel to narrow the six-city  
field to two finalists, then have the full membership quickly vote 
on the winner was among the plans that could be recommended by the 
executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	The board originally had proposed stripping the membership of  
any vote but backed off that plank after a rank-and-file rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are canvassing the people involved to get a handle on what  
is the right thing to do,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC leaders also are undecided on how to conduct a crucial vote  
of confidence on Samaranch. Although it's certain that the 
membership will vote for the 78-year-old Spaniard to remain in 
power, IOC officials are uncertain whether to have a secret ballot 
or public acclamation. 
</P>
<P>
	With the world closely watching every move the IOC makes in the  
wake of its biggest corruption scandal, officials expect the 
committee will be criticized no matter what procedure is used. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC members told The Associated Press that the confidence  
question is still being debated among the general membership and 
the leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has been canvassing the opinions of IOC members and is  
expected to settle on a formula later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``What counts is not the system,'' executive board member  
Jacques Rogge said. ``What counts is whether (Samaranch) can have 
broad support, and I believe he will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those seeking a public endorsement want Samaranch to give an  
opening statement to the assembly. The IOC's longest-serving 
member, Joao Havelange of Brazil, would then take the floor and ask 
the members to acclaim Samaranch by applause. 
</P>
<P>
	A secret ballot might be more democratic because it allows  
members to vote free of outside pressure. But it could also be seen 
as lacking accountability at a time when the IOC is being urged to 
become more open. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever we do, we will be criticized,'' Rogge said.

<HEADLINE> Engineer Uses Internet for Weather / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (AP) -- At first glance, Chris Peek doesn't  
look like he belongs in agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	With a tuft of white hair protruding beneath his cap and thick  
glasses sitting precariously on his nose, he resembles more an 
absent-minded professor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no experience in agriculture. I couldn't grow grass on  
my lawn,'' Peek said, harking back to 1983, when he moved in a 
rented motor home from Andover, Mass., to Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
	But this 78-year-old engineer, who worked at GTE for decades, is  
beginning to make a name for himself in the heart of California's 
farm country. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last 16 years, Peek has been developing and marketing an  
interactive weather station, a long pole with an antenna and 
thermometer on top and a metal box and a solar panel below. 
</P>
<P>
	The design looks simple, but there's enough hardware inside to  
detect temperature, humidity, wind direction, the sun's radiation 
and rainfall. It stands 35 feet tall and is powered by batteries 
recharged by solar cells. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's not his weather station that sets Peek apart from  
others who record climate information for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Peek provides an Internet home page where growers can get  
real-time information on such requirements as when to irrigate or 
spray pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	The process is interactive.  
</P>
<P>
	Each grower puts in information as to what he grows, the size of  
the growing area and how many plants or trees are in each plot. 
</P>
<P>
	Peek's weather stations, scattered from Fresno County in central  
California to Ventura County in the south, gather the information. 
The mainframe computer in Peek's south Bakersfield office does the 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes it easy to judge when to irrigate or spray for  
insects,'' said Cliff Trotter, a citrus grower in Arvin who has 
used Peek's service for eight years. ``It takes much of the 
guesswork out of what we do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peek admits that it wasn't easy in the beginning to sell his  
idea to growers. ``It took about four or five years before we could 
really make a living at it,'' Peek said. 
</P>
<P>
	His business has stabilized, and more are signing up, thanks to  
the Internet, which he started using only about three or four years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, farmers had to use their computers to call  
individual weather stations and operate the software to calculate 
the figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the process is much easier.  
</P>
<P>
	``All they have to do is go on the Internet, and we'll do all  
the complicated calculations for them,'' Peek said. ``If a farmer 
doesn't know how to get on the Internet, all he has to do is ask 
his kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's the similar case with Peek. His son, David, developed the  
software which controls the weather stations and calculates the 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the Internet, Peek gathers information from his 30  
weather stations, plus about 150 stations owned and operated by the 
state Department of Water Resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers rents weather stations for $29.50 per month per machine.  
If a farmers wants to own one, Peek will install it for $950, plus 
$75 a month to maintain it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have one in your own field, you can get information  
that's specific to your situation,'' he said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Police Arrest Senior Basque Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Police arrested the head of the military wing of  
the Basque separatist group ETA in Paris today, the same day 
Spain's prime minister began a visit to the French capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Police detained Javier Arizcuren-Ruiz, known as ``Kantauri,'' as  
he left a hotel in east Paris. Three other alleged ETA members were 
arrested with him and two were picked up in an apartment in 
southwest Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Kantauri, under investigation for an alleged role in 18 killings  
during ETA's armed struggle, is accused of ordering the failed 1995 
assassination of King Juan Carlos of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	ETA -- the initials in the Basque language for Basque Homeland  
and Freedom -- has killed nearly 800 people during its 31-year 
campaign for independence from Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests are a coup for the Spanish government, at least over  
the short term. But they could provoke a backlash, especially among 
young ETA supporters, who have carried out low-level street 
violence recently in the Basque country. 
</P>
<P>
	``ETA usually has people ready to take over as leader, but we do  
not know if there is anyone in line this time. It is too early to 
say,'' Spanish Interior Ministry spokesman Fernando Delgado said of 
the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	The apartment in Paris where two of the arrests were made is  
suspected of being a logistical center for the ETA movement in the 
French capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The five men and one woman who were arrested had been under  
surveillance this week and were armed, police said. Spain said it 
would seek the extradition of at least four of them, including 
Kantauri. 
</P>
<P>
	ETA has been observing a truce since Sept. 18, and there has  
been speculation it will announce a definitive cease-fire this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the truce, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has  
said he is willing to hold peace talks with ETA, but has refused to 
consider discussing its demand of secession from Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman arrested today -- Irantzu Gallastegui Sodupe -- is  
accused of participating in the killings of Basque politicians 
Fernando Mugica and Miguel Angel Blanco. 
</P>
<P>
	The four other people arrested were identified as Jesus Maria  
Puy Lecumberry, Mikel Zubimendi Besarasategui, Jose Ignacio Herranz 
Bilbao and Juan Maria Sampedro Blanco. 
</P>
<P>
	Aznar was meeting today with French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin  
and President Jacques Chirac. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about ETA's truce in an interview in today's edition of  
the French daily Le Monde, Aznar said that ``every day without a 
death is a step forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But it would be very naive to think that after 30 years of  
terrorism everything can be resolved in a few weeks,'' he was 
quoted as saying. ``But I hope it will be solved over the next 10 
years.''

<HEADLINE> Winds Delay World Cup Skiing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIERRA NEVADA, Spain (AP) -- The weather again failed to  
cooperate for a major ski event in Spain's southern Sierra Nevada 
range, site of this week's World Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Men's and women's downhills scheduled for Tuesday were called  
off due to high winds on the course. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers decided to schedule both downhill races on Wednesday  
and will also need to squeeze in a morning men's training session. 
</P>
<P>
	With forecasts of snow later in the week, organizers had hoped  
to run the two downhills on Tuesday, a day earlier than planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the schedule is back to the original with the downhills  
set for Wednesday and two super-Gs on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Winds reached 55 mph Tuesday with the possibility of snow on  
Wednesday and more wind. The forecast is much the same for Thursday 
and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first time unpredictable weather has affected ski  
races here, where the highest peak in continental Spain reaches 
11,424 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of poor weather during a World Cup final in 1993,  
organizers replaced a men's downhill with a slalom -- easier and 
less dangerous to stage -- causing miffed technical skiers to go on 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Gloomy forecasts in a World Cup in 1994 drove officials to  
advance all the women's races. And the world championships in 1995 
were wiped out altogether because of a lack of snow and held a year 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	With forecasts predicting foul weather until the weekend, the  
downhills -- the most delicate to stage -- could be in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the men's and women's World Cup downhill titles have  
already been decided, with Norway's Lasse Kjus and Austria's Renate 
Goetschl gaining unbeatable leads last week. 
</P>
<P>
	But the outcome of the last men's downhill still carries  
enormous importance for the three Olympic champions in a battle for 
the Cup overall crown. 
</P>
<P>
	While Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer managed to lock up the  
women's overall title last Saturday, Hermann Maier is fighting to 
overtake Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway and teammate Kjus. 
</P>
<P>
	With four races remaining, Aamodt leads the overall rankings  
with 1,267 points, with Kjus trailing by just eight points, and 
Maier by another 17.

<HEADLINE> Stranded Seamen Brought Ashore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ISABEL, Texas (AP) -- The last 12 crew members stranded  
aboard a Pakistani cargo ship for nearly a year since its owner 
went bankrupt were finally brought ashore today. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Maqsood Ahmed and 11 crew members of the Delta Pride were  
rescued by new owners who plan to sell the rusting ship for scrap. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are very elated. The tears are coming from their eyes,''  
Ahmed said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing they'll want is to feel land beneath their  
feet. Two or three of my men thought they'd never stand on land 
again,'' he said by cellular phone as they were coming in to port. 
They arrived on South Padre Island about 11 a.m. and were to be 
taken to a homeless shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Once more money arrives, they will be returned home for the  
first time in as much as two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The 740-foot Delta Pride dropped anchor about four miles off  
shore two days before Thanksgiving. The Coast Guard didn't allow it 
to enter Brownsville because the vessel and the crew lacked proper 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	All the paperwork had been seized by Mexican officials because  
of a financial dispute after the vessel's owner, Tri-star Shipping 
Lines of Karachi, Pakistan, filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship spent almost six months offshore from Tampico, Mexico.  
Crew members had to collect rain water and catch fish to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahmed said he decided to head to the United States after  
discovering a $10 bill and being inspired by the words ``In God We 
Trust.'' The crew scrounged together enough fuel for the 260-mile 
voyage to Texas, where shipping companies and others provided food 
and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Greater Houston Pakistani Association also sent supplies and  
helped fund trips home for 11 crew members. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship was auctioned for $300,000 to ESCO, a North Carolina  
company, paving the way for the remaining crew members to set foot 
on land today.

<HEADLINE> Terrapins' Stokes Can Really Dish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- Terrell Stokes sacrificed his future in  
basketball to make Maryland a better team this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes, a senior point guard, hasn't put up the kind of numbers  
that impress NBA scouts. He's averaging a mere 4.2 points and has 
taken only 21 free throws in 31 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he's just as indispensable as any of the Terrapins'  
high-profile players, mainly because of his willingness to 
distribute the ball to gunners such as Steve Francis, Laron Profit 
and Terence Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's done a great job of casting aside his personal goals for  
the betterment of the team. That's something that only a mature 
person can do,'' Profit said. ``He's a true point guard who looks 
to pass, pass, pass. That's something on this team we really 
appreciate because there are a lot of guys here who look to shoot, 
shoot, shoot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the unselfish Stokes leading the way, No. 5 Maryland will  
begin its quest to reach the Final Four of the NCAA tournament for 
the first time in school history against Valparasio on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes ranks seventh on the Terrapins in scoring this season but  
is second in minutes and leads with 198 assists. That's exactly 
what coach Gary Williams was looking for when he made Stokes his 
starting point guard ahead of Francis, an adept playmaker in his 
own right. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coach gave me the ball and told me, `We're going to go as  
far as you take us.' I accepted that role, and now we're going to 
try to go three more weeks,'' Stokes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes does occasionally unleash a 3-pointer -- he has 26 baskets  
from beyond the arc. But he usually operates in the background, 
looking to gather assists and victories rather than points and 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Terrell Stokes I'm embarrassed that the rest of the  
media, the rest of the coaches and the rest of the people have not 
admired what he has done,'' Clemson coach Larry Shyatt said. ``He's 
a guy who has not only molded his team but has played to his 
strengths without regard for his own numbers. Most adults would not 
do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes still entertains thoughts about playing in the NBA, but  
he knows the odds are against him. After all, there isn't much of a 
demand for 6-foot guards who average four points per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I can worry about now is my college career. You  
can't think about the NBA now,'' he said. ``Nobody makes it there 
easy; if it doesn't happen, then you just find something else you 
do well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toward that end, Stokes has made provisions for himself in case  
his career in competitive basketball ends this month. An accounting 
major, he will graduate in August and then take his CPA test. 
</P>
<P>
	``My ultimate goal would be to play in the NBA. But that's why  
you go to school, to fall back on something in case you don't reach 
that goal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	First things first.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've proven we could play with anyone in the country, beating  
teams like North Carolina and Stanford and UCLA,'' he said. ``Now 
we've got to prove it all over again.''

<HEADLINE> Bad Hearts and Stress Can Be Deadly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Speaking in public may be more than just  
terrifying. The stress may be deadly. 
</P>
<P>
	A study released Tuesday found that people whose hearts show  
ominous signs of poor circulation during such mental challenges 
face triple the usual risk of death in the years to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Often people with bad hearts suffer chest pain during exertion.  
Their clogged arteries cannot supply enough blood to their heart 
muscle. But over the past decade, it has become clear that mental 
exertion can also overwork the heart, although often without pain. 
Doctors call this condition silent ischemia. 
</P>
<P>
	While doctors assume that silent ischemia is not a good thing,  
no studies until now have been large enough to prove that mental 
stress can actually be fatal for people with coronary artery 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest study demonstrates just how dangerous this can be for  
the heart. It found the annual death rate is about 4 percent among 
people whose hearts have bad circulation during mental stress. This 
is more than triple the risk faced by heart disease patients who do 
not react this way to mental stress. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, the researchers found that public speaking is a  
particularly potent trigger of this heart problem. However, they 
said that probably anything that causes mental stress is risky for 
these people. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, conducted by Dr. David S. Sheps of East Tennessee  
State University, was presented in New Orleans at a meeting of the 
American College of Cardiology. 
</P>
<P>
	``As doctors, we all have had patients for whom we have no doubt  
that an acutely stressful situation has precipitated a cardiac 
event,'' Sheps said. 
</P>
<P>
	To help understand how this happens, the researchers gave three  
days of tests to 173 men and women with heart disease. They were 
asked to imagine that a relative had been mistreated in a nursing 
home. Then they were given two minutes to prepare a speech about 
the problem and five minutes to deliver it before an audience. 
</P>
<P>
	People's blood pressure typically soared about 40 points.  
Radionucleotide scanners watched their hearts. In half the 
volunteers, sections of the muscle of the left ventricle began to 
beat erratically. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven of them died during three to four years of follow-up.  
Forty-four percent of these victims had shown the erratic 
heartbeats during public speaking, while 18 percent did not. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheps said those whose hearts reacted badly on the test seemed  
no more nervous or tongue-tied than those who weathered the stress 
without problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people do not have sudden death during public speaking,''  
noted Dr. Bernard Gersh of the Mayo Clinic. Instead, the study 
identified people with a heightened response to stresses that may 
lead to a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier studies have shown that such hardships as depression,  
the death of a spouse, losing a job or living through an earthquake 
increase the risk of fatal heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	However, those studies did not test victims ahead of time for  
silent ischemia during mental stress. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was financed by the National Heart, Lung and Blood  
Institute.

make it four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to go out there and win our fourth championship and go  
out in style,'' said Holdsclaw, who on Tuesday became the first 
three-time selection to The Associated Press women's All-America 
first team. 
</P>
<P>
	Jolly, an honorable mention All-America, puts it even more  
simply. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to go out as winners,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jolly and Holdsclaw seemingly had little in common when they  
arrived on the Tennessee campus as freshmen in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw, who is 6-foot-2 and black, learned her game playing  
against boys in New York City schoolyards. 
</P>
<P>
	Jolly, who is 5-10 and white, polished her game against her  
brothers and through hours of shooting alone in a school gym in 
rural Sparta, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both are quiet, soft-spoken, not extremely outgoing,'' Lady  
Vols coach Pat Summitt said. ``At times, I think both of them come 
across as being very shy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not on a basketball court. There they are fierce competitors who  
stay calm while feeding off each other. 
</P>
<P>
	They also are confident, as Jolly showed when she won her first  
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kellie told me when she was a freshman: `One down, three to  
go,''' Summitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Jolly is like a pit bull, with bruises and scrapes from  
diving for loose balls, Holdsclaw is quick and graceful, able to 
take over a game at any time. 
</P>
<P>
	She is Tennessee's career scoring leader -- male or female -- and  
needs only seven points to pass former Lady Vol Bridgette Gordon as 
the NCAA tournament's leading scorer. Seven more rebounds, and she 
will pass USC's Cheryl Miller as the tournament's rebounding 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw also has been voted the Final Four's MVP the past two  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm playing with the best basketball player in the world,''  
Jolly said of Holdsclaw. ``It's been fun. It's an honor and a 
privilege to play with her out on the court. She's very smooth and 
smart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jolly, a point guard who would like to coach someday, has a few  
records of her own, including most assists at a Final Four (20 in 
1997) and most assists in a title game (11, also in 1997). She also 
shares the mark for the NCAA's highest 3-point shooting percentage 
in a title game, hitting four of the five she took mostly from NBA 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
	She helped spark Tennessee to its 1997 title by returning from a  
badly sprained ankle to score a then-career-high 19 points in the 
Midwest Regional championship over Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not the typical vocal leaders -- `Do this, do that.' We  
try to lead by example,'' said Holdsclaw, the likely first pick in 
the upcoming WNBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	And that means not settling for anything less than a fourth  
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``If our defensive intensity is there, I don't think there's a  
team in America that can stop us,'' Holdsclaw said.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Rebels Accept Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Amid continued fighting in Kosovo,  
ethnic Albanian rebels were inching toward signing a U.S.-backed 
peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was told Monday by leaders of the  
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army that they accept the agreement and he 
urged them to take the next step and sign the deal, Hill's 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs have continued to oppose the deal, and the ethnic  
Albanians signing a deal would mean NATO could strike Serb-led 
Yugoslavia to halt the violence in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	With moderate Kosovo Albanian politicians already on board,  
efforts have focused on nailing down KLA approval of the deal, 
which would give autonomy to the ethnic Albanian-majority province 
of Serbia, but not full independence, for a three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect a signature shortly,'' Hill's spokesman, Philip  
Reeker said after Monday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill is expected to return to Kosovo today from neighboring  
Macedonia, where he is the U.S. ambassador, for more talks. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said  
key rebel leaders gave their blessing to the plan. But he stopped 
short of declaring it a breakthrough, mindful that a promise to 
sign Sunday never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, a Western diplomat, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said the rebels objected to several details of the 
agreement, including Russian participation in a NATO-led 
peacekeeping force and the requirement that the guerrillas 
surrender weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA has also been pressing for guarantees of a referendum on  
independence after three years -- a condition rejected by Yugoslavia 
as well as the United States and major European powers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs have long refused to accept the deal because it calls  
for 28,000 NATO peacekeeping troops in Kosovo, a southern province 
of Yugoslavia's dominant republic, Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic shrugged off  
the threat of NATO airstrikes and stood firm Monday in his 
opposition to any foreign troops to police the proposed settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	During a first round of peace talks last month in Rambouillet,  
France, ethnic Albanian negotiators said they needed time to sell 
the plan to the rebel rank-and-file. Hill's mission is part of a 
Western diplomatic offensive to win the rebels' signature before 
peace talks resume in Paris next week. 
</P>
<P>
	In the southwestern village of Jablanica, a key rebel commander,  
Ramush Hajredinaj, told The Associated Press that the KLA will 
never give up its weapons and that disbanding the force ``would be 
a big mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without the rebels, moderate ethnic Albanian politicians will  
not sign the deal. And without full cooperation from all Albanian 
factions, NATO cannot follow through on military threats aimed at 
forcing Milosevic to agree. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke was expected in Belgrade Wednesday  
to press Milosevic to accept the peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
	As diplomats sought a solution, international monitors reported  
new clashes Monday near the village of Kacanik near the border with 
Macedonia. The rebel Kosova Press news agency reported at least one 
killed and four wounded ethnic Albanian fighters and an unspecified 
number of casualties among Serbian security forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said Serb  
forces had attacked several villages in the northern Podujevo area 
for a second straight day, burning at least eight Albanian houses. 
The report could not be independently verified.

<HEADLINE> Auto Giant May Pull Out of Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Auto giant DaimlerChrysler has  
threatened to end its sponsorship of the Olympic Games because of 
the bribes scandal, according to a newspaper report Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler, the merged German-American company, makes the  
International Olympic Committee's car of choice, Mercedes-Benz, and 
has supplied luxury vehicles and cash to the IOC since 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler senior vice president Mattius Kleinert told the  
Sydney Morning Herald's Berlin correspondent that revelations of 
financial irregularities within the IOC and some National Olympic 
Committees were ``a betrayal of the spirit of the Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have said to the IOC that our continued support is  
conditional on you making a clear plan for creating complete 
transparency in your finances so everyone can see the money that 
goes in and the money that goes out so everything is completely 
open and the shadow is removed,'' the paper quoted Kleinert as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes-Benz is ingrained in IOC culture. When Sydney Olympics  
organizing committee president Michael Knight suggested IOC 
delegates catch a bus to the 2000 Games, IOC marketing boss Michael 
Payne threatened to bring over their own Mercedes-Benz limousines. 
</P>
<P>
	Kleinert told the Herald that DaimlerChrysler would decide on  
its continuing support after the IOC reports next week on the 
scandals which has engulfed it. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the company would ask for outside auditors to study the  
IOC's books if it was not happy with the report. 
</P>
<P>
	A major Olympic partner, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.,  
has criticized the IOC and said it will not use the Olympic rings 
as part of marketing programs until corruption is purged.

<HEADLINE> Singer George Jones Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Country singer George Jones was removed  
from a ventilator Tuesday and breathing on his own as he continued 
his remarkable recovery from a near-fatal accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that he's demonstrated very amply that he's made of  
tough stuff,'' Dr. Virginia Eddy said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the one hand, he's very sick, he's extremely fragile. But  
on the other hand, he's still doing better than I would have 
expected at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He likely will remain hospitalized for two or three more weeks,  
Eddy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 67, has been in critical condition since crashing his  
sport-utility vehicle Saturday. He was talking on a cellular phone 
when he slammed into a bridge a mile from his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' liver was deeply lacerated, a lung collapsed and he was  
near death when he was brought to Vanderbilt University Medical 
Center. Eddy said she has lost younger patients with similar 
injuries, but Jones is ``obviously a fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones has recorded such classics as ``He Stopped Loving Her  
Today'' and ``A Good Year for the Roses.''

<HEADLINE> Cyprus in Cheese Export Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MENIKO, Cyprus (AP) -- Her sleeves rolled up, 63-year-old  
Augustina Nichola crouches over a vat full of fresh goat milk. With 
a slow flame burning underneath, she uses her bare hands to stir. 
</P>
<P>
	Slowly, the milk begins to solidify and Nichola starts removing  
slabs of a creamy substance that she wraps in white cloths and 
places under square marble tiles to squeeze out any liquid that 
remains. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the way to make traditional halloumi cheese, the Cypriot  
delicacy that has for centuries been a staple on this eastern 
Mediterranean island. 
</P>
<P>
	Cypriots say halloumi is unique to the island but, as they try  
to export it, they've wound up in an international trademark 
battle. Other cheese makers -- faraway Danes -- say Cyprus' halloumi 
is much like other Mediterranean cheeses and thus deserves no 
special cachet. 
</P>
<P>
	Halloumi has a salty tang and its rubbery texture gives it an  
unusual property: it can be grilled or fried without melting. If 
made of goat milk only, as tradition dictates, it can keep for up 
to a year without refrigeration. 
</P>
<P>
	In the village of Meniko outside Nicosia, Nichola has been  
making halloumi for 18 years at a small farm with a herd of 300 
goats. It's a family business like hundreds of similar operations 
across the island. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined, they meet half the domestic demand for halloumi. The  
remainder of the $10 million local market is supplied by big 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We make it the traditional way,'' Nichola proudly declares,  
saying mass-produced halloumi is too moist and goes bad unless 
refrigerated because it also contains sheep and cow milk. 
</P>
<P>
	The steady stream of buyers at the farm in the foothills of the  
Troodos mountains testifies to the quality of her cheese. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't supply supermarkets or even small grocery stores.  
People just come here from Meniko and surrounding villages to 
buy,'' says Anna Kambari, part of the family that owns the farm 
where Nichola works. 
</P>
<P>
	Halloumi is almost a national symbol for Cyprus' 700,000 people.  
It is found in virtually every home, thanks to its surprisingly 
varied use -- Cypriots eat it fresh with watermelon and figs, use it 
in sandwiches and omelets, eat it grilled or fried, and even grate 
it for pasta dishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its versatility, the cheese remains little known in most  
of the world, but that's changing. 
</P>
<P>
	Halloumi is showing encouraging signs of turning into a growth  
export, with markets as far afield as the Persian Gulf, the United 
States, Brazil and West Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Cypriot exporters most want to break into the mainstream market  
in the United States and western Europe, where ethnic Greek and 
Middle Eastern communities remain the main halloumi buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Cyprus exported 2,240 tons of halloumi, nearly half to  
Arab countries. Only 91 tons went to the United States, where 
authorities in 1990 awarded Cyprus halloumi an exclusive trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have recently entered gourmet shops in selected U.S. cities  
in the hope that halloumi will be noticed and picked up by the big 
supermarket chains,'' said Mylonas Pittas. 
</P>
<P>
	His Pittas Dairy Industries has built a $20 million plant in  
hopes of expanding export sales. 
</P>
<P>
	But the way ahead for Cypriot halloumi depends in part on  
fending off assaults by rival producers in Turkey and Denmark. That 
means obtaining trademark recognition in Europe and preventing 
halloumi from becoming a generic name like, for example, Greece's 
feta cheese. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittas and Panicos Hadjicostas of the Christis dairy, another  
big concern, say cheese from Denmark and the Turkish-occupied north 
of Cyprus is competing with their halloumi in key markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Danish dairy producers have challenged the U.S. trademark  
awarded to Cyprus halloumi, and the case has dragged on for seven 
years, involving expert witnesses from Greece, Cyprus, Egypt and 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Droushiotis, head of the Cyprus trade office in the  
United States, said in a telephone interview from New York that a 
verdict in the halloumi case is expected soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the meantime,'' he said, ``a seven-ton trial shipment of  
halloumi is on its way to Brazil, where a large Arab community 
makes it an extremely promising market.''

<HEADLINE> FTC, Intel Reach Proposed Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Intel Corp., the world's largest maker of  
computer chips, appears to have dodged one bullet from federal 
antitrust enforcers, but a larger battle looms. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel and the Federal Trade Commission announced a proposed  
settlement of some of the agency's allegations Monday, on the eve 
of a hearing before an administrative law judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side would comment on details of the settlement, but  
Intel's president and chief executive officer, Craig Barrett, 
called the agreement a ``win-win'' situation. ``We are satisfied 
that the agreement gives us value for our intellectual property 
rights,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	FTC's attorneys ``got the relief that they wanted,'' said agency  
spokeswoman Victoria Streitfeld. At the same time, however, the 
agency said in a statement that ``there are remaining issues under 
investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Antitrust experts said the reference was to a much broader  
inquiry into Intel's practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a piece of a larger investigation where the FTC was  
looking into whether Intel used its market position to achieve 
dominance in related areas,'' said Kevin Arquit, a New York 
antitrust lawyer and former director of the FTC's Bureau of 
Competition. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, a settlement means the FTC will get what it wanted -- an  
order prohibiting Intel from withholding information from customers 
because of patent squabbles. The full commission must approve the 
settlement before it becomes official. It is expected to vote 
within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of those unusual situations where both sides can  
declare that they won,'' Arquit said. ``For Intel, the stakes were 
enormous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is because ``the last thing they need is for a government  
agency to label them a monopolist'' at a time when the company also 
faces private antitrust lawsuits, Arquit said. 
</P>
<P>
	In its June 8 complaint, the FTC argued that Intel holds a  
monopoly in the market for microprocessors, the ``brains'' of 
computers. Intel is the world's largest maker of microprocessors, 
with $26.2 billion in sales last year. About 80 percent of the 
world's computers run on Intel chips. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC claims Intel used that monopoly power to withhold key  
technical information about future microchips from three companies 
to punish them for refusing to license key patents to Intel without 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies were Digital Equipment Corp., Intergraph  
Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp., which now owns Digital. The 
patents were for microprocessors and related technologies made by 
the three firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel acknowledges it did most of what the FTC alleged. However,  
the company claimed those actions were not illegal and had not 
``chilled'' innovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Meadlock, Intergraph's chief executive officer, said he  
didn't know details of the settlement but hoped it would modify 
Intel's behavior toward competitors. He said the agreement holds no 
bearing on a separate, much broader lawsuit filed by Intergraph 
against Intel alleging antitrust violations and patent 
infringement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the concessions of the settlement indicates that at  
least the antitrust issues in our lawsuit had validity,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Sober Message at Movie Trade Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Skyrocketing production costs and huge  
paychecks for stars and directors threaten the movie industry even 
at a time of record box office grosses, the head of 20th Century 
Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in a time of great promise and yet we are perhaps faced  
with greater problems,'' said Bill Mechanic, chairman and CEO of 
Fox Filmed Entertainment, at the start Monday of the industry's 
biggest trade show. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual ShoWest convention offers theater owners sneak movie  
previews, seminars, an all-star awards show and a peek at the 
biggest technological innovation in the industry since the 
invention of the movie projector: digital cinema. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie industry last year enjoyed record box office grosses  
and soaring attendance. But these gains have been countered by 
higher production and marketing costs, and financial problems by 
small and medium-sized theater chains. 
</P>
<P>
	Mechanic noted the problem in his luncheon speech, and said Fox  
is trying to rein in production costs, including money to the 
stars. ``The days of the $20 million (salary) with 20 percent 
against the gross may be coming to an end,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mechanic's remarks were notable since they came from the chief  
of the studio that co-produced ``Titanic,'' the most expensive 
movie in Hollywood history -- and the one with the highest box 
office grosses. Fox also is distributing what likely may be the 
biggest movie of 1999, the ``Star Wars'' prequel. 
</P>
<P>
	Mechanic made it clear that ``Titanic'' was an aberration, with  
production costs that others have estimated at more than $200 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ended up making 'Titanic' for an ungodly amount,'' he said.  
``But since then we haven't produced a single film for more than 
$70 million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And this includes, he said, last summer's special effects-laden  
films ``The X-Files'' and ``Dr. Dolittle,'' both box office hits. 
</P>
<P>
	As for high-priced stars, Mechanic noted that Fox struck gold  
with ``There's Something About Mary'' starring Ben Stiller and 
Cameron Diaz -- who didn't command top dollar at the time. Even 
Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet weren't the huge stars that 
``Titanic'' would eventually make them when they joined the sinking 
ship epic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But noting that Fox has movies coming out with Jodie Foster, Tom  
Hanks, Tom Cruise and DiCaprio, Mechanic said: ``I'm only 
cautioning against the overuse and over-dependence'' of expensive 
star vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Couch Not Only QB on Browns' List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Tim Couch has company atop the Cleveland  
Browns' list of players they might take with the No. 1 pick in the 
NFL draft. And it's not just Ricky Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	With a little more than a month left before they have to make a  
decision, and just two days before Couch will work out for them, 
the Browns have the Kentucky star and Oregon's Akili Smith rated as 
the top college quarterbacks available in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have (Couch) and Akili right next to each other,'' said  
Dwight Clark, Cleveland's director of football operations. ``Then 
according to how we continue to investigate, we'll see where 
(Syracuse's Donovan) McNabb and (UCLA's Cade) McNown and (Central 
Florida's Daunte) Culpepper fit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following a news conference to introduce left tackle Lomas  
Brown, who he called ``our leader on that side of the ball,'' Clark 
spent more than 20 minutes talking about what the Browns might do 
with their No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch, who has recently emerged as the frontrunner over  
Williams, is scheduled to hold a private workout for the Browns on 
Thursday in Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	The big knock on Couch, who decided to skip his senior year with  
the Wildcats for a chance to play in the NFL, is that he can't 
throw the deep pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark will get a chance to see for himself when he attends  
Couch's practice session along with Browns coach Chris Palmer and 
quarterbacks coach John Hufnagel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's questioning his arm strength,'' Clark said. ``I  
feel like his arm is plenty strong, but I can understand why people 
would have that concern because he does on occasion float a ball 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when he wants to throw it hard, he can. He can't throw it  
as hard as Akili Smith, I don't think. But he can throw it pretty 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without the Browns tipping their hand at whom they might take  
with the No. 1, there had been recent signs that Couch has inched 
ahead of Williams as Cleveland's preferred top choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is still in the mix, said Clark, but the Browns are  
still leaning toward a taking a quarterback with the top pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can get a quarterback that has the ability to be your  
leader and take you to the Super Bowl, you have to take that guy,'' 
Clark said. ``I don't think anybody could argue with that 
philosophy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark said although the Browns have Couch and Smith rated a  
notch above McNabb, McNown and Culpepper, he thinks four of those 
QBs could be taken in the first 10 picks of the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're all bunched together,'' Clark said of this year's  
class. ``They're really close to each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer was in Oregon on Tuesday for Smith's workout. Last month,  
Smith blew scouts away at the combines with his strong arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very unique thrower,'' Clark said. ``The ball comes out  
with big-time velocity and it's a real tight spiral, so it would 
cut right through the wind here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown also impressed the Browns, but not with his physical  
tools. Labeled too small by some, Clark thinks McNown has a certain 
intangible that can't be measured or timed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cade McNown has got something magical about him,'' Clark said.  
``He's a winner. He certainly has the demeanor. I think out of all 
the interviews he had the best. He's very confident in his 
ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A strong workout by Couch on Thursday could end months of  
speculation about the Browns' plans. If he is the franchise QB the 
Browns covet, will they make it known before the draft that they've 
begun negotiations?

	``I think it's conceivable,'' Clark said. ``I don't think we'll  
do that. But I think it's conceivable. I think you want to keep 
everyone guessing in case someone wants to offer you just an 
unbelievable blockbuster deal for that No. 1 pick.''

	Is there a chance Couch could fall off the Browns' board with a  
poor workout? 
</P>
<P>
	``He would have to really struggle with the 15- to 20-yard  
outs,'' Clark said. ``Then just not be able to throw the ball down 
the field. But I've seen him do that on tape, so I don't anticipate 
that happening.''

	Quarterbacks were the talk of the day, but don't forget  
Williams. After arriving at the combines more than 20 pounds 
overweight, Williams recently announced he is giving up baseball to 
concentrate on football full-time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may have him in for a visit,'' Clark said. ``I guess when  
you're making this kind of investment it would be nice to work him 
out and see everything first hand. But really, the guy rushed for 
2,000 yards and did it year after year. So there's not that many 
questions about him.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks End Morning Session Up / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Stock prices advanced Wednesday morning as  
investors were reassured after moves by two major Japanese 
companies to restructure their operations. The dollar remained 
lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average rose 165.29 points, or 1.09 percent,  
ending the morning session at 15,261.99. On Tuesday, the index 
climbed 317.65 points, or 2.15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.06 yen at midday, down 0.70 yen from late  
Tuesday in Tokyo but slightly above its level of 121.00 yen in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices rose as investors welcomed the  
restructuring news, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan Tobacco announced late Tuesday that it was buying the  
international tobacco operations of RJR Nabisco for $7.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony's announcement Tuesday that it would undertake aggressive  
restructuring also encouraged Japanese investors, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the moves prompted belief that Japanese companies are  
becoming more aggressive about restructuring, and thus helping the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar edged lower against the yen  
following the morning gains in Japanese stocks as well as a surge 
in the benchmark 10-year government bond yield, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	But investors avoided major moves ahead of Thursday's release by  
the Finance Ministry of a survey on corporate sentiment and private 
capital expenditure for the October-December quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 14.62 points, or 1.26 percent, to 1,177.13. 
The TOPIX rose 14.76 points, or 1.29 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.52 yen, down  
from 132.28 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.750  
percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.700 percent, driving its price 
down to 100.39 yen from 100.80 yen.

<HEADLINE> Monica Yields Big Ratings for ABC / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Thanks to Barbara Walters and Monica Lewinsky,  
ABC chalked up its best week in the ratings in nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter's interview with Ms. Lewinsky had an average viewership  
of 48.5 million last Wednesday, more than twice as many viewers as 
any other prime-time show last week, Nielsen Media Research said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's 10.1 rating and 16 share for the week easily topped CBS,  
which had a 9.0 rating and 15 share. NBC was third with an 8.6 and 
14. Fox had a 6.7 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
	It was ABC's best week since March 23, 1998, when it broadcast  
the Academy Awards, which were a big night for ``Titanic.'' ABC 
hadn't won any week in the ratings since November. 
</P>
<P>
	``Home Improvement,'' ending a two-part episode in which Jill  
had a hysterectomy, finished a strong fifth place in the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	With the sweeps period over, NBC reverted to reruns for its  
typically strong Thursday night lineup. That particularly hurt 
``ER,'' which slipped to ninth place. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' won the evening news race with an  
8.5 rating and 17 share. NBC's ``Nightly News'' was second at 8.4 
and 17, while the ``CBS Evening News'' trailed with a 7.1 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of March 1-7, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were ``20/20,'' ABC, 33.4; ``Friends,'' NBC, 15.2; 
``Touched by an Angel,'' CBS, 15.1; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 14.8; 
``Frasier,'' NBC, 14.3; ``Home Improvement,'' ABC, 14.3; ``Just 
Shoot Me'' Special, NBC 13.6; ``Jesse,'' NBC, 13.1; ``ER,'' NBC, 
12.2; ``Drew Carey Show,'' ABC, 11.8.

<HEADLINE> 4th-Quarter Productivity Is Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The productivity of American workers surged at  
the fastest pace in six years at the end of 1998. Healthy gains in 
productivity throughout the year gave Americans their biggest 
after-inflation pay increase in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Productivity -- the output per hour of work of nonfarm,  
non-supervisory workers -- raced ahead at a 4.6 percent annual rate 
during the final three months of last year, driven by computers and 
other high-tech innovations. That was the best rate since the 
fourth quarter of 1992 and even better than the 3.7 percent 
estimated a month ago, the Labor Department said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, productivity grew by 2.2 percent, up significantly  
from 1.2 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts debate how much of the pickup is a temporary reflection  
of the stronger economic growth of recent years, and how much an 
underlying cause of the improved, inflation-free growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Whichever, it's good news.  
</P>
<P>
	``Productivity gains really determine the standard of living in  
a country,'' said economist Sung Won Sohn of Wells Fargo Co. ``We 
can go all the way back to the 1800s and show a very close 
correlation between America's standard of living, as measured by 
inflation-adjusted wage gains, and productivity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sizable gains mean companies can pay their workers more while  
still holding the line on prices and delivering increased profits 
to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, for instance, inflation-adjusted hourly wages and  
benefits jumped 2.6 percent. That's more than double the 1.2 
percent increase in 1997 and the largest since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the growth in unit labor costs, a key  
barometer of underlying inflation pressures, slowed. Those costs 
rose 1.9 percent, compared with 2.3 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Employees are now reaping the benefits of the surging  
economy,'' said economist Mark Zandi of Regional Financial 
Associates in West Chester, Pa. ``Both continued productivity gains 
and the exceedingly tight labor market are allowing employees to 
garner a bigger share of the increasing economic pie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. economy once enjoyed stellar productivity growth, at a  
nearly 3 percent rate in the 1960s and early 1970s. But it slowed 
to an anemic 1 percent rate from 1974 through 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, it's averaged about 2 percent a year, leading some  
economists to speculate that the economy has embarked on a new era 
of productivity growth as businesses become increasingly skilled at 
making new technology pay off. 
</P>
<P>
	``A remarkable element of our recent prosperity has been the  
rapid acceleration in the application of computer and 
telecommunications technologies, which have engendered a 
significant increase in productivity,'' Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan said in a speech Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It's difficult to pin down, but some calculations suggest the  
rate of return on new equipment investments in recent years ``has 
moved up markedly,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts also believe last year's solid productivity growth  
bodes well for the economy's ability this year to extend the 
longest peacetime expansion in U.S. history while keeping inflation 
contained, without an interest rate increase by the Federal 
Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alan Greenspan seems ... inclined ... to believe that  
something structurally important is going on in productivity, and 
it makes him much less nervous about a resurgence of inflation,'' 
said economist David Orr of First Union Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Even at factories, many of them hard-hit by the loss of export  
sales to Asia and other struggling parts of the world, productivity 
increased a strong 4.2 percent in 1998, down from a five-year high 
of 4.9 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In the manufacturing of durable goods -- items from cars to  
computers expected to last three or more years -- productivity 
surged 6.8 percent, the biggest advance since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	The ability of manufacturers to maintain, and in many cases  
improve, productivity reflects their determination to operate 
efficiently in the face of lost sales abroad. That, in turn, has 
caused the loss of more than 337,000 jobs since March.

<HEADLINE> Silas Becomes Hornets Head Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) -- Paul Silas wanted to be a head coach  
again in the NBA. He didn't want it to come this way. 
</P>
<P>
	Silas was named the Charlotte Hornets' interim coach Monday, one  
day after the resignation of Dave Cowens, his close friend, former 
boss and ex-teammate with the Boston Celtics in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good man and I'm sorry to see him go,'' Silas said of  
Cowens, who led the Hornets to consecutive 50-victory seasons in 
his first two years in Charlotte. But Cowens became increasingly 
frustrated with owner George Shinn's unwillingness to give him a 
raise or pay top dollar to talented players. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Hornets turned to Silas, 55, the only one of Cowens'  
three assistants with NBA head coaching experience, to try to 
revive a franchise beset by poor play, weak leadership, injuries 
and falling attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't even worry about that,'' Silas said. ``All I can do is  
coach the 12 guys that I have and let the chips fall where they 
may.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn is the target of a lawsuit accusing him of unwanted sexual  
advances, and some fans are calling on him to sell the team. 
Injuries have sidelined the team's best two players, and one of 
them, leading scorer Glen Rice, is the subject of ongoing trade 
talks with the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Considering those circumstances, Silas acknowledged, his new job  
doesn't exactly look like the chance of a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I've been through tougher,'' he said. ``When you coach the  
Clippers, it's much tougher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silas coached the Clippers when they were located in San Diego  
from 1980-83, compiling a 78-168 mark. He has been an NBA assistant 
for most of the past 12 years, including the last two seasons in 
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	When Cowens told him of his plans to quit Sunday, Silas tried to  
talk him out of it. But Cowens would not relent, and the Hornets 
turned to Silas, whose 16-year playing career ended in 1980 and 
included championships with Boston (1974, 1976) and Seattle (1979). 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm honored that the Hornets asked me,'' said Silas, who also  
interviewed last summer for head-coaching vacancies in Chicago, 
Sacramento and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth coach in Charlotte's 11-year history, Silas makes his  
debut tonight when the Hornets play at home against the Celtics. 
Silas said he's holding out hope that Charlotte (4-11) can rally in 
the final two months of the lockout-shortened season and make the 
playoffs for the third year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where this thing is going, who the heck knows?'' he said.  
``Hopefully miracles do happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte's players don't seem to be bothered by the fact that  
Silas has had a 16-year layoff between head-coaching stints. 
</P>
<P>
	``They still run the same plays,'' forward J.R. Reid said.  
``Plays in the league haven't changed, believe me. That doesn't 
matter at all. Paul's a people person, and that has a lot to do 
with it nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
	``The X's and O's aren't everything. Some of the best X's and  
O's coaches can't get along with their players. Paul is different 
in that we all know him, he knows the game and he knows the 
personalities of the players, having been one himself. We're 
looking forward to having him as the coach.''

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Warns of Cyber-Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top Pentagon official warned Congress of an  
``electronic'' Pearl Harbor by cyber-terrorists and said the target 
is more likely to be commercial than military. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though its computer network is penetrated by computer  
hackers as often as 10 to 15 times a day, the Defense Department 
thinks it has done a good job of protecting vital national security 
interests, Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the Senate Armed Services Committee that all the  
computer intrusions so far have been against nonsensitive portions 
of the Pentagon computer system. 
</P>
<P>
	``To our knowledge, we have never been penetrated on our  
classified networks,'' Hamre said. ``We can protect the Department 
of Defense, and I think we've done a great deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he was increasingly worried about the vulnerability  
of commercial and financial interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``And this Pearl Harbor's going to be different,'' Hamre said.  
``It's not going to be against Navy ships sitting in a Navy 
shipyard; it's going to be against commercial infrastructure, and 
we don't control that. And there's been little progress on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Pentagon has made much headway over the past few  
years in beefing up its surveillance system. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamre told a closed-door congressional briefing late last month  
that a new, potentially more damaging method of penetrating the 
Pentagon's computer system had been detected recently, according to 
participants who spoke later on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	A military computer server near San Antonio was probed for  
several days in January by hackers who entered the system through 
an overseas site on the Internet, the sources said. The intrusions 
were detected by the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Dahlgren, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials later said that the penetrations had been  
foiled, although no suspects had been caught. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamre told Tuesday's Senate hearing that the Pentagon was  
monitoring all its computer-center networks 24 hours a day ``and 
we're able to get real-time detection'' of penetrations. 
</P>
<P>
	``And we're getting hit every day. We probably get 10, 15 a day  
at each of these centers, where people are trying to get in.'' He 
said most of the hits appeared harmless but ``some of them are 
serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the Pentagon has many computer experts at work to  
protect against hackers and computer viruses, Hamre cited the 
agency's biggest problem: losing computer experts to private 
industry. These experts earn up to $30,000 a year at the Pentagon, 
but companies are offering them $70,000 to $80,000, Hamre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Joseph Ralston, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  
told the panel the Pentagon had decided against recommending a new 
U.S.-based military command to deal exclusively with the terrorism 
issue, particularly a possible biological or chemical attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he said, Defense Secretary William Cohen would soon  
recommend to President Clinton the creation of a joint task force, 
made up of different services and agencies, to deal with terrorism 
threats. It and its commander would report to the Atlantic Command, 
based at Norfolk, Va., Ralston said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the committee chairman, said the nation  
``would be unforgiving'' if a terrorist attack occurred -- and it 
was later determined the government hadn't done enough to protect 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be ever-vigilant,'' Warner said, even it means  
building fewer warplanes or ships. ``This committee is prepared to 
do it, no matter what the cost.''

<HEADLINE> Darlington Raceway Might Add Lights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP) -- Darlington Raceway president Jim Hunter  
is all aglow about lighting up NASCAR's oldest superspeedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going after it this year,'' Hunter said Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Hunter will present the board of International Speedway Corp.,  
the track's owners, with a plan to permanently affix lights to the 
half-century-old layout. If the $2.9 million plan is approved, 
Hunter said he could run the TranSouth 400 under the lights by 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter says lights would spark an increase in attendance at race  
weekends, and maybe a decrease in those predicting Darlington's 
demise. The track has fought off rumors the past several years 
about its spring race being swiped by a gleaming new megatrack like 
Texas Motor Speedway or California Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would dispel the myth we're losing a race if we  
make that kind of investment,'' he said. ``As far as the mechanics 
go, we can turn it around (right now). It's a massive project.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Races at Charlotte, N.C., and Bristol, Tenn., have long been run  
at night. Daytona International Raceway, also owned by ISC, held 
its Pepsi 400 under the lights for the first time last October. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think, based on what happened at the Pepsi 400, if we  
announced tomorrow that we were going to have lights for next 
year's TranSouth, I think within three months we'd sell all the 
seats,'' Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers might not welcome the idea so readily at Darlington,  
considered one of the circuit's most challenging tracks. ``They've 
said to us, `Can you imagine how hard this will be at night?''' 
Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Next year's TranSouth could be run with Friday night qualifying  
and Saturday night racing, Hunter said. The same could happen for 
the Southern 500, one of NASCAR's crown jewel races run on Labor 
Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Night racing brings an after-work convenience to what had been a  
full weekend undertaking, Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter said it would be ``sheer speculation'' to comment on  
whether ISC would give him the green light. But the track has taken 
bids and could get moving on the project quickly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lights would go up on huge stanchions about 50 feet high  
surrounding the track. There would also be a bank on the inside of 
the track to make the place look like daytime at night, Hunter 
said. Construction could be complete in time for the 2000 TranSouth 
next March. 
</P>
<P>
	He said with lights in place, Darlington could attract other  
racing circuits and add racing weekends with the NASCAR Truck 
Series, the Dash Series and the Indy Racing League.

<HEADLINE> New Judge Resets Liggett Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- Attorneys set to wrap up a settlement of  
Liggett Group's tobacco litigation in an Alabama courtroom faced a 
new judge Tuesday who gave critics of the pact more time to 
re-examine the company's finances. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Robert Kendall, who received the case from Mobile  
Circuit Judge Braxton Kittrell, reset the fairness hearing for 
April 27. Kittrell is considering retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed settlement has drawn objections, including a claim  
that an Alabama judge has no jurisdiction to impose a class-action 
settlement on smokers nationwide. Kendall said he would hear 
arguments on the jurisdiction claim on April 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the pact contend it would be too beneficial to  
Liggett. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Liggett recently sold some of its cigarette brands,  
attorneys want a look at the company's annual report, due in April, 
before proceeding with the final settlement. The company's filing 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission should be available by 
the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
	Liggett first proposed the class-action settlement in Alabama  
two years ago, but the case was transferred to West Virginia, where 
it was rejected as overly ambitious by a federal judge. Plaintiffs' 
lawyers came back to state court in Alabama last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed class-action settlement, Liggett would  
cooperate with plaintiffs and their attorneys in lawsuits brought 
against other tobacco companies. Liggett is the smallest of the 
five major tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Liggett also would pay an amount equal to 7.5 percent of all its  
future sales into a fund that would be earmarked for compensating 
victims who have smoked its cigarettes, such as L&AMP;M, Lark and 
Chesterfield. If it fails to turn a profit in any given year -- and 
it hasn't posted net income for years -- the class is guaranteed $1 
million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Liggett also pledged to refrain from using outdoor or Internet  
advertising and would comply with regulations aimed at preventing 
youths from smoking. The proposal would place limits on the amount 
of damages that Liggett Group would pay to people claiming harm 
from the company's cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	Liggett attorney Marc Kasowitz of New York, while agreeing to  
provide new financial information, said the formula in the 
settlement took into account the chance the company's finances 
could improve. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, the company's parent, Miami-based Brooke Group  
Ltd., agreed to sell its L&AMP;M, Lark and Chesterfield brands to 
Philip Morris for $300 million. That would leave the company with 
Eve, its only remaining premium brand, and other discount brands 
including Pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance giant Blue Cross, hospitals in Missouri and  
Pennsylvania, and lawyers for individuals have voiced objections to 
the settlement.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Declares State of Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- President Jamil Mahuad declared a 60-day  
state of emergency in Ecuador on Tuesday amid a deep financial 
crisis and a looming nationwide strike by powerful leftist-led 
unions. 
</P>
<P>
	The decree allows the government to use the military to protect  
oil and electricity installations, limit public meetings and 
movement and order strikers back to work. 
</P>
<P>
	In a government news release Mahuad also announced that the  
unscheduled banking holidays he had declared for Monday and Tuesday 
to protect Ecuador's tumbling currency and bank deposits would be 
extended through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials said that on Thursday they may announce an  
economic plan to rescue this tiny Andean nation's economy, which 
saw its currency, the sucre, lose a quarter its value last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since several sectors have responded to the economic crisis  
with illegal work stoppages and calls for strikes that have a 
serious destabilizing effect, the government has decreed a national 
state of emergency,'' Interior Minister Vladimiro Alvarez said 
quoting the decree. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador's largest labor federation has called a national strike  
for Wednesday and Thursday to protest Mahuad's economic reforms, 
which have ended fuel subsidies and caused prices to soar. 
</P>
<P>
	State energy workers have threatened to block the supply of oil  
and electricity if Congress approves a bill to cut public spending. 
Protesting Indian groups have already started blocking roads in 
northern Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Ministry on Wednesday issued a communique denying  
allegations of discontent within the armed forces over the 
government's response to the economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador's bankers have charged that Mahuad was losing control of  
the economy after he ordered the unscheduled bank holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this moment, the government has lost control of the country  
and must retake control,'' said Carlos Larreategui, president of 
Ecuador's Association of Private Banks. ``If it doesn't attack the 
fundamental problems, it would be a catastrophe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Business leaders accuse Mahuad of moving too slowly to confront  
the crisis since he took office in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador, with a population of 12 million, is embroiled in its  
worst economic crisis in the last 20 years due to $2.6 billion in 
damage from El Nino-powered floods and mudslides last year and 
falling prices of its main export, oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic growth has fallen to near zero, inflation is running  
near 50 percent and the budget deficit stands at $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The government had been forced sell dollars in recent months to  
protect the value of the sucre, draining its scant foreign 
reserves. On Feb. 12, it abandoned its trading band and allowed the 
sucre to float freely. 
</P>
<P>
	But the sucre plunged as investors have begun to doubt Mahuad's  
ability to overcome political opposition and implement the drastic 
austerity measures experts say Ecuador's statist economy needs.

<HEADLINE> Holdsclaw Tops AP All America Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Chamique Holdsclaw, the smooth operator who has led Tennessee to  
three consecutive national championships, broke new ground as the 
leader of The Associated Press women's All-America basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw became the first player named to the first team three  
times and the first to earn All-America honors all four years of 
her college career. She made the third team as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tennessee ace and Purdue's Stephanie White-McCarty were  
voted to the first team on all 42 ballots from a national media 
panel, the only unanimous selections. They were joined on that unit 
by Tennessee's Tamika Catchings, Alabama's Dominique Canty and 
Colorado State's Becky Hammon. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other time one school had two first-team picks was  
1996, when Connecticut's Kara Wolters and Jennifer Rizzotti made 
the top five. The AP began picking a women's All-America team in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Catchings was named to the first, second or third team on 40  
ballots, Canty appeared on 39 and Hammon on 37. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's Semeka Randall was named to the second team, along  
with Amanda Wilson of Louisiana Tech, Svetlana Abrosimova of 
Connecticut, Angie Braziel of Texas Tech and Tamika Whitmore of 
Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	The third team had Maylana Martin of UCLA, Jackie Stiles of  
Southwest Missouri State, Ruth Riley of Notre Dame, Dalma Ivanyi of 
Florida International and Duke's Michele Van Gorp. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw, so versatile at 6-foot-2 that she can play any  
position on the floor, has averaged 20.9 points and eight rebounds 
in leading Tennessee to a 28-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
	With Tennessee getting more production from other positions,  
Holdsclaw's scoring average is down a little this season. But she 
has improved in other ways and is still the player the Lady Vols 
turn to when things get tight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Physically, she's more imposing now,'' said Tennessee coach  
Pat Summitt. ``She's much stronger, which I think has helped her 
around the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	'' Chamique's been able to get a lot better opportunities off  
the offensive glass, and physically be even more of a presence on 
defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw was the national player of the year last season, and  
is a candidate for that honor again. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is going to be remembered as a player of impact,'' Summitt  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty made the huge jump from honorable mention last  
year to unanimous first-team pick while leading Purdue to its 
first-ever No. 1 ranking. She's averaging 21 points and 4.6 
assists, and has helped the Boilermakers win several close games 
with key plays down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tremendous honor to be included among the top five  
players in the country,'' White-McCarty said. ``It's almost a dream 
a come true. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly I have to thank all my coaches and of course my  
teammates, because we're all in this together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canty, a second-team pick last year, has been a do-everything  
player for Alabama. Her 20-point scoring average is nearly twice 
that of anyone else on the team and she's also averaging 7.2 
rebounds and 4.3 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``The day she walked on our campus, she had an impact,'' said  
Alabama coach Rick Moody. ``Her demeanor on the floor has been just 
incredible because she's such a cool player and never once has she 
given any indication of a prima-donna attitude. That's just a joy 
to coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Catchings has been viewed as ``the next Holdsclaw'' ever since  
she arrived at Tennessee. She was a second-team All-American a year 
ago after a spectacular freshman season, and has continued to make 
big plays this season -- including a 38-point outburst against 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-1 sophomore is averaging 16.8 points, 7.3 rebounds and  
shooting 52 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Hammon has gone from a little-known high school player to the  
star of a team that has been ranked as high as fourth in the 
country. The 5-6 senior from Rapid City, S.D., averages 22.6 
points, shoots nearly 51 percent and has made 106 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	She's the leading career scorer in the Western Athletic  
Conference and had a high of 42 points at UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so rewarding for me to know all the hard work is paying  
off,'' Hammon said. ``I really didn't know how it was going to work 
coming out of high school. I didn't even know how I was going to 
fit into the program here. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be on that top unit is a huge honor.''

<HEADLINE> MacLeod Resigns As Notre Dame Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- The question dogged John MacLeod for  
several years: When's your time going to be up? 
</P>
<P>
	The answer came Tuesday when the Notre Dame basketball coach  
resigned after just three winning seasons during his eight years at 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everything is in place for Notre Dame to make a  
positive move,'' MacLeod said. ``I appreciated the opportunity to 
work here at Notre Dame, and I wish the best for the young men who 
are part of the program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement wasn't entirely unexpected after the Irish  
dropped five of their last seven to finish 14-16 overall and eighth 
in the Big East with an 8-10 record. They were picked by conference 
coaches to finish 12th in the 13-team league. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman David Graves, at home in Lexington, Ky., on spring  
break, said he hadn't expected the announcement and wasn't sure 
whether MacLeod was forced out. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know, because the last couple years it's always  
been, `Is he going to leave? Is he going to stay?''' he said. 
``You're not surprised, but it's kind of a shock when you finally 
hear it. You feel bad for him and his family, but we've still got 
business to take care of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Mike Wadsworth made the announcement Tuesday  
night after returning from a trip to Florida to meet with MacLeod. 
He refused to discuss the circumstances surrounding MacLeod's 
departure, insisting the coach requested that Wadsworth limit what 
he said to what was in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	But MacLeod, 61, told The Associated Press in an interview  
Friday that he expected to be back as coach despite the team's 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes I do. I really do,'' MacLeod said Friday. ``There's  
nothing written in stone. I'm not sitting here thinking I'm not 
going to be here. I'm going on a recruiting trip tomorrow. We've 
been working our tails off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wadsworth said he hoped to have a new coach in place by the  
April 7 signing date for basketball recruits and was already 
compiling a list of potential candidates with his staff, but he 
revealed no names. 
</P>
<P>
	He said only that he wanted to find someone who was a good fit  
for Notre Dame's basketball program as well as the university's 
image. 
</P>
<P>
	``Notre Dame is a university with a particular culture that  
doesn't suit all people,'' Wadsworth said. ``As a result, we'll be 
looking for a head coach that would be someone that has the 
potential to bring us to the top level nationally, but most 
particularly would be a very good fit for Notre Dame, will come to 
Notre Dame embracing what Notre Dame stands for, and if we can find 
that kind of matchup I think we'll have a good selection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MacLeod has often been criticized for poor recruiting, but his  
last class pulled in Big East rookie of the year Troy Murphy and 
Graves, both of whom started most of the season. A third freshmen, 
Harold Swanagan, saw plenty of playing time, and the three are 
expected to be a strong nucleus for next year's team. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, six players have left the Notre Dame program the last  
three seasons for a variety of reasons, and a seventh missed most 
of the year because of academic problems. That left only one 
scholarship player on the roster from the class of 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Wadsworth said the university hasn't contacted most of the  
players, who are on spring break this week, but the staff would 
complete that this week, as well as calling recruits. 
</P>
<P>
	Graves said it wasn't likely that he would transfer, but he will  
wait for Notre Dame to name a successor before making a final 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a commitment, and I'm going to stick to that  
commitment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	MacLeod's Notre Dame teams had a 106-124 mark, and his only  
winning years were 18-15 in 1991-92, his first at the school, 15-12 
in 1994-95 and 16-14 in 1996-97. MacLeod had the Fighting Irish in 
the NIT in 1992 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the only coach in school history to lead the team at least  
five seasons and still register an overall losing record. 
</P>
<P>
	MacLeod arrived at Notre Dame in 1991 after 18 seasons in the  
NBA with Phoenix, Dallas and the New York Knicks. His combined 
record in the NBA was 707-657 and his teams went to the playoffs 11 
times, four reaching the conference finals. He was coach at 
Oklahoma before moving to the NBA, finishing with a 90-69 mark in 
six seasons there. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame moved into the Big East for the 1995-96 season, and  
the Fighting Irish have never had a winning season in the league, 
with an overall conference mark of 27-45 and an 0-4 record in the 
Big East tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	MacLeod was selected as Big East coach of the year in 1997 and  
had players honored by the league the last two seasons, Pat Garrity 
as player of the year in 1998 and Murphy as newcomer of the year 
this season.

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio's Legacy Is Class, Dignity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- His was a dignity that stretched far beyond  
sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak, nine World Series  
victories and other Hall of Fame statistics are familiar to any fan 
of America's pastime. His marriage to Marilyn, his plugs for Mr. 
Coffee -- those too are among America's memories of one of its most 
cherished figures. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was his quiet, graceful spirit that fans and friends  
remembered Monday, hours after DiMaggio's death at 84. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the passing of a person from a time when baseball was the  
way it should be, when there was a higher ethical and moral 
standard,'' said Doug Connor, a finance industry worker on his way 
through Grand Central station. 
</P>
<P>
	It is that image of DiMaggio -- the lost hero yearned for in  
Simon and Garfunkel's ``Mrs. Robinson'' -- that endures. The 
songwriter, Paul Simon, wrote of DiMaggio's death in an op-ed piece 
today in The New York Times: 
</P>
<P>
	``In these days of presidential transgressions and apologies and  
prime-time interviews about private sexual matters, we grieve for 
Joe DiMaggio and mourn the loss of his grace and dignity, his 
fierce sense of privacy, his fidelity to the memory of his wife and 
the power of his silence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During and after his baseball career, DiMaggio built up an  
enormous reservoir of respect and a legacy of elegance that was 
never tarnished. Even when he turned to Mr. Coffee or the Bowery 
Savings Bank to do endorsements, no one whispered that the Yankee 
Clipper was cashing in on fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were glad to see him making some extra money,'' said  
David Halberstam, who chronicled baseball exploits in ``Summer of 
'49.'' ``By the 1960s, so-so players were making multiples of his 
highest Yankee salary, and nobody thought of DiMaggio as selling 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was, after all, the Joltin' Joe whose hitting streak in  
1941 was breakfast-table conversation from the Bronx to Butte, 
Mont. The astonishing accomplishment, still unmatched, made him an 
American hero. War was approaching, and a popular song about 
DiMaggio and his streak said, ``We want you on our side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	We got him, too. DiMaggio lost 2 1/2 years of his career to the  
Army. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe DiMaggio was an inspiration to all the strugglers of his  
day,'' said Mario Cuomo, a former New York governor who shared 
DiMaggio's Italian heritage and played minor-league ball. ``He 
showed America would make a place for true excellence, whatever its 
color, accent or origin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, said Cuomo, was the fulfillment of the American dream.  
</P>
<P>
	``He transcended baseball,'' said Halberstam. ``He was the last  
hero of the radio age. He played in New York, on all those great 
teams, and because of his looks and his reticence he was famous, 
honored and respected. There was no rock music, no pro football. It 
was all crystallized in him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio had the romantic image befitting a hero. He appeared in  
a Hemingway novel. He quit baseball at the top of his game. He 
married Monroe and was heartbroken at their divorce a few months 
later. He sent flowers to her grave for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this century, there have been three baseball players who  
transcended their sport to become part of American legend,'' Vice 
President Al Gore said. ``Where Babe Ruth was known for his power 
and Jackie Robinson was known for his courage, Joe DiMaggio was 
known for dignity and grace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Halberstam said DiMaggio came across as reserved and even lonely  
because he clung to his personal life. And in doing so, DiMaggio 
never marred his legend or greatness, remaining to Simon ``as proud 
and masculine as a battleship.'' Simon referred to ``Mrs. 
Robinson,'' which includes these lines: ``Where have you gone Joe 
DiMaggio? A nation turns its lonely eyes to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the lines were sincere and that they've been  
embraced over the years as a yearning for heroes and heroism speaks 
to the subconscious desires of the culture,'' Simon wrote in the 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need heroes, and we search for candidates to be anointed.''

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Company Shares Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British American Tobacco PLC said its full year  
profits fell sharply in 1998 due to the Asian financial crisis and 
the strength of the British pound. The company also posted major 
one-time charges to account for U.S. tobacco litigation costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretax profit after exceptional items fell 137 million pounds  
($220 million) to 738 million pounds ($1.188 billion), while sales 
slipped to 17.376 billion pounds from 17.834 billion pounds last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The results matched analysts' expectations, which had ranged  
from 700 million pounds to 780 million pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	BAT's exceptional charges included 613 million pounds for the  
initial costs of U.S. tobacco settlements in 1998, compared with 
258 million pounds for settlement costs in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of BAT fell more than 4 percent following the profit  
report. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were expecting Asia to be pretty tough in the fourth  
quarter, but it looks a bit worse than anticipated,'' said tobacco 
analyst Simon Willis at Charterhouse Tilney. Yet some analysts were 
surprised at the extent of the dip in the stock price, since BAT 
had already made it clear to investors that conditions in Asia were 
very tough. 
</P>
<P>
	On top of the Asian difficulties, BAT said the U.S. domestic  
market remains ``intensely competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When BAT announced its acquisition of Rothmans International in  
January, the company noted it was having a difficult first quarter, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pattern for the first quarter is in line with  
expectations,'' said Jonathan Fell, tobacco analyst at Merrill 
Lynch. ``We've been warned since October about the Asia 
difficulties and the fact that recovery probably wouldn't come 
until the third or fourth quarter of this year.''

therapy, beat up another new film, ``Cruel Intentions,'' to lead 
the weekend box office.

<HEADLINE> Author Munro Wins Critics' Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two years after the National Book Critics Circle  
widened its award to include non-U.S. authors, a second foreigner 
has captured the fiction prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Alice Munro, regarded by many as one of the world's greatest  
short story writers, won the 1998 fiction award Monday for her 
collection ``The Love of a Good Woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had reason for many years to be grateful to you, the  
American critic,'' the Canadian writer said in a statement read by 
her editor, Ann Close. ``It is this attention of yours that has 
helped me to flourish for the past couple of decades, as an 
unapologetic writer of short fiction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Short story writers rarely get the sales or the acclaim of  
novelists, but Munro has long been admired as a master of narrative 
and psychology. She has often been compared to Anton Chekhov and 
among living short story writers perhaps only William Trevor is 
thought of so highly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just adore her work,'' said short story writer Lorrie Moore,  
whose ``Birds of America'' was also nominated for the fiction 
prize. ``It's the subtle way she has of talking about the entirety 
of a life and the strange moments a life suddenly pivots upon. And 
as a person documenting and registering the lives of woman 
especially, she's just a genius.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To be eligible for the annual award, a book must be published in  
English for the first time in the United States. Last year's 
fiction winner was Penelope Fitzgerald a British author whose book

<HEADLINE> RJR To Spin Off Tobacco Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., the second-biggest  
U.S. cigarette maker, is selling its international tobacco business 
for nearly $8 billion to Japan Tobacco Inc. and plans to separate 
its remaining food and tobacco interests. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin announcements today would mean a breakup of a company  
that was acquired just over a decade ago for about $25 billion in 
what was the biggest leveraged buyout to that time. 
</P>
<P>
	The company had told analysts last month that it was looking to  
sell or find a partner for its struggling international tobacco 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	But it came as a surprise that its board had also endorsed a  
plan for subsequent spinoff of the domestic tobacco business into a 
separate company. Its R.J. Reynolds Tobacco division makes Winston, 
Camels and Salem cigarettes and is second in the U.S. only to 
Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the maker of Marlboro. 
</P>
<P>
	On the news, RJR Nabisco stock jumped more than 4 percent,  
rising $1.18 3/4 to $29.81 1/4 a share in morning trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been under pressure from shareholders, including  
onetime corporate raider Carl Icahn who threatened a proxy fight to 
force the company to separate the tobacco and food businesses. 
Icahn faced a deadline of Friday for filing a slate of candidates 
for election to the RJR board in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The advocates of a splitup of the tobacco and food ties argued  
the market is undervaluing the food business because of its 
connection with the potential liabilities of the tobacco 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The spinoff would leave RJR Nabisco with an 80.6 percent stake  
in Nabisco Holdings Corp., which makes products like Oreo cookies, 
Ritz crackers and Planters nuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the food and tobacco businesses will be best  
able to achieve their full potential under separate ownership 
structures,'' said RJR chairman and chief executive Steven F. 
Goldstone. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts have warned that a deal to separate all connections  
between the food and tobacco businesses would likely draw legal 
challenges from people who may have claims over tobacco-related 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The domestic tobacco company was among the four major U.S.  
tobacco companies that recently settled claims by 46 states for the 
expense of treating sick smokers by agreeing to pay $206 billion 
over 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry earlier agreed to settle suits with the four other  
states for about $40 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstone had told analysts last month that finding a way to  
give the international tobacco business greater stature was a top 
priority for the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The international tobacco business is a distant third to Philip  
Morris and British-American Tobacco PLC, and its earnings have 
fallen amid financial turmoil in its key Russian and Asian markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected the sale to generate $6 billion to $6.6  
billion, but the sale to Japan Tobacco topped that. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan Tobacco, the leading tobacco company in Japan and a  
growing overseas business, is paying $7.8 billion and is assuming 
$200 million in debt to acquire the international tobacco 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale is subject to approval by RJR Nabisco bondholders and  
regulators, but is expected to be completed within two months. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR said it would use the proceeds to reduce its debt and for  
other corporate purposes, including strengthening the position of 
its domestic tobacco business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deal will allow us to secure a base for future growth  
overseas and establish us as a global player,'' Japan Tobacco said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR said it would announce specifics on the domestic tobacco  
spinoff, pending final board approval, after the sale of the 
international tobacco business is completed.

<HEADLINE> RJR Nabisco To Shed Tobacco Biz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Food and tobacco conglomerate RJR Nabisco  
Holdings Corp. is sending its cigarette business out on its own. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR said Tuesday it will sell its international tobacco business  
to Japan's largest tobacco company and will break off its domestic 
tobacco operations into a separate company owned by RJR 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves come amid rising legal challenges to the tobacco  
industry and falling U.S. cigarette sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tobacco industry is in deep trouble,'' said Ahron  
Leichtman, executive director of Citizens for a Tobacco-Free 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
	But RJR said the cigarette and food companies will probably fare  
better as separate entities. 
</P>
<P>
	Its tobacco brands include Camel, Winston and Salem cigarettes,  
and the deals will leave it in control of a food business which 
makes Ritz crackers, Oreo cookies, Life Savers candy and Planters 
nuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The $17 billion conglomerate has been under pressure for several  
years from major stockholders to separate its food and tobacco 
businesses because the tobacco is considered a drag on RJR's stock. 
Some investors won't put their money in any company that has 
tobacco holdings, out of either opposition to smoking or fear that 
lawsuits will hurt profits. 
</P>
<P>
	John Maxwell, analyst at Davenport &AMP; Co., said RJR got a  
fantastic price for the international business -- $7.8 billion. He 
said RJR will use the proceeds to help reduce its $9.1 billion 
debt, leaving the domestic tobacco company in a better position to 
compete in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Icahn, a onetime corporate raider who holds about 7.7  
percent of RJR stock, had threatened to launch a fight for control 
of the board of directors to force a quick separation. Icahn failed 
to return repeated calls for comment Tuesday. The deadline for 
filing a rival slate is Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR is selling its international tobacco business to Japan  
Tobacco Co. which is also assuming $200 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deal will allow us to secure a base for future growth  
overseas and establish us as a global player,'' Japan Tobacco said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The RJR international tobacco business is a distant third to  
Philip Morris Cos. and British-American Tobacco PLC, and its 
earnings have fallen amid financial turmoil in its key Russian and 
Asian markets. 
</P>
<P>
	After the sale, the RJR board plans to spin off its domestic  
tobacco operations, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., to RJR shareholders. 
The tobacco company will keep its name and will retain its 
headquarters in Winston-Salem, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the food and tobacco businesses will be best  
able to achieve their full potential under separate ownership 
structures,'' said RJR chairman and chief executive Steven F. 
Goldstone. 
</P>
<P>
	Importantly, the new corporate structure allows people filing  
tobacco suits to continue to make claims against either R.J. 
Reynolds Tobacco Co. or the renamed RJR Nabisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The spinoff would leave RJR Nabisco with an 80.6 percent stake  
in Nabisco Holdings Corp., the food division that also makes Oreos, 
Chips Ahoy! and Snackwell's cookies, Premium saltines and A1 steak 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathryn Mulvey, executive director of corporate accountability  
watchdog Infact, said RJR's moves meant ``the corporation 
responsible for Joe Camel would no longer being operating with the 
same influence on the national or international scenes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her Boston-based group has been encouraging consumers to avoid  
buying Nabisco products since 1994 because of the food company's 
ties to cigarette making. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with lower debt after the spinoff, Reynolds Tobacco faces  
challenges. Analysts expect the steady decline in cigarette 
consumption will accelerate due to hefty price hikes that are being 
used to pay for a lawsuit settlement that is costing the industry 
$246 billion over 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government is considering a similar suit to recover  
the costs of treating sick smokers. A California jury recently 
ordered Philip Morris to pay $51 million judgment to a smoker. A 
class-action smokers' suit is pending in Florida and several union 
health funds are also suing the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had long warned that simply spinning off the food  
division into a separate independent company would face a prolonged 
court challenge because plaintiffs would charge the company with 
putting valuable assets out of their reach. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Daynard, a tobacco critic who heads the Tobacco Products  
Liability Project, said that plaintiffs may still protest if the 
company uses the proceeds from the sale of the international 
company for a stock buyback or higher dividends.

<HEADLINE> Study: Scary Films Stay With You </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Still scared of the water all those years after  
``Jaws''? Researchers say you're not alone. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey of 150 students at the Universities of Michigan and  
Wisconsin found that one in four had some lingering ``fright'' 
effect from a movie or TV show they saw as a child or a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger children were when they were frightened, the longer  
the reaction lasted. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people who saw the 1975 thriller about a man-eating shark  
never went into the ocean again, said Kristen Harrison, a 
University of Michigan communications professor who co-wrote the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	And what about ``Psycho,'' the 1960 thriller with the deadly  
shower scene? 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people who shower with the door open, even though  
they're quite sure there isn't a killer in the house,'' Harrison 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety percent said they were scared by a TV or movie from their  
childhood or adolescence; 26 percent said they still experience 
``residual anxiety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ranny Levy, president of the Coalition for Quality Children's  
Media in Santa Fe, N.M., said her own 27-year-old son was 
frightened of taking a swim in the sea a few years ago and blames 
it on seeing ``Jaws'' as a boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had to force himself. He really identified it with watching  
`Jaws' when he was little,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Tours Mitch-Damaged Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN SALVADOR (AP) -- President Clinton is saluting a ``new''  
Central America and highlighting the relief work of American troops 
here, meant to shut the door forever on the dark side of U.S. 
military involvement in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``We come to see what we can do together to help you rebuild''  
after Hurricane Mitch, Clinton said in greeting Salvadoran 
President Armando Calderon Sol at San Salvador's Compala 
International Airport on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problems of the future are our shared problems. The  
promise of the future is our shared promise,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was flying to Soto Cano Air Base in Honduras today to  
underscore a new, constructive partnership between the United 
States and its neighbors to the South. Clinton planned a little 
schmoozing in the mess hall before addressing some of the 520 
American personnel who reside on base with 800 Hondurans. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, he was visiting Tegucigalpa's Juan Molina Bridge,  
wiped out by Mitch and restored by 50 Marines in a week last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Emphasizing the positive, he glossed over sore spots in the U.S.  
relationship with Central America, namely trade and immigration. 
And today, as he outlined a stopgap $25 million in U.S. aid to 
Honduras -- the worst hit by last fall's storms -- Clinton was to 
make a detailed argument for the $956 million aid package held up 
in Congress by unrelated political issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has maintained a military presence in Honduras  
-- around 500 personnel -- since 1984 when it set up shop to support 
the Contras and other non-communist insurgents in Central America's 
bloody civil wars. 
</P>
<P>
	On the first of his four days traveling the region and surveying  
the aftermath of Mitch, Clinton said work remained to undo the 
legacy of the 1980s, when the United States was perceived here as 
meddlesome -- or worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``In times past, there was conflict, turbulence and distrust,''  
Clinton told Nicaraguans on Monday near the mudslide-ravaged town 
of Posoltega. ``But now we are bound together in our common 
commitment to democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman said it has helped that U.S.  
troops -- 5,300 at peak deployment -- swept into Central America so 
soon after Mitch to pluck survivors from mud and floodwaters, then 
stayed to rebuild a country that U.S. forces had occupied from 1909 
to 1925. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hands of friends, the hands of U.S. soldiers have been  
with us and have left their mark on the works and the roads that we 
Nicaraguans can now walk once again,'' Aleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton promised Central America nearly $1 billion in  
hurricane reconstruction help, partisan fights stalled the money on 
Capitol Hill. Republicans are demanding that Clinton offset the 
reconstruction aid through reductions in food stamps and welfare 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told reporters he would, when he returned to Washington,  
work with House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., to untangle the 
legislation. ``It doesn't have anything to do with the merits'' of 
the bill, Clinton said. ``That's encouraging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, he was announcing today an immediate package for  
Honduras, which sustained an estimated $3.4 billion in storm 
damage, including nearly 83,000 homes destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	The funds from the Agency for International Development budget  
will go largely toward restoring water systems, getting small 
businesses running again, preventing the spread of cholera and 
diarrhea, and ensuring environmental responsibility as Hondurans 
rebuild along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	On immigration, Clinton said only that he would seek ``a fair  
solution'' to problems exacerbated by the disaster. A temporary 
halt in deportations of Guatemalans and Salvadorans in the United 
States lapsed on Monday. Calderon had asked for more time to get 
the region on its feet before any return of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told reporters the resumption of deportations  
``shouldn't affect too many people in the early going'' and he 
questioned whether he had any legal authority to extend the halt. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 15,000 illegal immigrants were returned to Guatemala,  
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras combined, Immigration and 
Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner said. She 
expected that the expiration of the stay on deportations would 
affect less than 5,000 Guatemalans and Salvadorans this year.

<HEADLINE> Man Weeps at Sweepstakes Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans complaining about sweepstakes  
promoters' tactics related horror stories to a Senate panel Monday. 
One man sobbed uncontrollably as he told of squandering money saved 
for his daughter's law school education. 
</P>
<P>
	Eustace A. Hall, 65, of Brandon, Fla., became so emotional that  
the daughter, Angela, had to finish reading his statement. She 
completed her studies despite her father's sweepstakes addiction, 
and is now a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Before a hearing room filled with industry representatives and  
their lobbyists, Hall was among six witnesses who saw themselves or 
their families as victims -- and lashed out at sweepstakes companies 
at a hearing of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on 
Investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	The witnesses, five of them describing experiences of their  
parents or in-laws, complained about large type listing someone as 
a ``guaranteed winner,'' small type showing nearly insurmountable 
odds and computer-generated language that sounded as if the 
recipient were receiving a personal letter. 
</P>
<P>
	The sixth was Hall, who once received a letter quoting from a  
supposed conversation between two sweepstakes company officials. 
``It's not right when someone as nice as Eustace Hall doesn't 
win,'' one told the other in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee chairwoman, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, has  
sponsored legislation that would impose the first national 
regulation of sweepstakes mailings and levy hefty fines for 
deceptive practices. The bill would prevent companies from telling 
recipients they won something when they haven't, and from using the 
smallest print to list additional conditions for winning and the 
odds of capturing a major prize. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the companies were ``exploiting people's dreams through  
these deceptive mailings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two other witnesses, Attorney General J. Joseph Curran Jr. of  
Maryland and Virginia L. Tierney of the American Association of 
Retired Persons said the sweepstakes companies especially prey on 
the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I estimate I have spent $15,000 to $20,000 from 1992 to the  
present on sweepstake purchases,'' Hall's statement, read by his 
daughter, said. ``They always led me to believe that I had to 
purchase products to win. After all the time and money I spent I 
have nothing to show for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before a hushed hearing room, with a box of tissues in front of  
him, Hall broke down after telling the hearing that he entered the 
contests to provide his daughter ``with more financial 
assistance.'' The former medical technologist's sweepstakes debts 
forced him to come out of retirement and sell mobile phones. 
</P>
<P>
	The sweepstakes industry representatives will testify Tuesday.  
Industry officials said they will emphasize their voluntary reforms 
and their conclusion that most customers understand that no 
purchase is necessary to enter the contests. The companies have not 
yet taken a position on the legislation but have hired some of 
Washington's major lobbying firms in hopes of helping to shape the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Patti McElligott, of Tyler, Texas, handed Collins and Sen. Carl  
Levin, D-Mich. a ``golden horseshoe watch'' that was purchased in a 
sweepstakes promotion for $20.29 by her late father-in-law, Joseph 
P. McElligott Sr. ``I wouldn't give you a dime for it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said that after the retired Army officer died, she received  
a promotion declaring that his ``estate is a winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carol Gelinas, of Bangor, Maine, said the odds of winning a big  
prize, listed in minuscule type, ``were literally invisible'' to 
her late father, Clyde Schott. 
</P>
<P>
	Karol Carter, a veterinarian from Troy, Mich., said her  
86-year-old father, Allan Carter, was ``upset that I am attending 
these hearings. He is concerned that I am ruining his chances of 
winning. ... My father has a doctorate in organic chemistry and 
retired from Chrysler Corp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But with letters making him a guaranteed winner, Ms. Carter  
said, her father became so attracted to the contests that ``he has 
enough videos to open a video store -- about 200 -- and at least 150 
compact discs. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McElligott said her father-in-law had a U.S. News and World  
Report subscription that runs to the year 2018, and 32 separate 
subscriptions to the magazine. His subscription list included 158 
magazine titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tierney, of the AARP seniors organization, said one member  
trying to settle her father's estate had subscriptions to Sports 
Illustrated and Newsweek through 2086. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's right, an 87-year subscription,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Purdue Leads Final Women's Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Purdue Boilermakers have no history for where they find  
themselves now: heading into the NCAA women's basketball tournament 
as the nation's No. 1-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue led the final Associated Press women's basketball poll of  
the season on Monday, the first time it has finished at No. 1. 
Previously, the school's highest ranking at the end was fifth in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
	But whether they're first or 101st, the Boilermakers say it  
makes no difference at tournament time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all comes down to us preparing,'' senior guard Ukari Figgs  
said. ``We are really not concerned about the other teams right 
now. We are focused on having ourselves prepared for the 
tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue (28-1) is the No. 1 seed in the Midwest Regional. The  
other No. 1 seeds in the tournament followed the Boilermakers in 
the poll. Tennessee, seeking its fourth straight national 
championship, held the No. 2 spot, Louisiana Tech was third and 
Connecticut fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	At the bottom, No. 25 Toledo made the poll for the first time  
this season and just the third time overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue received 39 of 42 first-place votes and 1,047 points from  
a national media panel to hold the No. 1 spot for the third 
straight week. The Boilermakers defeated both Tennessee and 
Louisiana Tech this season and take a 26-game winning streak into 
NCAA play. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee (28-2), seeded No. 1 in the East, had two first-place  
votes and 1,009 points, while Louisiana Tech (26-2) had 967 points 
and the remaining first-place vote. Tech is the top seed in the 
West, with Connecticut (27-4) No. 1 in the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut jumped two spots in the poll after winning the Big  
East Conference tournament. Old Dominion remained at No. 5, and was 
followed by Texas Tech, Colorado State, Notre Dame and Rutgers. 
Clemson and Duke were tied for 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Tech, which beat Iowa State in the Big 12 tournament  
final, climbed three places. Colorado State dropped from fourth to 
seventh after losing to Southern Methodist in the Western Athletic 
Conference final. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia moved up two places to 12th and Virginia Tech was 13th.  
Then it was North Carolina, UCLA, Oregon and UC Santa Barbara, 
followed by Penn State, Iowa State and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	LSU, Alabama, Tulane, Florida International and Toledo held the  
final five spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo (25-5), the Mid-American Conference tournament champion,  
was given a No. 6 seed in the NCAA tournament and made the Top 25 
for the first time since the 1993-94 season. The Rockets were 
ranked for two weeks in February of that season. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of Toledo's losses were to Notre Dame, Rutgers and Boston  
College, all of whom made the NCAA field. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas, which lost to Iowa State in the Big 12 semifinals,  
dropped out. The Jayhawks (22-9) had been 25th. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen teams were ranked every week of the season. They were  
Purdue, Tennessee, Louisiana Tech, Connecticut, Notre Dame, Duke, 
Old Dominion, Rutgers, Georgia, UCLA, Texas Tech, North Carolina, 
Virginia, Iowa State and Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams from the preseason poll that didn't make the final Top 25  
were Kansas, Florida, George Washington, Arkansas, North Carolina 
State, Vanderbilt, Stanford, Illinois and Arizona. Kansas was the 
highest-ranked of those teams, starting out at No. 11. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Love Walks Out of Hometown Concert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Courtney Love got anything but a warm  
welcome at a weekend concert in her home state. 
</P>
<P>
	The actress and leader of the band Hole played for only 45  
minutes Saturday night before walking off stage, apparently upset 
by a tepid response from the half-full house at the Rose Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``Make up your minds,'' she told the crowd. ``Either you're  
happy that me and (movie director) Gus Van Sant are from here or 
you're not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When her cajoling drew little response, she muttered, ``This is  
so bad I can't deal with it'' and walked off. 
</P>
<P>
	``She played about five songs too long,'' said Jim Standley, 26.  
``It was like having a tooth pulled.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Buying Stake in Cable Channel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC owner General Electric Co. is buying a  
minority stake in ValueVision, the third largest home-shopping 
cable network, with an eye toward boosting the companies' Internet 
commerce business. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced today, brings NBC into televised home  
shopping for the first time and furthers its online expansion at a 
time when big media rivals are rapidly increasing their investments 
in the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the TV and PC converge, access to electronic revenue  
streams like home shopping through cable and Internet will become 
extremely valuable,'' said Tom Rogers, president of NBC's cable 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	ValueVision International Inc. operates the No. 3 cable shopping  
channel behind QVC and Barry Diller's Home Shopping Network -- 
peddling fake furs, porcelain dolls and computer desks among its 
many wares. ValueVision is shown in 21.8 million U.S. homes on 
either a full- or part-time basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBC deal employs a similar strategy to Diller's plan to  
acquire Internet company Lycos Inc., then combine it with his Home 
Shopping Network and Ticketmaster operations to create a wealth of 
cross-promotion opportunities. That deal, however, has been plagued 
by opposition from Lycos' biggest shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
	Under today's deal, GE will pay $56 million for a 19.9 percent  
stake in ValueVision, with an option to raise that stake to 39.9 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the deal pushed ValueVision shares up $2, or 20 percent,  
to $12.12 1/2 in morning trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. GE shares 
were down 37 1/2 cents at $104.43 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC will use its much-greater television experience to try to  
improve the quality of ValueVision's programming and expand the 
cable network's distribution. NBC already owns two successful cable 
networks, the CNBC business news network and the all-news MSNBC 
co-owned by Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	ValueVision, an 8-year-old company based in Minneapolis, also  
sells its goods over the Internet and through print media. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC will redesign ValueVision's current Web site and will seek  
opportunities over the next year to combine the site with a portal, 
the popular Internet sites such as Yahoo! and Lycos that offer 
searches, e-mail, news, chat and other services. 
</P>
<P>
	An NBC spokeswoman said the company may combine ValueVision's  
online business with Snap! -- a portal in which NBC acquired a 
minority stake last year -- or may seek deals with other Internet 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	ValueVision's sales and profits had been rising steadily for the  
past few years, but its sales dropped 13 percent to $138 million in 
the first nine months of 1998. Year-end figures are due out later 
this month.

<HEADLINE> Laborers' Boss Cleared of Mob Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The president of the Laborers union, Arthur  
Coia, was cleared Tuesday by an independent hearing officer of 
charges he had ties to organized crime but was fined on a separate 
ethics violation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearing officer Peter Vaira, hired by the union with the  
approval of the Justice Department in a 1995 agreement allowing the 
union to police itself, made the ruling after an internal 
investigation of corruption within the Laborers' ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	Coia was found liable for violating the union's ethical  
practices code in purchasing a personal car in a joint arrangement 
from a dealer who leased cars to the union. Coia was fined 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer from Providence, R.I., who has been fervent political  
supporter of President Clinton, Coia became the 350,000-member 
union's president in 1993 after rising through its staff ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	With its major strength in the Midwest, the union represents  
employees in construction, service and public jobs such as digging 
tunnels, pouring cement and loading mail. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1980s President Reagan's Commission on Organized Crime  
accused the Laborers of having mob ties. To avoid federal 
racketeering charges, the union signed the 1995 agreement with the 
Justice Department to sweep its ranks of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's general counsel, Michael Bearse, said Vaira's  
decision ``speaks well of our investigatory and disciplinary 
process.'' It was significant that all the allegations of organized 
crime involvement were dismissed, Bearse said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials, however, said they were ``disappointed with  
the decision'' but did not criticize the investigation leading up 
to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Lassar, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of  
Illinois, and James K. Robinson, head of the Justice Department's 
criminal division, said in a joint statement they ``believe the 
opinion contains serious factual and legal errors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The charge against Coia was brought by Robert Luskin, a former  
Justice Department organized crime prosecutor who was hired by the 
union to head its internal cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassar and Robinson said they would discuss Vaira's opinion with  
lawyers for the union and encourage Luskin to appeal it. The 
internal union appellate officer is W. Neil Eggleston, a former 
chief appellate attorney in the U.S. Attorney's office of the 
Southern District of New York. Vaira was a former federal 
prosecutor in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department retained the right under the 1995  
agreement to prosecute union officers and seize control of the 
union if the government is dissatisfied with the internal cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	Luskin said he would talk with federal officials about the case  
and their request that he appeal. But he said he doesn't believe 
the Tuesday decision would jeopardize the union's arrangement with 
the federal government to police itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we promised the government was not any particular result,  
but a fair, credible, aggressive and thorough process,'' Luskin 
said. He noted the union has removed about 200 officials and 
members during the internal sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	Coia released a statement noting that the union's investigation  
has spared no one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now my focus is on the future, not on the past,'' he said. ``I  
remain totally committed to our reform ....'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coia's lawyer, Howard Gutman, said the evidence was convincing  
that Coia was not involved with organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence demonstrated overwhelmingly that Coia has never  
been controlled by the mob, and in fact the mob despises Arthur,'' 
Gutman said.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise for Third Straight Day / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bonds rose for a third straight session Tuesday  
as inflation worries continued to ease after more upbeat remarks by 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 13/16  
point Monday, or by $8.13 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, 
which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 5.53 percent from 
5.59 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Making his second public appearance in as many days, Greenspan  
maintained his positive outlook on the economy and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's comments by the Fed chairman follow a key employment  
report on Friday that showed no major jump in inflationary 
pressures. Rapid inflation makes fixed-income investments like 
bonds less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market Tuesday, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities rose 5/32 point to 7/32 point, while intermediate 
maturities rose 13/32 point to 3/8 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 5.01 
points to 1,286.02. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 4.59 percent as the  
discount fell 0.04 percentage to 4.47 percent compared with 
Monday's auction. Six-month yields fell to 4.66, as the discount 
fell 0.05 percentage point from Monday's auction to 4.49 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	One-year yields fell to 4.72 percent, while the discount fell  
0.07 percentage point to 4.50 percent compared with late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.56 percent from 4.88 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 1/8 point to 124 1/16. The average yield 
to maturity fell to 5.22 percent from 5.23 percent late Monday.

	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota guard Kevin Clark suffered a  
seizure Tuesday on the plane en route to Seattle for the first 
round of the NCAA men's basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gophers play Gonzaga on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Coach Clem Haskins said he hopes Clark will play Thursday, but  
the guard won't be at 100 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you have a seizure, it'll take several days to really  
bounce back,'' Haskins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark has taken medication since childhood to stave off  
seizures, but two more episodes occurred last month. He also had a

<HEADLINE> Group: Credit Insurance a Ripoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers who buy credit insurance when they  
take out a loan, buy a car or get a credit card are being 
overcharged by $2 billion a year, Consumers Union and another group 
charged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Griffin, insurance counsel for Consumers Union, and Birny  
Birnbaum, consulting economist for the Center for Economic Justice, 
blamed state insurance regulators for what they said is lax 
supervision of credit insurance sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're asking the states to do their job,'' Birnbaum said at a  
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	An official of the National Association of Insurance  
Commissioners, which represents the state regulators, said they 
shared some of the concerns about credit insurance rates and were 
looking into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Several regulators ``have expressed concern about the credit  
industry in general'' and credit insurance rates, said Steven 
Larsen, chairman of the NAIC's market conduct and consumer affairs 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``This needs to be re-examined,'' Larsen, who also is Maryland's  
insurance commissioner, said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit insurance pays a lender, such as a bank or finance  
company, car dealer, department store or credit card company, if a 
borrower becomes disabled or dies. Other types of credit insurance 
provide for monthly payments if a borrower loses his job, or for 
repair or replacement of property bought with the loan or used as 
collateral. 
</P>
<P>
	More than $17 billion in credit insurance was sold in this  
country in 1995 to 1997, according to Consumers Union, which 
publishes ``Consumer Reports'' magazine, and the Center for 
Economic Justice, an advocate for low-income consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Although buying the insurance usually is not mandatory, the two  
groups maintain that lenders often coerce consumers into taking it. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups released a study of credit insurance sales in that  
period which concluded that most consumers are paying more than is 
reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think (most) consumers should stay away from this  
product,'' Ms. Griffin told reporters. Credit insurance ``is a bad 
deal and it's only getting worse,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	An exception, Ms. Griffin said, involves those consumers who  
live in states with cheaper rates for credit insurance or who are 
elderly or in poor health. 
</P>
<P>
	The states with the cheapest rates, according to the study, were  
New York, Maine, Pennsylvania, Vermont, New Jersey, West Virginia, 
Rhode Island, Michigan and Virginia, in that order. 
</P>
<P>
	Many consumers already have life insurance policies that cover  
their debts if they die, and homeowners insurance often covers 
property losses, Ms. Griffin noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Janet Eissenstadt, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers  
Association, agreed with that point. 
</P>
<P>
	As with any financial product, consumers should examine whether  
they need credit insurance, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Read the fine print,'' Ms. Eissenstadt advised.  
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Zielinski, a spokesman for the American Insurance  
Association, the industry's largest trade group, had no immediate 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The states with the most unreasonable rates, according to the  
report, were Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, Alaska, Nevada, 
Nebraska, New Mexico, Minnesota, South Dakota and Utah, in that 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	The rankings were based on average loss ratios for credit  
insurance in each state. The loss ratio is the ratio between the 
total amount paid out in benefits and the amount the consumer paid 
for the insurance.

<HEADLINE>  Neighbors Remember Joe DiMaggio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINEZ, Calif. (AP) -- Harriete Langemeier headed to the  
waterfront when she heard of Joe DiMaggio's death, worried a 
souvenir hunter might try to break off a piece of the ``Joltin' 
Joe'' speedboat DiMaggio donated to the town. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, she found flowers.  
</P>
<P>
	The town of DiMaggio's birth reacted with quiet dignity to his  
death on Monday, a fitting tribute to a shy man who carefully 
guarded his privacy even among neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``He conducted himself always as a gentleman,'' said John  
Sparacino, a former mayor of Martinez. ``He was very private, 
though he did have an opportunity to touch a lot of people 
throughout his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Langemeier was one of many Martinez residents who on Monday  
visited the ``Joltin' Joe,'' which the Hall of Famer received on 
Joe DiMaggio Day on Oct. 1, 1949, in front of 69,551 fans at Yankee 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tantamount to the country losing the president,''  
Langemeier said. ``He was a hometown hero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A bouquet of daffodils and carnations sat beside the ``Joltin'  
Joe,'' along with a note whose ink was beginning to smear in a cold 
rain: 
</P>
<P>
	``Dear Joe, from dear, loyal and loving fans,'' it said.  
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was born in Martinez in 1914. Though he moved with his  
family to San Francisco a year later, he often returned to fish 
with cousins or visit with grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents sometimes saw the lanky, white-haired gentleman  
wheeling his shopping cart gently through Longs Drugs, stopping to 
chat with his granddaughter, who worked there. His eyes would focus 
on the floor, avoiding the astonished stares of strangers.

	Or DiMaggio would slip over to Amato's restaurant for a meal.  
He'd sit in the back room, shielded from gawkers and autograph 
hunters. 
</P>
<P>
	He avoided crowds, skipping funerals and showing up unexpectedly  
at the mortuary to pay his last respects.

<P>
	``His head was always down, he wouldn't look around. No eye  
contact,'' said Ernie Lasell, who owned a hardware store and used 
to sell DiMaggio his fishing licenses. ``He was just a naturally 
shy guy, very modest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marie Amato Goodman, whose family ran the restaurant that sits

a humble man who ``had the limelight but didn't capture it and go 
with it.''

	``When he came into the restaurant, my mother grabbed Joe and  
took him in the back,'' said Goodman, a third cousin of DiMaggio.

never forgot who he was and where he came from, and the loyalties 
that come with family and friends in a small town.''

	Most Americans born before World War II remember DiMaggio as the  
dashing ``Yankee Clipper,'' the man who had a 56-game hitting 
streak and married Marilyn Monroe. Baby boomers think of DiMaggio 
as the guy hawking Mr. Coffee on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	But neighbors and relatives in Martinez knew DiMaggio as the  
quiet son of a Sicilian fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was born in a small wood house in Martinez, about 30  
minutes east of San Francisco, on Nov. 25, 1914. On his birth 
certificate, the midwife that delivered DiMaggio listed ``Fishman'' 
as the occupation of his father, Giuseppe DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuseppe and Rosalia Mercurio DiMaggio moved their family to the  
North Beach section of San Francisco when Joe was 1. The area also 
was an Italian enclave in those days. Now it is largely Asian. 
</P>
<P>
	Dante Benedetti played baseball with the DiMaggio boys. The kids  
used to play on a grassy lot next to a creamery when the horses 
were out pulling milkcarts. They used dried horse manure, covered 
with a sack, for bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never slid head first into those,'' Benedetti said.  
</P>
<P>
	Benedetti, who owned the New Pisa restaurant in that  
neighborhood, remembers young Joe DiMaggio sitting by himself at 
North Beach Playground, rolling Bull Durham cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because he was such a good player, he was the only one the  
director let smoke during the games,'' Benedetti said. ``He was a 
shortstop. He used to overthrow first base, he had such a strong 
arm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's a fable that DiMaggio avoided following in his father's  
footsteps only because he got seasick. Benedetti laughs at such 
nonsense, pointing out the $25,000 bonus offered by the Yankees was 
reason enough to stay on land. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know you'd get seasick if somebody offered you $500 a  
month,'' he said. ``After Joe signed, all the fishermen down there 
started to buy their kids gloves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two brothers, Dom and Vince, joined Joe in the major leagues.  
But Giuseppe DiMaggio never really understood. He sent his son a 
letter during his first spring training with the Yankees, in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come home, Joe,'' the letter said. ``The fish are running.  
Give up this game of baseball. It is for loafers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benedetti remembers DiMaggio being painfully shy throughout his  
playing days. After his hitting streak in 1941, the residents of 
North Beach threw a testimonial dinner for DiMaggio. When called to 
the microphone, he froze and couldn't speak.

<P>

couldn't get a word out of him. He talked through his bat and his 
ability to play.''

<HEADLINE>  Neighbors Remember Joe DiMaggio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINEZ, Calif. (AP) -- Harriete Langemeier headed to the  
waterfront when she heard of Joe DiMaggio's death, worried a 
souvenir hunter might try to break off a piece of the ``Joltin' 
Joe'' speedboat DiMaggio donated to the town. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, she found flowers.  
</P>
<P>
	The town of DiMaggio's birth reacted with quiet dignity to his  
death on Monday, a fitting tribute to a shy man who carefully 
guarded his privacy even among neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``He conducted himself always as a gentleman,'' said John  
Sparacino, a former mayor of Martinez. ``He was very private, 
though he did have an opportunity to touch a lot of people 
throughout his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Langemeier was one of many Martinez residents who on Monday  
visited the ``Joltin' Joe,'' which the Hall of Famer received on 
Joe DiMaggio Day on Oct. 1, 1949, in front of 69,551 fans at Yankee 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tantamount to the country losing the president,''  
Langemeier said. ``He was a hometown hero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A bouquet of daffodils and carnations sat beside the ``Joltin'  
Joe,'' along with a note whose ink was beginning to smear in a cold 
rain: 
</P>
<P>
	``Dear Joe, from dear, loyal and loving fans,'' it said.  
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was born in Martinez in 1914. Though he moved with his  
family to San Francisco a year later, he often returned to fish 
with cousins or visit with grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents sometimes saw the lanky, white-haired gentleman  
wheeling his shopping cart gently through Longs Drugs, stopping to 
chat with his granddaughter, who worked there. His eyes would focus 
on the floor, avoiding the astonished stares of strangers.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Hope Acevedo Can Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Blown saves shouldn't be the St. Louis  
Cardinals' downfall this year, now that they have the luxury of two 
closers. 
</P>
<P>
	To start the season, manager Tony La Russa plans on using Juan  
Acevedo for the ninth inning. But if Acevedo fails, Ricky Bottalico 
is waiting in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
	Acevedo earned the closer spot by nailing down 15 saves in 16  
opportunities for a team that had blown a league-high 31 the rest 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Acevedo is the guy we're set to go with,'' La Russa said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bottalico, a 34-save man in 1996 and '97 with the Philadelphia  
Phillies, is fully recovered, he believes, from elbow surgery that 
held him to only six saves last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``My health is outstanding,'' Bottalico said. ``You live with  
it, you learn, and you come back strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa doesn't seem worried about keeping both players happy.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have a real good ballclub and there will be opportunities  
for both guys,'' he said. ``It's just going to be a real strong 
situation for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, late-inning relief was a disaster. Jeff Brantley, who  
couldn't regain his form after shoulder surgery, was the top closer 
most of the year with 14 saves in 22 chances. St. Louis blew eight 
ninth-inning leads and 12 leads in the final two innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Acevedo was in the rotation most of the year before going on the  
disabled list with a strained elbow. After emerging to find the 
rotation filled and a big vacancy sign in the bullpen, he was 
13-for-13 with an 0.99 ERA after the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't allow a run in his last 16 outings, covering 18  
innings. It was almost enough to persuade him this was his niche, 
but then again he grew up idolizing Nolan Ryan and would still 
prefer to start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be 40 years old and you can ask me the same question, and  
I'll give you the same answer,'' Acevedo said. ``Starting is what I 
really want, but I'll do whatever the team needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals believe relieving may cut down on stress on  
Acevedo's elbow if he throws a dozen or so pitches at a time 
instead of 100 every five days. He's done his part to keep the 
elbow sound by undergoing acupuncture the last few months. 
</P>
<P>
	The needles bothered him, but he just looked away and read for  
the 10-minute sessions as a human pin cushion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever I had to do to get ready, I was willing to do,''  
Acevedo said. ``It feels great now. It's a matter of throwing a 
slider without any pain and since I've been here I haven't felt 
much tingling or anything like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Bottalico, he's felt fine since last September. The  
Phillies brought him back slowly, giving him middle-inning duty the 
first two months after he came off the disabled list at the end of 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	In his final seven games he allowed one run in six innings and  
had three saves. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a battle-type thing, we'll just battle each other,''  
Bottalico said. ``It's friendly competition, so you don't worry 
about it too much. I just want to help this team win.''

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Unveils High-Speed System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amtrak took the wraps off the nation's first  
high-speed rail system today, a $2 billion service that will race 
between Boston, New York and Washington at 150 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-awaited new trains will start running in October along  
tracks that Amtrak currently uses for its Northeast Corridor 
service. They have been dubbed ``Acela'' (uh-SELL-ah), a word made 
up by a marketing firm to indicate swiftness. 
</P>
<P>
	By electrifying the entire 470-mile route, straightening curves  
and using 20 new train sets that incorporate the so-called tilt 
technology, Amtrak hopes to chop as much as 90 minutes off its 
4 1/2-hour Boston-New York service and up to a half-hour off its 
current three-hour Washington-New York service. 
</P>
<P>
	With trip times down to 2 1/2 to three hours, Amtrak is betting  
much of its future -- and that of high-speed rail in the United 
States -- on the premise that it can now compete with airplanes and 
automobiles on city center-to-city center trips. 
</P>
<P>
	As added incentives, the fare will be about 30 percent less than  
the current $199 walk-up air shuttle rate, and Amtrak will expand 
some of its current amenities. In addition to offering 304 
business-class seats, the trains will have audio entertainment and 
power outlets at each seat, enclosed overhead bins, a dining car 
and full lavatories. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak views the Northeast Corridor as a model for other  
high-speed rail proposals in the Great Lakes region, along the 
Southeast and Gulf Coast and throughout California and the Pacific 
Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Acela is more than just a name for Amtrak's new high-speed  
trains. Acela is a brand representing a whole new way of doing 
business,'' Amtrak President George Warrington said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The unveiling took place near Amtrak's New York headquarters  
before a group of 1,000 company employees. The railroad is hoping 
that the workers will spread their enthusiasm to passengers before 
the service begins this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Outsiders also hope Acela will finally convince America to  
follow Europe's lead toward a transportation system that offers an 
alternative to congested highways and crowded airport terminals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It provides a reasonable and perhaps better third option for  
travel in the area,'' said Anne Chettle, spokeswoman for the 
High-Speed Ground Transportation Association, a Washington rail 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``The train is already popular in the Northeast. In other areas  
of the country, they are committed to their cars or airplanes. This 
way trains will seem less pie-in-the-sky to them,'' Chettle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak has not turned a profit since it was founded in 1971. The  
General Accounting Office reported that the railroad lost an 
average of $47 per passenger in fiscal 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Congress said Amtrak must become self-sufficient by  
2002. It provided a $2.2 billion cash infusion and a steadily 
declining annual subsidy that ends in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year the railroad topped $1 billion in revenues for the  
first time, propelled by the best ridership in a decade and its 
best on-time performance in 13 years. It views high-speed rail as 
the final piece of its move toward profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak currently transports about 9 million people each year  
along the Northeast Corridor, some 7 million between New York and 
Washington and an additional 2 million between New York and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be a minimum time-savings with the upgraded service  
between Washington and New York because that route already is 
electrified. The Achilles heel of the Boston-to-New York service, 
however, has been the requirement that diesel trains switch to 
electric locomotives for air quality reasons before completing the 
trip into New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	That adds about a half-hour to the journey.  
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Amtrak has spent millions improving the track  
and adding electrical service from New Haven to Boston. It has also 
spent $710 million on new train sets that are modeled after the 
French bullet train, the TGV. 
</P>
<P>
	While not as fast as the 185-mph TGV, the new Amtrak trains will  
glide around corners using technology that gently tilts the cars. 
That doesn't promote speed as much as it prevents centrifugal force 
from throwing the passengers into a car's walls. 
</P>
<P>
	The track electrification, a project started in 1906 but halted  
by world wars, the Depression and other events, will allow seamless 
service along the entire route.

<HEADLINE> Study: Fat, Breast Cancer Not Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Contradicting current medical theories, a 14-year  
study of nearly 89,000 women found no evidence that a high-fat diet 
promotes breast cancer or that a low-fat diet protects against it. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts were quick to note that a low-fat diet is still good for  
the heart and other aspects of health. They said the study 
indicates a need to look more carefully at how diet may affect the 
risk of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should just accept that good scientists can't tell you yet  
what to eat to minimize your breast-cancer risk,'' said Dr. John A. 
Glaspy of the University of California at Los Angeles, who was not 
involved in the research. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harvard study was published in Wednesday's Journal of the  
American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have theorized that eating lots of fat increases  
breast-cancer risk. They have based their thinking on animal 
studies, international comparisons and studies of women who 
developed breast cancer and women who didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Others have suggested that the key is the type of fat consumed,  
rather than the amount; that fish oil offers some protection from 
breast cancer; or that contaminants stored in fat trigger breast 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study tracked 88,795 women in the continuing Nurses'  
Health Study. The women, ages 30 to 55, completed detailed 
questionnaires about their eating habits every four years from 1980 
to 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers compared the diets of the women without breast  
cancer and the 2,956 women whose breast cancer was discovered 
during the course of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Breast cancer was found to be no more common among women who ate  
lots of fat, or among those who ate a large proportion of animal 
fat, polyunsaturated fat (vegetable fat) or trans-unsaturated fat 
(partially hydrogenated oils, such as those used in margarine and 
to cook doughnuts and french fries). 
</P>
<P>
	Nor was breast cancer any less common in women who got a high  
proportion of their fats from fish oil or who got less than 20 
percent of their total calories from fat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our research indicates it's highly unlikely that women who  
consume a low-fat diet are protected against breast cancer,'' said 
the study's lead author, Dr. Michelle D. Holmes, an instructor of 
medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital 
in Boston. ``Equally, it appears a high-fat diet also poses no 
increased risk for the disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most surprisingly, women who ate the least fat appeared to have  
a 15 percent higher rate of breast cancer, the researchers said. 
But Holmes said she's not ready to conclude that a low-fat diet 
increases breast cancer risk, because the finding was based on 
fewer than 1,000 women who ate less than 20 percent of calories as 
fat. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA's Glaspy said the new research ``is something that we're  
going to need to explain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said fat intake may need to be very low -- as little as 10  
percent of total calories -- to reduce breast-cancer risk. He also 
noted that only some kinds of fish oil have appeared beneficial in 
previous studies. The new study did not distinguish between types. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor did it run long enough to explore the possibility that  
dietary effects may take longer than 14 years to emerge, he said. 
Glaspy believes that diet interacts with environmental factors in 
subtler ways than scientists have been able to identify. 
</P>
<P>
	The theory that dietary fat is linked to breast cancer arose  
from the observation that breast-cancer rates are far lower in 
traditional Asian cultures, where diets are generally low in fat. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared with women in Western cultures, traditional Asian women  
start menstruating later, give birth at a younger age and gain far 
less weight in adulthood -- all factors that decrease breast-cancer 
risk, Holmes noted.

<HEADLINE> Top NBA Rookie Pierce Injures Ankle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- NBA rookie scoring and steals leader Paul  
Pierce had to be helped off the court after rolling his right ankle 
in the first quarter of the Celtics' game against Charlotte on 
Tuesday night. He did not return. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce was battling for a rebound with three minutes left when  
he landed awkwardly on his right ankle and it gave out on him. 
Pierce needed assistance from two members of the Celtics' staff to 
make it to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays were negative, and the Celtics originally said he would  
return to the game. But Pierce walked gingerly back to the Boston 
bench early in the second quarter and stayed there the rest of the 
period. He remained in the locker room for the second half. The 
team said the ankle stiffened up during halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce, the 10th overall selection in the 1998 draft, went into  
Tuesday night's game leading all NBA rookies with averages of 18 
points and 2.67 steals.

<HEADLINE> FDIC Chief Yields on New Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to a public outcry over privacy,  
the head of the FDIC says she's ready to drop proposed anti-money 
laundering rules that would track bank customers' habits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public has spoken very loudly and clearly,'' Donna Tanoue,  
chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said Monday in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she will urge her colleagues on the agency's  
four-member board to agree to withdraw the proposed regulations, 
called ``Know Your Customer'' rules. The board's next meeting is 
March 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tanoue spoke as the 90-day public comment period for the  
proposal closed. On Friday, the Senate joined the torrent of 
criticism and sent a message to federal bank regulators to withdraw 
the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	By an 88-0 vote, the Senate expressed support for a measure  
directing the regulators to drop the proposed rules. Senate 
Democrats blocked a vote on actual adoption of the measure, 
sponsored by Sens. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and Wayne Allard, R-Colo., 
so it lacks the force of law. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, the Banking Committee on Thursday adopted an  
amendment to a big financial services bill that would kill the 
proposed banking rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tanoue previously had said she was reconsidering the  
proposed rules, which were denounced in a flood of angry e-mail 
starting in December. The FDIC had received more than 225,000 
e-mail messages and letters as of Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed regulations would require banks to verify their  
customers' identities, know where their money comes from and 
determine their normal pattern of transactions. The current 
requirements for banks to report any ``suspicious'' transactions to 
law enforcement authorities would be expanded. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy advocates and bankers have complained that the rules  
would transform every bank teller into a spy for Big Brother. They 
maintain the rules are unconstitutional and would violate the 
Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable search and 
seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Ms. Tanoue, the FDIC board includes Comptroller  
of the Currency John D. Hawke Jr., who oversees nationally 
chartered banks. He also believes the bank rules should be 
scrapped, he told a House subcommittee last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Another board member is Ellen Seidman, director of the Office of  
Thrift Supervision, who has not yet taken a public position on the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The thrift agency, part of the Treasury Department, wanted to  
wait until after the comment period was over before it decided on a 
position, spokesman William Fulwider said Monday. ``We will look at 
it with a sense of balance and sensitivity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth director is FDIC Vice Chairman Andrew Hove, who is  
likely to agree with Ms. Tanoue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve, which also is involved in proposing the  
bank rules, has not taken a public position on them. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules are designed to combat money laundering techniques  
used by drug traffickers and other criminals to hide illegal 
profits.

<HEADLINE> Sober Message at Movie Trade Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Skyrocketing production costs and huge  
paychecks for stars and directors threaten the movie industry even 
at a time of record box office grosses, the head of 20th Century 
Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in a time of great promise and yet we are perhaps faced  
with greater problems,'' said Bill Mechanic, chairman and CEO of 
Fox Filmed Entertainment, at the start Monday of the industry's 
biggest trade show. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual ShoWest convention offers theater owners sneak movie  
previews, seminars, an all-star awards show and a peek at the 
biggest technological innovation in the industry since the 
invention of the movie projector: digital cinema. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie industry last year enjoyed record box office grosses  
and soaring attendance. But these gains have been countered by 
higher production and marketing costs, and financial problems by 
small and medium-sized theater chains. 
</P>
<P>
	Mechanic noted the problem in his luncheon speech, and said Fox  
is trying to rein in production costs, including money to the 
stars. ``The days of the $20 million (salary) with 20 percent 
against the gross may be coming to an end,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mechanic's remarks were notable since they came from the chief  
of the studio that co-produced ``Titanic,'' the most expensive 
movie in Hollywood history -- and the one with the highest box 
office grosses. Fox also is distributing what likely may be the 
biggest movie of 1999, the ``Star Wars'' prequel. 
</P>
<P>
	Mechanic made it clear that ``Titanic'' was an aberration, with  
production costs that others have estimated at more than $200 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ended up making 'Titanic' for an ungodly amount,'' he said.  
``But since then we haven't produced a single film for more than 
$70 million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And this includes, he said, last summer's special effects-laden  
films ``The X-Files'' and ``Dr. Dolittle,'' both box office hits. 
</P>
<P>
	As for high-priced stars, Mechanic noted that Fox struck gold  
with ``There's Something About Mary'' starring Ben Stiller and 
Cameron Diaz -- who didn't command top dollar at the time. Even 
Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet weren't the huge stars that 
``Titanic'' would eventually make them when they joined the sinking 
ship epic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But noting that Fox has movies coming out with Jodie Foster, Tom  
Hanks, Tom Cruise and DiCaprio, Mechanic said: ``I'm only 
cautioning against the overuse and over-dependence'' of expensive 
star vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Late Justice Blackmun Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court justices, former law clerks,  
family and members of the public paid respects to Harry A. Blackmun 
as his body lay in repose at the nation's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Blackmun was being remembered at a memorial service with  
eulogies to be given by his daughter, Nancy Blackmun, by three of 
Blackmun's former law clerks, and by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, his 
successor on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun, author of the Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized  
abortion nationwide, died Thursday at age 90. He served on the 
court for 24 years and retired in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he became the fifth Supreme Court member to lie in  
repose in the building's marble Great Hall, following Chief 
Justices Earl Warren and Warren Burger and fellow justices Thurgood 
Marshall and William Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of family members, 88 former law clerks and seven of the  
court's current nine members gathered for a solemn 15-minute 
ceremony before members of the public were allowed to file past his 
coffin. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun's widow, Dottie, listened silently from her wheelchair,  
flanked by the couple's three daughters and five grandchildren, as 
violinist Robert McDuffie played the hymn ``How Great Thou Art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun's casket, draped in the same 48-star flag that adorned  
his father's coffin, rested on the bier first used for Abraham 
Lincoln's funeral. Nearby, a 1978 portrait of the justice was on 
display. 
</P>
<P>
	During the court's morning session Monday, Chief Justice William  
H. Rehnquist noted Blackmun's death ``with sadness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chief justice said Blackmun's opinion in the Roe vs. Wade  
case ``may have obscured many other important decisions he 
authored.'' Blackmun wrote more than 350 majority decisions for the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun once said he hoped he would be remembered ``as a person  
of judicial integrity who wrote acceptably well and contributed in 
more than one field. I'd like to be known just as a good worker in 
the vineyard who held his own and contributed generally to the 
advancement of the law.''

<HEADLINE> These PGA Guys Are Good  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A 6-iron from 202 yards downwind that goes in for  
double eagle. A 3-iron from the bunker in an adjacent fairway that 
clears the palm trees and comes down 15 feet from the hole, never 
leaving its line. A chip-in for birdie with $1 million on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA Tour had the right idea when it came up with the slogan,  
``These guys are good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The more difficult message to communicate is that ``these guys''  
are more than just Tiger Woods, David Duval, Ernie Els or any other 
star people expect to see on any given Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lesson from the Match Play Championship was that any player  
among the top 64 in the world could win on any given day. 
</P>
<P>
	Now for an update from Doral: It's not just the top 64.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have not seen so much talent, since I've been on tour, as  
there is now,'' Steve Elkington said last week after his 10th 
victory in 13 years. ``There are probably more young players on 
tour that are going to emerge -- whether you guys want them to or 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The not-so-subtle message was that talent and television appeal  
should not be confused. 
</P>
<P>
	Elkington learned that himself nine years ago, when he was a  
``no-name'' player like those who littered the leaderboard at 
Doral. Seven strokes off the lead going into the final round of the 
1990 Greater Greensboro Open, he tapped in for birdie on the 18th 
for a 66, which held up for a two-stroke victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I finished so early, they didn't even have me on TV,'' he  
said. ``They got me putting out. That was the only shot they had of 
me winning the tournament. They didn't even know who I was at the 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They know him now for having one of golf's sweetest swings,  
although his swing is not much different from a decade ago. Only 
now, it belongs to a PGA Championship winner, to someone who in 
1997 went wire-to-wire to win The Players Championship against 
traditionally the toughest field in golf. 
</P>
<P>
	If Elkington had not closed with a 64 to win Doral, if Els had  
not bungled his way to a double bogey on the 18th, what would they 
have known of Greg Kraft? 
</P>
<P>
	What would have become of Doral, one of the most prestigious  
stops on the PGA Tour but picked apart this year by people more 
concerned with the anonymity of the field than the quality of the 
play? 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been reading the papers about the ``no-names'' at Doral,  
and it's a shame,'' said none other than Greg Norman. ``These guys 
can play. Why don't you look at the other side, and give credit 
where credit is due?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Small chance of that happening at Doral.  
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, after Kraft had scrambled brilliantly on the front  
to salvage a 70 and keep his two-stroke lead going into the final 
round, he was asked if his family was connected to the cheese 
company by the same name. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' Kraft said.  
</P>
<P>
	Have you ever been asked that question?  
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	There were other guilty parties. On Thursday, Franklin Langham  
shot a 67 for a share of the lead. As he was walking into the 
interview room, a tournament official was glued to the IBM scoring 
computer, tracking Norman's round and hoping the Shark would make 
some semblance of a run to restore order at Doral. 
</P>
<P>
	Another tournament official cheered Friday when a birdie went up  
for Els, which put him within two strokes of the lead. And not much 
respect was paid to Michael Bradley. Most tournaments put the 
defending champion on the cover of the program, but Bradley had to 
share space with three other past champions with far more fame. 
</P>
<P>
	If the lesser knowns took no offense, the stars rose to their  
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``You play on this tour, you can play,'' Els said. ``If you've  
got your card on the PGA Tour, you are a good player. You can 
probably win wherever you go in the world. And these guys have got 
it coming to them now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They didn't this week, but that's not to say they won't next  
week, or next year. 
</P>
<P>
	They haven't been asked to shoot a commercial yet, but perhaps  
they can find hope in Section 6-52 of the PGA Tour media guide, the 
list of players who graduated from the Nike Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe Scott Dunlap, on the Nike Tour last year at age 34, is the  
next Tom Lehman. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe Bob Burns, the Nike player of the year in 1998 after  
leading the money list, will turn out to be another Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	Els and John Daly spent time on the Hogan Tour before winning  
their two majors. Maybe that's down the road for Greg Chalmers and 
Chris Riley. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe these guys really are good, and we just don't realize it  
yet.

<HEADLINE> Holdsclaw Leads All-America Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Chamique Holdsclaw has been a standout since she arrived at  
Tennessee. Now she stands alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw was a unanimous selection to The Associated Press  
women's All-America basketball team Tuesday, becoming the first 
player voted to the first team three times. She was chosen for the 
third team as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
	The most decorated player of her time, Holdsclaw has led  
Tennessee to three consecutive national championships and could 
very well take the Lady Vols to another. She was the national 
player of the year last season and received the Sullivan Award last 
month as the nation's top amateur athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is going to be remembered as a player who had a tremendous  
impact on the women's game,'' Tennessee coach Pat Summitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw and Purdue's Stephanie White-McCarty were voted to the  
first team on all 42 ballots from a national media panel. They were 
joined on that unit by Tennessee's Tamika Catchings, Alabama's 
Dominique Canty and Colorado State's Becky Hammon. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other time one school had two first-team picks was  
1996, when Connecticut's Kara Wolters and Jennifer Rizzotti made 
the top five. The AP began picking an All-America team for women in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Catchings was named to the first, second or third team on 40  
ballots, Canty appeared on 39 and Hammon on 37. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw, so versatile at 6-foot-2 that she can play any  
position, has averaged 20.9 points and eight rebounds in leading 
Tennessee to a 28-2 record. Her scoring is down a little this 
season, but she has improved in other ways and is still the player 
the Lady Vols turn to when things get tight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Physically, she's more imposing now,'' Summitt said. ``She's  
much stronger, which I think has helped her around the basket. 
Chamique's been able to get a lot better opportunities off the 
offensive glass and physically be even more of a presence on 
defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty made the jump from honorable mention last year to  
unanimous first-team pick after leading Purdue to its first No. 1 
ranking. She's averaging 21 points and 4.6 assists, and has helped 
the Boilermakers win several close games with key plays down the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tremendous honor to be included among the top five  
players in the country,'' White-McCarty said. ``It's almost a dream 
a come true. Certainly I have to thank all my coaches and of course 
my teammates, because we're all in this together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canty, a second-team pick last year, has been a do-everything  
player for Alabama. Her 20-point scoring average is nearly twice 
that of anyone else on the team and she's also averaging 7.2 
rebounds and 4.3 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``The day she walked on our campus, she had an impact,'' said  
Alabama coach Rick Moody. ``Her demeanor on the floor has been just 
incredible because she's such a cool player and never once has she 
given any indication of a prima-donna attitude. That's just a joy 
to coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hammon has gone from a little-known high school player to the  
star of a team that has been ranked as high as fourth in the 
country. The 5-6 senior from Rapid City, S.D., averages 22.6 
points, shoots nearly 51 percent and has made 106 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a huge honor,'' Hammon said. ``I feel that I've  
earned every step, so it's even more rewarding. I wasn't highly 
recruited. I was just a little podunk kid from South Dakota. It 
wasn't like I was from Christ the King.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christ the King is the powerhouse high school in New York City  
that Holdsclaw attended. 
</P>
<P>
	Catchings was a second-team All-American a year ago after a  
spectacular freshman season, and has continued to make big plays 
this season -- including a 38-point outburst against Florida. The 
6-1 sophomore is averaging 16.8 points, 7.3 rebounds and shooting 
52 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's Semeka Randall was placed on the second team, along  
with Amanda Wilson of Louisiana Tech, Svetlana Abrosimova of 
Connecticut, Angie Braziel of Texas Tech and Tamika Whitmore of 
Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	The third team had Maylana Martin of UCLA, Jackie Stiles of  
Southwest Missouri State, Ruth Riley of Notre Dame, Dalma Ivanyi of 
Florida International and Duke's Michele Van Gorp.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Looking at Nissan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The U.S. co-chairman of DaimlerChrysler says the  
German-American automaker will likely decide before month's end 
whether to take a stake in debt-hobbled Nissan Motor Co. of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert J. Eaton denied reports that DaimlerChrysler is in a  
bidding war for Nissan with France's Renault SA. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Tuesday at the Geneva International Motor Show,  
Eaton also said he wouldn't be surprised if there are more 
defections of top American executives from DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton declined to reveal details of DaimlerChrysler's  
negotiations with Nissan. But he said statements last month that no 
decision would be made before mid-May were no longer valid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be substantially shorter than that,'' he said.  
When asked if it could be as soon as the end of March, Eaton 
replied: ``Yeah, I think it will be before that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Renault, which is considerably smaller than DaimlerChrysler,  
also has expressed interest in Nissan. But Eaton denied reports 
that the two automakers were bidding against each other. ``That's 
absolutely not the case,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Remi Deconinck, vice president of product planning for Renault,  
declined to comment on its talks with Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	Since rumors of DaimlerChrysler's interest in buying a stake in  
Nissan surfaced last year, Eaton has been more circumspect in his 
comments than his German counterpart, co-chairman Juergen Schrempp. 
Eaton is known to have rejected overtures by Nissan when he was 
chairman of the former Chrysler Corp. That has led to suggestions 
that Eaton and Schrempp are at odds over the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guarantee you he and I and every single person in management  
are together -- we've spent a lot of time on it,'' he said. ``We're 
100 percent together. There's not one iota of difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just not ready to do anything at this point. We're still  
looking at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A DaimlerChrysler-Nissan alliance could position DaimlerChrysler  
to better compete against Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp., 
Toyota Motor Corp. and Volkswagen AG, which have more extensive 
investments in China and other Asian developing markets. 
</P>
<P>
	But any deal will likely require DaimlerChrysler to take on a  
substantial portion of Nissan's staggering debt, which is estimated 
to range between $22 billion and $37 billion. Industry analysts 
expect DaimlerChrysler to demand a controlling 30 percent to 40 
percent stake with limits on its exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton also said he was not surprised by the departures of five  
top-level executives since the former Daimler-Benz acquired 
Chrysler in November. They include the former communications chief 
for Chrysler, three of its chief manufacturing executives, and the 
former head of Chrysler Financial Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a few more, I won't be surprised,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Though Eaton and Schrempp have portrayed the DaimlerChrysler  
deal as a ``merger of equals,'' some U.S. executives have 
complained privately that the Daimler half of the automaker has 
taken a firmer grip on the new company. 
</P>
<P>
	The departures also have worried some on Wall Street.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not surprising to see people leave when two companies  
merge,'' said Stephen Girsky, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter. ``What's surprising is a lot of it seems to be on the 
Chrysler side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Eaton said he expected some executives would be lured away  
by rival automakers in the merger's wake. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been recruiters circling the building for a long  
time,'' he said. ``I don't know of anybody who hasn't gotten 
offers. I know of an awful lot of people who have turned them 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton said he was not worried about DaimlerChrysler losing some  
of its best talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got an unbelievably strong team with plenty of depth,''  
he said. ``We're not concerned at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange,  
DaimlerChrysler's U.S. shares closed down $1.25 at $88.31 1/4 a share.

<HEADLINE> MacLeod Resigns As Notre Dame Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Notre Dame basketball coach John  
MacLeod, who had just three winning seasons in eight years at the 
school, resigned Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Mike Wadsworth said he met with the coach  
Tuesday afternoon and MacLeod indicated he wanted to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	MacLeod said in a statement: ``I think everything is in place  
for Notre Dame to make a positive move. I appreciated the 
opportunity to work here at Notre Dame and I wish the best for the 
young men who are part of the program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wadsworth refused to discuss the circumstances surrounding  
MacLeod's departure, insisting the coach had requested that 
Wadsworth limit what he said to what was in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	But MacLeod, 61, told The Associated Press in an interview  
Friday that he expected to be back as coach despite the team's 
14-16 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes I do. I really do,'' MacLeod said Friday. ``There's  
nothing written in stone. I'm not sitting here thinking I'm not 
going to be here. I'm going on a recruiting trip tomorrow. We've 
been working our tails off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wadsworth said he hoped to have a new coach in place by the  
April 7 signing date for basketball recruits. Wadsworth said he was 
compiling a list of potential candidates with his staff, but 
revealed no names. 
</P>
<P>
	He said only that he wanted to find someone who was a good fit  
for Notre Dame's basketball program as well as the university's 
image. 
</P>
<P>
	``Notre Dame is a university with a particular culture that  
doesn't suit all people,'' said Wadsworth, who was in Florida on 
vacation but came back Tuesday to meet with MacLeod. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result, we'll be looking for a head coach that would be  
someone that has the potential to bring us to the top level 
nationally, but most particularly would be a very good fit for 
Notre Dame, will come to Notre Dame embracing what Notre Dame 
stands for, and if we can find that kind of matchup I think we'll 
have a good selection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MacLeod has often been criticized for poor recruiting, but his  
last class pulled in Big East rookie of the year Troy Murphy and 
David Graves, both of whom started most of the season. A third 
freshmen, Harold Swanagan, saw heavy playing time, and the Irish 
finished eighth in the conference with an 8-10 record after being 
picked by the Big East coaches to finish 12th in the 13-team 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, six players have left the Notre Dame program over the  
last three seasons for a variety of reasons, and a seventh missed 
most of the year because of academic problems. That left only one 
scholarship player on the roster from the class of 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Wadsworth said the university hasn't contacted most of the  
players, who are on spring break this week, but the staff would 
complete that this week, as well as calling recruits. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a gentleman. He is a role model, and John MacLeod leaves  
Notre Dame with a great deal of integrity and a great deal of 
pride,'' Wadsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Graves, at home in Lexington, Ky., said in a phone interview  
that he wasn't sure whether MacLeod was forced out. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know because the last couple years it's always been  
is he going to leave? Is he going to stay?'' he said. ``You're not 
surprised, but it's kind of a shock when you finally hear it. You 
feel bad for him and his family, but we've still got business to 
take care of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graves said it wasn't likely that he would transfer, but he will  
wait for Notre Dame to name a successor making a final decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a commitment, and I'm going to stick to that  
commitment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish lost five of their last seven to finish 14-16, giving  
MacLeod's Notre Dame teams a 106-124 mark. His only winning years 
were 18-15 in 1991-92, his first at the school, 15-12 in 1994-95 
and 16-14 in 1996-97. MacLeod had the Fighting Irish in the NIT in 
1992 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the only coach in school history to lead the team at least  
five seasons and register an overall losing record. 
</P>
<P>
	MacLeod arrived at Notre Dame in 1991 after 18 seasons in the  
NBA with Phoenix, Dallas and the New York Knicks. His combined 
record in the NBA was 707-657 and his teams went to the playoffs 11 
times, four reaching the conference finals. He was coach at 
Oklahoma before moving to the NBA, finishing with a 90-69 mark in 
six seasons there. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame moved into the Big East for the 1995-96 season and  
the Fighting Irish never had a winning season in the league with an 
overall mark of 27-45 and an 0-4 record in the Big East tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	MacLeod was selected as Big East coach of the year in 1997 and  
had players honored by the league the last two seasons, Pat Garrity 
as player of the year in 1998 and Murphy this year.

<HEADLINE> Judge: NCAA Can't Use Minimum Score </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The NCAA's 302 Division I schools are on  
their own now in determining which freshmen are academically 
eligible to play college sports. 
</P>
<P>
	District Judge Ronald Buckwalter ruled Monday that the NCAA may  
not use a minimum test score to eliminate student-athletes from 
eligibility because the practice is unfair to blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy, known as Proposition 16, required freshmen athletes  
to have a minimum score of 820 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test 
regardless of their high school grades. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge cited the NCAA's own research showing that the  
practice harmed black students' chances of being declared 
academically eligible. He said there were other methods available 
to reach the goal of higher graduation rates that would be fairer 
to blacks -- such as a system that uses SAT scores together with 
grade-point averages in core subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Georgetown basketball coach John Thompson, who boycotted  
two games in 1989 over a forerunner of Proposition 16 called 
Proposition 48, said he had mixed emotions about the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel more upset than anything. Being right doesn't mean  
anything to me,'' he said. ``What do you do for the kids who have 
been deprived, who needed athletics to be able to get out of their 
situations?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Changes will obviously come about, but how do you go back and  
change the kids this hurt? All you can say is `Sorry,' and there's 
something wrong, very wrong with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four black student-athletes who were denied eligibility to take  
part in college sports challenged the rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The average for all 1.2 million students who took the test last  
year was 1,017. The highest possible SAT score is 1,600. 
</P>
<P>
	An NCAA attorney said the organization will seek a suspension of  
the judge's order ``because at this point there is no rule at all'' 
-- which she called a disservice to student-athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means that there is no standard to guide the schools,''  
NCAA general counsel Elsa Kircher Cole said. ``Each school will 
have to decide itself whether a student can play the first year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cole added, however, that she was pleased that the court  
recognized that improving graduate rates was a legitimate goal of 
the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Adele Kimmel, a staff lawyer with Trail Lawyers for Public  
Justice, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group, said the NCAA 
staff had recommended a ``sliding scale,'' in which test scores and 
grade-point averages in core academic courses would be given equal 
weight. But the NCAA surveyed its member schools last year, and a 
majority of them decided to reject that idea and keep Proposition 
16, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs' lawyers said the decision will be good for students  
of all races. 
</P>
<P>
	``Low-income white student-athletes will also benefit because  
the rule has had a disparate impact on them as well,'' said the 
plaintiffs' lead counsel, Andre Dennis of the Philadelphia firm of 
Stradley, Ronon, Stevens &AMP; Young. 
</P>
<P>
	Many colleges do not use a minimum test score to determine  
admission for students who are not athletes. Instead, a combination 
of test scores, grades, application essays and in-person interviews 
is considered. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who resigned from Georgetown for personal reasons in  
January in his 27th season at the university, said student-athletes 
should not be held to a strict test number. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should at least have individual evaluation mean more at  
individual institutions,'' he said. ``I never said you shouldn't 
use SAT scores, but I did say you shouldn't misuse SAT scores, and 
all along we have, as we generated statistics trying to fool the 
world.''

<HEADLINE> Slick Floor Delays Suns-Mavs Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas-Phoenix NBA game was delayed 70 minutes  
Tuesday night because of a mysterious substance that made the 
Reunion Arena floor slick. 
</P>
<P>
	Suns and Mavericks players warmed up four times while workers  
feverishly mopped the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Mavs public relations director Tony Fay said the floor became  
slick ``because of a solvent dropped on it while it was stored 
after Sunday's Dallas Stars hockey game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a joke,'' said center Chris Anstey of the Mavericks.  
``There was one spot they couldn't get up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mavericks president Terdema Ussery said postponing the game was  
no option. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to play tonight,'' he said. ``There was no date left  
where it could be made up. It's impossible because of the schedule. 
We had to play this game even it was midnight. We just wanted to 
make sure it was safe for the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a film on the floor and it wasn't condensation,''  
Ussery added. ``I walked on the floor and almost fell down. Part of 
the problem is that the players were stepping in the compound and 
tracking it around. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a strange one. We don't know what happened. Believe me  
we are looking into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix players used rubbing alcohol to clean the bottom of  
their shoes. The Mavericks just changed shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ussery added ``there's a possibility we could be fined by the  
league office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team announced that each fan at the game would be given two  
free tickets for a future contest. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been problems with the Reunion Arena floor before. In  
October, 1984 a Mavs preseason game with Philadelphia was canceled 
because of bad footing.

<HEADLINE> Concert Suit Prompts Hate Mail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A Princeton University music professor  
suing Smashing Pumpkins over their concert's noise level has 
received raucous feedback from fans of the alternative rock band. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Jeffery, a Gregorian chant expert, said Tuesday he has  
received nasty e-mails and telephone calls calling him ``a jerk'' 
and ``stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You join the ranks of the cretins who sue McDonald's for  
serving coffee too hot,'' reads one e-mail from a Smashing Pumpkins 
fan in Liverpool, England. ``You should be ashamed of yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffery, who is suing the band members, concert promoters and an  
ear plug manufacturer, says he suffered hearing damage while 
attending a 1997 Smashing Pumpkins concert with his 12-year-old 
son. 
</P>
<P>
	The band has declined comment on the lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
	Jeffery, 45, said the damage is permanent and has affected his  
professional work because it is difficult for him to focus on music 
he is studying. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffery said about 20 people have either phoned or e-mailed him  
since news reports of the lawsuit surfaced late last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe the lawsuit is true,'' said a message on a  
telephone voice mail. ``It's the most ridiculous, stupid thing I've 
ever heard of. You probably just hate your job. ... It so 
frustrated me I had to track you down because I think it's just 
total crap.''

<P>
	ARCATA, Calif. (AP) -- A bomb exploded at a Mormon student  
center, blowing the front door off its hinges and shattering 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was hurt in the blast Monday at the Church of Jesus  
Christ of Latter-Day Saints' Institute of Religion near Humboldt 
State University, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators had no suspects Tuesday.

	``It's a total surprise,'' he said. ``I've never had any

<HEADLINE> Newest Redwood Preserve a Treasure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IN THE HEADWATERS FOREST, Calif. (AP) -- Ancient redwoods 25  
stories high cling to near-vertical slopes, their bark blackened by 
centuries of fire, their tops cracked by lightning. Hawks and 
eagles glide overhead. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty yards away, a wind-swept logging road is bathed in  
sunshine, but the forest floor is dark and silent, covered in a 
deep bed of decaying bark, ferns, moss and fallen twigs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain drips from leaves, falling onto mossy underbrush. Visitors  
here find themselves enveloped in a quiet, moist twilight. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the Headwaters, America's newest redwood preserve,  
acquired last week from Pacific Lumber Co. for $480 million. A 
majestic, intimidating and vast stretch of patriarchal trees 
crossed by only two true hiking trails. Other paths tend to 
disappear in the rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising above the old timber town of Fortuna, the Headwaters core  
appears from a distance to be a gentle slope, dark and smooth. The 
redwoods, some of them nearly 2,000 years old, actually rise above 
a succession of ridges and gullies. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are going to have to be in pretty good shape to come in  
here,'' said John Morrison, a logger who has worked in the area for 
years and hiked it as a youngster. 
</P>
<P>
	California has other well-known redwood groves popular with  
hikers and campers. You can drive through a tree at Sequoia 
National Park and see them from Highway 101 at the Avenue of the 
Giants. An asphalt walkway runs through the John Muir Woods, a 
short drive from San Francisco Bay; Redwood National Park has two 
major highways running through it. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Headwaters Forest 250 miles north of San Francisco is  
still a jewel in the rough, a relatively untouched 12 square miles 
of old-growth forest in the middle of timberland that bears the 
scars of generations of logging. It is this pristine stretch that 
has been at the center of a political firestorm for more than a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Local environmentalists, who gave the forest its name, demanded  
protections for the redwoods after Pacific Lumber was acquired in 
the mid-1980s by Texas-based financier Charles Hurwitz, who 
substantially increased logging to pay for his purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	There were state and federal court battles over logging  
practices and species protection. Save-the-redwoods rallies were 
held across Northern California, culminating in the arrests of more 
than 1,000 people at the tiny mill town of Carlotta in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of haggling, Pacific Lumber agreed to sell the  
Headwaters Forest Complex, 94 square miles of land, for $250 
million in federal money and $230 million from California. The 
joint purchase covers the Headwaters core and smaller redwood 
groves known as the ``Lesser Cathedrals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, it's difficult to imagine tent sites, picnic tables,  
snack stands and outhouses in 3,000 acres of ancient trees 
surrounded by 4,500 acres of ``buffer'' forest. But development 
plans have already begun. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourists may be allowed in as early as June and various  
politicians and others have been here and gone. Interior Secretary 
Bruce Babbitt planned a press tour today. 
</P>
<P>
	Access to the dense forest may end up beginning near Fortuna at  
Newberg Gate, the site of a decade of protests. Federal officials 
and Pacific Lumber executives say the way in would follow a logging 
road, barely wide enough for one vehicle, that twists and climbs 
2,500 feet into the trees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at that road, look how narrow it is. It can't handle  
traffic,'' said Chris Perreira, a veteran timber worker whose 
property faces Newberg Road. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the logging trail is already dotted with surveyors' marks  
and steel gate posts have been sunk in cement that is still damp. 
</P>
<P>
	About two miles up, a clearing barely 80 feet across has been  
designated as a parking and staging area for hikers. Along the road 
is the debris of alders crushed by snow; by summer, it will be 
hidden by new growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really the image of nature that I keep in my mind,'' said  
Josh Brown, a member of Earth First! who brings would-be 
environmentalists into the Headwaters to show them what they are 
struggling to preserve. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a lot of parks, you can drive right up to the redwoods,  
like Avenue of the Giants,'' he said. ``But you can't in the 
Headwaters; it's a five-mile hike. I don't see the public screaming 
that `We want to drive our RV's in there.' 
</P>
<P>
	``You go in there,'' he said, ``and suddenly you're in a  
primeval world.''

<HEADLINE> Machinists Accept Lockheed Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- Machinists union members accepted a  
three-year contract proposal Tuesday, averting a strike at Lockheed 
Martin's aeronautics plant. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 4,200 workers, representing a range of employees  
including clerical, firefighters and aircraft mechanics, began 
voting before dawn at offices of Local 709 of the International 
Association of Machinists. 
</P>
<P>
	The results came in less than three hours before a walkout  
scheduled for 12:01 a.m. Union members had rejected the company's 
previous offer, leading to the strike authorization. 
</P>
<P>
	Union local president Wayne Myrick declined to provide exact  
vote totals, but said the turnout was strong and 59 percent of 
those participating voted to accept the company's terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very pleased with the results. We believe we have an  
agreement that's fair to our employees and should help keep the 
company competitive in the marketplace,'' said Lockheed spokeswoman 
Susan Miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Language regarding employee classifications, a sticking point  
when union members voted down the previous offer, were revised 
during negotiations Monday, and other refinements were made, Myrick 
said. He did not offer specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	A small ``graveyard shift'' at the plant, which has some 9,200  
employees total, had ``On Strike'' signs and picket assignments 
ready in case the offer was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin manufactures the C-130J military cargo plane and  
is the lead developer of the F-22 stealth fighter jet. The last 
strike at the plant was in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	The union leadership earlier negotiated a deal that provided for  
three annual raises of 3 percent, but rank and file members 
disliked health and retirement benefits and work schedule changes 
in the contract. Job security was also a concern at the plant, 
which has been under pressure to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	In voting Feb. 28, Machinists overwhelmingly rejected the  
contract and authorized a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	An initial strike deadline, set for Sunday, was delayed three  
days after the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service called on 
both sides to meet Monday, saying a ``substantial interruption of 
commerce'' would be created by a strike at the military aircraft 
plant in Marietta.

<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Lamar Alexander, the former Tennessee  
governor who never stopped running for president after dropping out 
of the 1996 race, officially declared his candidacy today by 
promising to be a leader ``who respects both the office and the 
people who put him there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His veiled rebuke of President Clinton was coupled with a plea  
to Republican primary voters: Don't limit your options to early 
favorites George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time the race is wide open,'' he said in a draft of his  
address. ``There is no one whose 'turn' it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Promising better schools, higher family incomes and a stronger  
military, Alexander said, ``I am here this morning to declare that 
I will be a candidate for president of the United States because I 
am ready to help our country face the challenges of a new 
century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He denounced Clinton ``and his faithful servant,'' Vice  
President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have given us what their polls tell them -- but that is  
not leadership,'' he said. The booming economy is nothing but a 
``magic show,'' disguising with political sleight of hand America's 
failing schools, bigger bureaucracies, weakening national defense 
and deepening racial polarization. 
</P>
<P>
	And worst of all: ``Our standards of right and wrong have all  
but disappeared,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A new American Century will require a moral foundation laid by  
a president who respects both the office and the people who put him 
there; a president who knows what it took to make this nation great 
and what it will take to keep it that way,'' Alexander said, 
without mentioning the Monica Lewinsky scandal or other Clinton 
controversies. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander's climb in 2000 promises to be at least as steep as  
four years ago, when he and his trademark checkered shirts finished 
third in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary before 
petering out. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the main establishment-candidate challenger to eventual  
nominee Bob Dole in 1996, and came within a few thousand votes of 
knocking the front-runner out in New Hampshire. But this time the 
field is more crowded, with Dole's wife and the son of former 
President Bush joining Vietnam War hero Sen. John McCain of Arizona 
in competition for the same voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elizabeth Dole and John McCain will also be there to pick up  
the pieces if and when Bush fails,'' said GOP strategist Greg 
Mueller, an ally of another GOP rival, millionaire businessman 
Steve Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said Monday he will decide whether to run next week,  
though he is widely expected to join the fray. His formal 
announcement is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander is the third GOP candidate to formally announce,  
following Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire and conservative 
commentator Pat Buchanan. The GOP field could hit double digits. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley are the only announced  
Democratic Party candidates, though civil rights activist Jesse 
Jackson is seriously considering the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the governor of Texas, received waves of publicity this  
week simply for forming a presidential exploratory committee. Dole, 
former president of the American Red Cross, will get similar 
treatment Wednesday when she takes the same baby step. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander chafes at the attention given his rivals, arguing that  
nobody is a front-runner a year before the primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Alexander shouldn't be counted out.  
</P>
<P>
	He plans to raise $15 million this year. He is the best  
organized candidate in Iowa, where former Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad 
is heading his operation, and has built a formidable New Hampshire 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	He has visited the early primary states dozens of times since  
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander also has a relatively defined agenda to improve  
schools, family incomes and the nation's security -- in contrast to 
Bush and Dole, who have avoided detailed discussions of most 
national issues so far. Bush on Monday said he would back a 
constitutional amendment to outlaw most abortions if more voters 
supported it. But he said, ``America is not ready to ban 
abortions.'' He called himself a ``pro-life person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who said he would make ``strong and practical  
proposals to bring out the best in America,'' has not gained 
traction in public opinion polls nor does he seem to inspire 
passion among activists. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't explain why he isn't catching on,'' said conservative  
organizer Grover Norquist of Washington. He said it may be that 
Alexander has never pushed his policies beyond the tried and true 
to prove his commitment to conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander's core policies have change little since 1996, with  
one exception: His attacks on Washington, a place he called an 
``arrogant empire'' in his 1996 announcement speech, are less 
pronounced this time. 
</P>
<P>
	He wants to send federal education money directly to the states  
and reduce bureaucratic meddling. 
</P>
<P>
	Inheritance and capital gains taxes should be cut, as well as  
the penalty for some married couples, he said. Alexander proposes 
to triple the tax deduction for each child to $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
	On national security, Alexander said he would push for a missile  
defense system and a new branch of the armed services to stem the 
flow of drugs from other countries.

<HEADLINE> Fluor Plans To Cut 5,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVINE, Calif. (AP) -- International construction and engineering  
giant Fluor Corp. plans to eliminate 5,000 jobs and close 15 
satellite offices in a bid to boost profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The cutbacks are expected to save the company about $160 million  
a year. Fluor will take a $130 million charge in the second quarter 
of 1999 to cover the costs of the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings from construction and engineering have been hurt by  
recession in Asia and Latin America. Fluor's coal operations also 
have suffered as a relatively mild winter has reduced demand, the 
company said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are implementing actions intended to deal with both  
deteriorating business environments in our two principal business 
segments and strategically position the company for profitability, 
growth and the creation of shareholder value longer term,'' said 
Philip J. Carroll Jr., Fluor's chairman and chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll told shareholders gathered for the company's annual  
meeting that the restructuring would boost the return on operation 
assets from 9 percent during 1998 to more than 13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, Fluor will be divided into four business groups  
focusing on engineering and construction, coal mining, global 
services and in-house administrative services. 
</P>
<P>
	The global services group provides consulting services and heavy  
industrial and construction equipment to clients.

<HEADLINE> Va., Mo. Execute Convicted Killers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JARRATT, Va. (AP) -- A man who killed an electrical supply  
company owner during a botched burglary was executed by injection 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	George Quesinberry Jr., 37, was put to death for the 1989 murder  
of Thomas Haynes. Quesinberry and a friend broke into the Tri-City 
Electrical Supply Co. office and were rummaging through desks when 
Haynes showed up to take care of some chores. 
</P>
<P>
	Haynes, 63, fled but Quesinberry chased him, shot him twice and  
struck him in the head with the handgun, fracturing his skull. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want my family to know I love them, and to the victim's  
family I am sorry for what I've done,'' Quesinberry said in a final 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In Missouri, Roy Roberts, 46, was executed by injection early  
Wednesday for holding a prison guard while other inmates stabbed 
him to death during a riot in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts' last words were, in part, ``you're killing an innocent  
man.'' His fate was sealed late Tuesday when Gov. Mel Carnahan 
refused a clemency request. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan, who commuted a Darrell Mease's death sentence to life  
in prison this year at the request of the pope, had received pleas 
for mercy on Roberts' behalf from the Vatican and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan last month refused to halt the execution of convicted  
killer James Rodden, who became the first Missouri inmate to be put 
to death since Pope John Paul II's January visit to St. Louis. 
Immediately following that visit, the governor reduced Mease's 
sentence.

	U.S. Envoy To Meet Yugoslav Leader  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- American envoy Richard Holbrooke was  
scheduled to meet with Yugoslavia's hard-line president tomorrow in 
an effort to get him to agree to a peace plan that would end the 
year-old war in the Serbian province of Kosovo. Holbrooke was 
instrumental in brokering a cease-fire last October that averted 
NATO retaliatory attacks. That cease-fire has unraveled but 
Holbrooke and Milosevic are believed to work well together. But 
Holbrooke warned of a possible ``collision course'' between NATO -- 
which has threatened airstrikes if no agreement is reached -- and 
Milosevic. The reported consent of Kosovo Liberation Army leaders 
to the plan has encouraged U.S. and European envoys to press the 
Serbs.

	Furor Grows Over Fired Scientist  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican lawmakers demanded today that the  
Clinton administration explain why a nuclear weapons lab scientist 
kept his job while under investigation for espionage. But Vice 
President Al Gore characterized the matter as a problem ``that 
happened during the previous administration.'' ``The law 
enforcement agencies have pressed it and pursued it aggressively 
with our full support,'' Gore said on CNN. Wen Ho Lee has not been 
charged with any crime, but he has been the prime suspect in a 
three-year investigation into allegations that China obtained 
sensitive weapons-design information in the 1980s.

Central American countries rebuild in the aftermath of Hurricane 
Mitch, President Clinton said they have helped repair a legacy of 
mistrust in the region bred by decades of U.S. involvement in coups 
and civil wars. U.S. troops were credited with saving more than 
1,000 people and providing medical treatment to more than 35,000 
people following last fall's devastating hurricane. Clinton 
announced the award of humanitarian service medals to all U.S. 
forces who took part in the relief effort.

	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Lamar Alexander, fighting in the shadows  
of front-running GOP stars Elizabeth Dole and Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush, declared his presidential candidacy by urging Republicans to 
look beyond familiar names. ``This time the race is wide open,'' 
the former Tennessee governor said. Alexander also belittled fellow 
Tennessean -- and likely Democratic candidate -- Al Gore as President 
Clinton's ``faithful assistant.'' Meanwhile, aides to Mrs. Dole 
said she was moving closer to a 2000 run for the White House and 
will announce a presidential exploratory tomorrow at a rally in

Researchers compared the diets of the women without breast cancer

diet is still good for other aspects of health.

<HEADLINE> White House Targets Farm Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cattle feedlots and large hog and poultry  
farms will face tighter regulations under a new national water 
pollution control strategy from the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	But some of the more stringent requirements, including  
compliance with permits under tougher federal standards, would not 
go into effect for several years under the plan, some 
environmentalists complained. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal strategy for reducing nutrient runoff into waterways  
from large, concentrated agricultural facilities was being 
announced today by Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists briefed by the plan on Monday said it does not  
go far enough to address the severe problems of pollution from 
thousands of large ``factory farms'' including poultry producers, 
hog farms and cattle feedlots. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will not solve the growing problem of factory farm  
pollution soon enough,'' said Robbin Marks of the Natural Resources 
Defense Council. The environmentalists said the government should 
impose a moratorium on permits for such facilities and move to 
close open-air waste lagoons at such sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said the plan will require thousands of  
additional facilities to get permits and develop nutrient 
management plans. While the regulations will not go into effect 
until after 2001, thousands of additional operators will have to 
get permits under existing standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``This comprehensive strategy tackles a major threat to water  
quality. Through tough standards and flexible new approaches, we 
can ensure communities across the country cleaner, safer water,'' 
Gore planned to tell environmental and agricultural leaders at a 
meeting at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The broad outline is similar to a draft version released last  
September and is aimed at providing the blueprint for new 
regulations to control runoff from feed lots, large hog farms and 
poultry farms. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency is to develop the new  
technology standards for reducing pollution, mostly nutrient runoff 
into lakes and streams. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, called it ``a giant leap toward holding  
the biggest livestock producers accountable for water pollution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But environmentalists were not as enthusiastic.  
</P>
<P>
	``It does nothing in the near-term to address the serious  
shortcomings of current animals waste practices,'' said Joe Rudek, 
a scientists for the Environmental Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathryn Hohmann of the Sierra Club said the plan provides ``no  
real protection of groundwater'' and will do little to address air 
pollution from such facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of cleaning up, the plan will have many of the largest  
factory farms writing up strategies for storing and disposing large 
volumes of manure, based on existing federal waste management 
standards and practices,,'' said the Environmental Defense Fund in 
a statement.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Ex-Owner Might Owe $45M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A former owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins  
could owe the bankrupt team's banks $45 million, according to 
documents filed in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for current Penguins co-owner Roger Marino said the  
documents indicate that former co-owner Morris Belzberg guaranteed 
loans that banks made to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a contract, and I think that the secured  
creditors are the beneficiaries of that contract,'' said Harry 
Manion III, one of Marino's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Belzberg guaranteed to pay the shortfall,'' Manion added.  
</P>
<P>
	Belzberg is one of the original partners of Penguins co-owner  
Howard Baldwin and retains a stake in the team. He is not on the 
hook for the $45 million, said his lawyer, Steven Engberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was done for tax purposes,'' Engberg said.  
</P>
<P>
	Engberg said the only way Belzberg would be liable to repay the  
$45 million is if the Penguins were sold and the price fell short 
of the amount needed to pay off the loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins owe banks and insurance companies about $70  
million, but the team is worth about $94 million, Engberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino also has demanded that all partners invest an additional  
$600,000 or lose their investment in the team. Marino's order gives 
Belzberg until Friday to make the additional investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Engberg said the bankruptcy filed last October puts a hold on  
such a demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't have the right to do that,'' Engberg said.

<HEADLINE> Joe DiMaggio Starred As Ad Pitchman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Before Miller Brewing Co. assembled its All-Star  
team of former sports stars to sell beer, Joe DiMaggio showed a 
retired athlete could still have a big influence with consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The graceful Hall of Fame outfielder, who died Monday, started  
pitching coffee makers more than two decades after his 1951 
retirement from baseball as one of the most revered members of the 
New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	His ads for Mr. Coffee, starting in 1973, helped show  
advertisers that sports figures could still command attention after 
their playing days. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1975, Miller Brewing Co. began featuring retired sports stars  
in ads for Miller Lite in mock debates over whether the beer's 
appeal was because it was ``less filling'' or ``tastes great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``DiMaggio and the Miller Lite campaign proved the retired  
athlete with the proper creative approach could be effective in an 
advertising campaign,'' said Marty Blackman, who helps match 
advertisers with athletes and other celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was the personal choice of the inventor of the Mr.  
Coffee machines, Vincent Marotta of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Marotta put the machines on the market in 1972. They introduced  
automatic drip technology for coffee making and sharply reduced the 
amount of time needed to brew a cup. 
</P>
<P>
	But he felt he needed a big-name personality to appear in  
network TV ads to sell them nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Marotta said in a telephone interview on Monday that DiMaggio  
was his choice because people still respected his sports 
achievements, he had a clean reputation and he also brought with 
him a bit of mystery due to his brief marriage with actress Marilyn 
Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
	Marotta got DiMaggio's unlisted phone number in San Francisco  
and called one Saturday morning in January 1973. DiMaggio answered. 
</P>
<P>
	Marotta explained who he was and described his new coffee  
machines. DiMaggio told him he had just won one the coffee makers 
in a golf tournament and said his sister ``is making coffee with it 
right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the ex-baseball star told Marotta he wasn't interested in  
being in a commercial for the coffee makers, saying ``I don't do 
that kind of work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marotta said he thanked DiMaggio for listening and hung up, but  
he didn't give up. The next day, Marotta and his wife flew to San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday morning, Marotta called DiMaggio again and invited him to  
come over to their hotel for lunch. DiMaggio agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never asked him why he came to that hotel. I figured the  
reason he came was he felt this poor slob came all the way across 
the country, so at least I could spend an hour with him before 
sending him back,'' Marotta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marotta met DiMaggio alone for lunch and talked for more than  
two hours about his plans for his coffee maker business. DiMaggio's 
expression barely changed during lunch, but as he reached out to 
shake hands after the meal, DiMaggio told Marotta he would make the 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	Marotta said they hadn't discussed a price and suggested ``a  
very low number'' to which DiMaggio replied ``Whatever you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio appeared in four or five commercials in 1973 and in  
additional ads that ran through the mid-1980s, Marotta said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said DiMaggio's annual pay rose to the $300,000 to $400,000  
range for the Mr. Coffee ads. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio made commercials run locally for the Bowery Savings  
bank in New York, but Marotta said he didn't think DiMaggio made 
any other national ads. Marotta sold his company in 1987, and it is 
now owned by Sunbeam Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe DiMaggio was an enormous asset for us. I'll forever be  
grateful to him,'' Marotta said.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Block Oliver Stone Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The U.S. Supreme Court's decision not to  
derail a lawsuit blaming the makers of ``Natural Born Killers'' for 
a copycat crime has cast a chill on Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could have a strangling effect on creativity,'' said  
writer Amy Holden Jones, whose movies include ``Indecent Proposal'' 
and ``Mystic Pizza.'' ``Where it leads boggles the mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit accuses filmmaker Oliver Stone, producer Time Warner  
Entertainment Co., and others of intentionally inciting a teen-age 
couple to shoot Patsy Byers in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Byers was left a quadriplegic during a robbery of the  
Ponchatoula, La., convenience store where she worked. Sarah 
Edmondson and Benjamin Darras, both 18 at the time, were convicted 
in the shooting and each were sentenced to 35 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Edmondson told investigators that she and Darras performed  
crimes similar to those in Stone's 1994 ultraviolent movie, which 
portrays a couple who kill 52 people in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court's action Monday was not a ruling but merely a  
denial of review. The case now moves back to Louisiana for pretrial 
motions. 
</P>
<P>
	Most in Hollywood dismissed the idea that Stone or anyone else  
in the film industry intends for the audience to go out and try to 
relive a movie plot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the media should lose any sleep over this,''  
said Jonathan Kotler, a lawyer who specializes in media law. ``This 
happens every time there is a copycat killing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Director Luis Mandoki said that if it can be proven that  
``Natural Born Killers'' caused audience members to commit crimes, 
then television news crews and executives could be faulted for most 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	John Schulman, general counsel for Time Warner, said the lawsuit  
threatens freedom of expression. ``We will continue to defend 
vigorously the constitutional rights of artists and directors to 
express their creative ideas without fear of liability,'' he said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit may center on a statement Stone made in a 1996  
interview when he was quoted as saying: ``The most pacifistic 
people in the world said they came out of this movie and wanted to 
kill somebody,'' according to Joe Simpson, lawyer for the Byers 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit does not specify alleged monetary damages. Under  
Louisiana law, civil suits do not ask for a specific damage award. 
</P>
<P>
	More than two dozen media groups supported the filmmakers'  
positions, including the Authors Guild, National Association of 
Broadcasters and Recording Industry Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone, busy on a Miami set of an upcoming movie, was unavailable  
for comment. But in Hollywood, support for the director was 
universal. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Mr. Stone puts violence in his movies, he does it for  
dramatic purposes to show the folly of violence, not to incite 
it,'' said David Davis, an entertainment industry investment 
banker. 
</P>
<P>
	``A movie is not enough to change someone's attitude and make  
them commit such a heinous crime,'' said Rick Jewell, a film 
historian. ``Millions of people saw that movie and did not go out 
and do anything abnormal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit had initially been dismissed by a Louisiana judge  
because the First Amendment bars claims over copycat crimes. But a 
state appeals court reinstated it because of an allegation that the 
filmmakers had set out to incite the audience.

<HEADLINE> Chip Maker's Shares Tumble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNNYVALE, Calif. (AP) -- Shares of computer chip maker AMD  
tumbled more than 10 percent this morning after the company 
forecast a ``significant'' loss for the current quarter and a 
restructuring program that will cut about 300 jobs over the next 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
	In an announcement after financial markets closed Monday, AMD  
also said it would fall short of its goal of shipping 5.5 million 
K6 processors during the quarter ending March 28. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading this morning on the New York Stock Exchange, AMD was  
off $1.93 3/4 at $17 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring is aimed at increasing the company's focus on  
microprocessors and other circuits that enhance the value of 
personal computers as tools for communications and information 
processing, AMD said. 
</P>
<P>
	AMD employs 13,800 people worldwide, with 6,900 in the United  
States. It posted a loss of $55.8 million on sales of $540.9 
million in the first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	AMD supplies integrated circuits for the computer and  
communications markets. It produces processors, flash memories, 
programmable logic devices and products for communications and 
networking applications.

<HEADLINE> Group: Credit Insurance a Ripoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers who buy credit insurance when they  
take out a loan, buy a car or get a credit card are being 
overcharged by $2 billion a year, Consumers Union and another group 
charged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Griffin, insurance counsel for Consumers Union, and Birny  
Birnbaum, consulting economist for the Center for Economic Justice, 
blamed state insurance regulators for what they said is lax 
supervision of credit insurance sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're asking the states to do their job,'' Birnbaum said at a  
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	An official of the National Association of Insurance  
Commissioners, which represents the state regulators, said they 
shared some of the concerns about credit insurance rates and were 
looking into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Several regulators ``have expressed concern about the credit  
industry in general'' and credit insurance rates, said Steven 
Larsen, chairman of the NAIC's market conduct and consumer affairs 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``This needs to be re-examined,'' Larsen, who also is Maryland's  
insurance commissioner, said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit insurance pays a lender, such as a bank or finance  
company, car dealer, department store or credit card company, if a 
borrower becomes disabled or dies. Other types of credit insurance 
provide for monthly payments if a borrower loses his job, or for 
repair or replacement of property bought with the loan or used as 
collateral. 
</P>
<P>
	More than $17 billion in credit insurance was sold in this  
country in 1995 to 1997, according to Consumers Union, which 
publishes ``Consumer Reports'' magazine, and the Center for 
Economic Justice, an advocate for low-income consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Although buying the insurance usually is not mandatory, the two  
groups maintain that lenders often coerce consumers into taking it. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups released a study of credit insurance sales in that  
period which concluded that most consumers are paying more than is 
reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think (most) consumers should stay away from this  
product,'' Ms. Griffin told reporters. Credit insurance ``is a bad 
deal and it's only getting worse,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	An exception, Ms. Griffin said, involves those consumers who  
live in states with cheaper rates for credit insurance or who are 
elderly or in poor health. 
</P>
<P>
	The states with the cheapest rates, according to the study, were  
New York, Maine, Pennsylvania, Vermont, New Jersey, West Virginia, 
Rhode Island, Michigan and Virginia, in that order. 
</P>
<P>
	Many consumers already have life insurance policies that cover  
their debts if they die, and homeowners insurance often covers 
property losses, Ms. Griffin noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Janet Eissenstadt, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers  
Association, agreed with that point. 
</P>
<P>
	As with any financial product, consumers should examine whether  
they need credit insurance, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Read the fine print,'' Ms. Eissenstadt advised.  
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Zielinski, a spokesman for the American Insurance  
Association, the industry's largest trade group, had no immediate 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The states with the most unreasonable rates, according to the  
report, were Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, Alaska, Nevada, 
Nebraska, New Mexico, Minnesota, South Dakota and Utah, in that 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	The rankings were based on average loss ratios for credit  
insurance in each state. The loss ratio is the ratio between the 
total amount paid out in benefits and the amount the consumer paid 
for the insurance.

<HEADLINE> Case Dropped in $2 Robbery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A 15-year-old retarded boy grabbed  
$2 in lunch money out of the pocket of a classmate -- and for that, 
he could have gotten life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	For weeks, prosecutors defended their decision to treat Anthony  
Laster as an adult, even though the boy communicates on the level 
of a 5-year-old. He spent four weeks, including Christmas, in a 
jail for adults because his sister was unable to raise the $500 
needed to get him out. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, last week, two days after ``60 Minutes'' arrived to do a  
story on the case, the charges were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor offered no apologies for his zero-tolerance stand  
in the case of Anthony, who never knew his father and whose mother 
died in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``You do not cherry-pick the cases, you do not say you feel  
sorry for this person because there's a developmental disability or 
this person has had a bad family life so we won't charge him as an 
adult,'' said Mike Edmondson, a spokesman for Palm Beach County 
State Attorney Barry Krischer. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to drop the charges of strong-arm robbery,  
extortion and petty theft Thursday had nothing to do with ``60 
Minutes,'' Edmondson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-year-old victim changed his story and his new version did  
not back up the severity of the charges, Edmondson explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The child originally told police he felt threatened and in fear  
of physical harm when Anthony demanded his money during art class 
Dec. 1 at a Boynton Beach middle school. Later, he said he did not 
feel he was in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	State law gives prosecutors authority to decide which juveniles  
are treated as adults. Edmondson said in Palm Beach County, the 
policy is to treat as adults all offenders who are at least 14 and 
have committed a felony. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it is automatic, they've got a lot of holes in their zero-  
tolerance policy,'' said John Walsh, an attorney with the Juvenile 
Advocacy Project who was appointed by a court to represent Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony did not deny taking the money. He said he was hungry and  
used the money to buy candy, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said what was needed in this case was for someone to take  
a look at the child and his circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe if they had done that they would have seen that he was  
having difficulty dealing with his mother's death,'' he said. 
``There just seemed to be very little attention to the individual 
child. No one seemed to care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony's family did not return calls for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	``You scan the country, you rarely find cases this outrageous,''  
said Dan Macallair, associate director of the Justice Policy 
Institute in San Francisco. ``This particular prosecutor is 
prosecuting kids in adult court that probably shouldn't even have 
gotten past the school principal.''

<HEADLINE> Holyfield Stands by KO Prediction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Evander Holyfield calls it the truth. Lennox  
Lewis called it preposterous. 
</P>
<P>
	What the two heavyweights, who will fight in a showdown in  
sold-out Madison Square Garden Saturday night, were talking about 
was Holyfield's prediction that he will win by a third-round 
knockout. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Tuesday if he was holding to his prediction, made a couple  
of weeks ago, Holyfield replied: ``The truth is I'm knocking him 
out in the third round. I'm not asking anybody here to believe 
that. I'm not asking anybody to write that. But you can write it 
now or write it later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One who does not believe it is Lewis, who smilingly said his  
prediction for the fight is, ``He will not knock me out in the 
third round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield, the 36-year-old IBF and WBA champion, and Lewis, the  
33-year-old WBC champion from Britain, both worked out Tuesday -- 
Holyfield in the Church Street boxing gym at the tip of Manhattan 
and Lewis in The Theater in the Garden complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield sparred three rounds with James Gaines and rocked him  
in the second round with two right uppercuts and a left to the 
body. Lewis just loosened up. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield said his prediction has nothing to do with Lewis,  
``except that Lewis is going to be the opponent. Everybody who 
fights me has courage and heart and skills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When someone wondered why Holyfield is so supremely confident  
for such a major match against such a dangerous opponent, he 
replied: ``I'm a born-again Christian and I believe in the word. 
Each and every time, I'm supposed to be better. It would be wrong 
for me to be bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield worked out in a stark, whitewashed back room at the  
gym near Wall Street, but none of the champion's fellow 
multimillionaires were present. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last fight, Holyfield went the 12-round distance in  
outpointing Vaughn Bean on Sept. 19, and Lewis has said Holyfield 
looked very ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
	``His (Bean's) goal was just to survive and not win,'' Holyfield  
said. ``Lennox is coming to win, and because Lennox is coming to 
win, that makes it a great fight ... but a short night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He should have knocked Vaughn Bean out in the third round and  
not be predicting he will knock me out,'' Lewis said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Evander Holyfield has no second thoughts about  
his prediction for his heavyweight title fight with Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still holding to the truth,'' he said. ``The truth is I'm  
going to knock him out in the third round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old IBF-WBA champion, who made the prediction a  
couple of weeks ago, is the 6-5 favorite to keep his title and add 
Lewis' WBC championship at Madison Square Garden on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not asking anybody here to believe that,'' Holyfield said

on fighting inside. In the second round he landed two solid right 
uppercuts and hard left hook to the body.

<HEADLINE> Goldman Sachs Partners OK Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The partners in Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., an elite  
Wall Street investment bank, have voted to turn the last large 
private partnership into a public company. 
</P>
<P>
	However, one of their longtime leaders has disclosed he will  
leave Goldman after the stock sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Jon S. Corzine, who currently shares the chairman's title with  
Henry M. Paulson, disclosed after the vote Monday that he will 
leave Goldman after the sale, which could come as early as May. 
Goldman is expected to sell at least 10 percent of the firm to the 
public, raising more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Going public would mark the end of an era for the secretive,  
130-year-old investment bank. Goldman Sachs' partners will be 
giving up some control in exchange for the cash the firm needs to 
keep pace with competitors like Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and Morgan 
Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``In making this difficult and daunting decision, the (Goldman)  
partners will give up a great deal in terms of privacy, loyalty and 
the ability to make decisions based on the long term,'' said Lisa 
Endlich, a former Goldman vice president and author of the new book 
``Goldman Sachs: The Culture of Success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman was prepared to sell stock last fall, but withdrew the  
offer as the market faltered. Monday's vote came after Friday's 
record-high close for the Dow Jones industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
	Corzine, 52, who joined Goldman in 1975 and helped build up the  
firm's bond-trading division, lost his shared title as co-chief 
executive in January in what some have called a coup in the firm's 
executive management committee. Now, he's planning to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``The completion of the public offering will mark a logical and  
appropriate point for me to move on in my career and life,'' 
Corzine said in a statement Monday. ``As of the closing of the 
offering, I will stand down from my remaining duties within the 
firm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corzine's reputation inside the investment bank suffered after  
Goldman postponed plans to go public in September, spent hundreds 
of millions to bail out a failing hedge fund, and then lost several 
hundred million in bad bond trades. 
</P>
<P>
	But Monday, Henry M. Paulson Jr., who is now the sole chief  
executive, had only words of praise for Corzine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We deeply appreciate Jon Corzine's vision in preparing the  
firm for this moment in history,'' he said. ``We thank him for his 
leadership and grace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote to go public, however, was not without acrimony and  
some internal strife. Some Goldman executives, including former 
co-chariman John Whitehead, have expressed concerns that selling 
shares to the public would rupture the Goldman culture. 
</P>
<P>
	At most investment banks, loyalty is paid for with six-figure  
salaries and larger bonuses. Top talent are often bid away by 
competitors. But at Goldman, which has the lowest turnover on Wall 
Street, young associates work hard in hopes of being made a 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lure of partnership has been very, very strong -- it's the  
crowning glory on Wall Street,'' said Endlich, the author. 
``Without that, they have to reward people like everyone else -- 
with stock options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman is starting to look a bit more like the competition in  
other ways as well. Last week, the company appointed two women to 
its executive management committee, the first appointment of any 
women to the panel. Goldman Sachs also is making strategic 
investments in online trading and is said to be exploring 
opportunities to provide services to average investors for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Goldman also named five executives to its board of  
directors. The insiders on the board are: Paulson; Robert J. Hurst, 
vice chairman; John A. Thain, co-chief operating officer; John L. 
Thornton, co-chief operating officer; John L. Weinberg, senior 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman will name three outside directors after the stock  
offering.

<P>
	PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) -- Harold Rhodes was fired as women's  
basketball coach at Washington State on Tuesday after only four 
winning seasons in 17 years.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Brand Unanimous All-America Choice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	All but one of the players on the Associated Press preseason  
All-America team were on the postseason version as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The only one who wasn't was Jason Terry, and on Monday he became  
Arizona's fourth All-America in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day during the offseason I would walk by the basketball  
office and see the photos on the wall of all the guys who have been 
All-Americans here and tried to picture myself up there,'' he said. 
``Now, to think that I will have a photo up there, makes me realize 
what an accomplishment this is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terry joined Sean Elliott (1988 and 1989), Damon Stoudamire  
(1995), Mike Bibby (1998) and Miles Simon (1998) on the wall 
outside coach Lute Olson's office. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined Elton Brand of Duke, Andre Miller of Utah, Richard  
Hamilton of Connecticut and Mateen Cleaves of Michigan State on the 
1998-99 AP All-America team. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, a 6-foot-8 sophomore center who missed almost half of  
last season with a broken foot, was the only unanimous selection. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, who averaged 17.8 points and 9.8 rebounds for the  
top-ranked Blue Devils, was named on all 72 first-team ballots by 
the national media panel to become the fourth unanimous selection 
of the '90s. The others were Christian Laettner of Duke in 1992, 
Glenn Robinson of Purdue in 1994 and Tim Duncan of Wake Forest in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unbelievable. I'm just elated right now. Just to have  
been considered for a position of first-team All-America is a 
special, special honor,'' said Brand, who shot 62 percent from the 
field. ``I knew I worked hard, and the hard work paid off. Growing 
up, it's one of the things you definitely dream of. I'm definitely 
a team person and the individual accolades come when the team 
wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand was an honorable mention All-America last season despite  
missing 15 games with the injury, but he showed he was healed this 
summer when he led the U.S. team in the Goodwill Games in scoring 
and rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, a senior guard was the second-leading vote-getter in the  
5-3-1 process, getting 330 points with 60 first-team votes. The 
Western Athletic Conference player of the year averaged 15.9 
points, 5.5 rebounds, 5.7 assists and 2.5 steals, and the 6-2 guard 
was given more credit for his team leadership than statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real honor. I can't take the credit myself because we  
have a great team and they deserve the award also,'' said Miller, 
an honorable mention last season when the Utes reached the Final 
Four. ``It makes being a leader easy when you have a team like we 
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, who won or shared Big East player of the year honors  
the last two seasons, averaged 21.0 points and 4.8 rebounds this 
season for the Huskies who were ranked No. 1 for 10 weeks. The 6-6 
junior swingman, the leading vote-getter on the second team last 
season, had 48 first-team votes and 300 points this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's worked hard at expanding his total game, and has become  
one of the top collegiate players in the nation,'' Connecticut 
coach Jim Calhoun said. ``Last year, he just missed being a 
first-team selection and this year has rightfully earned his spot 
among the top five players in college basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terry, the Pac-10 player of the year, led the league in scoring  
(22.1), assists (5.6) and steals (2.7) -- the first player to do 
that since Gary Payton of Oregon State in 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no one more deserving for this honor because of what  
he has had to go through, in that he has had to provide leadership 
to the three freshmen in our starting lineup,'' Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry, a 6-2 senior, got 48 first-team votes and 293 points, 83  
more than Cleaves, who was on 19 first-team ballots.

<HEADLINE> NYC Commissioner Defends Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Police Commissioner Howard Safir confirmed that  
police searched the home of Amadou Diallo and questioned his 
roommates but denied officers did so to help justify the fatal 
shooting of the unarmed West African immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Diallo's family have accused investigators of  
ransacking the man's home and interrogating his roommates in a bid 
to sully his character. 
</P>
<P>
	Safir insisted at a news conference Monday that the roommates --  
who did not know that police had fatally shot Diallo -- were free to 
leave the precinct house whenever they wished, and that police went 
through Diallo's belongings in order to track down his relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Safir said detectives just ``followed the normal procedures they  
would follow in any shooting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, the National Congress for Puerto Rican Rights  
joined two young black men in a lawsuit that accuses the NYPD's 
Street Crimes Unit of stopping and frisking thousands of black and 
Hispanic New Yorkers because of their ethnic background. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit demands that the elite crime-fighting unit be  
disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
	Four undercover officers from the unit shot 41 bullets at  
Diallo, a 22-year-old street vendor, while they were searching for 
a rapist in the Bronx on Feb. 4. Diallo was hit 19 times. A lawyer 
for the officers has said they believed Diallo had a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	The Center for Constitutional Rights, a legal activist group  
representing the plaintiffs, said the unit's tactics violate the 
constitutional protection against unreasonable search and seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	Safir said neither the Street Crimes Unit nor any other part of  
the police department uses racial profiling. He declined to comment 
on the lawsuit but said the NYPD would respond in court.

<HEADLINE> NASA Unable To Save Star Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- With a multimillion-dollar star research  
mission over before it started, NASA is left only with an 
out-of-control satellite and resolve to figure out what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wide-Field Infrared Explorer cannot conduct its science  
mission because all the frozen hydrogen needed to cool the 
satellite's telescope melted and vented into space, NASA said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency spent a fruitless weekend trying to regain control of  
the spinning spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Ground controllers were slowly beginning to decrease the spin by  
using the satellite's magnetic attitude control system and hoped to 
have it stabilized by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA spent about $73 million on the satellite's development,  
launch and operations, spokesman Don Savage said. Had the mission 
gone forward, operations and data analysis costs would have put the 
total over $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Weiler, associate administrator for space science at NASA  
headquarters, said he was disappointed but confident upcoming 
missions could accomplish some of the goals ``so it will be science 
delayed rather than science lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite, nicknamed Wire, was intended to study  
``starburst'' galaxies, those in which rapid star formation is 
taking place. It was also going to study infant galaxies known as 
protogalaxies. Scientist had expected to detect at least 50,000 
galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite incorporated a variety of new technologies and it  
can still be used as an engineering ``testbed,'' said Lynn Jenner, 
a spokeswoman for Goddard Space Flight Center, where it was 
developed under the Small Explorer program. 
</P>
<P>
	Wire was launched March 4 on a Pegasus rocket dropped from an  
aircraft flying off the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Wire was on its second orbit when ground stations detected that  
it was spinning rather than maintaining a stable orientation, and 
that the cryostat -- the container for the hydrogen -- was warmer 
than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The hydrogen was supposed to have lasted four months. Instead,  
it rapidly melted and vented. The force of that venting is believe 
to have caused the spin. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials believe a cover over the telescope came off  
prematurely and allowed sunlight to fall on the instrument, setting 
off that mission-wrecking chain of events. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigative board was being established to find out what  
went wrong.

	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Asked the inevitable question --  
``Are you excited?'' -- some of the Academy Award nominees were 
cool, proud, even nonchalant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to start a movie in three days and I'm more worried  
about that,'' Billy Bob Thornton told reporters Monday at an Oscars 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Nominated for best supporting actor in ``A Simple Plan,''  
Thornton added: ``It is exciting. I've been around 20 years and I 
feel real good about being nominated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Cate Blanchett, nominated for best actress  
``Elizabeth,'' said she was ``enormously excited'' and joked that 
``per capita, Australia has the highest number of nominations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rachel Griffiths, a best supporting actress nominee for ``Hilary  
and Jackie,'' quipped in her response: ``No, I'm used to it. I'm 
just waiting for lunch.'' She said later that her nomination was 
``fantastic.'' 
</P>

	SOTO CANO AIR BASE, Honduras (AP) -- President Clinton today  
saluted a new Central America and a new relief role for U.S. troops 
here, hoping to shut the door forever on the dark side of U.S. 
military involvement in the region. ``You have shown the people of 
Central America the true colors of our men and women in uniform,'' 
Clinton told several hundred U.S. personnel who live and work 
alongside Honduran soldiers to rebuild from October's Hurricane 
Mitch. Honduran President Carlos Flores said Clinton's four-day, 
four-nation tour of Central America was part of ``the overriding 
historical concern of what will be the legacy of your

Iraqi challenges should cease. ``We do not wish to see Iraq being 
bombed daily,'' Sheik Hamad bin Jassim Al-Thani, Qatar's foreign 
minister, said with Cohen at his side. ``The way for the attacks to 
stop is for Saddam to simply stop trying to violate the no-fly

<HEADLINE> Study: Scary Films Stay With You </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- If ``Jaws'' scared you out of the water or  
``Psycho'' changed your shower habits, a study suggests you 
probably aren't alone. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey of 150 students at the Universities of Michigan and  
Wisconsin found that one in four had some lingering ``fright'' 
effect from a movie or TV show they saw as a child or a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people who saw the thriller about a man-eating shark never  
went into the ocean again, said Kristen Harrison, a University of 
Michigan communications professor who co-wrote the study. 
</P>
<P>
	And ``Psycho?''  
</P>
<P>
	``There are people who shower with the door open, even though  
they're quite sure there isn't a killer in the house,'' Harrison 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety percent said they were scared by a TV or movie from their  
childhood or adolescence; 26 percent said they still experience 
``residual anxiety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The younger children were when they were frightened, the longer  
the reaction lasted. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranny Levy, president of the Coalition for Quality Children's  
Media in Santa Fe, N.M., said her own 27-year-old son was 
frightened of taking a swim in the sea a few years ago and blames 
it on seeing ``Jaws'' as a boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had to force himself. He really identified it with watching  
`Jaws' when he was little,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>  Brand Unanimous All-America Choice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	All but one of the players on the Associated Press preseason  
All-America team were on the postseason version as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The only one who wasn't was Jason Terry, and on Monday he became  
Arizona's fourth All-America in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day during the offseason I would walk by the basketball  
office and see the photos on the wall of all the guys who have been 
All-Americans here and tried to picture myself up there,'' he said. 
``Now, to think that I will have a photo up there, makes me realize 
what an accomplishment this is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terry joined Sean Elliott (1988 and 1989), Damon Stoudamire  
(1995), Mike Bibby (1998) and Miles Simon (1998) on the wall 
outside coach Lute Olson's office. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined Elton Brand of Duke, Andre Miller of Utah, Richard  
Hamilton of Connecticut and Mateen Cleaves of Michigan State on the 
1998-99 AP All-America team. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, a 6-foot-8 sophomore center who missed almost half of  
last season with a broken foot, was the only unanimous selection. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, who averaged 17.8 points and 9.8 rebounds for the  
top-ranked Blue Devils, was named on all 72 first-team ballots by 
the national media panel to become the fourth unanimous selection 
of the '90s. The others were Christian Laettner of Duke in 1992, 
Glenn Robinson of Purdue in 1994 and Tim Duncan of Wake Forest in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unbelievable. I'm just elated right now. Just to have  
been considered for a position of first-team All-America is a 
special, special honor,'' said Brand, who shot 62 percent from the 
field. ``I knew I worked hard, and the hard work paid off. Growing 
up, it's one of the things you definitely dream of. I'm definitely 
a team person and the individual accolades come when the team 
wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand was an honorable mention All-America last season despite  
missing 15 games with the injury, but he showed he was healed this 
summer when he led the U.S. team in the Goodwill Games in scoring 
and rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, a senior guard was the second-leading vote-getter in the  
5-3-1 process, getting 330 points with 60 first-team votes. The 
Western Athletic Conference player of the year averaged 15.9 
points, 5.5 rebounds, 5.7 assists and 2.5 steals, and the 6-2 guard 
was given more credit for his team leadership than statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real honor. I can't take the credit myself because we  
have a great team and they deserve the award also,'' said Miller, 
an honorable mention last season when the Utes reached the Final 
Four. ``It makes being a leader easy when you have a team like we 
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, who won or shared Big East player of the year honors  
the last two seasons, averaged 21.0 points and 4.8 rebounds this 
season for the Huskies who were ranked No. 1 for 10 weeks. The 6-6 
junior swingman, the leading vote-getter on the second team last 
season, had 48 first-team votes and 300 points this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's worked hard at expanding his total game, and has become  
one of the top collegiate players in the nation,'' Connecticut 
coach Jim Calhoun said. ``Last year, he just missed being a 
first-team selection and this year has rightfully earned his spot 
among the top five players in college basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terry, the Pac-10 player of the year, led the league in scoring  
(22.1), assists (5.6) and steals (2.7) -- the first player to do 
that since Gary Payton of Oregon State in 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no one more deserving for this honor because of what  
he has had to go through, in that he has had to provide leadership 
to the three freshmen in our starting lineup,'' Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry, a 6-2 senior, got 48 first-team votes and 293 points, 83  
more than Cleaves, who was on 19 first-team ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves, a 6-2 junior, was a second-team choice last season and  
was named Big Ten player of the year by the league's coaches for 
the second straight year. He averaged 11.8 points and 7.2 assists 
as the Spartans won their second straight Big Ten regular-season 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to give a lot of credit to my teammates,'' he said.  
``If we wouldn't have won a championship, I wouldn't have earned 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second team was senior center Evan Eschmeyer of  
Northwestern, who had one point less than Cleaves, Chris Porter of 
Auburn, Wally Szczerbiak of Miami of Ohio, Steve Francis of 
Maryland and Trajan Langdon of Duke, a third-team choice last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The third team was Tim James of Miami, Baron Davis of UCLA,  
Scoonie Penn of Ohio State, Quincy Lewis of Minnesota and Ron 
Artest of St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Nailon of Texas Christian, an honorable mention selection  
this season, was the fifth member of the preseason team.

<HEADLINE> Magazine To Pay Hoffman Legal Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A magazine that published a picture of Dustin  
Hoffman's head on the body of a cross-dressing man has been ordered 
to pay $270,000 of the actor's legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure announced Monday was less than the $415,000 Hoffman's  
attorneys had sought from Los Angeles Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The judge cut their attorneys' fees back significantly and we  
were pleased about that,'' said Julie Hoover, a spokeswoman ABC 
Inc., the magazine's parent company. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian ordered the  
magazine to pay Hoffman $3 million in damages. ABC plans to appeal 
that judgment, Ms. Hoover said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman, 61, sued over the March 1997 fashion layout in which  
his face, as it appeared in the 1982 cross-dressing comedy 
``Tootsie,'' was computer-grafted onto the body of a male model 
wearing a yellow evening gown and heels. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman sued for violation of publicity rights, claiming that  
the magazine's publisher, Fairchild Publications Inc., and its 
parent turned him into an unpaid fashion model.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Will Fix Privacy Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reacting to privacy concerns over a flaw in  
Windows, Microsoft Corp. is promising to offer software to strip 
out an identifying number that could be used to trace the 
authorship of some electronic documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Sinofsky, a vice president for Microsoft's Office  
products, said late Monday the company also almost certainly will 
offer a patch for the tens of millions of customers who use its 
popular collection of Office 97 business programs, which include 
Word and Excel. 
</P>
<P>
	That software fix, to be administered by customers themselves,  
would prevent the identifier number from being quietly embedded 
within electronic documents in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take these things very seriously,'' Sinofsky said.  
</P>
<P>
	The company previously promised only to allow customers to  
remove the serial number from their computers, not from individual 
documents, such as business letters and spreadsheets. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft confirmed over the weekend that its latest version of  
Windows generates a unique serial number for each computer that is 
partly planted within some documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the company also acknowledged it may have been  
harvesting those serial numbers from customers -- along with their 
names and addresses -- even when customers had explicitly indicated 
they didn't want the numbers disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy groups complained that the list of serial numbers,  
together with names and addresses, could be used to trace 
electronic documents to a specific computer even when an author 
wished to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard M. Smith of Brookline, Mass., the software programmer  
who first noticed the numbers hidden within his Microsoft files, 
compared the situation to a person's Social Security number being 
stamped on every document he creates. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said Monday that Microsoft was acting appropriately.  
</P>
<P>
	``For the document problem, that's what they need to do,'' Smith  
said. ``There are a lot of documents that already have the stuff in 
it. You don't want to be storing those (numbers) in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those numbers are part of a 32-digit identifier created by  
Windows 98 whenever customers register their software with 
Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said late Monday it still was investigating whether  
it might be inadvertently collecting the numbers during the 
electronic registration process for Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft announced Monday on its Web site that it will  
change the procedure ``to not send the hardware ID, unless the user 
checks the option to send hardware information to Microsoft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It acknowledged ``there are hypothetical scenarios in which this  
number could be used to learn something about the user's system 
without his or her knowledge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The number appears in a log of information transmitted to  
Microsoft, even when customers say they don't want details about 
their computers sent to the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy was aggravated by the prominence of Microsoft's  
products: Its bundle of affected business programs is used by 
nearly 90 percent of consumers of such programs, and its dominant 
Windows operating systems run most of the world's personal 
computers.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The federal government is stepping up scrutiny  
into how major pharmaceutical companies fight off generic 
competitors from producing cheaper copies of their top selling 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	But industry analysts expect little to come of the investigation  
because they believe the companies, such as Eli Lilly and Dupont, 
are acting within their rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``The companies are all doing the normal practices that they  
have to do to protect their franchises,'' said Hemant Shah, a drug 
analyst with HKS &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, shares of several drug companies being targeted by the  
Federal Trade Commission fell on Tuesday after the agency's widened 
inquiry became public. They include Eli Lilly, which fell $1.81 1/4 to 
$95.50 and Dupont, down 31 1/4 cents to $53.44. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission is looking at deals drug companies  
have with potential rivals and other activities undertaken to 
protect their patents. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, for example, Eli Lilly formed an agreement to buy a  
modified form of Prozac from Sepracor, a company that specializes 
in removing dangerous side effects from established drugs and 
licensing the rights back to the manufacturer. The FTC is 
requesting more information on that deal, Eli Lilli officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is valuable to Lilly because Prozac, which had nearly  
$3 billion in worldwide sales in 1998, is expected to lose patent 
protection in the next two years. While Sepracor isn't a generic 
drug maker, it illustrates Lilly's desire to hold onto the rights 
to desirable second-generation drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Lilly-Sepracor deal is an exclusive arrangement it  
eliminates a potential rival in a class of drugs dominated by 
Prozac. 
</P>
<P>
	A second generation Prozac drug made by Lilly would likely  
hamper potential sales of a generic competitor to the existing 
Prozac drug because the newer form would have fewer side effects, 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Sepracor shares fell $7 Tuesday to $131.93 3/4.  
</P>
<P>
	Regulatory concerns have been fueled as drug prices continue to  
increase at more than twice the overall inflation rate. The higher 
prices combined with the rising demand for new drugs has placed a 
difficult burden on private and public health insurance programs. 
``We think this is positive that the FTC is looking into this, and 
at least calling into question the parameters of these deals,'' 
said Carole Cox, a spokeswoman for generic drugmaker Barr 
Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	An FTC spokeswoman said the agency does not comment on  
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr is suing Lilly for blocking its ability to make a generic  
form of Prozac. Barr is also suing Dupont, which has cracked down 
on Barr's efforts to sell its generic form of the blood thinner 
Coumadin. Dupont asserts that Barr's generic copy is not equivalent 
to Coumadin. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox said the FTC contacted the company last month about Prozac  
and Coumadin issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Some companies, such as Abbott Laboratories, have paid potential  
generic rivals not to produce a generic drug until they resolve 
their litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst David Saks of Gruntal &AMP; Co. said that may appear  
anti-consumer, but such deals help both firms, and ensure a generic 
version eventually does come to market. Without such an agreement, 
major pharmaceutical companies could keep small generic firms in 
court for years before resolving patent disputes, he said.

<HEADLINE> Merck's Drug Study Boosts Rival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merck, the world's largest drug company, has  
unveiled a new study that shows rival Warner-Lambert makes a 
slightly better cholesterol-reducing drug. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study involving 842 patients in 19 counties,  
Warner-Lambert's Lipitor cholesterol drug reduced LDL or ``bad'' 
cholesterol levels by 45 percent to 51 percent compared to Merck's 
Zocor, which cut levels 43 percent to 49 percent. The study's chief 
investigator called the differences small, yet statistically 
significant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very pleased with the findings,'' said Warner-Lambert  
spokeswoman Christy Davis, ``It confirms that we provide superior 
LDL reduction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were disclosed this week at the American College of  
Cardiology meeting in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Zocor and Lipitor are the leading cholesterol-lowering drugs on  
the market. Before Lipitor was introduced in early 1997, Merck 
dominated the cholesterol drug market and it still has annual sales 
of almost $4 billion worldwide. But Lipitor quickly became the best 
seller in the United States after Warner-Lambert showed doctors it 
had a more potent medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Zocor sales still top the $2.2 billion in Lipitor receipts  
because Zocor is available in more countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Lipitor controls about 44 percent of the U.S. market for  
cholesterol drugs compared to 25 percent for Zocor, according to 
IMS Health, a market data firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the best Merck can hope for is to stem its loss of  
market share. Merck thought pitting a higher dosage of its Zocor 
drug against Lipitor in a head-to-head study would have helped. But 
that's unlikely now, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a pro-Lipitor study, that's why the stock is up  
today,'' said David Saks, an analyst with Gruntal &AMP; Co. 
Warner-Lambert rose $1.75 to $72.25 a share, while Merck shares 
rose 18 3/4 cents to $83.12 1/2 in New York Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck officials acknowledged that Warner-Lambert's Lipitor had  
an edge in reducing bad cholesterol levels, but said its drug did 
better at increasing HDL or ``good cholesterol levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For more than a decade, doctors have considered LDL or bad  
cholesterol an indicator of poor health because it becomes 
deposited in blood vessels and boosts the risk of heart attacks and 
strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two years, some studies showed that increasing HDL  
levels is desirable because it picks up fat and carries it out of 
the body, reducing heart attack risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, health experts say reducing bad or LDL cholesterol levels  
remains the main event in the cholesterol wars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lowering LDL is still the primary goal,'' said Dr. Sidney  
Smith, chief of cardiology at the University of North Carolina 
Medical Center and past president of the American Heart 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John Crouse, a Wake Forest University researcher and lead  
author of the Merck study, said his investigation shows Lipitor 
only has an advantage over Zocor in a small percentage of patients 
with astronomically high cholesterol levels. Crouse refused to say 
the Merck-funded study actually helped Zocor. Rather, he said the 
study merely proved the two drugs act differently, particularly in 
Zocor raising good cholesterol levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Further, he stressed that both drugs are effective at cutting  
cholesterol levels and doctors should have confidence in both. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, of the heart association, agreed. ``The major clinical  
problem right now is making sure patients get either medication, 
rather than trying to discriminate between the two.''

<HEADLINE> Heinz Earnings Fall 36 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Food maker H.J. Heinz Co.'s earnings fell 36  
percent in the latest quarter, dragged down by the costs of 
combining two divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months ended Jan. 28, Heinz had $120.6 million in  
net profits, down from $188.2 million in the same period last year. 
Per-share earnings were 33 cents, down from 51 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also cited the ``disappointing performance'' of the  
9-Lives four-pack of pet food, but said losses there were offset by 
gains in the Weight Watchers classroom business. Heinz does not 
publicize sales in its divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were $2.28 billion, up from $2.24 billion in the same  
period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The news sent the company's stock down $1.12 1/2, or 2 percent, to  
$50.87 1/2 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Heinz spent $147 million on restructuring in the quarter -- the  
equivalent of 27 cents per share. The company combined its Ore-Ida 
and Weight Watchers Gourmet Food businesses and reduced its 
workforce by 400 people through layoffs and attrition.

<HEADLINE>  DiMaggio Funeral Set for Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio's family wants his funeral to be as private as the  
man. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about 30 relatives and close friends will attend the  
service Thursday at Sts. Peter and Paul Church, where DiMaggio 
married his first wife, Dorothy Arnold, in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe insisted that his funeral be a private, religious service,  
and his family is intent on carrying out his wishes,'' said Morris 
Engelberg, DiMaggio's friend and attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``George Steinbrenner asked to come. So did Reggie Jackson and a  
lot of other people he knew and liked, but the family had to say 
`no,''' Engelberg told The Associated Press from San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The church's twin steeples tower over the North Beach section of  
San Francisco where DiMaggio spent most of his childhood. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral procession will drive into Beach Street in San  
Francisco's Marina section where the DiMaggio family lived as it 
makes its way to the Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, where DiMaggio 
will be buried. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's only son, Joe Jr., will be one of the pallbearers.  
The two had been estranged and had not seen each other in two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Other pallbearers will be Roger Stein and James Hamra, the  
husbands of DiMaggio's two granddaughters; Joseph DiMaggio, son of 
ballplayer's late brother, Mike; Joe Nacchio, a friend of 
DiMaggio's for 59 years, and Engelberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be memorial services in other parts of the  
country,'' Engelberg said. ``Steinbrenner said there would be one 
at Yankee Stadium in the Memorial Park there. And, there are plans 
to erect a monument next to the one for Babe Ruth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's body was flown from Miami to San Francisco late  
Monday on private jet. The Hall of Famer died Monday at age 84 at 
his home in Hollywood, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio divorced Arnold in 1943. DiMaggio wed Marilyn Monroe in  
1954 and they divorced later that year.

<HEADLINE> EU Farm Ministers Continue Talking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union farm ministers on  
Tuesday tried to pick up the pieces from a divisive week of talks, 
hoping to finish agricultural reform negotiations before a March 24 
summit of EU government leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, which holds the EU presidency, and the EU's executive  
Commission worked into the night on a new proposal on cutting 
guaranteed prices paid to farmers for cereals, beef and milk after 
last week's plan from Germany was rejected out of hand as 
insufficient by the Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Outraging farmers and France, which is the EU's biggest farm  
producer, the Commission had called for cuts in guaranteed prices 
of 30 percent in beef, 20 percent in cereal and 15 percent in milk. 
Germany countered with proposals of 20 percent in beef, 10 percent 
in cereals and none in milk. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the Commission, this was no basis for discussion,'' said  
Gerry Kiely, spokesman for EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler. 
</P>
<P>
	The new proposal is expected to be put to the 15 EU farm  
ministers early Wednesday, opening a new session of hard bargaining 
to reform the sector and cut generous support. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU's 8 million farmers want to hold on to their subsidies  
and have pushed their demands through often rowdy demonstrations. 
More than 30,000 farmers demonstrated near EU headquarters when 
farm ministers met last month. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, French farmers pulled out their tractors and slowed  
down traffic on provincial highways to show their discontent. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastward expansion puts most pressure on the EU to cut farm  
subsidies. Adding such countries as Poland, with its huge, outdated 
farm structure, would break the back of the EU budget if no reforms 
are instituted. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, world trade negotiations due to kick off at the end of the  
year will have farm liberalization measures high on the agenda.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Exec Gets Signing Bonus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing's new chief financial officer received a  
$750,000 signing bonus when she joined the aerospace company in 
mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Hopkins, formerly vice president of finance and chief  
financial officer for General Motors Europe, will receive a base 
salary of $450,000 and is guaranteed a bonus of $360,000 this year, 
according to a new Boeing filing with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock and options based on performance could add to Hopkins'  
income if Boeing's stock price improves. She also received typical 
executive perks, including a company car; relocation assistance; 
life, medical and dental insurance; financial planning and 
counseling services; and job placement assistance for her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	The filing also revealed more details about the company's  
severance agreement with Ron Woodard, former chief of Boeing 
Commercial Airline Group, who was asked to resign in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodard received $1.35 million, including a lump sum of $900,000  
for signing a departure agreement on Oct. 31 that also provides him 
with a guaranteed retainer of $19,000 a month as a consultant to 
Boeing through November 2000 if he is not otherwise employed 
full-time. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also included medical and dental coverage for  
Woodard and his dependents through this year, and he was allowed to 
either keep his company car or receive its market value in cash. He 
also received more than $43,000 for taxes on recently exercised 
stock options, and will receive financial counseling and other 
services through this year.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Expands Presence in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                       *Asociated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	SHENZHEN, China (AP) -- Microsoft Corp., eyeing a restricted but  
rapidly growing computer market in mainland China, said Wednesday 
it will start offering systems to let the Chinese download movies, 
music, e-mail and other services. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will really open up Internet usage in a dramatic way,''  
Microsoft boss Bill Gates said at a signing ceremony in this 
booming southern border city not far from Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft is banking on manufacturers to install the necessary  
hardware in their of televisions, video equipment and computers 
that are distributed across China. The end-users of services 
provided by the so-called ``Venus'' project will get connected to 
the Internet in a partnership between Microsoft and China Telecom. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates issued a statement lauding `the benefits this new,  
specialized system can bring to the Chinese customer,'' although 
Microsoft stayed vague about many of the details. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates held a press conference in Shenzhen where he told local  
reporters that Internet growth in China was encouraging. Otherwise, 
he kept his distance from the Western media, both in Shenzhen and a 
day earlier in Hong Kong, where Microsoft announced a similar deal 
with Hongkong Telecom. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign journalists were kept cordoned off at Wednesday's press  
conference, preventing them from questioning Gates. On Tuesday in 
Hong Kong, he refused to answer any questions directly from 
reporters, choosing instead to field only written questions that 
had been screened by his public relations advisers. 

</P>
<P>
	It is unclear how broad Microsoft's reach can be in a huge  
nation where the Internet has posed touchy policy questions for 
authorities who are at once encouraging its growth while also 
trying to keep tight controls on information. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite various controls and threats to information  
dissemination in China, Internet use has soared. Users topped 2.1 
million in 1998, a fourfold growth in a year, and another 1.5 
million accounts are expected to be opened this year. 
</P>
<P>
	High-tech analysts believe the growth is unstoppable.  
</P>
<P>
	A public relations adviser for Microsoft, Jenny Liu, would not  
say how many customers Microsoft is hoping to get in China. Nor 
would Microsoft discuss how much money it is investing in deals it 
was signing Wednesday with seven companies on the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's venture is the second of its kind in China for the  
U.S. software giant. 
</P>
<P>
	The first such Microsoft project was launched late last year in  
Shanghai but offers its services only through small, handheld 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Piracy of software and other Western high-tech items is a  
perennial problem in China, but Microsoft said Wednesday that in 
its latest dealings it has signed an anti-piracy agreement with 
Shenzhen, a booming southern border city not far from Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft will provide software for the Shenzhen government so  
it can go online. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal comes at a time when the Chinese government has been  
seeking to control the Internet and other innovative forms of 
telecommunications and multimedia services both for the sake of 
profit and to block the use of such services for political dissent.

<HEADLINE> Counsell, Castillo Fight for Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Fla. (AP) -- As Craig Counsell nursed his fractured  
jaw last year, he received a flood of fan mail from around the 
country. Children sent drawings and senior citizens offered 
prayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It meant a lot to me,'' said Counsell, a World Series hero in  
1997. ``It makes you feel special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Counsell now knows fans are rooting for him, which is comforting  
as he wages a spring-training duel with Luis Castillo for the 
Florida Marlins' second base job. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins, however, are secretly rooting for Castillo.  
</P>
<P>
	Not that they wish Counsell ill. Everyone admires his comeback  
from the awful jaw injury, suffered when he took a fastball in the 
face last August. 
</P>
<P>
	And he's one of only four players remaining from Florida's World  
Series team. Counsell's place in franchise history is secure for 
scoring the winning run in Game 7 against the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Counsell is a sentimental favorite, he can't match  
Castillo when it comes to speed, defense and potential. 
</P>
<P>
	If Castillo, 23, shows this month that he can get to first base,  
he'll be at second base on opening day. He's a wizard with a glove, 
and his speed -- 193 steals in the minors -- would give the Marlins a 
weapon in the leadoff spot that they'll otherwise lack. 
</P>
<P>
	``Counsell has a workmanlike approach, stability and  
consistency,'' manager John Boles said. ``Castillo has the tools -- 
the speed, the arm strength, the range. What he has to do is do it 
offensively. He's got to get on base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castillo split the past three seasons between the minors and the  
Marlins, and this could be his final chance. In 160 games for 
Florida -- the equivalent of one full season -- the switch-hitting 
Dominican has batted .236 with just 18 extra-base hits, 26 RBIs and 
132 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The job is out there,'' he said. ``Whoever plays best is going  
to win the position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both players are off to a slow start in spring training.  
Counsell began 0-for-5 and Castillo 0-for-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Castillo was the opening-day second baseman two years ago for  
the team that went on to win the World Series. But he hit just 
.240, and Counsell became the rookie starter in late July when the 
Marlins acquired him from Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Counsell batted .299 that year, then slipped to .251 last  
season. Now, at age 28, he finds himself battling to stay in the 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be that way every year for me because of the  
kind of player I am,'' he said. ``I'm not going to steal a lot of 
bases or hit a lot of home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mind. I feel like I'm the second baseman. I don't see  
anything changing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Counsell showed last year how badly he wanted to stay in the  
lineup when he staggered toward first base, spitting blood, 
reluctant to leave after being hit in the jaw by a pitch from 
Houston's C.J. Nitkowski. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury required surgery, and Counsell lost 20 pounds because  
his jaw was wired shut for six weeks. The mail, meanwhile, provided 
food for thought. 
</P>
<P>
	``The feeling I got from that was better than the feeling I got  
winning the World Series,'' Counsell said. ``It means a lot when 
that many people take time out of their day to put you in their 
thoughts and prayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is perhaps the Marlins' most popular player, and the ovation  
for Counsell on opening day will be long and loud -- especially if 
he's in the lineup.

<HEADLINE> Blair Happy in Tigers' Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) -- It has been quite an odyssey for Willie  
Blair, one he was reluctant to make. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in a Detroit uniform after a year in the National League,  
Blair looked tired but content after pitching three innings against 
Tampa Bay in his first spring start Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays won the game 8-5 and Blair was the loser, but  
that didn't tell the whole story. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been tough,'' Blair said. ``I never wanted to leave here.  
But I felt it was probably the only time in my career I was going 
to sign a big contract and set up my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blair had the best year of his career for Detroit in 1997,  
coming back from a frightening injury to go 16-8. After the season, 
the expansion Arizona Diamondbacks offered him $11 million for 
three years. That was a whole lot more than the Tigers wanted to 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair went to Arizona, struggled and was traded to the New York  
Mets. The Tigers got him back in a trade for Joe Randa last 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a guy who has been making big money, $11 million isn't  
much money,'' Blair said. ``But it's a lot to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He admits he's happy to be back.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like this team could be very good,'' Blair said.  
``We're not an elite team like the Yankees or Indians. But we can 
play with those teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Sorrento's first hit of the spring was a two-run homer off  
Blair that gave Tampa Bay a lead it never lost.

	``This time the race is wide open,'' he said in a draft of his  
address. ``There is no one whose 'turn' it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without mentioning Bush by name, Alexander clearly questioned  
the Texas governor's qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new president should be someone who wants it, someone who  
is well prepared for the job and someone who knows from the first 
day that he or she is in office exactly what they will do,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Promising better schools, higher family incomes and a stronger  
military, Alexander said, ``I am here this morning to declare that 
I will be a candidate for president of the United States. I am 
ready to help our country face the challenges of a new century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He denounced Clinton ``and his faithful assistant,'' Vice  
President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have given us what their polls tell them -- but that is  
not leadership,'' he said. The booming economy is nothing but a 
``magic show,'' disguising with political sleight of hand America's 
failing schools, bigger bureaucracies, weakening national defense 
and deepening racial polarization. 
</P>
<P>
	And worst of all: ``Our standards of right and wrong have sunk  
to a new low,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A new American Century will require a moral foundation laid by  
a president who respects the office and the people who put him in 
office; a president who knows what it took to make this nation 
great and what it will take to keep it that way,'' Alexander said, 
without mentioning the Monica Lewinsky scandal or other Clinton 
controversies. 
</P>
<P>
	He delivered the speech beneath the vaunted ceilings of the  
state Capitol's old Supreme Court room, reminding Tennesseans that 
he took over as governor in 1978 from a scandal-ridden 
administration. The message was clear: It's time for him to step 
into the breach of another controversial administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander's climb in 2000 promises to be at least as steep as  
four years ago, when he and his trademark checkered shirts finished 
third in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary before 
petering out. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the main establishment-candidate challenger to eventual  
nominee Bob Dole in 1996, and came within a few thousand votes of 
knocking the front-runner out in New Hampshire. But this time the 
field is more crowded, with Dole's wife and the son of former 
President Bush joining Vietnam War hero Sen. John McCain of Arizona 
in competition for the same voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elizabeth Dole and John McCain will also be there to pick up  
the pieces if and when Bush fails,'' said GOP strategist Greg 
Mueller, an ally of another GOP rival, millionaire businessman 
Steve Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said Monday he will decide next week whether to run,  
though he is widely expected to join the fray. His formal 
announcement is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander is the third GOP candidate to formally announce,  
following Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire and conservative 
commentator Pat Buchanan. The GOP field could hit double digits. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley are the only announced  
Democratic Party candidates, though civil rights activist Jesse 
Jackson is seriously considering the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the governor of Texas, received waves of publicity this  
week simply for forming a presidential exploratory committee. Dole, 
former president of the American Red Cross, will get similar 
treatment Wednesday when she takes the same baby step. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander chafes at the attention given his rivals, arguing that  
nobody is a front-runner a year before the primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Alexander shouldn't be counted out.  
</P>
<P>
	He plans to raise $15 million this year. He is the best  
organized candidate in Iowa, where former Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad 
is heading his operation, and has built a formidable New Hampshire 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	He has visited the early primary states dozens of times since  
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander also has a relatively defined agenda to improve  
schools, family incomes and the nation's security -- in contrast to 
Bush and Dole, who have avoided detailed discussions of most 
national issues so far. Bush on Monday said he would back a 
constitutional amendment to outlaw most abortions if more voters 
supported it. But he said, ``America is not ready to ban 
abortions.'' He called himself a ``pro-life person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who said he would make ``strong and practical  
proposals to bring out the best in America,'' has not gained 
traction in public opinion polls nor does he seem to inspire 
passion among activists. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't explain why he isn't catching on,'' said conservative  
organizer Grover Norquist of Washington. He said it may be that 
Alexander has never pushed his policies beyond the tried and true 
to prove his commitment to conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander's core policies have change little since 1996, with  
one exception: His attacks on Washington, a place he called an 
``arrogant empire'' in his 1996 announcement speech, are less 
pronounced this time. 
</P>
<P>
	He wants to send federal education money directly to the states  
and reduce bureaucratic meddling. 
</P>
<P>
	Inheritance and capital gains taxes should be cut, as well as  
the penalty for some married couples, he said. Alexander proposes 
to triple the tax deduction for each child to $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
	On national security, Alexander said he would push for a missile  
defense system and a new branch of the armed services to stem the 
flow of drugs from other countries.

<HEADLINE> Trial Begins in Racist Plot Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Prosecutors opened their case against  
two white supremacists charged with murder by calling a former 
associate who said one suspect likened Jews and blacks to insects 
and animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevie Kehoe, 26, of Colville, Wash., and Danny Lee, 26, of  
Yukon, Okla., are also charged with racketeering and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Kehoe and Lee are accused of using a campaign of violence to set  
up a whites-only nation in the Pacific Northwest and could get the 
death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	John Shults, a convict who says he has left the white supremacy  
movement, testified Monday that he joined Kehoe in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would make such comments as `The Jews are nothing but  
maggots. The Jews should be exterminated.' ... Black people were 
the beasts of the field, how they were meant to be lower than the 
white man, how we used them for caretaking,'' Shults said. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the mostly black jury were expressionless. Shults  
also said Kehoe spoke of executing judges to spark a revolt. 
</P>
<P>
	The crimes associated with the alleged plot include a 1996  
bombing at City Hall in Spokane, Wash.; shootouts with Ohio police; 
the slayings of two people in Idaho; and the drownings of a white 
Arkansas family of three. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Dan Stripling told jurors that Kehoe's beliefs  
were based on those of Robert Mathews, the founder of the Aryan 
Nations white supremacist group. Mathews was killed in 1984 when 
his hideout caught fire during a shootout with federal agents in 
Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor said Kehoe and Lee robbed the Arkansas family in  
1996 and killed them by taping plastic bags over their heads, 
weighing them down with rocks and throwing them into a bayou. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the defendants told Kehoe's parents that the family was  
on ``a liquid diet,'' Stripling said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge has issued a gag order in the case, but Lee's mother,  
Lea Graham, said her son is innocent and no racist.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Attack Hits Hitler Exhibit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAARBRUECKEN, Germany (AP) -- A bomb exploded early today outside  
a building housing a controversial traveling exhibit on the 
involvement of Hitler's army in war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured in the pre-dawn blast, which police said they  
suspect was detonated by right-wing extremists who have staged 
repeated protests over the exhibition -- claiming it is full of lies 
-- during its four-year tour. 
</P>
<P>
	About 400 right-wing extremists demonstrated against the  
exhibition when it opened Feb. 20 in Saarbruecken. About 1,000 
radical leftists staged a counter-demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	The show uses photos and documents to demonstrate the  
involvement of the Wehrmacht, Hitler's regular army, in 
extermination campaigns during the Nazi's drive through eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage was estimated at millions of dollars though the explosion  
will not affect plans to open the exhibit in Cologne on April 3, 
said organizers, who also plan to bring the exhibit to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Though today's blast was powerful enough to shatter windows on  
all four sides of the building, and reverberate through the 
southwestern German city, the exhibit itself was not seriously 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said they planned to reopen it next week provided  
there is no significant structural damage to the building, a school 
built in the 1950s that is under historic preservation as an 
example of period architecture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Otherwise they would have gotten their way,'' said Ingrid  
Schoell, director of the damaged school. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb was placed outside the building and apparently  
detonated electronically, police said. Patrols that had passed 10 
minutes before the 5 a.m. blast saw nothing out of the ordinary, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the state leader of the Christian Democrats called on  
the state governor, a Social Democrat, to discontinue sponsorship 
of the show, calling it one-sided. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Democrats and Greens called the criticism a cheap shot,  
saying the exhibit consciously concentrates on extermination 
campaigns by Hitler's army. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers say the exhibit has been seen by more than 700,000  
people, including 9,000 in Saarbruecken.

<HEADLINE> Padres Give Hoffman $32M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- Just a few weeks ago, Trevor Hoffman was  
worried that he might be traded. Now he's baseball's highest-paid 
reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Diego Padres closer agreed to a $32 million, four-year  
contract extension through 2003, the Associated Press learned. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which is the largest in club history, reversed an  
exodus of Padres stars since the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman's extension includes a $10 million club option for 2004  
which, if exercised, would make the deal worth $40 million over 
five years. The Padres can buy out the option year for $2 million. 
For the first time ever, the team has granted a no-trade clause. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, Hoffman, the premier closer in baseball last year  
with 53 saves in 54 chances, gets what he wanted -- an $8 million 
average annual salary. His last two deals have been at the 
so-called San Diego discount, and Hoffman, who wanted to remain 
with the Padres, made it clear that a new deal would be on his 
terms. He set a deadline of opening day for completing an 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres now have the two relievers with the highest average  
annual salaries in baseball. Randy Myers is owed $6 million this 
year in the middle year of an $18 million, three-year deal he 
signed in November 1997 with Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Acquired Aug. 6, Myers was ineffective and has been on the  
trading block, but the Padres would have to eat some of his salary 
in any potential deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman, 31, will be paid $4.1 million in 1999, the final year  
of an $8.4 million, three-year extension he signed in August 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest previous deal in Padres history was the $15.5  
million, three-year contract given to left-hander Sterling 
Hitchcock, the MVP of the NL championship series, on Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Kevin Towers, who attended the Padres' game  
against San Francisco at Scottsdale on Monday, wouldn't confirm or 
deny the deal. A source familiar with the deal, speaking on the 
condition he not be identified, said San Diego planned to announce 
it today. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman was not at Monday afternoon's game, but said earlier in  
the day that talks were ``moving in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few days ago, Hoffman wondered whether a deal would get  
done. But talks proceeded at a remarkable clip after Hoffman met 
this weekend with owner John Moores and club president Larry 
Lucchino, who were in town for the club's board of directors 
meeting on Saturday. Hoffman summoned his agent from Florida, and 
negotiations went late into Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really, it's been a lot of KT's (Towers') input in regard to  
getting stuff started,'' Hoffman said. ``I don't know if they want 
to wait until the end of spring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman's .981 save percentage last year was the best in major  
league history and his 53 saves tied the NL record. He made the 
All-Star team for the first time and was runner-up to Atlanta's Tom 
Glavine in the NL Cy Young balloting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres were 62-4 in games in which Hoffman pitched. His only  
blown save came on July 26, when he allowed Moises Alou's 
first-pitch homer in the ninth. That came one day after he matched 
Rod Beck's big league record with 41 straight saves, a mark later 
surpassed by Boston's Tom Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	Retaining the popular reliever is certain to be a hit with the  
fans, who saw Kevin Brown, Steve Finley and Ken Caminiti leave as 
free agents, and Greg Vaughn and Joey Hamilton depart via trades. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres traded Vaughn in part because of his potential free  
agent status, and Hoffman feared he might be traded for the same 
reason. Now he becomes the first player locked up through 2002, 
when the club is scheduled to move into a new downtown ballpark 
that was overwhelmingly approved by voters two weeks after the 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with all the offseason moves, the Padres project a player  
payroll of about $48 million, a $3 million increase from the figure 
they opened 1998 at.

<HEADLINE> Ewing Has Sore Achilles Tendon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Patrick Ewing took himself out of the New York  
Knicks' game Tuesday night against the Milwaukee Bucks when his 
sore Achilles tendon flared up just 29 seconds into the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	A Knicks spokesman said he would not return to the game.  
</P>
<P>
	Ewing, who missed 56 games and the first round of the playoffs  
last season with a broken wrist, has been bothered by tendinitis in 
the left Achilles tendon for several days. He missed practice 
Monday and did not participate in the team's shootaround Tuesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13-year veteran and 11-time All-Star has been the Knicks'  
leading scorer and rebounder this season, averaging 17.9 points and 
10.1 boards. He averaged 28.3 points in New York's last three 
games, although he missed buzzer-beating shots that would have won 
two of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing also has been a defensive force, averaging 3.47 blocks,  
third in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Dudley replaced Ewing in the lineup and made his first  
shot 30 seconds later on a hook shot from the lane. They were 
Dudley's first points in 11 games.

<HEADLINE> Scientist Fired in China Nuke Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under Republican attack over security at  
federal weapons labs, the Clinton administration has directed the 
firing of a Chinese-American computer scientist who has been the 
subject of a three-year espionage investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientist was dismissed Monday from his job at the Los  
Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico because of alleged 
security violations. He has not been arrested, nor charged with a 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	But the scientist has been the focus of intense scrutiny by the  
FBI for nearly three years after intelligence agents learned that 
China apparently had obtained top-secret design information in the 
1980s about nuclear warhead technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Although not identified by the Energy Department, The Associated  
Press learned the scientist's identity to be Wen Ho Lee, a native 
of Taiwan who has worked at Los Alamos for a dozen years or more 
with top security clearance. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no answer Monday night at a phone listing in Los  
Alamos for a Wen Ho Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	The espionage investigation gained heightened attention in  
recent days after news reports that China was suspected by U.S. 
intelligence officials of having made a major leap forward in 
nuclear missile technology in the early 1990s, in part because of 
information gotten from secrets allegedly stolen from Los Alamos. 
</P>
<P>
	China reiterated denials that it stole U.S. nuclear know-how.  
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said today in Beijing that 
such allegations demonstrate that ``some people'' want to hamper 
improvements in U.S-China ties and disrupt ``the normal export by 
the U.S. of some high-tech products to China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	News media and others have ``disseminated many rumors about  
China's stealing of U.S. technology,'' Zhu charged. ``All these are 
unfounded and with ulterior motives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican congressional leaders over the weekend promised  
hearings on why the Clinton administration was not more quickly off 
the mark in pursuing the espionage when it first surfaced in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., lashed out at the  
administration for lax security, especially involving Chinese 
attempts to get military secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	And Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said his Intelligence Committee  
planned hearings on the Los Alamos espionage investigation. ``We've 
been prodding the administration to do more to tighten up security 
... but they waited a long time,'' Shelby complained. 
</P>
<P>
	By Monday morning, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson was pledging  
to cooperate fully in any Senate hearing. He declared the 
administration would ``not tolerate the theft of our secrets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a briefing later in the day by the FBI, Richardson told  
managers at Los Alamos that the scientist should be fired. A letter 
of dismissal was sent within hours, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese-American scientist was fired for ``failing to  
properly safeguard classified material,'' having contact with 
people ``from a sensitive country'' and ``apparently attempting to 
deceive (the) laboratory about security-related issues,'' an Energy 
Department statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said the FBI investigation was continuing, but  
there was no word late Monday whether the government would seek an 
arrest or prosecute the case. The statement made no reference to 
any crimes, or any mention of espionage specifically involving 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	Although, Lee has been the leading target of the FBI probe for  
nearly three years, only in recent months was he shifted to a less 
sensitive job, and the government made no move to lift his security 
clearance until even more recently, officials acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	``DOE had kept the worker employed so that the FBI could more  
efficiently investigate the case,'' the brief department statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though his name had never been mentioned, Lee has been at the  
center of the FBI investigation since early 1996, according to 
published reports. The investigation was prompted by concerns among 
U.S. intelligence agents in 1995 that top-secret nuclear weapons 
design material was given to China in the mid-1980s that helped 
them build miniaturized warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	Such technology, developed at Los Alamos, allows production of  
small warheads that can be launched from a single missile at 
multiple targets -- a key component of a nuclear arsenal. By the 
mid-1990s, China had built and tested such warheads and U.S. 
officials were puzzled by the rapid technological leap. In 1995, 
U.S. intelligence officials uncovered a Chinese document, written 
in 1988, that indicated the Chinese knew design information about 
the U.S. W-88 miniature warhead. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. investigators immediately suspected that the Chinese were  
helped by information provided from someone at one of the U.S. 
weapons labs.

<HEADLINE> Action Delayed in Satellite Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Satellite TV customers losing CBS and Fox  
programs may have to wait a little longer for help from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	House Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas Bliley, R-Va., said  
Monday that that he wants to give the broadcasting and satellite 
industries time to resolve a dispute over how satellite TV 
customers can watch broadcast programs before acting on a pending 
satellite TV bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Bliley made his remarks at a conference here, sponsored by the  
National Association of Broadcasters, which doesn't like the bill, 
largely written by Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, unanimously passed by the committee's  
telecommunications subcommittee last week, would restore CBS and 
Fox programs for six months to about 700,000 customers. A federal 
court in Miami had ordered the cutoff, saying these customers 
aren't legally entitled to receive the networks' signals. 
</P>
<P>
	Bliley promised to give the parties enough time to resolve the  
dispute on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``In return, I ask that you and the satellite industry get back  
at the negotiating table to resolve this matter,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bliley wouldn't say when his committee would act on the bill if  
the industries -- which have been feuding for years on the matter -- 
fail to resolve the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Bliley didn't give the industries a deadline for coming to an  
agreement, but he indicated he wanted them to act quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	NAB lobbyist Jim May said broadcasters would ``redouble  
efforts'' to work with the satellite industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin supports giving the industries time to work things out  
and doesn't believe negotiations would hurt his bill, said 
spokesman Ken Johnson, calling the measure ``very much alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin's measure is likely to be part of a broader bill that  
would make it easier for satellite TV customers to receive 
broadcast network programs on their satellite systems as well as 
let them receive local broadcast signals, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bliley, who plans to meet with other key lawmakers later this  
week on the matter, said he would like the House to pass a broad 
satellite TV bill this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law allows satellite companies to provide ``distant''  
network signals from other broadcast areas to customers only if 
those customers can't receive their local stations using rooftop 
antennas. 
</P>
<P>
	But the satellite and broadcasting industries disagree over how  
to interpret an arcane legal test for determining when a satellite 
customer can't get a local signal. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Bliley called a proposal in President Clinton's  
budget to make commercial TV stations for the first time pay a fee 
on their existing analog TV channels ``a tax'' that isn't 
justified. 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds from the so-called lease fee, which would raise $200  
million annually, would help federal, state and local governments 
upgrade communications systems used by fire, police, emergency 
rescue and other public safety agencies.

<HEADLINE> Virus Puts Okla. Coach in Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson went from the  
hospital to practice and back to the hospital as he prepared his 
Sooners for their first-round game against No. 4 seed Arizona in 
the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampson suffered an asthma attack Saturday. The attack coupled  
with an upper respiratory virus had him spend Sunday and Monday 
nights at Norman Regional Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't keep him from his basketball duties.  
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he spent part of the day in the hospital,  
participating in the Big 12 coaches' call, returning calls to the 
media and watching video of the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he went to practice. He tried to make the practice as  
routine as possible. He came up 20 minutes short of lasting the 
entire practice, telling trainer Alex Brown it was time to get him 
back to the hospital to rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was on the floor coaching as close to normal as possible,''  
Brown said. ``When he felt like it was time that he needed to go 
and get more rest, we left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampson, who was still in the hospital today in good condition,  
played down the illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've said many times your greatest problems come disguised as  
your greatest opportunities. That's how I'm treating this with my 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll get through it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Sampson had a similar condition in the 1995-96 season where he  
shuffled between the hospital and practice.

<HEADLINE> Dummy Shots Can Be Powerful Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- An attempt to relieve chest pain with a  
genetically engineered drug offers a lesson in the power of 
positive thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	As hoped, researchers found that folks who got a medicine called  
VEGF can exercise longer without being stopped by angina. But it 
turns out that people who got dummy shots seem to improve even 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	``These early and preliminary results are not exactly what we  
hoped for,'' conceded Dr. Timothy Henry of Hennepin County Medical 
Center in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The development of VEGF -- vascular endothelial growth factor --  
was a high-profile project of Genentech Inc. The treatment is 
intended to stimulate the heart to sprout new blood vessels around 
clogged heart arteries, relieving pain. 
</P>
<P>
	If it worked, patients with untreatable chest pain would  
literally grow their own coronary bypasses. 
</P>
<P>
	At last year's meeting of the American College of Cardiology,  
Henry presented promising results. It appeared that injecting the 
protein directly into the heart's circulation significantly eased 
pain within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Genentech sponsored a larger study, also directed by Henry. This  
time, patients were randomly assigned to get either VEGF or dummy 
injections. Such comparison experiments are necessary to make sure 
that people are not simply imagining their improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors enrolled 178 patients; 56 got low doses of VEGF, 59  
got high doses and 63 received dummy placeboes. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Genentech issued a brief statement calling the  
results disappointing. Henry detailed them Tuesday at this year's 
cardiology conference. 
</P>
<P>
	It turned out that two months after their treatments, those who  
got low doses of VEGF could walk 26 seconds longer than before on a 
treadmill. Those who got high doses could walk 32 seconds longer. 
And the placebo patients? They could walk 43 seconds longer. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Henry said he has much more work to do and was not  
willing to call the treatment a failure. The placebo effect may 
wear off, while those getting VEGF may continue to get better. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry said researchers will know whether VEGF is effective after  
doctors complete four months of follow-up work and do scans to show 
any changes in blood flow to the patients' hearts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is a biological effect of the drug, but I can't  
prove that,'' said Henry. ``I am anxious to see what will happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite these results, efforts to trigger blood vessel growth --  
what doctors call angiogenesis -- remain a hot area of research. 
Several teams are experimenting with attempts to achieve the same 
thing using gene therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of squirting pure VEGF into the heart's arteries, they  
are injecting the gene that makes VEGF into the heart muscle. The 
protein alone disappears quickly, but the gene continues to make 
VEGF for a couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jeffrey Isner of St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Boston  
has treated 24 patients this way with the VEGF gene. Virtually all 
have improved, he said, and angina has disappeared completely in 
half the patients who have been followed for three months. 
</P>
<P>
	The patients also appear to have significantly better blood flow  
in their heart muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	Isner's study does not include a group getting dummy treatment.  
Giving the drug requires cutting open the chest to expose the 
heart, which Isner contends would be unethical simply to give 
people salt water.

<HEADLINE> Purdue Leads Final Women's Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Purdue Boilermakers have no history for where they find  
themselves now: heading into the NCAA women's basketball tournament 
as the nation's No. 1-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue led the final Associated Press women's basketball poll of  
the season on Monday, the first time it has finished at No. 1. 
Previously, the school's highest ranking at the end was fifth in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
	But whether they're first or 101st, the Boilermakers say it  
makes no difference at tournament time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all comes down to us preparing,'' senior guard Ukari Figgs  
said. ``We are really not concerned about the other teams right 
now. We are focused on having ourselves prepared for the 
tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue (28-1) is the No. 1 seed in the Midwest Regional. The  
other No. 1 seeds in the tournament followed the Boilermakers in 
the poll. Tennessee, seeking its fourth straight national 
championship, held the No. 2 spot, Louisiana Tech was third and 
Connecticut fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	At the bottom, No. 25 Toledo made the poll for the first time  
this season and just the third time overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue received 39 of 42 first-place votes and 1,047 points from  
a national media panel to hold the No. 1 spot for the third 
straight week. The Boilermakers defeated both Tennessee and 
Louisiana Tech this season and take a 26-game winning streak into 
NCAA play. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee (28-2), seeded No. 1 in the East, had two first-place  
votes and 1,009 points, while Louisiana Tech (26-2) had 967 points 
and the remaining first-place vote. Tech is the top seed in the 
West, with Connecticut (27-4) No. 1 in the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut jumped two spots in the poll after winning the Big  
East Conference tournament. Old Dominion remained at No. 5, and was 
followed by Texas Tech, Colorado State, Notre Dame and Rutgers. 
Clemson and Duke were tied for 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Tech, which beat Iowa State in the Big 12 tournament  
final, climbed three places. Colorado State dropped from fourth to 
seventh after losing to Southern Methodist in the Western Athletic 
Conference final. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia moved up two places to 12th and Virginia Tech was 13th.  
Then it was North Carolina, UCLA, Oregon and UC Santa Barbara, 
followed by Penn State, Iowa State and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	LSU, Alabama, Tulane, Florida International and Toledo held the  
final five spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo (25-5), the Mid-American Conference tournament champion,  
was given a No. 6 seed in the NCAA tournament and made the Top 25 
for the first time since the 1993-94 season. The Rockets were 
ranked for two weeks in February of that season. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of Toledo's losses were to Notre Dame, Rutgers and Boston  
College, all of whom made the NCAA field. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas, which lost to Iowa State in the Big 12 semifinals,  
dropped out. The Jayhawks (22-9) had been 25th. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen teams were ranked every week of the season. They were  
Purdue, Tennessee, Louisiana Tech, Connecticut, Notre Dame, Duke, 
Old Dominion, Rutgers, Georgia, UCLA, Texas Tech, North Carolina, 
Virginia, Iowa State and Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams from the preseason poll that didn't make the final Top 25  
were Kansas, Florida, George Washington, Arkansas, North Carolina 
State, Vanderbilt, Stanford, Illinois and Arizona. Kansas was the 
highest-ranked of those teams, starting out at No. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo became the 41st school to appear in the poll this season.  
The most in any season was 45 in 1991-92.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Town To Annex Black Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.C. (AP) -- Two weeks after the mayor inflamed racial  
tensions by saying blacks are unfit to govern themselves, the 
all-white town council agreed to annex three black neighborhoods -- 
the first annexations in Trenton's 215-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Black activists immediately announced they would drop a week-old  
boycott of the town's white-owned businesses after the three 
councilmen agreed Monday night to annex the areas and their roughly 
100 residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Trenton is a farming center of 200 people on North Carolina's  
coastal plain. The town is about one-fourth black. The annexations 
will make the town about half black, and activists hope that will 
lead to the election of the town's first black council member. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want to show people this board is not racially  
biased,'' Councilman Charles Jones said. ``Let's put this ugly 
thing behind us and all go back to living normal lives where we all 
speak to each other and are friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks had filed a federal lawsuit Jan. 12 alleging the town  
discriminated by refusing to annex the three areas, called Haiti, 
Monktown and Spicey-Quinn Lands. 
</P>
<P>
	But the issue didn't catch fire until two weeks ago, when  
Joffree Leggett, Trenton's white mayor of 16 years, told The 
Kinston Free Press that blacks don't belong in town government. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not leaders,'' he said. ``A black man would rather  
work for a white person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leggett, 81, resigned last week under pressure from the council.  
</P>
<P>
	Most residents of the three neighborhoods have signed a petition  
in favor of becoming part of the town. After the council's 
decision, many said the town never would have acted without 
pressure from the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
	``They weren't going to do nothing,'' said Johnson Willis, one  
of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. ``They never wanted to give us 
nothing. I had to sue them for everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, the councilman, said the board could not consider  
annexing the three areas until early this year, when the 
neighborhoods were finally connected to the town sewer service. 
</P>
<P>
	The annexation process is expected to take about a year.  
</P>
<P>
	``This was meant to happen, and I'm glad it happened,'' said  
Sharon Ingram, who lives in one of the neighborhoods. ``It 
should've happened a long time ago.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A Sony Corp.-led rally by high technology shares  
boosted Japan's Nikkei stock average Tuesday to finish above 15,000 
points for the first time since November. The dollar slipped 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 317.65 points,  
or 2.15 percent, to 15,096.70 points by the close of the afternoon 
session. On Monday, the average slid 114.95 points, or 0.77 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time the Nikkei finished above 15,000 since  
Nov. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.76 yen at 5 p.m. (0800 GMT), down 0.02 yen  
from late Monday in Tokyo but slightly above its late New York 
level of 121.66 yen overnight. The greenback ranged between 120.65 
yen and 122.02 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	High tech stocks were on the rise thanks to an increase in the  
U.S. market overnight and Sony's announcement of a major 
restructuring plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rise in the high technology sector, one of the leading  
industries in Japan, brightened the overall market,'' said 
Masatoshi Sato, manager of the investment information group at 
Kankaku Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony soared 890 yen (dlrs 7.36) to 10,940 yen (dlrs 90.41) after  
the company said it would turn three of its listed units into 
wholly-owned subsidiaries by January and slash its work force by 10 
percent by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The units were Sony Music Entertainment, Sony Chemicals and Sony  
Precision Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders lauded the deal as a sign that the influential industry  
leader is bringing its Playstation and other highly profitable 
businesses directly under the wing of the parent company. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading in the shares of the three units involved was suspended  
Tuesday morning as exchange officials verified the information. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other high-technology shares, Toshiba jumped 39 yen (dlrs  
.32) to 813 yen (dlrs 6.72), NEC advanced 45 yen (dlrs .37) to 
1,270 yen (dlrs 10.50), and Hitachi climbed 41 yen (dlrs .34) to 
808 yen (dlrs 6.68). 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the stock market remains strongly supported by  
continued foreign buying, as well as the recent fall in long-term 
interest rates and the yen. Long-term interest rates have been 
helped by the Bank of Japan's decision to ease monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the improved sentiment, traders said the market will  
probably have a difficult time climbing sharply above the 15,000 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market won't be able to move up that easily as there still  
seems to be a lot of corporations wanting to sell 
cross-shareholdings,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general manager at Nikko 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancers beat retreaters 646 to 522, while 142 were unchanged.  
Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was 
estimated at 594.84 million shares, down from 649.37 million shares 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 14.76 points, or 1.29 percent, to 1,162.51 
points. The TOPIX closed up 1.03 points, or 0.09 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar dropped after an early  
short-covering rally sputtered out amid heavy selling by Japanese 
exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar briefly broke above 122 yen early in the session, but  
dollar-long Japanese exporters and institutional investors saw that 
as the signal to resume their recent position liquidations and as a 
chance to take profits. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 132.28 yen, up from  
132.09 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond rose to 1.700 percent from Monday's finish of 1.625 
percent, driving its price down to 100.80 yen from 101.41 yen.

<HEADLINE> Bush Abortion Stance Challenged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fellow Republicans challenged as ``ambiguous''  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush's stance on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said Monday he would back a constitutional amendment to  
outlaw most abortions if more voters supported it. But he said, 
``America is not ready to ban abortions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer, a conservative Republican presidential hopeful, said  
Tuesday that Bush's stance on abortion was far too vague. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see how a 'compassionate conservative' can be  
ambiguous about protecting unborn children,'' said Bauer. ``Clearly 
the governor hasn't thought this issue through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer also challenged Bush's contention that public opinion  
would not support a constitutional ban on abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	``As leaders,'' Bauer said, ``our role must be to help shape  
public opinion, not simply react to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., who is seeking the Republican  
presidential nomination and has led the anti-abortion effort in the 
Senate, says the abortion issue will require concrete stances from 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it is a moral issue,'' said Smith, ``and you can't  
tiptoe around moral issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Kennedy, national political director for Lamar Alexander's  
presidential bid, said Bush's comments illustrate his lack of 
political experience on the national level. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way he fumbled this issue indicates why he may not be  
ready to play in the big leagues of national politics,'' Kennedy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Opinsky, spokesman for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., says  
Bush's vague positions on key issues like abortion helped make him 
popular early in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	For candidates like Bush, whose positions on abortion are not  
clearly defined, Opinsky says, ``voters have been able to project 
whatever positions they want into them.''

<HEADLINE> Bucks' Karl To Face Former Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The hardest thing about the NBA lockout for  
Milwaukee Bucks coach George Karl was not knowing which days to 
circle on his calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	When the NBA lockout ended, Karl scanned the schedule for the  
truncated season and looped just one day, Wednesday, March 10. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when he'll face his former team, the Seattle SuperSonics,  
who fired him last summer despite a sixth straight 50-win season 
after another playoff run fell short of the title. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course. I'm a competitor and I have a lot of love for those  
guys and when that night occurs, it's going to be emotional, it's 
going to be exciting, it's going to be a little fearful because I 
know how talented they are and how effective a basketball team they 
can be,'' Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks won 10 of their first 15 under Karl in their quest to  
end a seven-year playoff drought. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sonics, under Paul Westphal, started out hot but have  
cooled. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Karl talks of turning around the Bucks as he did the  
Sonics, he won't use Seattle as a gauge for his up-and-coming team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's probably a little better to measure yourself  
against your conference opponents and conference elite,'' Karl 
said. ``I kind of laugh because the Sonics are probably going to 
know the stuff that we do better than we know it right now. They've 
done it more than we've done it. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, it'll be interesting to throw some of the stuff at them  
and see how Gary Payton and Vinny Baker and Detlef Schrempf handle 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bucks guard Ray Allen said Karl has been playing down the  
matchup, but no one is fooled. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't want a lot of people to make a big deal out of it,  
but it's one of those situations where he doesn't have to say 
anything to us because we know,'' Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Bucks are off to a good start under Karl, not all  
is well. 
</P>
<P>
	Point guard Terrell Brandon, the team's spark plug, has refused  
to negotiate a contract extension and the rumor mill has been 
churning with the possibility he'll be traded by Thursday's 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, forward Tyrone Hill, who came to Milwaukee with Brandon  
from Cleveland, has said he wants out, especially if Brandon 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill met with team owner Sen. Herb Kohl on Sunday but refused to  
reveal details of his trade request he made less than a year after 
signing an extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl is accustomed to the turmoil, having weathered stormy  
relationships with Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he's reluctant to let a player of Brandon's stature  
get away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to have him the rest of the way and then figure  
it out in the summertime when the free agent stuff hits the fan,'' 
Karl said.

<HEADLINE> Missouri Poised To Execute Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Gov. Mel Carnahan is being asked by the Vatican  
to spare the life of another condemned prisoner, six weeks after he 
commuted the death sentence of a convicted killer following a plea 
from the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Roberts, 46, is scheduled to die by injection at 12:01 a.m.  
Wednesday at the Potosi Correctional Center for killing prison 
guard Tom Jackson during a 1983 riot. A spokesman for the governor 
said Carnahan is considering Roberts' clemency request. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan last month refused to halt the execution of convicted  
killer James Rodden, who became the first Missouri inmate to be put 
to death since Pope John Paul II's January visit to St. Louis. 
Immediatly following that visit, the governor reduced Darrell 
Mease's sentence to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts said in a phone interview Monday that he was scuffling  
with another guard during the riot and was nowhere near where 
Jackson was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never saw Mr. Jackson,'' he said. ``I didn't even know  
nobody had been killed until the next day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other guards say Roberts held the guard while two fellow inmates  
stabbed the 62-year-old Jackson to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys questioned why eyewitnesses -- two guards and  
an inmate -- didn't name Roberts in initial reports. They also asked 
why Roberts had no blood on him after the slaying, and say he 
passed a lie detector test denying involvement in the murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Religious leaders are asking Carnahan to intervene.  
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Carnahan on Saturday, the Rev. Jesse Jackson  
wrote that without clemency, Missouri faces ``the troubling 
prospect of taking the life of a man for a crime he may not have 
committed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan also heard pleas for mercy last week from the Vatican  
and from ``Dead Man Walking'' author Sister Helen Prejean.

<HEADLINE> Cabbies Upset Over Child Restraints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Taxi driver Jimmy Lugar agrees that every  
infant passenger should be in a car seat. He just doesn't think 
cabs should have to provide the seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's possible for a taxi driver to carry a car  
seat in the car. I don't think it makes sense,'' said Lugar, a 
driver for Stamford Yellow Cab. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Connecticut law, if Lugar decides to take a child  
passenger, he has to ensure that the adult accompanying them has a 
car seat for the child. If not, he must provide one. Violators face 
a $70 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's absolutely outrageous,'' said William Scalzi,  
president of Metro Taxi of New Haven, the state's largest taxi 
company. ``What in God's name makes riding on a city bus or a train 
any less dangerous than going down the road in a four-door sedan? 
Nobody else is required to do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Letters went out to cab companies around the state last week,  
reminding them that they are subject to a 1994 law requiring 
children under 4 and weighing less than 40 pounds to travel in a 
car seat. Buses are exempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Gambardella, a supervisor for state Department of  
Transportation, said cabbies may have been confused because they 
are exempt from the state's mandatory seat belt law. However, they 
must comply with the child car seat law. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can be injured just as easily in a taxi cab as you can in  
an automobile, so with regard to safety, (taxi drivers) shouldn't 
be treated any differently,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Delaware, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan and the District of  
Columbia exempt taxi drivers from child restraint laws, according 
to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The group does 
not have data on how many states require taxi drivers to provide 
the restraints. 
</P>
<P>
	John Reynolds, president of Valley Cab in Shelton, was one of  
two cab operators who recently asked state officials for 
clarification of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds said he had been instructed by his insurance company  
not to have child restraint seats in his cabs because it would make 
his company liable if a child was hurt in an accident. He said his 
insurers also told him he would need to carry five different sizes 
to ensure a proper fit for a variety of child passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to ... have to refuse anyone who has a child under  
4 or 40 pounds. We can't assume that risk,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Buckeyes Rise From Ashes of 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The future couldn't have looked much  
darker for coach Jim O'Brien and Ohio State a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien's first Buckeyes team was awful, matching the school  
record with 22 losses and finishing last in the Big Ten. His first 
recruiting class was solid but unspectacular. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the pressure, Ohio State was poised to move into a new  
$110 million arena that had 19,500 seats -- even though it couldn't 
draw 10,000 to its home games in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who do not experience the lows have a tendency to  
not totally appreciate the highs,'' O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what makes Thursday night's first-round NCAA South  
Regional game against Murray State all the sweeter for O'Brien and 
Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Buckeyes -- with one major exception -- have never  
been closer to the NCAA tournament than watching it on TV. Ohio 
State, 23-8 after going 8-22 a year ago, had strung together five 
straight losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you have to do is go through a couple of seasons where  
you've lost a lot of games,'' O'Brien said. ``To get to this point 
for us makes all of us appreciate the winning, having been through 
what we did a year ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes' remarkable turnaround has made O'Brien one of the  
most popular men in Ohio. Fans sounding off on radio call-in shows 
and writing letters to the editor call him a miracle worker. 
</P>
<P>
	The 48-year-old Brooklyn, N.Y., native pinches himself at his  
good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	In what must seem like a previous life, O'Brien spent 11 years  
as the head coach at Boston College after starring as a guard at 
the school under coach Bob Cousy. O'Brien's BC teams were 
frequently overshadowed in the Big East, but gained the reputation 
of being giant-killers. 
</P>
<P>
	Three times in four years, the Eagles made it to the NCAA  
tournament and won at least a game each time, including a trip to 
the regional championship game in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his success and the reverence BC fans had for him, there  
were problems. An ongoing battle with school administrators over 
admission standards for his recruits turned personal and then 
public two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	At almost the same time, Ohio State fired Randy Ayers and was  
shopping for a coach. Athletics director Andy Geiger interviewed 
big-name candidates such as Tubby Smith and Rick Barnes. When 
O'Brien was announced as the new coach, many fans groused that 
Geiger had settled for a no-name. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I heard about it, I didn't believe it,'' BC point guard  
Scoonie Penn said. ``One day he's my coach. The next day, I see him 
on the news walking around St. John Arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before he had ever coached a game at Ohio State, O'Brien showed  
the door to three players, including two starters. Before long, 
three others joined them. 
</P>
<P>
	Undermanned and overmatched, the Buckeyes were seldom in a game  
in the last two months of the 1998 season, losing a school-record 
17 straight games during one stretch. But Michael Redd, who became 
the first freshman to lead the Big Ten in scoring, earned valuable 
experience, and O'Brien began molding a collection of scrubs into 
dependable role players 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State went from 1-15 in the Big Ten to 12-4 this season,  
reaching the top 10 in the polls and going 8-2 against ranked 
teams. The team averaged more than 17,000 in attendance while 
winning 14 of 15 games at its new Value City Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	After suffering his worst loss (73-56) to Ohio State as  
Indiana's head coach, Bob Knight said, ``Last year was a really 
tough season for them. It was a question of getting things 
implemented with a new coach. They're really improved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim O'Brien has done a terrific job,'' Wisconsin coach Dick  
Bennett said. ``There's been a major attitude change, as much as 
anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the biggest reasons for the turnaround is the smallest  
guy on the squad. Penn -- a 5-foot-10 junior who played on two NCAA 
tournament teams under O'Brien at BC -- followed him to Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting out his transfer year, Penn suffered through the losses.  
This year he has triggered the Buckeyes' turnaround with 17 points 
and four assists per game to earn Big Ten player of the year 
honors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tremendous success story for him,'' O'Brien said. ``To  
give up what he gave up to come out here and end up getting a 
player-of-the-year award in his first year -- my God, what can be 
better than that for him?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn said the turnaround is the product of O'Brien and the  
coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't let us all season be happy with where we were.  
They kept pushing us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien, who tripled his salary when he took the Ohio State job,  
said he fell into a position that happened to be a perfect fit. 
</P>
<P>
	``These kids have been wonderful to coach,'' O'Brien said.  
``They have refused to lose.''

<HEADLINE> Bad Hearts and Stress Can Be Deadly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- People whose hearts show signs of poor  
circulation during stress face triple the usual risk of death in 
the years to come, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Often people with bad hearts suffer chest pain during exertion,  
with clogged arteries that cannot supply enough blood to the heart 
muscle. But over the past decade, it has become clear that mental 
exertion can also overwork the heart, often without pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors call this condition silent ischemia.  
</P>
<P>
	While doctors assume that silent ischemia is not a good thing,  
no studies until now have been large enough to prove that mental 
stress can actually be fatal for people with coronary artery 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	A study released Tuesday demonstrates just how dangerous this  
can be for the heart. It found the annual death rate is about 4 
percent among people whose hearts have bad circulation during 
mental stress -- more than triple the risk faced by heart disease 
patients who do not react this way to mental stress. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, the researchers found that public speaking is a  
particularly potent trigger of this heart problem. However, they 
said that probably anything that causes mental stress is risky for 
these people. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, conducted by Dr. David Sheps of East Tennessee State  
University, was presented in New Orleans at a meeting of the 
American College of Cardiology. 
</P>
<P>
	``As doctors, we all have had patients for whom we have no doubt  
that an acutely stressful situation has precipitated a cardiac 
event,'' Sheps said. 
</P>
<P>
	To help understand how this happens, the researchers gave three  
days of tests to 173 men and women with heart disease. They were 
asked to imagine that a relative had been mistreated in a nursing 
home. Then they were given two minutes to prepare a speech about 
the problem and five minutes to deliver it before an audience. 
</P>
<P>
	People's blood pressure typically soared about 40 points.  
Radionucleotide scanners watched their hearts. In half the 
volunteers, sections of the muscle of the left ventricle began to 
beat erratically. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven of them died during three to four years of follow-up.  
Forty-four percent of these victims had shown the erratic 
heartbeats during public speaking, while 18 percent did not. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheps said those whose hearts reacted badly on the test seemed  
no more nervous or tongue-tied than those who weathered the stress 
without problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people do not have sudden death during public speaking,''  
noted Dr. Bernard Gersh of the Mayo Clinic. Instead, the study 
identified people with a heightened response to stresses that may 
lead to a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier studies have shown that such hardships as depression,  
the death of a spouse, losing a job or living through an earthquake 
increase the risk of fatal heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	However, those studies did not test victims ahead of time for  
silent ischemia during mental stress. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was financed by the National Heart, Lung and Blood  
Institute.

<HEADLINE> California Has Most Aggressive Driving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An environmental group contends that  
aggressive driving is worst in places where sprawl development and 
poor mass transit planning force drivers into their cars. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey released Monday by the Surface Transportation Policy  
Project, a group backed by 200 environmental groups including 
several Sierra Club chapters, found that the Riverside/San 
Bernardino, Calif., region had the highest number of aggressive 
driving deaths in 1996, an average of 13.4 deaths per 100,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	In a twist, the best metropolitan area was Boston, a city with a  
reputation for bad drivers. It had only 2.1 aggressive driving 
deaths per 100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The endless strip malls and high-speed roads we're building  
seem to be a breeding ground for aggressive driving,'' said Roy 
Kienitz, executive director for the group that advocates mass 
transit alternatives to traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
	A community like Boston, the Surface Transportation Policy  
Project believes, has a lower rate because it offers commuters 
options like the subway, commuter trains and an extensive sidewalk 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	The Riverside/San Bernardino area, by contrast, is near Los  
Angeles, a region with few mass transit options, overcrowded 
freeways and a tradition of driving vast distances, the project 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore put the administration's stamp on the  
report, highlighting its findings during a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nationwide today, men spend an average of 84 minutes per day  
behind the wheel. Women spend an average of 64 minutes per day 
behind the wheel, and that can lead to some frustrated moments,'' 
Gore told 20 traffic reporters invited to Washington for the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore urged the Federal Communications Commission to establish a  
national ``N11'' hotline -- using the numbers 211 or 511 -- that 
would give drivers immediate transportation and traveler 
information, such as road conditions and bus schedules. Unlike 911, 
it would not be used for life-threatening situations. 
</P>
<P>
	The aggressive driving report was criticized by The Road  
Information Program. The Washington road-building group noted a 
recent AAA survey in which motorists said aggressive driving is 
triggered by congestion and slow-moving traffic -- evidence of the 
need to build more roads. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1970, the group said, highway travel has increased by 130  
percent while new road mileage has increased by only 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``If traffic is growing at more than 24 times the rate of  
increased capacity, the net result is going to be increased 
congestion,'' said William Wilkins, head of The Road Information 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
	In Riverside, Calif., spokesmen for both the police department  
and the city manager's office did not immediately return calls 
seeking comment on the aggressive driving report. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, meanwhile, announced at the news conference that  
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater will lead four 
transportation summits across the country during the next year. The 
summits will be held in Atlanta, San Francisco and Detroit, as well 
as possibly Blue Springs, Mo., and will be co-hosted by the mayor 
in that community. 
</P>
<P>
	He also noted that the nation's $203 billion highway act -- a  
six-year measure passed last year -- lets employers spend up to $240 
per employee each year on taxable and nontaxable transit 
assistance, including money for parking and vanpools. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's announcements are part of the administration's $1 billion  
budget proposal to improve daily life in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Surface Transportation Policy Project's report was based on  
its analysis of 1996 fatal accident reports, the most recent 
available. Like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 
the group defined aggressive driving as speeding, tailgating, 
failing to yield and improper passing, among other factors. 
</P>
<P>
	It eliminated accidents in which drugs or alcohol were a factor.  
For speeding crashes, it included only those involving speeds over 
80 mph. The group then compared the accidents' locations with 
urbanized areas over 1 million in population, as defined by the 
U.S. Census Bureau.

<HEADLINE> FTC Probes Fight Over Generic Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Generic drugs were once seen as the solution to  
rising cost of brand-name prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	But large pharmaceutical companies have become increasingly  
sophisticated at starving off generic competitors by finding ways 
to extend the patent life of their blockbuster drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the federal government is taking a hard look at whether all  
the methods pass legal muster. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts, though, expect little to come of the  
investigation because they believe the companies, such as Eli Lilly 
and Dupont, are acting within their rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``The companies are all doing the normal practices that they  
have to do to protect their franchises,'' said Hemant Shah, a drug 
analyst with HKS &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission is looking at deals drug companies  
have with potential rivals and other activities undertaken to 
protect their patents. The agency's widened inquiry was first 
reported in the Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, for example, Eli Lilly formed an agreement to buy a  
modified form of Prozac from Sepracor, a company that specializes 
in removing dangerous side effects from established drugs and 
licensing the rights back to the manufacturer. The FTC is 
requesting more information on that deal, Eli Lilli officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is valuable to Lilly because Prozac, which had nearly  
$3 billion in worldwide sales in 1998, is expected to lose patent 
protection in the next two years. While Sepracor isn't a generic 
drug maker, it illustrates Lilly's desire to hold onto the rights 
to desirable second-generation drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Lilly-Sepracor deal is an exclusive arrangement it  
eliminates a potential rival in a class of drugs dominated by 
Prozac. 
</P>
<P>
	A second generation Prozac drug made by Lilly would likely  
hamper potential sales of a generic competitor to the existing 
Prozac drug because the newer form would have fewer side effects, 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulatory concerns have been fueled as drug prices continue to  
increase at more than twice the overall inflation rate. The higher 
prices combined with the rising demand for new drugs has placed a 
difficult burden on private and public health insurance programs. 
``We think this is positive that the FTC is looking into this, and 
at least calling into question the parameters of these deals,'' 
said Carole Cox, a spokeswoman for generic drugmaker Barr 
Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	An FTC spokeswoman said the agency does not comment on  
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr is suing Lilly for blocking its ability to make a generic  
form of Prozac. Barr is also suing Dupont, which has cracked down 
on Barr's efforts to sell its generic form of the blood thinner 
Coumadin. Dupont asserts that Barr's generic copy is not equivalent 
to Coumadin. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox said the FTC contacted the company last month about Prozac  
and Coumadin issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Some companies, such as Abbott Laboratories, have paid potential  
generic rivals not to produce a generic drug until they resolve 
their litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst David Saks of Gruntal &AMP; Co. said that may appear  
anti-consumer, but such deals help both firms, and ensure a generic 
version eventually does come to market. Without such an agreement, 
major pharmaceutical companies could keep small generic firms in 
court for years before resolving patent disputes, he said.

<HEADLINE> Study Disputes Breast Cancer Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- In a surprising shift from popular medical  
theory, researchers reported today that they found no evidence that 
a high-fat diet promotes breast cancer -- or that low-fat foods 
protect against the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers and other experts quickly noted that a low-fat diet  
is still good for the heart, and heart disease kills far more 
Americans -- women and men -- than any cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should just accept that good scientists can't tell you yet  
what to eat to minimize your breast-cancer risk,'' said Dr. John 
Glaspy of the University of California at Los Angeles, who was not 
involved in the research. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have theorized that eating lots of fat increases  
breast-cancer risk. They have based their thinking on animal 
studies, international comparisons and studies of women who 
developed breast cancer and women who didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts have suggested that the key is the type of fat  
consumed, not the amount; that fish oil offers some protection from 
breast cancer; or that contaminants stored in fat trigger breast 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study, published in today's Journal of the American  
Medical Association, tracked 88,795 women in the continuing Nurses' 
Health Study. The women, ages 30 to 55, completed detailed 
questionnaires about their eating habits every four years from 1980 
to 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers compared the diets of the women without breast  
cancer and the 2,956 women whose breast cancer was discovered 
during the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Breast cancer was found to be no more common among women who ate  
lots of fat, or among those who ate a large proportion of animal 
fat, polyunsaturated fat (vegetable fat) or trans-unsaturated fat 
(partially hydrogenated oils, such as those used in margarine and 
to cook doughnuts and french fries). 
</P>
<P>
	Nor was breast cancer any less common in women who got a high  
proportion of their fats from fish oil or who got less than 20 
percent of their total calories from fat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our research indicates it's highly unlikely that women who  
consume a low-fat diet are protected against breast cancer,'' said 
the study's lead author, Dr. Michelle Holmes, an instructor of 
medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's 
Hospital. ``Equally, it appears a high-fat diet also poses no 
increased risk for the disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most surprisingly, women who ate the least fat appeared to have  
a 15 percent higher rate of breast cancer, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes said she's not ready to conclude that a low-fat diet  
increases breast cancer risk because the finding was based on fewer 
than 1,000 women who ate less than 20 percent of calories as fat. 
</P>
<P>
	The theory that dietary fat is linked to breast cancer arose  
from the observation that breast-cancer rates are far lower in 
traditional Asian cultures, where diets are generally low in fat. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared with women in Western cultures, Asian women start  
menstruating later, give birth at a younger age and gain far less 
weight in adulthood -- all factors that decrease breast-cancer risk, 
Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA's Glaspy said the new research ``is something that we're  
going to need to explain.'' He said fat intake may need to be very 
low -- as little as 10 percent of total calories -- to reduce 
breast-cancer risk. 
</P>
<P>
	He also noted that only some kinds of fish oil have appeared  
beneficial in previous studies. The new study did not distinguish 
between types, he said, nor did it run long enough to explore the 
possibility that dietary effects may take longer than 14 years to 
emerge. 
</P>
<P>
	Glaspy said he believes that diet interacts with environmental  
factors in subtler ways than scientists have been able to identify.

<HEADLINE> Tenant Refuses To Leave Pricey Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- In truth, Charlton Forge isn't even Samuel  
Rael's kind of neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Rael is a bachelor lawyer, amateur boxer and sometime producer  
of B-movies. Charlton Forge, with its $200,000-plus homes of 
spacious decks and rolling, landscaped yards, is a Southern 
suburbia of sport-utility vehicles, soccer moms and backyard 
barbecues. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rael is staying right where is. It's a matter of principle  
now, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Rael is renting a house at a bargain rate through a company  
called Atlanta Showcase of Homes. Renters with an eye for 
decorating are allowed to move into a house while it is up for 
sale. The idea is that the tenant will give the place the lived-in 
look that makes a house easier to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	The house where Rael is living has yet to sell. But neighbors  
want him out anyway because of his roommate: a man awaiting trial 
on rape charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Rael is fighting eviction by Atlanta Showcase of Homes.  
</P>
<P>
	It's more than tenants' rights, he explains -- there's  
presumption of innocence, loyalty to a friend and standing up to 
small-minded attitudes and threats. ``That is ultimately what this 
is all about,'' Rael says. 
</P>
<P>
	That draws a chuckle from the lawyer for Atlanta Showcase of  
Homes. ``In our view, they're simply trying to hang on to a cheap 
rent,'' says Charles Robertson II. 
</P>
<P>
	Real, a Bronx-born defense attorney, moved into the  
three-bedroom, three-bath home owned by the wife of R&AMP;B musician 
Keith Sweat in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his contract with Atlanta Showcase, Rael was ``resident  
manager,'' paying $650 a month and agreeing to keep the house ready 
to show to potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rael, 45, had lived in two other homes for Atlanta Showcase,  
staying about six months each time. The drawbacks are interruptions 
by real estate agents and a requirement that he be ready to vacate 
on seven days' notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like being in the Army, or maybe in the witness  
protection program,'' Rael says. 
</P>
<P>
	His latest house is in conservative Cobb County, home of former  
House Speaker Newt Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after Rael moved in, his friend Michael Wright needed a  
place to stay after four months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, 50, blames a bad breakup with a vengeful girlfriend for  
the rape charges and predicts he will be acquitted. He has an ankle 
monitor that prevents him from going more than 150 feet from the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	When a problem with the pipes last year left the house without  
water while Rael was away, Wright sheepishly asked a neighbor to 
bring him water, claiming a basketball injury kept him from going 
for it himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm probably the least-dangerous person in this  
neighborhood,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors don't see it that way. They learned about Wright's  
status after he asked a church for help in getting back on his feet 
and his Charlton Forge address caught the eye of a volunteer who 
lives there. 
</P>
<P>
	Word got around quickly, and Atlanta Showcase told the tenants  
to leave. Rael refused, both because he didn't want to move so 
quickly and because he didn't like the reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``The neighbors take exception to turning their neighborhood  
into a minimum-security prison,'' Robertson explains. 
</P>
<P>
	Three neighbors declined comment or didn't return calls, and  
Rael says he has had little contact with them. He jokes that he 
fears being pelted by ``their Gucci bags.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was an anonymous voice mail last week warning that  
neighbors will cause trouble for Wright in court, and Rael says 
Sweat's wife, Lisa, threatened to send high-powered Los Angeles 
lawyers after him. Sweat's publicist didn't return a call. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson last week won an eviction order against Rael. But Rael  
is appealing and asking for a jury trial. The case could drag on 
for months. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson says the uncertain status of the tenants has  
complicated efforts to sell the house. The for-sale sign was taken 
down last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Rael, meanwhile, ponders whether this could be the stuff of a  
new direct-to-video movie. Four movies he helped produce, with 
titles such as ``Demolition Highway,'' found their biggest audience 
in Bangladesh, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't know what the ending's going to be,'' Rael says.

<HEADLINE> Weber St. Gives Heels Matchup Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Quick, undersized teams can give North  
Carolina problems, meaning Weber State is capable of some trouble 
in the first round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The Big Sky Conference champions don't have a starter taller  
than 6-foot-7. The third-seeded Tar Heels are one of the nation's 
tallest teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quick team always has the advantage, especially if you've  
got a lot of big people on the court,'' North Carolina point guard 
Ed Cota said Tuesday before the Tar Heels flew to Seattle. ``You 
can always use your quickness to run up and down the floor to wear 
a team down. Hopefully, we can overcome that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two teams meet in the West Regional on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us problems, but at the same time it gives them  
problems,'' forward Ademola Okulaja said Thursday. ``Overall, I 
think it will give them more problems if we run our plays right and 
execute and get the ball inside. Hopefully, we'll overpower them 
under the boards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bill Guthridge said a pair of satellite dishes installed  
at the Smith Center years ago came in handy late Sunday when he and 
his staff dug up four taped games on 14th-seeded Weber State 
(24-7), a squad the Tar Heels knew little about. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they've got a couple of future NBA players,''  
Guthridge said Tuesday of 6-6 forward Harold Arceneaux and guard 
Eddie Gill. ``That conference has a good history (in the NCAAs). 
</P>
<P>
	``They certainly like to break, but they can run a set offense  
too. They start three guards, and if you count Arceneaux, they have 
four guards. So they are going to present matchup problems for 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tar Heels (24-9) are making their 25th straight NCAA  
tournament appearance but are coming off a 23-point loss to Duke in 
the Atlantic Coast Conference title game. 
</P>
<P>
	Guthridge said his team is upbeat despite the lopsided loss,  
which could translate into a potential loss of momentum heading 
into the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost to the No. 1 team in the country, so we can't dwell on  
that game. We just have to bounce back,'' Cota said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Losses really bother me, but if you look back on it we had two  
of our best games in beating Georgia Tech and Maryland,'' Guthridge 
said of the ACC tourney. ``It's hard to judge how you play against 
Duke because they are so good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina, seeking a 25-win season for the 15th time in the  
last 18 years, has one huge advantage -- NCAA experience. The Tar 
Heels have won at least one game in the tournament 18 straight 
years and been to the Final Four each of the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care about the Final Four no more, I want to win it,''  
Okulaja said. ``It's nice to say you've been to the Final Four, 
then the next year again you said you were to the Final Four. But 
both times people say, `What happened?' I don't want them to say, 
`What happened?' I want to say I've won the whole thing and here is 
my ring.''

<HEADLINE> Chinese Parliament Gets Amendments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- The ruling Communist Party asked the national  
legislature today to approve constitutional amendments underscoring 
China's commitment to safeguarding private businesses and pushing 
ahead with economic reforms despite the risk of unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The amendments, a chief task of this year's 11-day annual  
meeting of the full legislature, typify how the Communist Party 
makes decisions in advance and asks the 2,978-member National 
People's Congress to approve them. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation learned of the amendments on Jan. 30, when state-run  
news media reported disclosed them following a closed meeting of 
the legislature's executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
	One amendment describes private business as an ``important  
component of the socialist market economy,'' instead of merely a 
``complement'' to state ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Another states that China will be in a primary stage of  
socialism, in communist theory a time when state-owned and private 
business can co-exist, ``for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Communist Party's second highest ranking member, legislative  
chairman Li Peng, led a party committee that drafted the 
amendments. The group collected opinions from provincial-level 
party committees, experts on legal and economic affairs, and 
business interests under the government-backed National Association 
of Industry and Commerce, Tian Jiyun, a congressional vice 
chairman, told the legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	Another proposed constitutional revision would enshrine ``Deng  
Xiaoping Theory'' as one of China's guiding principles, along with 
Maoist and Marxist-Leninist theories. 
</P>
<P>
	Deng, who died in 1997 at age 92, helped open China to outside  
trade and investment and encouraged growth of the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The constitutional revisions reflect positions set by a key  
Communist Party meeting in September 1997. Premier Zhu Rongji, in 
his address at the opening of the session Friday, emphasized anew 
Beijing's commitment to market-oriented economic reforms despite 
the threat of social unrest due to rising unemployment and lagging 
farm incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	The central government is looking to private businesses to help  
provide jobs for many of the millions of workers being laid off by 
defunct state factories. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually outlawed by radical communist policies during the  
1966-76 Cultural Revolution, private businesses were revived with 
the economic reforms championed by Deng beginning in the late 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Weak legal protection, however, has inhibited growth of the  
private sector, leading to calls for constitutional guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
	Private businesses produce about one-third of the nation's  
industrial output, said Zhao Shulian, a researcher in Beijing with 
the China Academy of Social Sciences. State-owned and collectively 
owned businesses each also produce one-third.

<HEADLINE> Roche Profits Rise 3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BASEL, Switzerland (AP) -- Swiss pharmaceuticals giant Roche  
Holding AG said Tuesday its profits were up 3 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company posted a net profit of 4.39 billion Swiss francs ($3  
billion), up from 4.27 billion Swiss francs in 1997. Changes in the 
exchange rate mean that the profit in dollars was essentially 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barring extraordinary events, Roche anticipates another good  
result for 1999,'' the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Roche also announced that chairman Fritz Gerber would be  
retiring at the 2001 general meeting. He will be replaced by the 
present chief executive, Franz Humer. 
</P>
<P>
	Roche had previously announced that its sales for 1998 rose to  
24.66 billion francs, from 18.77 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Roche, whose leading products include the drugs Rocephin,  
Accutane/Roaccutan and Versed/Dormicum, has expanded steadily 
during the 1990s. In November 1998 the group completed the sale of 
DePuy Inc. to Johnson and Johnson for $2.9 billion.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft, Hongkong Telecom To Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. and Hongkong Telecom will  
cooperate on an Internet venture to provide movies and other home 
entertainment to Hong Kong residents via computer, the companies 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies plan to combine Microsoft's software with Hongkong  
Telecom's Internet infrastructure in a deal that will offer 
customers on-line rentals of videos, music, news and interactive 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Hongkong Telecom now offers subscribers a variety of Internet  
services that include home banking, home shopping and videos and 
music on demand. The company has said it wants to become an Asian 
Internet powerhouse, with more alliances and possibly some 
acquisitions expected soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, meanwhile, is angling for a stronger presence in  
China. 
</P>
<P>
	Hongkong Telecom shares had gained about 18 percent over the  
past two days, before Microsoft boss Bill Gates and Hongkong 
Telecom chief executive Linus Cheung made their announcement this 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft and Hongkong Telecom did not immediately say how much  
money they would be investing in the venture or when it would be 
available for customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates was to travel Wednesday to the southern Chinese city of  
Shenzhen and sign an agreement with six mainland Chinese computer 
companies to bring movies and Internet services to mainland 
television viewers, according to Bruce Ning, a public relations 
executive employed by Microsoft in China. 
</P>
<P>
	The government-sponsored project will use advanced software  
developed in Microsoft's new research center in the Chinese capital 
of Beijing, Ning said.

	LONDON (AP) -- Roger Moore found being honored by Queen Elizabeth  
II on Tuesday a little more nerve-wracking than dodging bullets in 
her majesty's service. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a bit nervous, mainly because you don't get a rehearsal  
for this and I am used to having rehearsals before I perform,'' he 
said after the queen gave him the Commander of the Order of British 
Empire medal.

	Moore, 71, may be most famous as James Bond, but it was his  
UNICEF campaign for children that won him the queen's recognition. 
He has been a special ambassador for the U.N. children's charity 
for almost a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``Working with UNICEF made me grow up and recognize how  
fortunate I am,'' Moore said.

<HEADLINE> Magazine To Pay Hoffman Legal Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A magazine that published a picture of Dustin  
Hoffman's head on the body of a cross-dressing man has been ordered 
to pay $270,000 of the actor's legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure announced Monday was less than the $415,000 Hoffman's  
attorneys had sought from Los Angeles Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The judge cut their attorneys' fees back significantly and we  
were pleased about that,'' said Julie Hoover, a spokeswoman ABC 
Inc., the magazine's parent company. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian ordered the  
magazine to pay Hoffman $3 million in damages. ABC plans to appeal 
that judgment, Ms. Hoover said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman, 61, sued over the March 1997 fashion layout in which  
his face, as it appeared in the 1982 cross-dressing comedy 
``Tootsie,'' was computer-grafted onto the body of a male model 
wearing a yellow evening gown and heels. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman sued for violation of publicity rights, claiming that  
the magazine's publisher, Fairchild Publications Inc., and its 
parent turned him into an unpaid fashion model.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Retailer Buys Pathmark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Royal Ahold will buy the Pathmark  
supermarket chain in a $1.7 billion deal that boosts the giant 
Dutch retailer's share of the U.S. grocery market. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahold, which already owns the Tops Market, Giant Food and Stop &AMP;  
Shop chains, said it reached an agreement with SMG-II Holdings 
Corp., which controls Pathmark, to buy its outstanding shares for 
$250 million. It also agreed to assume $1.5 billion of Pathmark's 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahold hopes to strengthen its position in the New York  
metropolitan area with the acquisition of Carteret, N.J.-based 
Pathmark, which has 132 supermarkets mostly in New York City, 
northern New Jersey and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The acquisition of Pathmark provides Ahold with a large number  
of high quality locations in an attractive market where our 
position left room for improvement. This is now going to change,'' 
said Bob Tobin, president and chief executive officer of Ahold USA. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pathmark stores' estimated 1998 sales were $3.7 billion, and  
the chain employs 28,000 people. The Dutch retailer also plans to 
change its Edwards supermarkets in New Jersey, New York City and 
Long Island into Pathmarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahold said the company would save $30 million in the first year  
and $50 million in the second as a result of the acquisition, 
partly by restructuring Pathmark's debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The chain also said it would spend more to make Pathmark a  
``state-of-the-art'' supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahold bought Giant Food Inc. of Landover, Md., last year for  
$2.6 billion and already owns the BI-LO supermarket chain in the 
Carolinas, Tops Markets in western New York and Stop &AMP; Shop in 
Connecticut and Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	It controls about 1,000 stores on the East Coast and operates  
about 3,600 supermarkets throughout the world, including in The 
Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Latin America. Sales in 1998 were 
over $30 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahold said the sale, subject to regulatory approval, should be  
finalized in the second half of this year.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Gain; Wheat Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures advanced Tuesday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade, while wheat moved lower and corn was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans gained on the strength in the soybean oil market, which  
was tied to reports of damage to Argentina's sunseed crop after 
heavy weekend rains. Smaller competing supplies in the world 
vegetable oil could bolster prospects for U.S. exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures retreated after Pakistan purchased wheat from  
competing countries, dashing hopes that a recent pickup in export

<HEADLINE>  Ice, Snow Hit North, East States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Schools closed and traffic slowed to a crawl from the Great  
Lakes all the way south into Georgia on Tuesday, as a storm dumped 
more than a foot of snow in places along with layers of ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Air travel suffered across the Midwest as airport crews cleared  
runways. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen inches of snow piled up at the Minneapolis-St. Paul  
airport, with 14 in Iowa, 10 in Indiana, Ohio and Maryland and a 
foot possible by Wednesday in the West Virginia mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	``We opened the door, and the drift was bigger than the dog,''  
said Rose Bissmeyer, who lives near Pleasant Plain in southwest 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Southeast, a layer of ice under 2 inches of snow created  
havoc Tuesday morning in northeastern Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The roads aren't closed but they're impassable,'' said Deputy  
Sheriff John Keener in Rabun County, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first major snowstorm of the season for Washington,  
D.C., leading the House to postpone all floor votes, delaying 
flights in and out of Dulles and Ronald Reagan National airports, 
and delaying a memorial service for the late Supreme Court Justice 
Harry A. Blackmun. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a band of air that's just not moving,'' said Andy  
Woodock of the National Weather Service in Sterling, Va. ``It just 
snowed and snowed and snowed instead of moving on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The snow also caused flight delays and cancellations from Monday  
evening into Tuesday at airports in Minneapolis, Chicago, 
Milwaukee, Detroit, Pittsburgh and some Ohio cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm briefly closed the Minneapolis-St. Paul International  
Airport for the first time in three years, and airport workers 
distributed pillows and blankets to stranded passengers Monday 
night as nearby hotels filled up. 
</P>
<P>
	As airlines worked to catch up and move planes into place,  
Chicago's O'Hare and Midway airports had continuing delays Tuesday. 
American Airlines canceled about 60 percent of its morning flights 
and United slashed about 30 percent of its schedule, said city 
Aviation Department spokeswoman Monique Bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The big storm had swept eastward across the Plains, closing  
scores of schools Monday in Nebraska, South Dakota, Minnesota and 
Iowa, and churning up thunderstorms in the South and southern 
Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	By Tuesday, snow flew across the Great Lakes states to the  
Atlantic and southward along the Appalachians, closing schools in 
39 of West Virginia's 55 counties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really haven't had a bad winter,'' said Jesse Richey in  
Elkins, W.Va. ``But we've had more snow here in the past couple of 
weeks than in the whole rest of the season put together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least eight traffic deaths were blamed on the weather, two  
each in Iowa and Maryland, and one each in Minnesota, Indiana, 
Virginia and West Virginia.

<HEADLINE>  Late Justice Blackmun Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Harry A. Blackmun was eulogized Tuesday as a  
man with a ``conscientious, humane judicial vision'' who sought to 
understand the people whose lives his Supreme Court opinions would 
affect. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton, Attorney General Janet Reno and humorist  
Garrison Keillor joined Blackmun's family, friends and Supreme 
Court colleagues at a memorial service for the retired justice who 
died last Thursday at age 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who succeeded Blackmun on the  
nation's highest court in 1994, said he ``made a direct, conscious 
effort to reach out and understand those whose life experience was 
different from his own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His accomplishments during 24 years on the court ``reveal a  
vision, a conscientious, humane judicial vision, which he applied 
in one area of the law after another,'' including equal protection 
of the sexes and races, Breyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun got tens of thousands of letters after he authored the  
1973 Roe vs. Wade opinion that legalized abortion nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	One very long letter urged Blackmun to resign, Breyer said, and  
the justice's reply was succinct: ``Dear Sir, No. Sincerely, Harry 
A. Blackmun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Koh, a former Blackmun law clerk and now assistant  
secretary of state, called him ``the people's justice'' who 
``through quiet courage and sheer hard work became the conscience 
of our court in the late 20th century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former law clerk Pamela Karlan told of the time Blackmun, a  
Methodist, came to her Passover seder wearing a yarmulke and having 
studied up on the Jewish rituals. ``He was amazingly open to new 
experiences,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	His daughter, Nancy Blackmun, said his long hours at work  
limited his time with his family, but added that for his three 
daughters, ``his were the most comforting hands to hold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Minnesotan Garrison Keillor led the congregation in the  
Yale University ``Whiffenpoof Song,'' a song about lost lambs that 
Ms. Blackmun said her father often sang to his children when they 
were small, even though he earned his undergraduate and law degrees 
at Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. William A. Holmes of the Metropolitan Memorial United  
Methodist Church said Blackmun brought to religion and the law ``a 
creative fidelity marked by humility, and always with a twinkle in 
his eye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton sat on the front row with Blackmun's family. Across  
the aisle were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, seven of the 
eight associate justices, and retired Justice Byron R. White -- the 
only living retired justice. Justice Antonin Scalia was out of town 
due to an illness in the family. 
</P>
<P>
	Back at the Supreme Court building, a bouquet of flowers and a  
framed photograph of Blackmun adorned the table in the public 
cafeteria where he regularly had breakfast with his law clerks.

<HEADLINE> RJR Nabisco To Shed Tobacco Biz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., the food and tobacco  
conglomerate whose brands include Camels and Winstons, Oreo cookies 
and Ritz crackers, is getting out of the cigarette business. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR said Tuesday it will sell its international tobacco business  
to Japan's largest tobacco company and will break off its domestic 
tobacco operations into a separate company owned by the same 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves come amid rising legal challenges to cigarettes and  
falling numbers of U.S. smokers, something tobacco opponents were 
quick to note. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tobacco industry is in deep trouble,'' said Ahron  
Leichtman, executive director for Citizens for a Tobacco-Free 
Society, an anti-tobacco group based in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	On the contrary, RJR said its aim is merely to help the  
cigarette and food companies to greater success as separate 
entities -- and securities analysts agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	John Maxwell, analyst at Davenport &AMP; Co., said RJR got a  
fantastic price for the international business -- $7.8 billion. It 
will use the proceeds to help reduce its $9.1 billion debt, leaving 
the domestic tobacco company in a better position to compete in the 
United States, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR has been under pressure for several years from some of its  
major stockholders to separate the businesses in the $17 billion 
conglomerate so they could rise or fall on their own merits. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Icahn, a onetime corporate raider who holds about 7.7  
percent of RJR stock, had threatened to launch a fight for control 
of the board of directors to force a quick separation. Icahn failed 
to return repeated calls for comment Tuesday. His 25 million shares 
grew in value slightly as RJR Nabisco stock rose 12 1/2 cents to 
$28.75 a share in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Nabisco 
Holdings -- which trades as a separate stock even though RJR owns 
80.6 percent of it -- closed up 31 1/4 cents at $44.93 3/4 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR Nabisco was acquired in 1988 by the investment firm  
Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts for $25 billion, the biggest corporate 
buyout of the high-flying 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday RJR said it is selling its international tobacco  
business to Japan Tobacco Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deal will allow us to secure a base for future growth  
overseas and establish us as a global player,'' Japan Tobacco said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The RJR international tobacco business is a distant third to  
Philip Morris Cos. and British-American Tobacco PLC, and its 
earnings have fallen amid financial turmoil in its key Russian and 
Asian markets. 
</P>
<P>
	After the sale, the RJR board plans to spin off its domestic  
tobacco operations, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., to RJR shareholders. 
The tobacco company will keep its name and will retain its 
headquarters in Winston-Salem, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the food and tobacco businesses will be best  
able to achieve their full potential under separate ownership 
structures,'' said RJR chairman and chief executive Steven F. 
Goldstone. 
</P>
<P>
	The spinoff would leave RJR Nabisco with an 80.6 percent stake  
in Nabisco Holdings Corp., the food division that also makes Chips 
Ahoy! and Snackwell's cookies, Life Savers candy and Planters nuts. 
RJR would change its name to Nabisco Group Holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with lower debt after the spinoff, the R.J. Reynolds  
Tobacco faces challenges. Analysts expect the steady decline in 
cigarette consumption will accelerate due to hefty price hikes that 
are being used to pay for a lawsuit settlement that is costing the 
industry $246 billion over 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government is considering a similar suit to recover  
the costs of treating sick smokers. A California jury recently 
awarded a smoker a $51 million judgment against a tobacco maker. A 
class-action smokers' suit is pending in Florida and several union 
health funds are also suing the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Importantly, the new corporate structure allows people filing  
tobacco suits to continue to make claims against either R.J. 
Reynolds Tobacco Co. or the renamed RJR Nabisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had long warned that simply spinning off the food  
division into a separate independent company would face a prolonged 
court challenge because plaintiffs would charge the company with 
putting valuable assets out of their reach. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Daynard, a tobacco critic who heads the Tobacco Products  
Liability Project, said that plaintiffs may still protest if the 
company uses the proceeds from the sale of the international 
company for a stock buyback or higher dividends.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen Tuesday as  
interest rates rose in Japan along with its main stock index, 
underpinning the Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar barely slipped against the euro in very thin currency  
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 121.00  
Japanese yen, down from 121.66 yen on Monday. The euro was quoted 
at $1.0890, up from $1.0886. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was rising during Asian trading when Japanese  
exporters and institutional investors began taking profits, sending 
the dollar lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell further after a Bank of Japan governor, Masaru  
Hayami, indicated the central bank might raise interest rates. 
Lower rates have fueled the dollar's recent rise against the yen. 
Foreign investors are repelled by assets that return lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Some traders said Hayami's comments brought added pressure on an  
already sliding dollar. Japan's main stock index shot up and the 
Japanese bond market sold off, making Japanese assets and currency 
more appetizing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dollar is not as attractive as it was a day ago,'' said  
Robert Fullem, a corporate trader at National Westminster Bank, 
especially given the reactions of Japanese stocks and bonds. ``But 
it's too early to tell that Japan is coming out of a quagmire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar again rose in late Asian/early European trading on  
rumors China was again considering devaluing its currency. But that 
was cut short when a People's Bank of China spokesman denied the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro has fallen almost from its first day of trading in  
January. But traders are no longer sure where the new currency is 
headed, so they sold it off Tuesday along with the dollar, Fullem 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fullem called this ``a period of rest before we go lower'' with  
the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4667 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4627, and 1.5178 Canadian dollars, up from 1.5156. The British 
pound rose to $1.6186, up from $1.6080. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro no longer  
are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7960 German 
marks, down from 1.7966; 6.0241 French francs, unchanged; and 
1,779.36 Italian lire, also unchanged.

<HEADLINE> O'Brien, Ohio State a Perfect Fit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- It wasn't so long ago that Jim O'Brien  
languished at Boston College, feeling unhappy and unappreciated. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, in two short seasons after years of decline, Ohio State has  
become a powerhouse and O'Brien couldn't be happier. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a remarkable climb from the depths for both.  
</P>
<P>
	``The people who do not experience the lows have a tendency to  
not totally appreciate the highs,'' O'Brien said. ``All you have to 
do is go through a couple of seasons where you've lost a lot of 
games. To get to this point for us makes all of us appreciate the 
winning, having been through what we did a year ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State (23-8) is the No. 4 seed and a heavy favorite over  
Murray State (27-5) in Thursday's first round of the NCAA South 
Regional in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Buckeyes -- with one major exception -- have never  
been closer to the NCAA tournament than watching it on TV. Ohio 
State, 8-22 and last in the Big Ten in 1998 in O'Brien's first 
season, is coming off a school-record five straight losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes' remarkable turnaround has made O'Brien one of the  
most popular people in Ohio where he is seen as a miracle-worker. 
Fans sounding off on radio call-in shows and writing letters to the 
editor call it a dream. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a road the 48-year-old Brooklyn native has been down  
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In what must seem like a previous life, O'Brien spent 11 years  
as the head coach at Boston College playing as a guard at the 
school under coach Bob Cousy. Overshadowed by bigger names in the 
Big East, O'Brien coached frequently overlooked Boston College into 
a giant-killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Three times in four years, the Eagles made it to the NCAA  
tournament and won at least a game each time, including a trip to 
the regional championship game in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his success and the reverence Boston College fans had  
for him, there were problems. A battle with school administrators 
over admission standards for his recruits turned personal and then 
public two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	At almost the same time, Ohio State fired Randy Ayers and was  
shopping for a coach. Athletic director Andy Geiger interviewed 
several candidates and was reportedly turned down by Tubby Smith 
and Rick Barnes. When O'Brien was hired as the coach, many fans 
groused that Geiger had settled for a no-name. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I heard about it, I didn't believe it,'' point guard  
Scoonie Penn said. ``One day he's my coach. The next day, I see him 
on the news walking around St. John Arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before he had ever coached a game at Ohio State, O'Brien showed  
the door to three players including two starters. They were ushered 
out of the program for a variety of crimes and misdemeanors. Before 
long, three others joined them. 
</P>
<P>
	Undermanned and overmatched, the Buckeyes were seldom in a game  
in the last two months of the 1998 season. They lost a 
school-record 17 straight games during one stretch. But Michael 
Redd, who became the first freshman to lead the Big Ten in scoring, 
earned valuable experience and O'Brien began molding a collection 
of scrubs into dependable role players 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State went from 1-15 in the Big Ten to 12-4 this season,  
reaching the top 10 in the polls and going 8-2 against ranked 
teams. After drawing under 10,000 per game to antiquated St. John 
Arena last year, Ohio State drew more than 17,000 fans while 
winning 14 of 15 games in its new building. 
</P>
<P>
	After suffering his worst loss (73-56) to Ohio State as  
Indiana's coach, Bob Knight said, ``Last year was a really tough 
season for them. It was a question of getting things implemented 
with a new coach. They're really improved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim O'Brien has done a terrific job,'' Wisconsin coach Dick  
Bennett said. ``There's been a major attitude change, as much as 
anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the primary reasons for the turnaround is the smallest  
guy on the squad. Penn, who played for O'Brien for two years at 
Boston College, followed him to Columbus. Penn sat out the 1998 
season as a transfer, and has triggered the Buckeyes' comeback with 
17 points and four assists a game to earn Big Ten player of the 
year honors. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn played on two NCAA tournament teams at Boston College when  
he made the jump to the problem-riddled Ohio State program. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tremendous success story for him,'' O'Brien said. ``To  
give up what he gave up to come out here and end up getting a 
player-of-the-year award in his first year -- my God, what can be 
better than that for him?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn said the turnaround is the product of O'Brien and the  
coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``They keep us on our toes. They didn't let us all season be  
happy with where we were. They kept pushing us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien, who tripled his salary when he took the Ohio State job,  
said he fell into a position that happened to be a perfect fit. 
</P>
<P>
	``These kids have been wonderful to coach,'' O'Brien said.  
``They have refused to lose.''

<HEADLINE> IRS Can Give Wrong Answers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most of the time, the IRS is a fine place to  
get the answer to a sticky tax question. But the agency admits that 
15 percent of the answers given on its help line are wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	And the tax collectors aren't too sympathetic toward people who  
claim they made a mistake because they followed advice they got 
from the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the most part, the responsibility still lies with the  
taxpayer to file an accurate return,'' said Marilyn Soulsburg, 
acting IRS commissioner for customer service. ``That's why there's 
a bigger burden on us to make sure our quality is as high as it can 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A little more than half of American taxpayers had their returns  
professionally prepared last year, according to the IRS. Others are 
increasingly turning to computer tax software programs, which are 
modified each year to reflect changes in the tax code and ``ask'' 
people detailed questions about their finances. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS estimates that only 1 percent of returns done  
electronically contain errors, compared with 20 percent of those 
prepared on paper. 
</P>
<P>
	But millions of Americans still do their taxes with nothing more  
than a pencil, a calculator and a pot of coffee. If they get 
stumped, the IRS offers a variety of toll-free telephone lines to 
get answers. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS employs about 7,000 people in its toll-free telephone  
program, which expanded its 15,000 lines for the first time this 
year to seven days a week, 24 hours a day. Last year, almost 70 
million callers phoned the IRS for tax advice or to inquire about 
their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Medick, national director of the IRS telephone service,  
said the agency's own monitoring of calls indicates that last 
year's answers were accurate 85 percent of the time regarding tax 
law. For questions about individual taxpayer accounts, the accuracy 
rate was 90 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as 1995, the accuracy rate for both types of  
questions was placed at about 90 percent, but IRS recently switched 
to a centralized call monitoring system to replace the spot test 
calls made in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are always working to improve,'' Medick said. ``We have  
instant replay, so to speak, in the areas where we have the most 
difficulty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That ``replay'' includes bulletins sent to the 25 IRS phone  
service locations detailing areas of tax law where errors are more 
frequent. The IRS has also redoubled its training, but the 
expansion to a 24-hour system without additional staff has put a 
strain on the quality of its advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the same group of people working more hours, so we  
don't have the same skill base,'' Soulsburg said. 
</P>
<P>
	One other note: Although the taxpayer is ultimately responsible  
for all taxes, the IRS will forgive penalties if the problem is 
caused by their advice. Taxpayers who believe they were given bad 
guidance should contact the IRS to have any penalty deleted. 
</P>
<P>
	Another problem IRS has been working to overcome is the number  
of times taxpayers simply can't get through at all. A recent 
General Accounting Office report found that only about 51 percent 
of all calls were answered in 1997 -- and that was up 20 percent 
from the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the agency expanded from typical business hours to 16  
hours a day, seven days a week, and this year calls are answered 
round-the-clock all week during tax filing season -- from the 
beginning of January through mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've given people more opportunities to get through at  
different times,'' Soulsburg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another free option for taxpayers with computers is the IRS site  
on the Internet -- www.irs.ustreas.gov -- that includes thousands of 
pages of tax publications and forms. The site, visited more than 
340 million times in fiscal 1998, provides answers to frequently 
asked questions and features alerts to any widespread tax problems. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other alternatives. IRS tax help, including  
face-to-face contact, is available at 400 agency offices around the 
country, with 250 of them open Monday through Saturday through 
April 10. Taxpayers should call the IRS for more information.

<HEADLINE> Lycos Board Member Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lycos Inc., a top Web destination, may be forced  
to remain independent or seek a new suitor after its largest 
shareholder quit the Lycos board to protest its proposed merger 
with the USA Networks cable television company. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignation by David Wetherell on Tuesday helped push up  
Lycos' stock by up to 24 percent as investors, who have balked at 
the deal's terms, expressed relief that it could fall through. 
</P>
<P>
	Wetherell's venture capital firm, CMGI Inc., owns 18.5 percent  
of the Waltham, Mass.-based Lycos, which provides Internet search 
and information services. His protest adds doubt to a three-way 
deal that would merge USA Networks' cable TV network with Lycos and 
Ticketmaster Online Citysearch, an online seller of tickets to 
concerts and other events. 
</P>
<P>
	While other large investors could still end up supporting the  
merger, CMGI's stepped-up opposition raised the odds considerably 
against the deal going through unless Lycos shareholders are 
offered sweeter terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as the current structure is concerned, it's going to be  
really tough to pull it off,'' said Ullas Naik, an analyst with 
First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The mounting discontent in the Lycos deal throws a cautionary  
note to other potential Internet merger partners considering 
something other than the sort of pure Web marriage preferred by 
Internet investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the discontent is the fact that the New York-based USA  
Networks didn't offer Lycos investors the sort of rich takeover 
premium typically showered on shareholders of newly acquired 
Internet companies. Lycos investors were offered less than the 
closing price of their stock of $127.25 just before the deal was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	More fundamentally, investors are wary of merging a fast-growing  
Internet company with seemingly infinite potential with a stable 
company deeply rooted in a slower-growing business. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies with most of their businesses in the Internet, the  
notion goes, will profit the most from the Web's fast-growing sales 
and not be weighed down by more traditional businesses. Last year, 
online sales totaled $4.9 billion, and are projected to jump more 
than five times, to $29 billion, in four years, according to New 
York-based research firm Jupiter Communications LLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Concern that a ``mixed marriage'' would drag down Lycos' growth  
led Ryan Jacobs, manager of The Internet Fund, to sell its Lycos 
stock shortly after the deal was announced on Feb. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just didn't agree with that strategy and thought it was  
unnecessary and would result in slower growth and reduced 
margins,'' Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the deal was announced, Wetherell declared he  
would not support it unless Lycos' stock recovered from its 
depressed levels. Lycos' shares have fallen by more than a third 
since the deal was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	But reports of Wetherell's resignation Tuesday sent the  
company's stock soaring before easing somewhat. It closed up nearly 
15 percent, or $12.37 1/2, at $96.25 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	``After further consideration, it is my opinion that the terms  
of the USA-Lycos transaction are inadequate for Lycos 
shareholders,'' Wetherell said in a statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``As such, I am resigning from the Lycos board in order to be  
free to explore the best options available to Lycos shareholders, 
including the possibility of Lycos remaining independent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswomen at Lycos and USA Networks did not return phone calls  
seeking comment. Lycos, in a statement, said ``it remains fully 
committed'' to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Wetherell also did not return calls. But his resignation  
suggests he had tried unsuccessfully to get USA Networks to sweeten 
the deal's terms, said Chris Lochhead, chief marketing officer at 
Scient Corp., an electronic-commerce consulting firm based in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to be believe he's tried everything to either fix  
the deal or remedy the situation, and that leaving the board is a 
last-ditch effort from his point of view,'' Lochhead said.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Keep Interception Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Kwamie Lassiter, whose NFC-leading eight  
interceptions helped the Cardinals to their first playoff berth 
since 1982, has signed a new three-year contract with Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter, who spent most of his first three NFL seasons as a  
nickel back, apparently passed up a more lucrative offer from San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	He became a starter at midseason last year, and capped the year  
with four interceptions in a final game win over San Diego that 
clinched a wild-card berth for the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune, a newspaper serving suburban Phoenix, reported  
Tuesday that the deal was worth an estimated $3.6 million -- nearly 
triple his 1998 salary of about $400,000 but about $300,000 short 
of the Chargers' last offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal includes a $900,000 signing bonus, the newspaper said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I went with what went down at the end of the season,''  
Lassiter told The Tribune after agreeing to the deal. ``The players 
want to win, and it was a feeling I had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter -- one of four signing priorities for the Cardinals --  
had visited the Chargers about two weeks ago, and the team made its 
initial offer on Friday. It then worked hard to persuade Lassiter 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chargers told me I'd come in to be a starter, but it's all  
talk until it happens,'' Lassiter said. ``It was very close to me 
going there -- real close.''

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Looking at Nissan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Debt-hobbled Nissan Motor Co.'s future could  
become a lot clearer by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Robert J. Eaton said Tuesday that  
German-American automaker will likely decide before month's end 
whether to take a stake in the Tokyo-based Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Tuesday at the Geneva International Motor Show,  
Eaton also said he wouldn't be surprised if there are more 
defections of top American executives from DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton declined to reveal details of DaimlerChrysler's  
negotiations with Nissan. But he said statements last month that no 
decision would be made before mid-May were no longer valid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be substantially shorter than that,'' he said.  
When asked if it could be as soon as the end of March, Eaton 
replied: ``Yeah, I think it will be before that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	France's Renault SA, which is considerably smaller than  
DaimlerChrysler, also has expressed interest in Nissan. But Eaton 
denied reports that the two automakers were bidding against each 
other. ``That's absolutely not the case,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Remi Deconinck, vice president of product planning for Renault,  
declined to comment on its talks with Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	Since rumors of DaimlerChrysler's interest in buying a stake in  
Nissan surfaced last year, Eaton has been more circumspect in his 
comments than his counterpart, co-chairman Juergen Schrempp. Eaton 
is known to have rejected overtures by Nissan when he was chairman 
of the former Chrysler Corp. That has led to suggestions that Eaton 
and Schrempp are at odds over the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guarantee you he and I and every single person in management  
are together -- we've spent a lot of time on it,'' he said. ``We're 
100 percent together. There's not one iota of difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just not ready to do anything at this point. We're still  
looking at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A DaimlerChrysler-Nissan alliance could position DaimlerChrysler  
to better compete against Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp., 
Toyota Motor Corp. and Volkswagen AG, which have more extensive 
investments in China and other Asian developing markets. 
</P>
<P>
	But any deal will likely require DaimlerChrysler to take on a  
substantial portion of Nissan's staggering debt, which is estimated 
to range between $22 billion and $37 billion. Industry analysts 
expect DaimlerChrysler to demand a controlling 30 percent to 40 
percent stake with limits on its exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton also said he was not surprised by the departures of five  
top-level executives since the former Daimler-Benz acquired 
Chrysler in November. They include the former communications chief 
for Chrysler, three of its chief manufacturing executives, and the 
former head of Chrysler Financial Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The departures have worried some on Wall Street.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not surprising to see people leave when two companies  
merge,'' said Stephen Girsky, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter. ``What's surprising is a lot of it seems to be on the 
Chrysler side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Eaton said he expected some executives would be lured away  
by rival automakers in the merger's wake. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been recruiters circling the building for a long  
time,'' he said. ``I don't know of anybody who hasn't gotten 
offers. I know of an awful lot of people who have turned them 
down.''

<HEADLINE> House Gears Up for Vote on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House is gearing up for a non-binding vote  
on whether the Clinton administration should send troops to Kosovo 
as part of a NATO unit to enforce a peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Debate on the issue is scheduled later in the week as the  
administration intensifies its efforts to get the Serbs and Kosovar 
Albanians to support the proposed plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is eager for both sides to commit themselves  
to the proposal before peace talks resume in France next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials are hopeful the Kosovar Albanians will go along the  
plan but are less optimistic about the willingness of Serb 
President Slobodan Milosevic to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is dispatching Ambassador  
Richard Holbrooke to Belgrade for talks on Wednesday. Holbrooke has 
a reputation for persuading Milosevic to make concessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, Milosevic has resisted provisions of the proposal  
that call for the deployment of some 30,000 troops in Kosovo, 
including 4,000 U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been more receptive to political aspects of the plan.  
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has warned of possible NATO military action  
against the Serbs if Milosevic remains defiant. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would give the majority Albanian population in Kosovo  
self-rule while leaving sovereignty over the province with the 
Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a ``Dear Colleague'' letter, House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., said he has told Clinton he has serious reservations about 
sending U.S. peacekeepers to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my judgment, members of Congress have a solemn duty to vote  
before thousands of men and women are placed in harm's way,'' 
Hastert wrote. ``I believe each of us, and the nation, will benefit 
from such a debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution, to be introduced by Rep. Benjamin Gilman,  
R-N.Y., who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, 
would express a sense of Congress that troops should be deployed, 
allowing for an up-and-down vote on matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration claims it doesn't need specific  
congressional approval to send troops to Kosovo. Congressional 
views are mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members, including Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., contend  
that Clinton does need such authority. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department said Monday that the general staff of the  
Kosovo Liberation Army had agreed to the plan. But a rebel 
commander insisted the KLA will not give up its arms -- a key 
provision of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Bob Dole, who met last Friday with Kosovar Albanian  
leaders, stressed the importance of a unified Kosovar Albanian 
stand in support of the plan.

<HEADLINE> Farmer Fined for Illegal Subsidies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Greenville, Miss., farmer and his company  
were ordered Monday to pay $776,860 in restitution and serve three 
years probation for fraudulently collecting subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	Brook Keith Mitchell Sr. and his 4,700-acre company, Five M  
Farming Enterprises, were sentenced by U.S. District Judge Thomas 
Penfield Jackson. They pleaded guilty Nov. 13, 1996, to four counts 
of illegally obtaining excess crop subsidy payments from 1992 to 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges were brought by Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz,  
who investigated former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. Mitchell 
was a longtime supporter of Espy, who was acquitted in December of 
charges he accepted illegal gifts from companies he regulated. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a federal program, owners of farming operations are  
entitled to crop subsidy payments of up to $50,000 per owner under 
certain market conditions. Prosecutors said Mitchell developed a 
scheme that falsely claimed there were three companies, which 
inflated the operation's eligibility for subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, the Agriculture Department concluded that the three  
companies claimed by Mitchell did not qualify for subsidy payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Espy's chief of staff, Ronald H. Blackley,  
helped Mitchell secure a review of the decision and the subsidy 
denial was later reversed.

<HEADLINE> Dole Announcement Focuses GOP Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole's announcement of an  
exploratory committee for the Republican presidential nomination 
brings new attention to the GOP field and should give her early 
steam in the race, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole will announce at a rally here Wednesday the formation  
of the committee and also begin airing television commercials in 
Iowa and New Hampshire fleshing out her campaign's themes, aides 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the TV spots, she warns of a ``thickening layer of skepticism  
and doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I run, this will be why -- I believe our people are looking  
for leaders who will call America to her better nature,'' Mrs. Dole 
said. ``Yes, we've been let down, and by people we should have been 
able to look up to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A transcript of the commercial was obtained from a site on the  
World Wide Web, and two Dole aides confirmed it was the script for 
the new spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a politician and, frankly, today that may be a plus,''  
Mrs. Dole says. 
</P>
<P>
	With the formation of an exploratory committee, Mrs. Dole joins  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush at the top of the name recognition heap 
among GOP presidential hopefuls. The two dominate early polling for 
what is shaping up as a large Republican field. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a magnifying glass above them that other candidates  
don't have,'' said Ed Gillespie, a strategist allied with Ohio Rep. 
John Kasich. ``They have very positive names in the Republican 
Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said last week Mrs. Dole had decided to form an  
exploratory committee, and she chose Iowa -- home of the precinct 
caucuses that launch the nominating season -- for the formal 
announcement. She's heading to Arizona and New Hampshire later in 
the week, before returning to her North Carolina home on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole has a wealth of experience serving in the  
administrations of five presidents and she touts that in her TV 
spots. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is an overriding theme to my 30-plus years in public  
life -- and I think there is -- it lies in placing service over 
politics, consensus over confrontation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While she enters the race with high standings in the polls, some  
warned she will be forced soon to wrestle with contentious issues 
and define herself as she never had to do in the past, when her 
campaign effort were on behalf of her husband, Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Others said Mrs. Dole starts with a big advantage because,  
thanks to the repeated presidential bids of her husband, she does 
have decades of experience campaigning in important early states. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's campaigned in Iowa, off and on, since 1979,'' said Des  
Moines lawyer Steve Roberts, who sits on the Republican National 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillespie said Mrs. Dole could broaden the Republican base  
simply by causing women to take a fresh look at the GOP field, a 
solid development for a voting group that hasn't been kind to 
Republicans.

<HEADLINE> Cellulite Pill Hits U.S. Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An herbal supplement popular in Australia that  
claims to eliminate cellulite was launched in the U.S. market 
Tuesday, prompting a wave of media attention and medical 
skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
	The makers of Cellasene claim an eight-week course of three  
pills daily will eliminate the stubborn, lumpy fat known to plague 
women's thighs. 
</P>
<P>
	The pills, available at major drug and retail stores, cost about  
$40 for a two-week supply. 
</P>
<P>
	As with the scores of other dietary supplements promising  
everything from slowing aging to preventing cancer, Cellasene is 
not regulated by the federal Food and Drug Administration and its 
claims do not have to be substantiated. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitamin maker Rexall Sundown Inc., based in Boca Raton, Fla.,  
which has the U.S. distribution rights to Cellasene, said gingko 
biloba, sweet clover and grapeseed extracts and other ingredients 
in Cellasene work by increasing increase blood circulation, 
reducing fluid buildup, stimulating metabolism and reducing 
localized fats. The company's press kit and Web site offered no 
information on any tests done on the efficacy of Cellasene. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said the claims were unlikely and would require  
controlled medical trials to achieve any credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be very skeptical of any quick-fix pill one can ingest  
that would have any meaningful effect on the appearance of 
cellulite,'' said Dr. Seth Yellin, director of the Emory Center for 
facial aesthetics at Emory University in Atlanta.

	``All of these things (ingredients) have been around for some  
time. Why all the sudden would putting them together this way 
create a miraculous cure for cellulite, a problem that has plagued 
women for forever?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	The pills have proved popular in Australia, where published  
reports said consumers had to be put on waiting lists because of a 
shortfall after Cellasene's debut last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	A warning on the label says those taking the pills may exceed  
the FDA's recommended daily allowance of iodine. It also warns that 
Cellasene should not be used by people with thyroid conditions, 
those being treated with blood thinners or those who are pregnant 
or nursing.

<HEADLINE> NIT Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) -- Being left out of the NCAA tournament  
was tough to swallow for Mississippi State. Being forced to play 
its first game of the National Invitation Tournament on the road 
felt like an added insult. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs (20-12) travel to Colorado State (17-10) for an NIT  
game tonight, when all 16 first-round games will be played. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team earned the right to be in the NCAA,'' Bulldogs coach  
Rick Stansbury insisted. ``It won 20 games. It won seven of its 
last 11. Of the 12 losses we had, seven were against Top 25 teams. 
But we can't control any of that. We feel fortunate to have another 
opportunity to play basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the road assignment, Stansbury said, ``Why? I don't  
know. But again, I'm not in control of that. All we're going to be 
concerned with are the things we are in control of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs launched a surprising run in the SEC tournament  
that ended with a semifinal loss Saturday to Arkansas, then were 
one of the teams snubbed by the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played hard and won 20 games,'' guard Detrick White said.  
``We were looking forward to getting into the NCAA tournament. We 
were disappointed when we watched the selection show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi State, which has enjoyed increased success since  
going to a smaller lineup in January, faces a Colorado State team 
that was surprised to get an NIT nod. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams, making their third appearance in the NIT in four  
years, made an early exit from the Western Athletic Conference 
tournament last week. The home game was equally unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge advantage for us,'' coach Ritchie McKay said.  
``We're 12-2 at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But McKay is concerned primarily about MSU's athleticism.  
</P>
<P>
	``Mississippi State is more athletic than any team we have  
played,'' he said, ``and we have played some pretty good teams in 
Tulsa and Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to play strong on defense and limit Tyrone  
Washington's catches. Washington is an NBA prospect, a big 6-10 
kid. We have to make him work for everything he gets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other NIT games tonight have Xavier (21-10) at Toledo (19-7),  
Hofstra (22-9) at Rutgers (18-12), Georgia (15-14) at Clemson 
(16-14), Seton Hall (15-14) at Old Dominion (24-8), Butler (20-9) 
at Bradley (17-11), Alabama (17-14) at Wake Forest (16-13) and 
Providence (16-13) at North Carolina State (18-13). 
</P>
<P>
	Also, it's Nevada-Las Vegas (16-12) at Nebraska (19-12),  
Pepperdine (19-12) at Colorado (17-14), Georgetown (15-15) at 
Princeton (20-7), Texas Christian (19-10) at Kansas State (20-12), 
Southern California (15-12) at Wyoming (17-9), Northwestern (15-13) 
at DePaul (17-12), Fresno State (21-11) at California (17-11) and 
Georgia Tech (15-15) at Oregon (16-11). 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago, 16th-seeded Princeton nearly pulled off the  
biggest upset in NCAA tournament history against No. 1 seed 
Georgetown. The Tigers get another crack at Georgetown, only this 
time in the NIT. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers in 1989 NCAA gave the Hoyas a memorable first-round  
scare in which Georgetown held on to win 50-49. A No. 16 seed has 
never defeated a No. 1 in the history of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a different story now,'' Tigers senior guard Brian Earl  
said. ``It's not on the same stage, it's the NIT as opposed to the 
NCAA's. And they're not so much the powerhouse, we're not so much 
the underdog. I'm sure it sparks memories, but not many.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Tigers win this time around, it wouldn't be much of a  
surprise. Princeton's chance to make the NCAA tournament slipped 
away in a loss to Pennsylvania in its final regular season game, 
while the Hoyas barely made the NIT, extending their streak of 
postseason appearances to 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the near upset, Princeton has become a national fixture,  
going to six more NCAA tournaments and winning two first-round 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hoyas have gone in the opposite direction, compiling a 31-30  
record the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgetown finished 0-9 against NCAA teams this year as opposed  
to Princeton's 4-3 mark. But Georgetown's young starting lineup, 
which includes two freshmen and two sophomores, has recently come 
together, and the Hoyas won six of their last 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only is Hofstra making its first postseason appearance in 22  
years, the Flying Dutchmen only have to travel about 60 miles for 
the game, so their fans are going to be able to make the trip 
rather easily. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our players are familiar with Rutgers and because we watch  
them all the time,'' Hofstra coach Jay Wright said. ``Eleven of our 
13 guys are from the metropolitan area and Rutgers has a lot, and 
our guys love that challenge, they really do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright's biggest concern is the health of junior point guard  
Craig ``Speedy'' Claxton. He missed the final regular-season game 
and was not at hardly played in the conference tournament with a 
strained left thigh. His status probably won't be determined until 
just before tipoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Claxton averaged 13.3 points, while handing out 159 assists. The  
junior was the player of the year in the American East conference 
as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
	With Claxton, Hofstra might present problems for Rutgers, which  
struggled late in the season, losing five of its last six games and 
a potential NCAA berth.

<HEADLINE> IRS Can Give Wrong Answers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service telephone help  
lines are open around the clock for taxpayers who need answers to 
difficult tax questions. Trouble is, even the IRS is wrong 15 
percent of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS officials say they're trying to close that gap, but it isn't  
easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``People should be able to rely on the information they get from  
us,'' said Marilyn Soulsburg, acting IRS commissioner for customer 
service. But for sticky problems, she added, ``oftentimes the 
taxpayers' best bet is to seek professional advice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A little more than half of American taxpayers had their returns  
professionally prepared last year, according to the IRS. Others are 
increasingly turning to computer tax software programs, which are 
modified each year to reflect changes in the tax code and ``ask'' 
people detailed questions about their finances. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS estimates that only 1 percent of returns done  
electronically contain errors, compared with 20 percent of those 
prepared on paper. 
</P>
<P>
	But millions of Americans still do their taxes with nothing more  
than a pencil, a calculator and a pot of coffee. If they get 
stumped, the IRS offers a variety of toll-free telephone lines to 
get answers. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS employs about 7,000 people in its toll-free telephone  
program, which expanded its 15,000 lines for the first time this 
year to seven days a week, 24 hours a day. Last year, almost 70 
million callers phoned the IRS for tax advice or to inquire about 
their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Medick, national director of the IRS telephone service,  
said the agency's monitoring of calls indicates that last year's 
answers were accurate 85 percent of the time regarding tax law. For 
questions about individual taxpayer accounts, the accuracy rate was 
90 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as 1995, the accuracy rate for both types of  
questions was placed at about 90 percent, but IRS recently switched 
to a centralized call monitoring system to replace the spot test 
calls made in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are always working to improve,'' Medick said. ``We have  
instant replay, so to speak, in the areas where we have the most 
difficulty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That ``replay'' includes bulletins sent to the 25 IRS phone  
service locations detailing areas of tax law where errors are more 
frequent. The IRS also has redoubled its training, but the 
expansion to a 24-hour system without additional staff has put a 
strain on the quality of its advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the same group of people working more hours, so we  
don't have the same skill base,'' Soulsburg said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the IRS isn't too sympathetic toward people who claim they  
made a mistake because of bad advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the most part, the responsibility still lies with the  
taxpayer to file an accurate return,'' Soulsburg said. ``That's why 
there's a bigger burden on us to make sure our quality is as high 
as it can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, although the taxpayer is ultimately responsible for all  
taxes, the IRS will forgive penalties if the problem is caused by 
the agency's advice. Taxpayers who believe they were given bad 
guidance should contact the IRS to have any penalty deleted. It's a 
good idea for the questioner to record the name of the person 
providing the advice and the time and date of the call. 
</P>
<P>
	Another problem IRS has been working to overcome is the number  
of times taxpayers simply can't get through at all. A recent 
General Accounting Office report found that only about 51 percent 
of all calls were answered in 1997, and that was up 20 percent from 
the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the agency expanded from typical business hours to 16  
hours a day, seven days a week, and this year calls are answered 
round-the-clock all week during tax-filing season, from the 
beginning of January through mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've given people more opportunities to get through at  
different times,'' Soulsburg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another free option for taxpayers with computers is the IRS site  
on the Internet -- www.irs.ustreas.gov -- that includes thousands of 
pages of tax publications and forms. The site, visited more than 
340 million times in fiscal 1998, provides answers to frequently 
asked questions and features alerts to any widespread tax problems. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other alternatives. IRS tax help, including  
face-to-face contact, is available at 400 agency offices around the 
country, with 250 open Monday through Saturday through April 10. 
Taxpayers should call the IRS for more information.

<HEADLINE> Cook With Propane Phobia Gets $3M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A federal jury awarded nearly $4 million to  
a chef who claimed a propane explosion left him too frightened of 
gas to cook. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Roettig, 50, said he developed a gas phobia after a blast  
wrecked his kitchen at The Balsam House Inn and Restaurant in 
Chestertown five years ago. Roettig told the jury that he can't go 
near a gas stove now, and if he sees a propane truck on the road, 
he has to pull over. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury Friday found Riverside Gas and Oil Co. liable for damages  
to both Roettig and the owner of the inn, Frank Ellis. Ellis was 
awarded more than $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion happened while a Riverside employee was checking a  
problem with the deep-fryer. Nobody was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for Riverside called the award unreasonable and said he  
will appeal.

<HEADLINE> Padres End Star Exodus With Hoffman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- Getting Trevor Hoffman's signature on a $32  
million, four-year contract extension sends a message to the team 
and the community, San Diego Padres manager Bruce Bochy said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing Kevin Brown, Ken Caminiti and Steve Finley to free  
agency and trading Greg Vaughn and Joey Hamilton from San Diego's 
NL championship team, general manager Kevin Towers said he made 
signing Hoffman a top priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``My desire all along had been to remain a Padres for the rest  
of my career,'' Hoffman said prior to a news conference in San 
Diego. ``San Diego is a special place to play. We've got baseball's 
greatest fans and an incredible new ballpark coming soon. To 
realize that I'll get to pitch there is incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contract, the largest in Padres history, calls for the  
highest average annual salary ever for a relief pitcher. Hoffman, 
already signed for $4.1 million this year, gets a $3 million 
signing bonus that is payable in 2002, $6 million in each of the 
first three years of the extension and $9 million in 2003. San 
Diego has a $10 million option for 2004 with a $2 million buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract has a no-trade clause, something new for the  
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dollar amount of the contract is unbelievable, but to  
dictate where you play for the next five years is priceless,'' said 
Hoffman, who had 53 saves in 54 chances last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman, 31, came to the Padres in a 1993 deal that sent  
outfielder Gary Sheffield to the Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited for Trevor as a person, but also for the  
organization,'' Bochy said. ``As a manager, it's nice to know 
you'll have the best reliever in baseball on you side for the next 
five years. `He has established himself as a San Diego Padre. And 
there is something to be said about continuity and tradition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman said he thought about testing the free-agent market  
after this season, but always thought something could be worked out 
with the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to run the risk that a deal with the Padres was  
a slam dunk,'' Hoffman said. ``I had to protect myself, but this is 
where I want to be. There has been a lot written and said about my 
situation, but there were never any heated exchanges or threats. 
Timing is everything in life, and my timing -- being in the last 
year of a deal after a great year in '98 -- was perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, country singer-turned-baseball player Garth Brooks,  
who left the Padres to be with his ill mother, could be back in 
training camp by the end of the week, club sources said. Official 
word could come Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 56 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were higher at midday, after bond prices  
were brought back from an early decline by the release of positive 
productivity data. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
56.89 at 9,784.50. The Dow opened lower and got as low as 9,681.27, 
down 46 points, before recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which rose to a record high  
close on Monday, reversed an early slide and was up another 9.32 
and again in record territory, at 1,292.05. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index, which also opened lower, was up  
25.95 at 2,423.57. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market opened lower but turned around after a 10 a.m.  
report showing that the productivity of American workers surged at 
a 4.6 percent annual rate during the final three months of last 
year, the best showing in six years. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, productivity increased a healthy 2.2 percent, a  
significant improvement over the 1.2 percent gain in 1997. Higher 
productivity means companies are more efficient and in many cases, 
more profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up 1/4 point in price and  
yielding 5.57 percent, down from 5.59 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the impediment of lower bonds was removed, stocks had the  
go-ahead to move higher, particularly in the technology sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were looking for reasons to rally, and that was as good  
as any,'' said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist for Legg 
Mason of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Longer term, however, Cripps said he was concerned about a drop  
in cash inflows into stocks, and a concentration of interest in the 
shares of large-capitalization companies over smaller ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our sense is that the liquidity going into the market is  
slowing, and what's happening is that the large-cap performance 
driven stocks are sucking liquidity from smaller caps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the higher indexes, declining issues were still leading  
advancers on the New York Stock Exchange by 1,432 to 1,359. Volume 
on the Big Board came to 362 million shares, up from Monday's pace 
of 315 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, technology stocks turned around after a lower opening  
caused by microchip maker Advanced Micro Devices, which warned of a 
``significant'' first-quarter loss because of production problems 
with its best line of microprocessors. AMD also announced a 
restructuring that will include cutting 300 jobs over the next six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	AMD shares were down 1 7/8 at 17 1/16. But other technology stocks  
were better behaved after an initial downturn. ``My sense is that 
people want to own these large, big technology names and they don't 
want to be left behind,'' Cripps said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cripps noted that AMD's news hadn't done real damage to the  
entire sector because it didn't include a prediction of slower 
demand for computers. Dow member IBM was up 3 5/8 at 182 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR Nabisco shares were up 1 15/16 at 30 9/16 on theBig Board.  
The consumer-products holding corporation agreed to sell its 
international tobacco business to Japan Tobacco Inc. for $7.8 
billion, and said it will separate its U.S. tobacco unit from its 
big Nabisco food operation.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Unveils High-Speed Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amtrak unveiled a new high-speed train Tuesday  
that is designed to whisk passengers at 150 mph between Washington, 
New York and Boston and revitalize the railroad by competing with 
airlines on such trips. 
</P>
<P>
	Named ``Acela'' (uh-SELL-ah) to hint at both acceleration and  
excellence, the new trains will travel between Boston and New York 
in three hours -- an improvement of 90 minutes over the current trip 
-- and from New York to Washington in as little as 2 1/2 hours, a 
savings of a half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Service is to begin in November or December, and Amtrak  
officials hope it will be a model for similar trains in the Great 
Lakes, the Gulf Coast, California and the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we have a product here that will absolutely knock the  
socks off the competition,'' Amtrak President George Warrington 
said at a gala opening attended by more than 1,000 employees. 
``USAir, Delta, General Motors, Ford, you name it, only Amtrak's 
Acela will provide a very special journey for customers who will 
travel downtown to downtown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to pledging speed, Amtrak promised an unparalleled  
service. Acela's snub-nosed, silver-and-turquoise trains will have 
business-class seats with audio and power jacks, special check-in 
areas and concierge service, plus dining cars with meeting tables, 
upgraded food and beer on tap. 
</P>
<P>
	The schedule has not been set, but Amtrak officials said it  
probably would maintain most current stops, including Baltimore, 
Philadelphia, New Haven, Conn., and Providence, R.I. The railroad 
will also retain its slower Northeast Direct service. 
</P>
<P>
	A one-way trip will cost about $130 to $140 each way between New  
York and Boston or Washington, an increase from the current 
Metroliner express fare of $114 but still less than the $199 
walk-up fare charged by US Airways and Delta Air Lines. They are 
the two primary airlines offering shuttle service between 
Washington, New York and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta spokeswoman Kay Horner said: ``There's a lot of traffic in  
the corridor and Delta offers a different product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak projects that Acela will boost its market share in the  
busy Northeast Corridor from 12 percent to 15 percent annually, or 
about 14.3 million passengers total. It also expects Acela to 
generate $180 million in new profits its first full year of 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	A cash influx is important because Amtrak has not turned a  
profit since being founded in 1971. The General Accounting Office 
reported that the railroad lost an average of $47 per passenger in 
fiscal 1997, renewing criticism in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the House and Senate passed legislation requiring that  
Amtrak become self-sufficient by 2002. They provided a $2.2 billion 
cash infusion in 1997 and have been approving steadily declining 
subsidies since then. 
</P>
<P>
	``For years our critics have sat on the sidelines waiting for  
the high-speed rail program to fade. We will continue to disappoint 
them,'' Warrington said. ``In fact, we are using the lessons 
learned on high-speed rail to improve all our services across this 
country. Acela will be a catalyst for America's 21st century rail 
renaissance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak will achieve the time gains through a $2 billion program  
that has included electrifying the entire 470-mile stretch between 
Washington and Boston, straightening curves and spending $710 
million on 20 new train sets that incorporate so-called tilt 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Such trains glide around corners by gently tilting into the  
bend. That doesn't promote speed as much as it prevents centrifugal 
force from throwing passengers into a car's walls. 
</P>
<P>
	While modeled after the French bullet train, the TGV, Acela  
won't match its top speed of 185 mph because it does not have a 
dedicated track and is working off rail that is not new but has 
been incrementally improved. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, chairman of the Amtrak board of  
directors, said he hopes the next stop for high-speed rail will be 
the Midwest. Amtrak has already announced it will spend $25 million 
to work on a high-speed network linking nine Midwestern states. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar projects are being considered between Charlotte, N.C.,  
and Washington, D.C.; Birmingham, Ala., and Houston; and up the 
Pacific coast. Thompson said Acela should generate the necessary 
congressional support. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as we kick off the Northeast Corridor, Trent Lott is  
going to say, `Why can't I have it in Mississippi?' and Speaker 
Hastert is going to say, `You know, I think it's what's needed in 
Chicago and the Midwest,''' Thompson said, referring to Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott and House Speaker Dennis Hastert.

<HEADLINE> Gore Discounts Poor Poll Numbers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore said Tuesday he isn't  
putting much stock in a poll indicating American voters may be more 
interested in electing Texas Gov. George W. Bush or Elizabeth Dole 
as president than him. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore told CNN's ``Late Edition Primetime'' that his low poll  
numbers don't mean voters have ruled out casting their ballots for 
him, saying the 2000 presidential election would be decided by 
``the power of ideas,'' not by polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Polls are simply predictions of the future, in this case of an  
election that's two years away,'' Gore said. ``And you know the old 
saying that six months is a lifetime in politics. That means there 
are four lifetimes between now and then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore currently is the front-runner for next year's Democratic  
presidential nomination. But a poll of 1,203 adults released last 
month by the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press showed 
45 percent of registered voters surveyed said there was no chance 
they would vote for him. 
</P>
<P>
	In that same poll, more than two-thirds said there was at least  
a chance they would vote for Bush, and nearly that many said they 
could vote for Mrs. Dole, the former American Red Cross chief and 
wife of 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other predictions of the future have been famously wrong  
because they didn't take into account what the reality is,'' Gore 
said. As an example, he cited a decades-old forecast by IBM that 
the worldwide market for computers would be only ``a few dozen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Polls will not determine the (election's) outcome in any way,  
shape or form. Ideas will,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Nicklaus Might Use Cart Upon Return  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Jack Nicklaus was one of several golfers who spoke out against  
the court ruling that allowed Casey Martin to use a cart on the PGA 
Tour and the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that he has had hip replacement surgery, the 60-year-old  
Nicklaus says he might consider using one on the Senior Tour during 
the early stages of his return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never taken a cart on the Senior Tour,'' he said. ``If  
I had to use it ... that's the rules of that game. Do I want to 
take a cart? No. I much prefer to walk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Should he be able to play in his own Memorial Tournament  
(doubtful), the U.S. Open (improbable) or the Senior Open 
(unlikely), Nicklaus would not be able to use a cart and wouldn't 
ask for one. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the Senior Tour is the Senior Tour -- it's not the walking  
tour,'' Nicklaus said. ``It's the walking wounded, that's what it 
is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin found the situation was ``pretty ironic.''  
</P>
<P>
	``However, I hope he uses one,'' Martin told CBS Sportsline. ``I  
would feel really bad if the best player of all time didn't play 
because he testified against me. Swallow your pride and ride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin has a rare circulatory disease in his right leg, making  
it nearly impossible for him to walk 18 holes. Martin said a cart 
would not give Nicklaus an unfair advantage. What it might give 
him, he said, is a new perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want him to play,'' Martin said. ``in the back of my  
mind, I'm chuckling.'' 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	 *NORMAN'S REGRETS: Greg Norman has not seen the changes to  
Augusta National Golf Club, but chances are he won't like them. If 
Norman had his way, the world's renowned courses should remain the 
same as long as championship golf is played there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like to see that because I like to step up on the tee  
and say Gene Sarazen did this or Byron Nelson did this, and feel 
the same piece of nostalgia and history,'' Norman said. ``When you 
change it, you change all that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Norman is not surprised. Even the Blue Monster, where  
he won the Doral Open three times, took on a new look under the 
redesign of Raymond Floyd, and Norman says the great courses in 
Melbourne are always going through some kind of change. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just blows my mind,'' he said. ``I don't like to see that  
stuff happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Nicklaus, who recently built a new fifth hole at Pebble  
Beach Golf Links (the way it originally was routed), agrees that 
players lose a slight sense of history when a course is 
significantly altered. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only trouble is, you have to use the same equipment for it  
to be the same thing,'' Nicklaus said. ``If they could take the 
equipment and allow us to hit a golf ball only so far, then I think 
they shouldn't change a thing. But if you look at the course 
(Augusta) that I shot 64 on in 1965 ... it's not the same golf 
course.''

	 *PLAYER 2000:* Forget the nine major championships, the career  
grand slam or his streak of 42 consecutive British Opens. Gary 
Player is obsessed with winning in the next millennium, which he 
believes would be one of the greatest accomplishments of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Player wants to become the first to win a tour-sanctioned event  
in six decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the only ambition I have in golf and it's a very tall  
order,'' Player said. ``If I can do that, it would a record that 
might never be broken, because you've got to live that long, you've 
got to have nerves, and you've got to be pretty damn lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Player turned professional in 1953 and won his first British  
Open in 1959. He became the third player to win the career Grand 
Slam at age 29 with the 1965 U.S. Open and won the last of his nine 
majors in the 1978 Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with 14 Senior victories in the 1980s, he won the Chile  
Open at age 54. He has won five Senior events in the '90s, 
including the Long Island Classic last year at age 62. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Snead won in five decades -- his first PGA event in 1936, his  
last Senior event in 1973. Snead won the Golf Digest Commemorative 
Pro-Am in 1980, but that wasn't an official Senior event. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty obsessed about this,'' Player said. ``To win in six  
decades would give me great pleasure. It would be the result of 
hard work and looking after your body. I'm going to give it a 
go.''

the Stroke Play Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	What will Dunlap, a 35-year-old graduate of Q-school, be doing  
in Spain? 
</P>
<P>
	Since he couldn't get into several West Coast events, he decided  
to play in South Africa during the winter. Dunlap won the Dimension 
Data and finished second in the South African Open, which was 
enough to finish second on that tour's money list. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's enough to qualify for the $5 million tournament at  
Valderrama, the third of the World Golf Championship events. 
</P>
<P>
	``That'll work,'' Dunlap said. ``Hopefully, that week won't mean  
anything in terms of playing privileges. But if it does, it's nice 
to have it there.''

<HEADLINE> Chinese-American Scientist Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The case of a Chinese-American computer  
scientist who was fired after a three-year espionage investigation 
is part of a broader pattern of security lapses at federal weapons 
labs, the chairman of a key House committee said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was dismissed Monday from his job at  
the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico because of alleged 
security violations. He has not been arrested, nor charged with a 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	While not commenting on the Lee case specifically, Rep.  
Christopher Cox R-Calif., chairman of a select committee 
investigating U.S. military and commercial dealings with China, 
said today the Los Alamos case is part of a broader pattern of 
security problems at the weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Details, including the espionage investigation of Lee, are laid  
out in a yet-to-be-declassified report by his committee, said Cox. 
But he said there was wide disagreement between his panel and the 
White House over how much of the report to make public, with the 
administration wanting to keep large portions classified. 
</P>
<P>
	While some improvements have been made, Cox said in a telephone  
interview, the labs over a period of years ``failed to take even 
minimal steps necessary for counterintelligence.'' He declined to 
discuss the Lee case specifically because it is part of the 
classified 700-page report. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, has been the focus of intense scrutiny by the FBI for  
nearly three years after intelligence agents learned that China 
apparently had obtained top-secret design information in the 1980s 
about nuclear warhead technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Concern among U.S. intelligence officials that China may have  
obtained critical U.S. nuclear warhead technology from Los Alamos 
surfaced in the mid-1990s at a time when the administration was 
seeking improved trade relations with China and pressing Congress 
to certify the Bejing government as no longer helping other nations 
build nuclear bombs. Congress in 1997 gave such certification, but 
might not have if they had known about the alleged espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were concerned that the Chinese are conducting espionage.  
We make no illusions about Chinese behavior,'' Energy Secretary 
Bill Richardson said this morning. As to the ``actual extent of the 
damage, our CIA is assessing that now and is going to determine 
that soon,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We fired him because he had misused security. He had improper  
contact with foreign officials and he had violated a number of 
security measures,'' Richardson said on NBC's ``Today'' show. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, a native of Taiwan who has worked at Los Alamos for a dozen  
years or more with top security clearance. In Los Alamos, a 
telephone belonging to Lee had been disconnected. His whereabouts 
were not known. 
</P>
<P>
	The espionage investigation gained heightened attention in  
recent days after news reports that China was suspected by U.S. 
intelligence officials of having made a major leap forward in 
nuclear missile technology in the early 1990s, in part because of 
information gotten from secrets allegedly stolen from Los Alamos. 
</P>
<P>
	China reiterated denials that it stole U.S. nuclear know-how.  
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said today in Beijing that 
such allegations demonstrate that ``some people'' want to hamper 
improvements in U.S-China ties and disrupt ``the normal export by 
the U.S. of some high-tech products to China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	News media and others have ``disseminated many rumors about  
China's stealing of U.S. technology,'' Zhu charged. ``All these are 
unfounded and with ulterior motives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican congressional leaders over the weekend promised  
hearings on why the Clinton administration was not more quickly off 
the mark in pursuing the espionage when it first surfaced in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., lashed out at the  
administration for lax security, especially involving Chinese 
attempts to get military secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	And Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said his Intelligence Committee  
planned hearings on the Los Alamos espionage investigation. ``We've 
been prodding the administration to do more to tighten up security 
... but they waited a long time,'' Shelby complained. 
</P>
<P>
	Although, Lee has been the leading target of the FBI probe for  
nearly three years, only in recent months was he shifted to a less 
sensitive job, and the government made no move to lift his security 
clearance until even more recently, officials acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson defended the delay in dismissing the employee. ``He  
was investigated. He was questioned. But I had to get the green 
light from the FBI on when to terminate him. We needed to keep him 
on to develop a case,'' Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know the extent of the damage from these thefts. They  
were serious,'' Richardson said. But, he said, ``We have taken some 
very, very strong measures so this is not going to happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a briefing Monday by the FBI, Richardson told managers at  
Los Alamos that the scientist should be fired. A letter of 
dismissal was sent within hours, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese-American scientist was fired for ``failing to  
properly safeguard classified material,'' having contact with 
people ``from a sensitive country'' and ``apparently attempting to 
deceive (the) laboratory about security-related issues,'' an Energy 
Department statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though his name had never been mentioned, Lee has been at the  
center of the FBI investigation since early 1996, according to 
published reports. The investigation was prompted by concerns among 
U.S. intelligence agents in 1995 that top-secret nuclear weapons 
design material was given to China in the mid-1980s that helped 
them build miniaturized warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	Such technology, developed at Los Alamos, allows production of  
small warheads that can be launched from a single missile at 
multiple targets -- a key component of a nuclear arsenal. By the 
mid-1990s, China had built and tested such warheads and U.S. 
officials were puzzled by the rapid technological leap. In 1995, 
U.S. intelligence officials uncovered a Chinese document, written 
in 1988, that indicated the Chinese knew design information about 
the U.S. W-88 miniature warhead.

<HEADLINE> Umpires Will Call High Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Todd Hollandsworth could not believe  
what he saw. Or heard. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, Kent Mercker's fastball cut across Hollandsworth's  
chest. But instead of keeping silent, umpire Bruce Froemming 
shouted ``Strike!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hollandsworth slowly leaned over the plate, shaking his head. He  
walked out of the batter's box and stayed out for several seconds, 
still incredulous. 
</P>
<P>
	In just his first at-bat of spring training, the Los Angeles  
outfielder learned last week that baseball is serious: High strikes 
will be the rule in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think that pitch was a little up,'' Hollandsworth said  
later. ``But I guess that's the change they're making, right 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Mercker seemed surprised.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was kind of like, `wow, I see where he's calling it,'' the  
St. Louis pitcher said. ``I mean, that's a pitch that if he calls 
it a ball, I wouldn't complain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, umpires rarely called any pitch above the belt  
a strike. But a memo sent by the commissioner Bud Selig's office 
told teams that from now on ``the upper limit of the strike zone 
will extend two inches above the top of the uniform pants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that's how the umps are calling it so far.  
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Knoblauch saw that firsthand. Before the New York Yankees'  
exhibition opener, the players were briefed on the new strike zone 
by longtime AL umpire Jim McKean. 
</P>
<P>
	But that didn't help Knoblauch. He argued with Eric Cooper after  
being called out on strikes on a high pitch for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will try to call them the way they want me to,'' said  
29-year veteran Bruce Froemming, who rung up Hollandsworth. ``But 
you've got 68 umpires, and you can't clone 68 umpires,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran AL umpire Greg Kosc hopes his colleagues don't get  
caught in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to try, I really am,'' he said. ``But I've been  
calling the same pitch for years, and it's not easy to change 
overnight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe you call it on strike one or maybe strike two,'' he  
said. ``But am I going to call strike three on Cal Ripken or Mo 
Vaughn or Albert Belle or Bernie Williams or Paul O'Neill just to 
prove a point? And if I do, am I going to get backing?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, the biggest disputes about the strike zone in past  
years involve width, most notably Eric Gregg's ample plate when 
Livan Hernandez struck out 15 in a 1997 NLCS game. 
</P>
<P>
	Batters feel that pitchers get too many outside calls on  
unhittable pitches. Baseball hopes that more high strikes -- still 
hittable -- will also lead to fewer wide ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a change that will be good for the game,''  
Montreal general manager Jim Beattie said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody should go with it and accept that's the way  
it's going to be and not fight it,'' he said. ``Just go with it and 
move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre agrees.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've noticed a difference. I don't object to it at all,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, it might take time for all sides to see it the same  
way. Several years ago, there was a crackdown on balks during 
spring training -- the totals went crazy -- and it took pitchers and 
umpires a month or so to adapt. 
</P>
<P>
	NL president Len Coleman and AL president Gene Budig sent a  
short note to the umpires, informing the umpires what the 
commissioner's office wanted with strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, umpires have been asked to adjust,'' Coleman said.  
``But I look at the quality of my National League umpires. They'll 
be able to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires, however, were upset that baseball did not consult with  
them before ordering the new policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have had discussions with Bud Selig,'' umpires' union chief  
Richie Phillips said. ``Bud has asked me to handle the matter 
directly with him and see if we can resolve our problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the official rules, the strike zone goes from ``a  
horizontal line at the midpoint between the top of the shoulders 
and the top of the uniform pants'' to ``a line at the hollow 
beneath the kneecap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Expos pitcher Carl Pavano said he might be tempted to ``start  
climbing up'' in certain situations, and Yankees ace David Cone 
predicted higher strikes would help power pitchers such as new 
teammate Roger Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	But Oakland manager Art Howe is not going to alter his  
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new zone isn't going to change how we tell our younger  
pitchers to throw,'' he said. ``You want to keep the ball down in 
the zone and not start it rising up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because if you do, hitters are going to hit it,'' he said. ``I  
have a saying: `You want all pitches to live in the hollow.'''

<HEADLINE>  Duke's Coach K Named Best in ACC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Mike Krzyzewski hobbled through the Atlantic  
Coast Conference season with a painful hip injury. No. 1 Duke 
certainly didn't limp along behind its leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran coach, who led the Blue Devils to a 32-1 record, and  
the ACC regular-season and tournament titles in smashing fashion, 
was rewarded Tuesday by being named the ACC Coach of the Year by 
The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski was the runaway winner of the award voted on by  
members of the Atlantic Coast Sports Writers Association, receiving 
77 of a possible 95 votes. Pete Gillen of Virginia was second with 
10 votes, while Gary Williams of Maryland got six. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think whenever a player or coach gets these awards it's a  
reflection of a belief that your team has had and their 
performance,'' Krzyzewski said. ``In particular for me this year, 
it's a reflection of my staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski also won the award in 1984, 1986 and 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	Duke began the season as the nation's No. 1 team, but not  
without questions revolving around team chemistry, the loss of team 
leader Steve Wojciechowski, and the play of new point guard William 
Avery. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, the Blue Devils were still a young team, starting a  
senior, a junior and three sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
	After an early-season loss to Cincinnati that dropped the Blue  
Devils from the top of the rankings, Duke reeled off 27 straight 
victories and head into this week's NCAA tournament as the No. 1 
seed. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke's 16-0 regular-season run through the ACC by an average  
margin of 24.3 points were both records, and the team's ACC tourney 
title capped the league's first ever 19-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are a great team, and everybody is always telling them  
that -- it's so well documented -- yet they handled the continual 
praise, almost the angelic status they are given, with tremendous 
maturity,'' N.C. State coach Herb Sendek said of Krzyzewski's team. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski's mobility in practice and on the bench was limited  
this season. The 52-year-old coach will have hip replacement 
surgery in early April. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski, 537-213 in 24 years at Army and Duke, said he leaned  
on assistants Quin Snyder, Johnny Dawkins and David Henderson, all 
former Duke players, more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have really depended on this staff more than I've depended  
on a staff my entire career,'' Krzyzewski said. ``I hope they get a 
sense of real satisfaction of having known they are responsible for 
(this award).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski singled out Snyder in particular, calling him a true  
associate head coach who at times ran practice while the head coach 
was ailing. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of it has to do with the physical aspects of what I'm  
going through, but also just age and the gap between you and the 
player's age,'' Krzyzewski said of his assistant's roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although I think I communicate well with my players, it is  
nice to have other great communicators on the staff. They may be 
able to get the points across that I may not be able to get across 
to my team. These guys have been able to do that. They have just 
been a huge factor for us.''

members of the Atlantic Coast Sports Writers Association, receiving 
77 of a possible 95 votes. Pete Gillen of Virginia was second with 
10 votes, while Gary Williams of Maryland got six. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think whenever a player or coach gets these awards it's a  
reflection of a belief that your team has had and their 
performance,'' Krzyzewski said. ``In particular for me this year, 
it's a reflection of my staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski also won the award in 1984, 1986 and 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	Duke began the season as the nation's No. 1 team, but not  
without questions revolving around team chemistry, the loss of team 
leader Steve Wojciechowski, and the play of new point guard William 
Avery. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, the Blue Devils were still a young team, starting a  
senior, a junior and three sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
	After an early-season loss to Cincinnati that dropped the Blue  
Devils from the top of the rankings, Duke reeled off 27 straight 
victories and head into this week's NCAA tournament as the No. 1 
seed. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke's 16-0 regular-season run through the ACC by an average  
margin of 24.3 points were both records, and the team's ACC tourney 
title capped the league's first ever 19-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are a great team, and everybody is always telling them  
that -- it's so well documented -- yet they handled the continual 
praise, almost the angelic status they are given, with tremendous 
maturity,'' N.C. State coach Herb Sendek said of Krzyzewski's team. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski's mobility in practice and on the bench was limited  
this season. The 52-year-old coach will have hip replacement 
surgery in early April. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski, 537-213 in 24 years at Army and Duke, said he leaned  
on assistants Quin Snyder, Johnny Dawkins and David Henderson, all 
former Duke players, more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have really depended on this staff more than I've depended  
on a staff my entire career,'' Krzyzewski said. ``I hope they get a 
sense of real satisfaction of having known they are responsible for 
(this award).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski singled out Snyder in particular, calling him a true  
associate head coach who at times ran practice while the head coach 
was ailing. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of it has to do with the physical aspects of what I'm  
going through, but also just age and the gap between you and the 
player's age,'' Krzyzewski said of his assistant's roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although I think I communicate well with my players, it is  
nice to have other great communicators on the staff. They may be 
able to get the points across that I may not be able to get across 
to my team. These guys have been able to do that. They have just 
been a huge factor for us.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Group Picks New Chief of Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a political facelift, the Republican  
National Committee has chosen the Oklahoma secretary of state to be 
its new chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Cole, top adviser to Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating and also  
the secretary of state, was picked by GOP chairman Jim Nicholson to 
run the day-to-day operations of the committee. Cole will take over 
at the committee next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Cole is no stranger to Washington or national politics. He  
served as executive director of the National Republican 
Congressional Committee in the early 1990s. He also was a state 
senator in his native state, a Fulbright scholar, and served for 
four years in the 1980s as Oklahoma's Republican chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tom's experience is very broad,'' said former Republican  
National Committee chairman Haley Barbour. Citing Cole's experience 
as a pollster for political campaigns and his work for the NRCC, 
Barbour said: ``He's the total package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cole's addition to the RNC staff comes after the party's  
disastrous showing in the 1998 congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``It indicates that the RNC is being reminded why they are in  
business, which is to win elections,'' said Rich Galen, executive 
director of GOPAC, a Republican political action committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has both campaign experience and Washington experience,''  
Galen said. ``I think he's exactly the right person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cole said that despite the disappointments of 1998, the party  
still has the potential to do very well in the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the RNC is a little like a beaten-down stock,'' said  
Cole. ``And I think it's going to move up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cole also hopes to refocus the party's attention to political  
fights outside of the Beltway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I can bring an emphasis not just on Washington, but  
outside of Washington, in the states and local elections,'' Cole 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cole has raised eyebrows in political circles for maintaining  
his lucrative political consulting firm while working in a top 
political appointee position. Cole says he plans to continue with 
the same arrangement at the RNC. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to do what I did for existing clients'' as  
secretary of state, said Cole. ``But I will not be soliciting any 
new business or working on any new campaigns.''

<HEADLINE> Mount Airy, N.C. Is Granite Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT AIRY, N.C. (AP) -- Visitors don't just come to Mount Airy  
for the ``Andy Griffith Show'' ambiance or the pork chop sandwiches 
from the Snappy Lunch. For some, the lure is the speckled white 
granite. 
</P>
<P>
	They pore over rock samples and tour the world's largest  
open-face granite quarry, operated by North Carolina Granite Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Mount Airy was ``The Granite City'' long before it became famous  
as Griffith's hometown and the inspiration for the fictional 
Mayberry. 
</P>
<P>
	N.C. Granite's rock, a gleaming white speckled with black,  
adorns a temple in Bangkok, the 82-story Amoco building in Chicago, 
Denver International Airport, Centennial Park in Atlanta, the 
Wright Brothers Memorial in Kill Devil Hills, N.C., and the gold 
depository at Fort Knox, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want something really white they'll come to us,'' said  
Eddie Corder, vice president of N. C. Granite. 
</P>
<P>
	The granite, which is impervious to salt, sand and extreme  
temperatures, also is used in constructing street curbs in some 
cities, including New York and Buffalo, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people who have never been to Mount Airy probably have  
stepped on or touched a piece of it. It's everywhere in Washington, 
D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can walk from the Kennedy Center across the (Arlington  
Memorial) bridge to Arlington (Va.) and never get off Mount Airy 
granite,'' Corder said. 
</P>
<P>
	Corder spots his product in curbs and buildings whenever he  
travels. ``In New Orleans, we passed by mausoleums ... . It was all 
Mount Airy granite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several Mount Airy buildings, including the post office and a  
bank, are made of hometown granite. 
</P>
<P>
	The 110-year-old quarry was the town's first major attraction.  
People used to picnic on the white oyster-shaped rock where no 
crops would grow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hate to think we were nothing or nobody until Andy  
Griffith came along in the 1950s,'' said Barbara Summerlin, interim 
director of the Mount Airy Museum of Regional History. 
</P>
<P>
	Mount Airy, a community of 7,200 just 10 miles from the Virginia  
line, relishes its ties to the television town of Mayberry. 
Visitors can stroll along Main Street and stop by Floyd's 
Barbershop or the Snappy Lunch, two Mount Airy businesses mentioned 
on the TV show. 
</P>
<P>
	While the town's connection to television is limited to  
black-and-white reruns, Mount Airy's granite business continues to 
thrive. 
</P>
<P>
	The granite deposit at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountain chain  
is 7 miles long, 4 miles wide and 6,000 to 8,000 feet deep. It 
covers 300 acres, but only about 5 percent of the deposit is being 
quarried. 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent winter day, about five workers were hammering and  
drilling into the vast white rock to remove one 20-ton block -- 
measuring 10 feet long, 5 feet high and 4 feet wide -- at a time. 
Nothing goes to waste: Leftover pieces are crushed and sold as 
landscaping stone or gravel for highway shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	Each day, about 40 to 50 blocks are quarried -- with one raw-cut  
block selling for $3,000. Additional customized cutting on the same 
block may drive the price as high as $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In a year, when more than 11,000 blocks with a value of $33  
million are removed, only an average layer of one foot is stripped 
away across the massive quarry. 
</P>
<P>
	If the quarrying continues at the present rate, the deposit  
should last another 200 to 300 years, industry experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	The chalky white stone, which workers and visitors can drive  
across, was formed about 225 million years ago when feldspar and 
quartz heated and cooled slowly under pressure as the Blue Ridge 
Mountains developed. 
</P>
<P>
	Local legend has it that the granite rock first changed hands  
for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	According to city archives, a farmer who bought land in 1872  
that included the deposit realized 40 acres of it was bare rock. 
The seller ended up deducting the price of the ``worthless rock'' 
from the whole tract. 
</P>
<P>
	Builder Thomas Woodruff bought the acreage in 1889 and started a  
quarry business. He used the stone to build railroad stations 
between Greensboro and Mount Airy. 
</P>
<P>
	The name changed from Thomas Woodruff &AMP; Sons to North Carolina  
Granite Corp. in 1904. The company, which employs about 200 
workers, remains privately held today by a small group of 
investors. Sales and earnings figures are not released. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, the company has cultivated clients in Europe,  
Malaysia, Taiwan, Japan, China and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	It also has worked jointly for the past 50 years with the  
family-run Cleveland (Ohio) Marble Mosaic Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland Marble recently refurbished the previously marble  
Department of Labor building in Trenton, N.J., with Mount Airy 
granite, which costs about the same as marble but last longer 
because it's harder. 
</P>
<P>
	``We used North Carolina granite, which they love and will last  
until they are all gone,'' said Robert Zavagno Jr., a vice 
president at Cleveland Marble.

<HEADLINE> Movie Previews Get Volume Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- It's not your imagination. Many movie trailers  
-- previews of coming attractions shown before feature films -- are 
too noisy. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Hollywood is doing something about it.  
</P>
<P>
	Volume for the movie trailers now must be set at the same level  
as the feature, industry representatives announced Tuesday at the 
ShoWest theater operator convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Long a major source of complaints, trailers are usually so loud  
that projectionists have to turn down the volume. The problems come 
when projectionists forget to turn the volume back up for the 
feature, making it too quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Ioan Allen of Dolby Laboratories, who worked on the new  
standards, said that 40 percent of trailers in the last two years 
were too loud. 
</P>
<P>
	The quieter trailers should be running by the end of the year,  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Killer Teen Suspect Called Psychotic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ERIE, Pa. (AP) -- A 15-year-old boy charged with killing a  
teacher at a school dance is psychotic, paranoid and delusional and 
cannot be treated effectively in an adult prison, a defense 
psychiatrist testified today. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Wurst is charged with killing science teacher John  
Gillette at a middle school graduation dance in Edinboro last 
April, when he was 14. It was one of a series of school-related 
shootings that shocked the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing opened today in Erie County Court on whether Wurst  
should be classified as a juvenile. If that happens, he could be 
free at age 21. Wurst is now considered to be an adult and could 
face life in prison if convicted in an adult court. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Robert Sadoff, who was hired by Wurst's attorneys, said  
Wurst needs the kind of treatment he can get in a juvenile jail and 
predicted that Wurst will not be cared for among adults in a state 
prison. He said people with mental illnesses like Wurst's have 
prospects for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Locking him up doesn't do that,'' Sadoff said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said Wurst is convinced that he is the only real person in an  
unreal world, so he laughs off the seriousness of the murder charge 
against him. Television cameras recorded the handcuffed Wurst 
laughing in the back of a police car shortly after his arrest, 
angering some residents of Edinboro. 
</P>
<P>
	Sadoff said Wurst exhibits symptoms of schizophrenia but cannot  
be diagnosed as having the disease. Psychiatric guidelines reserve 
schizophrenia for people 18 and older, Sadoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wurst is also charged with wounding two students and threatening  
to kill his school principal. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pennsylvania, juveniles accused of murder are always charged  
first as adults. A judge decides later whether the case can be 
moved to juvenile court. 
</P>
<P>
	Wurst is accused of using his father's handgun to shoot Gillette  
in the back and head. He told a psychiatrist that he was 
embarrassed earlier that evening when Gillette gave him a door 
prize at the dance. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted as an adult, he faces life in prison without  
parole. If convicted as a juvenile, he would automatically be 
released when he turns 21. Because Wurst is under 16, state law 
prohibits prosecutors from seeking the death penalty, even if he 
stands trial as an adult.

</P>
<P>
	ENGLEWOOD, N.J. (AP) -- Ann Corio, the queen of burlesque who  
kept the tradition alive into the age of X-rated movies, died March 
1. She was believed to be in her 80's. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the last to practice the art of striptease as a put-on,  
Ms. Corio said her shows emphasized comedy and didn't contain full 
nudity. 
</P>
<P>
	Her two decade run of ``This Was Burlesque,'' a musical satire  
based on Ms. Corio's recollections, began off Broadway in 1962. 
Over the years, Ms. Corio served as author, director and star. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1980's, the show moved to the Playhouse Mall in Paramus,  
where it was eventually filmed by HBO for cable television. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Corio, who retired from show business about eight years ago,  
was always proud of the burlesque tradition. She said her shows 
were entertainment the whole family could watch. 
</P>
<P>
	As she once put it, ``We do nothing you wouldn't write home  
about to your aunt in East Cupcake, Ohio.''

                           *Joe DiMaggio    	
</P>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- Joe DiMaggio, who captivated the nation  
as the elegant star of the marquee New York Yankees during 
baseball's golden era, died Monday after a five-month battle with 
lung cancer. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was forever the Yankee Clipper, who amazed America with  
The Streak and married Marilyn Monroe. He roamed center field and 
ran the basepaths for the Yankees for 13 seasons, from 1936 through 
1951, with three years off for military service in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio played for 10 pennant winners and nine World Series  
champions. He batted .325 lifetime, with 361 home runs. He won 
three American League Most Valuable Player awards, appeared in 11 
All-Star games, and entered the Hall of Fame in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the numbers don't account fully for his place on the  
American cultural landscape, the reason Ernest Hemingway wrote 
about him and Simon and Garfunkel sang about him. 
</P>
<P>
	For all his exploits, DiMaggio displayed perhaps his most magic  
in the summer of '41, when he had at least one hit in 56 
consecutive games, one of baseball's most enduring records. The 
streak riveted a country fresh from the Depression and elevated 
DiMaggio from baseball star to national celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
	He ascended to the top rank of popular culture in 1954 when he  
wed Monroe, a storybook marriage that lasted less than a year. For 
years after she died in 1962, DiMaggio sent roses to her grave but 
refused to talk about her. 
</P>
<P>
	Long after retiring as a player, DiMaggio served briefly as a  
vice president and coach for the Oakland A's, and as a member of 
the board of directors of the Baltimore Orioles.

<P>
	RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AP) -- Donald Goodenow, managing editor of  
the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner who steered the newspaper through a 
decade of employee strikes, died of a heart attack Thursday. He was 
78. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodenow started his newspaper career as a copy boy at the Los  
Angeles Examiner in 1942. He quickly moved his way up, working on 
the copy desk, as photo editor and Sunday editor. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1962 the Examiner merged with the afternoon Herald Express,  
creating one of the largest afternoon newspapers in the United 
States. Goodenow was named managing editor, then the top editorial 
job at the newly formed Herald-Examiner. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1967, the American Newspaper Guild began a strike which would  
last 10 years. Goodenow became assistant to the publisher in 1978 
and held that position until his retirement in 1982. 
</P>

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Let's Make A Deal'' gameshow co-creator  
Stefan Hatos, a longtime radio and television writer and producer, 
died of a heart ailment March 2. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatos began his career at age 19 behind the microphones of  
Detroit stations WJLB and WXYZ. While doing announcing work, he 
wrote episodes of ``The Lone Ranger'' and ``The Green Hornet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatos then moved to New York where he wrote episodes of Orson  
Welles' Mercury Theater and ``Inner Sanctum.'' He worked for CBS 
until World War II when he was commissioned in the Navy in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
	After the war, he returned to CBS Radio in New York and Chicago.  
He also directed ``Lucky Strike Hit Parade'' for NBC Radio and 
produced ``Ladies Be Seated'' for ABC Radio. 
</P>
<P>
	He won a Peabody Award for the ABC-TV show, ``The Adventures of  
Uncle Mistletoe.'' Hatos probably was best known for the gameshow 
``Let's Make A Deal,'' with host Monty Hall. It debuted in 1963 and 
ran for 16 years in daytime and 10 years in primetime on NBC and 
ABC. 
</P>

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Carl A. Kroch, who earned the nickname ``Baron of  
Books'' as head of the Kroch's &AMP; Brentano's bookstore chain, died 
Saturday. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Kroch's Austrian-born father set up his first shop in 1907 in  
Chicago as a German-language book store. After merging with the 
Brentano's bookstore in Chicago, the chain eventually grew to 19 
area stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Kroch anticipated several trends in bookselling, including  
opening outlets in suburban malls and returning unsold books to 
publishers for credit. 
</P>
<P>
	But one practice Kroch refused to allow was to offer deep  
discounts. That decision would partly lead to the demise of Kroch's 
&AMP; Brentano's as large discount chains took over the bookselling 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the company closed its last stores.

<P>
	Ms. McLaughlin was driving home from court Jan. 8 when she lost

</P>
<P>
	She was presiding over the first hearing at the new Ronald  
Reagan Federal Building in Santa Ana during the week of the

</P>
<P>
	She was appointed to the Municipal Court in Orange County in  
1980 by then-Gov. Edmund G. ``Jerry'' Brown Jr. She was elevated to

<HEADLINE> Catfish Hunter in Battle for Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A boy scampers up the stadium steps, paper  
and pen in outstretched hands, toward George Steinbrenner's box at 
Legends Field where Catfish Hunter and his wife sit alone an hour 
before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Hunter,'' the boy asks, eagerly holding up his pad.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry,'' Catfish says, a penetrating sorrow in his blue  
eyes. ``I can't sign anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lou Gehrig's disease is breaking down Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter's  
body, muscle by muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	He can still use his right arm, once the best in baseball, to  
guide the razor in his left hand when he shaves. Soon, he knows, he 
may not be able to do that. And he can still get around his beloved 
farm in a pickup truck, thanks to power steering and a long oak 
lever a neighbor made to start the ignition. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has to rely more and more on Helen, his sweetheart since  
high school and wife of 32 years. She helps him so much already, 
cutting up food, buttoning buttons, tucking in his shirttail, tying 
his shoes. His flaccid arms dangle limply. His hands are soft and 
puffy, no longer the strong hands of a pitcher or farmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always used to get up early and leave her in bed. Now I've  
got to wait until she gets up to get me dressed,'' says Hunter, who 
owns 1,000 acres of rich farmland and dense woods in his native 
Hertford, N.C. ``I'm puttin' a lot of work on her, and she's been 
strong. But once in a while we sit there and cry together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He gave himself insulin shots three times a day for diabetes  
since 1978, never complained about it. That's Helen's job now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell when she's mad at me,'' he said, joking. ``She  
twists the needle the wrong way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His smile briefly relieves the sadness in an intimate  
conversation away from the autograph seekers, reporters and cameras 
that encircled him last week when he arrived at New York Yankees 
camp. In this empty room behind home plate, he was dressed casually 
in a knit shirt and blue jeans and shared his worries about 
helplessness, about what it means to cede independence, to lose 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter is one of 30,000 Americans with Lou Gehrig's disease,  
also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS. Garbled 
instructions to brain cells from a perfectly normal gene appear to 
trigger an attack on nerves in the spinal cord and brain that 
control muscle movement. So far, the result is unstoppable: 
progressive paralysis leading to death. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll find a cure someday, and I just hope I'm still here  
when they find it,'' says Hunter, who turns 53 on April 8. A moment 
later his eyes brim with tears as he speaks of his children, Todd, 
28, Kim, 25, Paul, 18, and a 3-year-old grandson, Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to see them grow up,'' he says, his strong, gravelly  
voice cracking. 
</P>
<P>
	Control, control, control ... that was Hunter's mantra in a  
15-year Hall of Fame pitching career with the Kansas City and 
Oakland Athletics and Yankees through 1979. He could crank up a 90 
mph heater once in a while, but mostly he painted the plate 
artistically, throwing sliders and curves and fastballs that 
shifted gears to keep the batter guessing. 
</P>
<P>
	He pitched a perfect game in 1968, won 224 games in his career,  
and collected five World Series rings. Twenty-five years ago, after 
the end of his Cy Young season in 1974, he won an arbitration 
ruling against Oakland owner Charles O. Finley, left the Athletics 
and ushered in the era of big money for free agents by signing a 
five-year, $3 million deal with the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would trade all of that for good health,'' Hunter says.  
``I'd be a groundskeeper and not let anybody know me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter sat in the Yankees dugout a few days ago with two of his  
high-priced pitching descendants, Roger Clemens and David Cone, 
showing them how he placed his fingers on his slider and two-seam 
fastball. They watched with all the respect in the world for what 
he had accomplished in the game and done for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``He paved the way for me,'' says Clemens, who will earn $16.1  
million over the next two years. ``I watched him as a kid and 
didn't appreciate the type of pinpoint control he had. It's great 
to get a chance to talk to him. But it hurts to know he's 
suffering. This disease is very real. It makes you ponder what the 
future might hold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are lessons of the game and lessons of the farm, and a  
lifetime split between them has given Hunter an abiding strength 
and philosophy. From baseball, Hunter has learned to filter out 
distractions and worries, to focus on the moment. From raising 
cotton, peanuts, corn and soybeans, he has learned to cope with the 
vagaries of the weather and the markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter is, as he describes himself, ``uncomplicated, country  
born and raised, given to saying 'rivah' for river, 'dat' for that 
and droppin' the 'g' from just about everythin' I say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one-on-one when you're a pitcher,'' he says. ``It's just  
the hitter and you. I'm not worried about the guy on first or 
third, just the hitter. If you get the hitter out, you're gonna get 
the other guys out and you're gonna have a chance. A lot of people 
worry too much about different parts of the game, or different 
parts of the disease. You should take it one day at a time and go 
from there. 
</P>
<P>
	``A farmer is the biggest gambler in the world. Everythin' he  
does is a gamble. You don't know if he's gonna get his crop up, you 
don't know at harvest time if he's gonna get the right prices for 
anythin'. He's got to depend on everybody else. I've got to hope 
the doctors can prolong this thing until they find a cure. I just 
sit back and wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He jokes that now he's like former teammate Ron Guidry, ``a  
farmer who doesn't do too much hard labor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although most ALS patients die within five years, some live with  
it for decades. Cambridge physicist Stephen Hawking, a genius 
trapped in a feeble body, has had the disease for 30 years. He 
speaks by touching a computer screen that translates his words 
through an electronic synthesizer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter knows he may be just at the beginning of a long ordeal a  
year after the first symptoms appeared while he was out duck 
hunting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't lift my shotgun with my right hand,'' Hunter says.  
``It was a little bit cool that day, and I thought there was 
somethin' wrong with me that would go away. But it just kept 
gettin' worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was kinda hoping it was a tick bite. I'm always around dogs  
and stuff. Three or four doctors sent my blood off to check for a 
tick bite, but it always come back negative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter started going to doctors last March, traveling to  
Norfolk, Va., and Duke and Johns Hopkins medical centers. It wasn't 
until September that he was diagnosed with ALS. He had seen ``Pride 
of the Yankees'' and knew all about Lou Gehrig and his tragic death 
at 37 in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor's words took Hunter's breath away.  
</P>
<P>
	``Right then,'' the voluble Hunter says, ``I couldn't even  
talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter retreated with his family and friends, emerging only last  
week to accept an invitation to visit the Yankees in spring 
training. He's heard by letter or telephone from virtually everyone 
he played with and some he didn't, including Henry Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no way to cut out ALS in surgery, no magic medicine that  
will make it vanish. At least not yet. Drugs and physical therapy 
might slow it down, and Hunter is counting on that and prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard on us and the whole family, but we all just have to  
be strong,'' Helen Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	He gets new ``cures'' in the stacks of mail that arrive every  
day from around the world, but nothing his doctors are convinced 
will work. They've talked to him about a couple of promising drugs, 
including one that is injected directly into the spine. 
</P>
<P>
	He does what he can to take care of himself with health foods  
and a low-fat, low-sugar diet that he's been on for years to deal 
with diabetes. His own cookbook favorites: Seventh Game Black Bean 
Soup, Pennant Fever Pasta, Catfish Sole, and Pitcher's Mound Pie 
(apple pie with a crunchy whole wheat crust). 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter's legs and lungs are still strong enough to allow him to  
find tranquility in the familiar woods around the clear streams of 
Perquimans County, N.C., where he has fished and hunted since his 
boyhood. He was just Jim or Jimmy then, a boy who learned to pitch 
by throwing to his brothers from a mound by their daddy's 
smokehouse. The Catfish part of his name came later, courtesy of 
publicity-minded Finley, who wanted his new pitcher to have a 
homespun image. Around Hertford, 60 miles southeast of Norfolk, 
he's still just Jimmy. 
</P>
<P>
	When Hunter goes hunting now, for the exercise and the pleasure  
of being with friends, he leaves his gun behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took a gun last year the first day, and I was standin' on  
top of my truck because you've got to be a certain height off the 
ground,'' he says. ``My dogs barked and I dropped my rifle. I got 
down, picked it up, unloaded it, and didn't take a gun anymore. I 
just took my dogs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The beautiful hunting hounds he bred are another part of a life  
that's disappearing. He used to keep about 40 dogs in two kennels 
on the farm but started giving them away this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've given away all my dogs but eight,'' he says. ``I'm tryin'  
to find good homes for them. I never sold a dog, because I know if 
you give them away you give them a good home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had names for every one of them. I named some after  
ballplayers, and they turned out just like the ballplayer. I had 
two named after Jim Nash, who I started in the big leagues with. 
The dogs were big, just like Jim Nash. I called one of 'em Big Jim, 
and one of 'em Nash. Both those two were good dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I named some of 'em after ballplayers who weren't that  
good. But I better not say who those were.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter played with some of the best of his era -- Reggie Jackson,  
Thurman Munson, Lou Piniella in New York; Jackson, Rollie Fingers, 
Sal Bando, Joe Rudi in Oakland. Hunter's gifts, perhaps more 
valuable than his control on the mound, were a competitive streak 
that made those around him better and a fun-loving nature that 
brought sometimes-battling teammates together. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought I'd be 50 years old,'' Hunter says, thinking  
back on those days of pranks and parties. ``I thought I'd die 
before then. Because ballplayers when I played ball loved to have a 
good time, go out together. I loved it. I think the guys today 
don't have as much fun as we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Yankees honored him with a special day after his  
induction into the Hall of Fame in 1987, the club gave him a 
Cartier tray inscribed with his name and the tribute that he 
``taught a new generation of Yankees how to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner always claimed the $3 million he gave Hunter was  
the best money he ever spent. Hunter was ``the rock,'' Steinbrenner 
said, on which the Yankees built all their future championships. 
</P>
<P>
	In that way, Hunter was very much like Gehrig, possessed of  
innate leadership and an inner strength that will surely be tested 
by a relentless and unforgiving disease.

<HEADLINE> Fluor Plans To Cut 5,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVINE, Calif. (AP) -- Fluor Corp. will eliminate 5,000 jobs and  
combine the company's diverse operations into four business groups 
in a strategy to offset shrinking demand in Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	The cutbacks are expected to save the international engineering  
and construction giant company about $160 million a year. Fluor 
will take a $130 million charge in its second quarter to cover the 
costs of the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials blamed recent declines in earnings on the  
recession in Asia and Latin America, where clients have been unable 
to buy Fluor's services. 
</P>
<P>
	Fluor's coal operations also have suffered as a relatively mild  
winter and cutbacks in U.S. steel production have reduced demand, 
the company said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip J. Carroll Jr., Fluor's chairman and chief executive,  
told shareholders gathered for the company's annual meeting that 
the restructuring would boost the return on operation assets from 9 
percent during 1998 to more than 13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The job cuts all will come within Fluor Daniel, the company's  
global construction and engineering business. 
</P>
<P>
	Fluor reported last month that its net income fell 6.8 percent  
to $51 million during the first quarter, a penny below analysts' 
forecasts. At the time, the company said some customers had 
postponed plans for new contracts. Awards for new engineering and 
construction fell to $11 billion from $12.6 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, Fluor will be divided into four business groups  
focusing on engineering and construction, coal mining, global 
services and in-house administrative services. 
</P>
<P>
	The global services group provides consulting services and heavy  
industrial and construction equipment to clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Fluor's stock fell $1.75 to $34.31 1/4 in trading Tuesday on the  
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio Remembered As True Hero </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Players and fans stood in silence, staring at  
the videoboard in center field before bowing their heads in tribute 
to Joe DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	The game went on at Legends Field, but not before the New York  
Yankees paused to remember the man many considered to be the 
quintessential American hero. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, three times the American League's most valuable  
player, died Monday at his South Florida home. In 13 seasons, he 
played for 10 pennant winners and nine World Series champions with 
the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``This son of Italian immigrants gave every American something  
to believe in,'' President Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He became the very symbol of American grace, power and skill.  
... I have no doubt that when future generations look back at the 
best of America in the 20th century, they will think of the Yankee 
Clipper and all that he achieved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans stopped by Legends Field to pay their respects during the  
day. Some left bouquets of flowers and then returned for a spring 
training game against the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, the Yankees played a 90-second highlight film  
of DiMaggio and observed a moment of silence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe DiMaggio is baseball. He's a national hero,'' said Sandra  
De Santis, a Highland Park, N.J., mother, whose 11-year-old son 
Gregory placed a bouquet is front of the plaque that reads: 
</P>
<P>
	``From 1936-51, Joe led the Yankees through their most  
dominating era. His excellence on the field propelled the Bombers 
to 10 World Series and his graceful stroke was one of baseball's 
greatest pleasures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Current team members remembered him as a legend held in such  
high regard that few of them would approach him during his 
occasional visits to Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	No one wanted to infringe on his privacy. But some players, like  
pitcher David Cone, had memorable encounters with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I met him a few times,'' the right-hander said. ``He told me  
that he'd seen me pitch and sometimes I looked unhittable and 
sometimes I looked hittable. I didn't know how to take that. But 
just the fact he knew who I was was enough for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Catcher Joe Girardi talked about what a thrill it was to have  
his picture taken with DiMaggio when he threw out the first pitch 
during a playoff game in 1996. Darryl Strawberry predicted no one 
will ever hit safely in 56 straight game again, while Derek Jeter 
described DiMaggio as ``everything a ballplayer would want to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To those who knew him and to those who only admired him from  
afar, DiMaggio was an ideal role model. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really lived up to his billing,'' Cone said. ``He was the  
greatest living player. He just had such a dignity and an elegance 
about him that nobody can match in today's game. Even the greatest 
players in today's game can't match that elegance that he had. He's 
one of a kind. ... There was a real royalty to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire, himself a larger-than-life figure after hitting 70  
home runs last season, said he was saddened by DiMaggio's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of the best in the game,'' said McGwire, who never  
got a chance to meet DiMaggio. ``It's a big loss for the game and 
for life in general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Cal Ripken, who shattered the consecutive games streak of  
Lou Gehrig, a former DiMaggio teammate, said: 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fortunate and lucky that I had the opportunity to talk  
baseball with him. I'm a baseball fan, and his accomplishments 
speak for themselves. There were a lot of misconceptions about Joe 
because of his need for privacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone always wanted to ask DiMaggio for an autograph, but didn't.  
About a year ago, he bought a dozen signed baseballs from a 
collector. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why? ... Just so I'd have them,'' the pitcher said. ``I don't  
remember what the exact price was, but it was a lot.''

<HEADLINE>  Wall St. Stocks End Lower / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks retreated Tuesday on renewed concern  
about weak first-quarter earnings at market-leading technology 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average lost 33.85 to close at 9,693.76  
after swinging widely throughout the session. The Dow gained as 
much as 71 points then sank by as much as 57 before trimming its 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip index had gained a total of 460 points last  
Thursday and Friday, closing the week at a record high of 9,736.08. 
But it has been unable to sustain that lofty level this week, 
falling Tuesday as the profitability of marquee technology 
companies was questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which on Monday closed at a  
record high of 1,282.73, declined 2.89 to 1,279.84. The S&AMP;P was up 
as much as 11 points earlier in the day. The Nasdaq composite index 
shed 4.68 to 2,392.94, after trimming an earlier gain of 35 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're flirting with an all-time high, and people are just as  
nervous as the veritable cat on the roof,'' said Edward Collins, 
stock trader at Daiwa Securities America. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors that Intel would report disappointing first-quarter  
earnings caused technology stocks, which had led the market on 
Monday, ``to just kind of give up,'' Collins said. ``In this kind 
of nervous market, anything like this just causes people to run for 
the hills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, whose stock fell 4 5/16 to 115 5/16 in Nasdaq trading,  
said its practice is not to comment on market rumors. Intel gave 
back almost all of its 5-point advance on Monday following the 
microchip maker's settlement of antitrust charges with the Federal 
Trade Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble for technology stocks on Tuesday actually began  
before the Intel rumors. Late Monday, after markets closed, 
microchip maker Advanced Micro Devices said it expected a 
``significant'' first-quarter loss because of production problems 
with its best line of microprocessors. AMD also announced it will 
cut 300 jobs over the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
	AMD shares sank 1 7/16 to 17 1/2. Other technology stocks were  
better behaved in late morning, but succumbed in early afternoon to 
the Intel worries. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq Computer sank 1 5/8 to 32 3/4 in leading volume on the New York  
Stock Exchange, after the computer maker said Monday that its 
performance had lagged its peers last year, when return on invested 
capital and sales growth were measured. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow member IBM, however, bucked the ebbing technology tide,  
adding 3 5/16 to 182 3/16. So did Microsoft, which gained 2 13/16 
to 161 13/16 on a report that the software giant was about to 
settle the government's antitrust suit against the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks weren't helped much by strong gains in the bond market.  
The 30-year Treasury bond was up, extending recent sharp gains and 
pushing down its yield to 5.53 percent from 5.59 percent late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market opened lower but turned around after a 10 a.m.  
EST report showing that the productivity of American workers surged 
at a 4.6 percent annual rate during the final three months of last 
year, the best showing in six years. For all of 1998, productivity 
increased a healthy 2.2 percent, up from a 1.2 percent gain in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Lower; Dow Down 32 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks dropped further into negative territory  
at mid-afternoon, on rumors that more technology companies would 
report disappointing first-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 32.19 at 9,695.42. The Dow got as high as 9,798.93, up 71 
points, before backing off in early afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which closed at a record high  
on Monday, was down 2.88 at 1,279.85, after climbing as much as 11 
points earlier. The Nasdaq composite index was down 5.05 at 
2,392.57 after trimming an earlier gain of 35 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors sold technology stocks at the open after an  
announcement that microchip maker Advanced Micro Devices expected 
``significant'' first-quarter loss because of production problems 
with its best line of microprocessors. AMD also announced a 
restructuring that will include cutting 300 jobs over the next six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	AMD shares were down 1 5/8 at 17 3/8. Other technology stocks were  
better behaved in late morning, but succumbed in early afternoon to 
worries that AMD may not be alone in expecting poor earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq Computer was down 1 3/4 at 32 5/8, although Dow member IBM was  
up 2 3/4 at 181 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks weren't helped much by gains in the bond market. The  
30-year Treasury bond was up 11/16 point, its yield down to 5.54 
percent from 5.59 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market opened lower but turned around after a 10 a.m.  
report showing that the productivity of American workers surged at 
a 4.6 percent annual rate during the final three months of last 
year, the best showing in six years. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, productivity increased a healthy 2.2 percent, a  
significant improvement over the 1.2 percent gain in 1997. Higher 
productivity means companies are more efficient and in many cases, 
more profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	The lift in bonds did support financial services stocks,  
however. Citigroup was up 13/16 at 62 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Longer term for the stock market, Richard E. Cripps, chief  
market strategist for Legg Mason of Baltimore, said he was 
concerned about a drop in cash deposits into stock funds, and an 
ongoing concentration of buying interest in the shares of 
large-capitalization companies over smaller ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our sense is that the liquidity going into the market is  
slowing, and what's happening is that the large-cap performance 
driven stocks are sucking liquidity from smaller caps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues were leading  
advancers a 6-to-5 margin. Volume on the Big Board came to 652.79 
million shares, up from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR Nabisco shares were up 1 1/8 at 29 3/4 on the Big Board. The  
consumer-products holding corporation agreed to sell its 
international tobacco business to Japan Tobacco Inc. for $7.8 
billion, and said it will separate its U.S. tobacco unit from its 
big Nabisco food operation.

<HEADLINE> Snow Pummels North, Eastern States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Layers of ice and piles of snow made driving hazardous and  
closed schools today from the Great Lakes south to Georgia, and 
some air travelers were stuck because of canceled flights. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a foot of snow had fallen on Minnesota and Iowa.  
</P>
<P>
	``Roads are nasty,'' said Sgt. Scott Beamon of the Indiana State  
Police in Indianapolis. ``There are snow-covered, slick and 
hazardous roads in some areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The big storm had swept eastward after closing scores of schools  
Monday in Nebraska, South Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa. The warmer, 
southern side of the weather system kicked off thunderstorms in the 
South and southern Plains, with tornadoes Monday in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three traffic deaths had been blamed on the weather.  
</P>
<P>
	And behind that storm, another one was pushing eastward through  
the mountains of northern California and Nevada. Interstate 80 over 
Donner Summit in California's Sierra Nevada was closed today 
because of nearly zero visibility in snow driven by wind that 
gusted to 80 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Southeast, a layer of ice under 2 inches of snow created  
havoc this morning in northeastern Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The roads aren't closed but they're impassable,'' said Rabun  
County Deputy Sheriff John Keener. 
</P>
<P>
	Six inches accumulated in the hills of western Virginia and up  
to 4 inches fell overnight in the Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the worst storm of the season for Minnesota, dumping more  
than a foot of snow after weeks of mild weather and briefly closing 
the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport for the first time 
in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We rarely get into a situation where we can't handle it,''  
said Wendy Burt, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Airports 
Commission. ``Tonight (Monday) was a rarity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just over 14 inches of snow fell at the Twin Cities of  
Minneapolis-St. Paul, and at Carroll, Iowa. Parts of Ohio had 8 
inches today and up to 7 inches fell across northern and central 
Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Streets and highways were mostly clear today in Detroit, but  
Northwest Airlines and some other carriers canceled a few departing 
flights today because of lingering problems elsewhere, said 
spokeswoman Andrea Newman. 
</P>
<P>
	At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, United and American  
airlines canceled flights Monday because of the weather and there 
were more delays this morning. Ohio airports also had some 
cancellations because of delays elsewhere in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	South of the snow belt, several tornadoes touched down Monday  
around the East Texas town of Holly Springs, destroying homes and 
injuring one person. Just one week earlier, another round of 
twisters had struck the same town 110 miles northeast of Houston, 
demolishing six homes and damaging 25 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people were injured when an apparent tornado struck near  
Henryetta, Okla.

<HEADLINE> Internet Alcohol Crackdown Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A growing number of minors are buying alcohol  
on the Internet, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said as he called 
Tuesday for a federal crackdown on interstate shipments that 
violate state laws. 
</P>
<P>
	To open a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Hatch, the panel's  
chairman, showed a video of a Utah news story about a 13-year-old 
girl ordering beer on her computer using an adult's credit card. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that does not bother you, it should,'' Hatch said. ``There  
is something very wrong with the level of control that is being 
exercised over these sales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Rep. Robert Ehrlich, R-Md., as the Internet has  
grown, so has its use for the sale of alcohol. He said the market 
in illegal sales of alcohol on the Internet is $1 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch introduced a bill that would toughen enforcement of  
existing laws prohibiting the importation or transportation of 
alcohol to minors. He said it is a federal issue that should be 
handled in federal court. The legislation would grant state 
attorneys general the power to file actions in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporting Hatch's position was Wayne Klein, assistant attorney  
general of Utah, who said federal help is needed because modern 
technology has made the fight tougher. 
</P>
<P>
	But John De Luca, president and chief executive officer of the  
Wine Institute, said the bill would hurt small wineries that depend 
on the Internet as their only means of selling their product. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. George Radanovich, R-Calif., said the government's  
interference with direct orders on the Internet could be 
detrimental to interstate commerce and create barriers to free 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``But direct shipment of alcohol is impacting our most  
vulnerable constituents-- our children, who are surfing the Internet 
and getting direct access to alcohol,'' said Rep. Juanita 
Millender-McDonald, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said she was looking for a  
solution to the teen-age drinking problem that would not devastate 
the wine industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be fair to the wine industry, but we also want to  
be fair to America's children,'' said Hatch.

<HEADLINE> New Approach for US in N. Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- U.S. officials will adopt South  
Korea's policy of greater engagement with North Korea and expand 
current talks beyond just weapons issues, Washington's point man on 
North Korea said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	William Perry, a former defense secretary, agreed to the new  
approach after meeting with President Kim Dae-jung and other top 
officials to discuss policy recommendations for President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both sides agreed that a comprehensive approach was needed to  
address those problems caused by North Korea's nuclear and missile 
programs,'' Perry and Foreign Minister Hong Soon-young said in a 
statement. ``Such an approach would build upon (South Korea's) 
policy of engagement with North Korea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perry plans to present his policy recommendations to Clinton  
later this month. He has visited Beijing and later Tuesday flew to 
Tokyo to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea wants the United States and Japan to offer North  
Korea expanded economic and diplomatic benefits in exchange for 
abandoning its missile and nuclear programs and establishing a 
permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, those issues have been dealt with individually, but  
South Korea thinks they should be lumped together in one 
negotiating package. 
</P>
<P>
	But South Korea's so-called ``sunshine policy'' faces growing  
opposition from Republicans in Congress who want Clinton to take a 
tougher stance against North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	``North Korea's nuclear ambitions, chemical-biological  
capability and its burgeoning missile capability present a clear 
and present danger to the security of the United States,'' five 
Republican U.S. House leaders told Perry in a letter released 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry's visit comes amid reports that U.S.-North Korea talks  
under way in New York were bogged down over North Korea's refusal 
to allow free access to a suspected nuclear weapons site in the 
communist country. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, U.S. satellite photographs found thousands of North  
Koreans burrowing into a mountainside 25 miles northwest of the 
country's main nuclear complex of Youngbyon. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials raised the suspicion that the work might be  
nuclear-related. Any North Korean nuclear activity would violate a 
1994 agreement with the United States, under which Pyongyang 
promised to give up its suspected nuclear weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
	While claiming that the facility is for civilian use, North  
Korea says it will allow one or two U.S. visits to the suspected 
site if Washington compensates it financially. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has rejected the North's demand for financial  
compensation, but expressed willingness to expand humanitarian food 
aid if free access is permitted.

<HEADLINE>  Wall St. Stocks End Lower / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks retreated Tuesday on renewed concern  
about weak first-quarter earnings at market-leading technology 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average lost 33.85 to close at 9,693.76  
after swinging widely throughout the session. The Dow gained as 
much as 71 points then sank by as much as 57 before trimming its 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip index had gained a total of 460 points last  
Thursday and Friday, closing the week at a record high of 9,736.08. 
But it has been unable to sustain that lofty level this week, 
falling Tuesday as the profitability of marquee technology 
companies was questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which on Monday closed at a  
record high of 1,282.73, declined 2.89 to 1,279.84. The S&AMP;P was up 
as much as 11 points earlier in the day. The Nasdaq composite index 
shed 4.68 to 2,392.94, after trimming an earlier gain of 35 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're flirting with an all-time high, and people are just as  
nervous as the veritable cat on the roof,'' said Edward Collins, 
stock trader at Daiwa Securities America. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors that Intel would report disappointing first-quarter  
earnings caused technology stocks, which had led the market on 
Monday, ``to just kind of give up,'' Collins said. ``In this kind 
of nervous market, anything like this just causes people to run for 
the hills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, whose stock fell 4 5/16 to 115 5/16 in Nasdaq trading,  
said its practice is not to comment on market rumors. Intel gave 
back almost all of its 5-point advance on Monday following the 
microchip maker's settlement of antitrust charges with the Federal 
Trade Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble for technology stocks on Tuesday actually began  
before the Intel rumors. Late Monday, after markets closed, 
microchip maker Advanced Micro Devices said it expected a 
``significant'' first-quarter loss because of production problems 
with its best line of microprocessors. AMD also announced it will 
cut 300 jobs over the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
	AMD shares sank 1 7/16 to 17 1/2. Other technology stocks were  
better behaved in late morning, but succumbed in early afternoon to 
the Intel worries. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq Computer sank 1 5/8 to 32 3/4 in leading volume on the New York  
Stock Exchange, after the computer maker said Monday that its 
performance had lagged its peers last year, when return on invested 
capital and sales growth were measured. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow member IBM, however, bucked the ebbing technology tide,  
adding 3 5/16 to 182 3/16. So did Microsoft, which gained 2 13/16 
to 161 13/16 on a report that the software giant was about to 
settle the government's antitrust suit against the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks weren't helped much by strong gains in the bond market.  
The 30-year Treasury bond was up, extending recent sharp gains and 
pushing down its yield to 5.53 percent from 5.59 percent late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market opened lower but turned around after a 10 a.m.  
EST report showing that the productivity of American workers surged 
at a 4.6 percent annual rate during the final three months of last 
year, the best showing in six years. For all of 1998, productivity 
increased a healthy 2.2 percent, up from a 1.2 percent gain in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond investors took higher productivity numbers as an assurance  
that the economy could continue to grow without producing 
inflation. The Federal Reserve has already said it stands ready to 
raise interest rates -- anathema to bond investors -- if inflation 
rears its head. To stock investors, higher productivity is good 
news because it signals that companies are more efficient and in 
many cases, more profitable.

<HEADLINE> Monitoring Competitors' Commercials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST CHESTER, Pa. (AP) -- The TV show ends, a commercial comes  
on, and it's one you can't stand. At least you have a means of 
escape -- the refrigerator, the bathroom, your remote control. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheryl Smith isn't so lucky. She can't run away; her job is to  
watch TV ads by the thousands and categorize them for Competitive 
Media Reporting, a firm that tracks advertising and commercial 
spending across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The work can be mind-numbing, but to Competitive Media's  
clients, the information gleaned by employees slouched in chairs in 
front of computer monitors is critical to staying ahead of their 
rivals. When McDonald's wants information about Burger King's 
latest ad, Competitive Media is one of the company's resources. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we offer is like military intelligence for these  
companies,'' said Peter A. Andrel III, Competitive Media's senior 
vice president of information services. ``Without the backdrop of 
knowing what their competitor is doing, they don't know what to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York City-based Competitive Media compiles data on  
broadcast, print, billboard and Internet advertising for more than 
2,000 clients. At the company's West Chester office, workers deal 
strictly with TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads and information about them are kept in a database that  
includes more than 750,000 product brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Chang, a marketing professor at Penn State University  
in State College, Pa., said a company can only be better than its 
competitors if it knows what they are doing to sell their product. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to know how to distinguish yourself,'' Ms. Chang  
said. ``You just can't sit around and be quiet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Anheuser-Busch are among Competitive  
Media's big-name clients; so was President Clinton's re-election 
campaign. But the majority of clients are advertising agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies, such as Nielsen Media Research in New York  
City, have similar databases but work with an automated system, 
which they say is more efficient. Competitive Media, however, 
believes in the human eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point in time, we still need those eyes. It's critical  
for all the details we want,'' said Judy Vogel, a media research 
director at BBDO advertising agency in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're the guide for us,'' said Vogel, a customer for 15  
years. ``They keep a good pulse on what the competition is doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Classifiers are given two weeks of training, then assigned a  
computer screen, a keyboard and free license to decorate their 
cubicle in any way they feel will help keep them alert. No special 
skills are needed, just a high school diploma and a strong 
tolerance for monotony. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're mostly housewives or college students and many quit  
after six months,'' Andrel said. ``I myself would be climbing the 
walls after two months. But there are some who have worked here for 
years. It's a low-stress and peaceful job for some.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gabrielle Gentry, 32, is one of the veterans.  
</P>
<P>
	Wearing earphones, she quickly types her observations onto a  
keyboard, rarely taking her eyes off the screen. She performs no 
analysis or interpretation, just stating whether the commercial is 
``brand name,'' public service'' or ``news promotion.'' She then 
breaks the ads down into specific brands, markets and product type. 
</P>
<P>
	After eight years on the job, it only takes her a second to  
recognize what is flashing on the screen. Three notes into one 
commercial, she perks up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, that's a Jerry Springer promo,'' she says.  
</P>
<P>
	Seconds later, she speaks again: ``Oh, that's a Philadelphia  
Light Cream Cheese ad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the day, Ms. Gentry will have watched as many as  
800 commercials. That's a lot, until you consider a person will 
watch an average of 100 commercials during four hours of daily 
viewing. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the risks on this job is the psychological effect of all  
the advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything you see, you want, especially the cars,'' said Ms.  
Smith, a 32-year-old former X-ray technician. ``Even the food. And 
right before lunch is the worst time.''

<HEADLINE> Dutch Retailer Buys Pathmark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Dutch food retailer Royal Ahold has bought  
the Pathmark supermarket chain for $1.7 billion, securing a major 
hold over the supermarket industry on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahold, which already owns large chains in the Southeast, New  
England and mid-Atlantic areas, will gain 132 stores in New Jersey 
and the New York and Philadelphia metropolitan areas with estimated 
1998 sales of $3.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This clearly positions Ahold to be the No. 1 drug and food  
retailer in the eastern United States,'' said Burt Flickinger, a 
consultant with Reach Marketing in Westport, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahold operates Bi Lo Markets in the Southeast, Stop and Shop  
Supermarkets in New England, Tops supermarkets in western New York 
and Ohio, and the Giant Food Stores and Edwards Supermarket chains 
based in Carlisle, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahold, with a 10 percent share of the U.S. supermarket industry,  
should become one of the five largest chains in the country after 
several other pending mergers go through, analysts said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides its U.S. stores, Ahold operates about 3,600 supermarkets  
in 17 countries, including The Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Latin 
America. Sales in 1998 were over $30 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahold spokesman Hans Gobes said no store closings or layoffs  
were planned as a result of the acquisition. The Pathmark chain 
employs 28,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Man Pleads to Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A man accused of playing a key role in the  
largest drug money laundering case in U.S. history has pleaded 
guilty to charges from one of three indictments in the $70 million 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Victor Manuel Alcala Navarro, who admitted paying off Mexican  
bankers to launder drug proceeds and move them into the United 
States, pleaded guilty 28 times through a Spanish interpreter 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcala Navarro still faces two other federal indictments in  
Operation Casablanca, which snared officials of three of Mexico's 
largest banks in a sting by U.S. Customs agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcala Navarro, 36, admitted to introducing bankers to the U.S.  
agents he thought were operatives of the powerful Cali drug cartel. 
The indictment alleged that about $70 million was laundered through 
Mexican banks and sent to the United States under the direction of 
Alcala Navarro. 
</P>
<P>
	The case raised tensions between Mexico and the United States  
last spring when U.S. law enforcement agents arrested 167 people, 
including top Mexican bankers and executives. Mexico accused the 
United States of intruding on Mexican sovereignty by conducting its 
sting operation without its involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of Mexico's most prominent banks -- Bancomer, Banca Serfin  
and Confia -- were charged in the case. The indicted banks have 
denied any wrongdoing, saying the illegal activity was committed by 
rogue employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The counts that Alcala Navarro admitted to were only a fraction  
of the 106 charges lodged against him in the indictment. The 
government agreed to drop the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Each count carries a possible maximum sentence of 20 years in  
prison, though defense attorney Victor Sherman said he expects 
Alcala Navarro to draw a sentence of about 32 years. Charges in the 
other two indictments could result in terms of life imprisonment 
without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentencing was scheduled for June 28.  
</P>
<P>
	Sherman told reporters that his client was not helping  
prosecutors to convict others.

<HEADLINE> Some See Red Over Crayon Color </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EASTON, Pa. (AP) -- Burnt sienna is for coloring houses and  
trees. Brick red is for fireplaces. Goldenrod is the sun. And 
indian red? 
</P>
<P>
	``To color Indians,'' 7-year-old Danny Lamorte said recently  
about the reddish-brown Crayola crayon. 
</P>
<P>
	Though his mortified mother, Maryalice Lamorte of Yardley,  
insists the first grader was kidding or showing off, Crayola has 
decided to end such youthful misunderstandings. 
</P>
<P>
	For only the third time in its 96-year history, Crayola will  
change the name of a crayon. 
</P>
<P>
	Crayola says indian red was based on a reddish-brown pigment  
commonly found near India. But the manufacturer has gotten 
complaints from teachers who say students think the color has to do 
with American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Little children take words and names very literally,'' said  
Louise Cosgrove, an art teacher in Allentown. ``To them, they think 
indian red is the color of a Native American's skin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suggestions for the new name will be accepted over the next  
three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian red -- with a lower-case ``i'' -- debuted in the Crayola  
lineup in 1958, when the 64-crayon box was introduced. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it confuses children, it's something that should be  
re-evaluated,'' Crayola spokeswoman Tracey Muldoon Moran said. 
``It's easy enough for us to remedy the situation by renaming the 
crayon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The name change is only the third in the 96-year history of  
Crayola, a division of Binney &AMP; Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1958, ``prussian blue'' was renamed ``midnight blue,''  
because teachers said students were no longer familiar with 
Prussian history. In 1962, ``flesh'' was changed to ``peach'' to 
recognize that ``everyone's skin tone is not the same,'' Ms. Moran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent name change ``underscores the American public's  
growing sensitivity to images and symbols which have been perceived 
as offensive to Native Americans and more importantly to native 
children,'' said JoAnn K. Chase, executive director of the National 
Congress of American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-grade teacher Gayle Ganser of Allentown agreed the name  
change was long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children, especially the age levels I'm dealing with, they  
make literal associations between the words they know and their 
prior knowledge. So when they hear indian red, two words that they 
know, they automatically make the association that that is what 
indians look like,'' Mrs. Ganser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crayola currently makes 120 crayon colors, plus eight colors  
that were retired in 1990 and replaced with new shades. In 1993, 
Crayola introduced 16 new colors for its new 96-count box, with the 
names selected from nearly 2 million suggestions sent in from kids, 
parents and colorers nationwide. Another 24 new colors were added 
in 1998.

<HEADLINE> GM May Buy Remainder of Saab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- General Motors Corp. will begin talks this July on  
buying the remaining 50 percent of Saab Automobile AB, the chief 
executive of the Swedish car maker said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit-based GM acquired half of Saab from the Swedish holding  
company Investor AB for $600 million in 1989 and has an option to 
buy the remaining half for the six months starting on July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with Dow Jones Newswires and financial cable  
network CNBC, Saab CEO Robert Hendry suggested that Saab may not 
come cheap, given the automaker's recent sales gains and improving 
financial balance sheet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saab's good performance makes both parties want to keep their  
shares,'' Hendry said during an interview at the Geneva Auto Show. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's news comes a day after Volvo shareholders approved the  
$6.5 billion sale of the Swedish company's passenger car division 
to Ford Motor Co.

<HEADLINE> Conviction Overturned in Gun Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court has overturned a  
woman's conviction for giving a gun to her 14-year-old daughter, 
who then used it to kill her mother's abusive boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 10-1 ruling Tuesday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
ordered a new trial for Ernestine James, who was convicted of 
aiding and abetting manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said the trial judge should have allowed James  
to offer evidence of her boyfriend's criminal record to support her 
testimony that he had bragged about his violent past. 
</P>
<P>
	James' public defender, Peter Offenbacher, said the ruling  
``strikes a blow for the defendant's opportunity to present her 
case and not just to respond to the government's case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James was sentenced to five years' probation for the July 1993  
shooting of David Ogden on the Lummi Reservation in Whatcom County, 
Wash. Her daughter, Jaylene Jeffries, pleaded guilty to 
second-degree murder in juvenile court and has completed her 
sentence at a rehabilitation center, Offenbacher said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial judge had allowed testimony about Ogden's violence to  
James and his threats of violence, but barred testimony of his 
record, which included 38 criminal charges, including a robbery and 
several attacks.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a St. Patrick's Day ceremony, President  
Clinton will award former Sen. George Mitchell the nation's highest 
civilian honor for his efforts to forge peace in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has helped bring the people of Northern Ireland closer to  
lasting peace than they have been in 30 years of sectarian 
conflict,'' White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said in a 
statement. ``And he has given inspiration to others around the 
world seeking to resolve seemingly intractable disputes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, a former Senate majority leader from Maine, will  
receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom at a White House ceremony 
on March 17, Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As judge, lawmakers and statesman, George Mitchell has devoted  
his life to the determined pursuit of the common good,'' Lockhart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, acting as Clinton's envoy, shepherded the warring  
factions in Northern Ireland to the political settlement known as 
the Good Friday agreement in April 1998.

<HEADLINE>  Gunman Kills S. African Politician </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- A gunman killed an opposition  
politician in Cape Town on Tuesday despite efforts by South African 
security forces to halt a wave of political violence ahead of 
elections in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The escalating bloodshed threatens to undermine South Africa's  
second all-race elections, to be held June 2 and which the ruling 
African National Congress is expected to win. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday morning, the government poured army troops and police  
into a Cape Town slum where an ANC politician and four organizers 
for a rival party, the United Democratic Movement, have been killed 
since Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the afternoon, a gunman shot Patata Nqwaru, vice chairman of  
the local branch of the United Democratic Movement party, as he 
walked down a street, said police Capt. Mark Romburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of police rushed to where Nqwaru's body lay with bullet  
wounds in the head and stomach. A police helicopter circled 
overhead, but the killer had already fled. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the run-up to national elections, political tensions will  
heighten. We're very concerned that it is now materializing into 
attacks,'' Romburgh said. ``If people want to settle rivalries 
through the barrel of the gun rather than political debate, police 
are limited in what they can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The killings in the Cape Flats area started Sunday, when ANC  
city council member Zwelinzima Hlazo was slain. Ninety minutes 
later, United Democratic Movement organizer Mncedise Mpongwane was 
killed, leading police to suspect a tit-for-tat killing. Two other 
United Democratic Movement party organizers were killed Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the United Democratic Movement, Bantu Holomisa,  
hinted at ANC involvement in the killings, which mirror a cycle of 
violence that has hit Richmond, a town in eastern KwaZulu-Natal 
province. Dozens of ANC and United Democratic Movement supporters 
were killed in clashes there last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There seems to be intimidation taking place in certain areas  
in South Africa. And as usual, the ANC will always be the common 
denominator,'' Holomisa told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the ANC condemned the bloodshed.  
</P>
<P>
	``The ANC is deeply shocked by the violence in that area and is  
committed to the re-establishment of peace,'' said Ebrahim Rasool, 
the ANC chairman for Western Cape province. 
</P>
<P>
	He called for a suspension of radio debates among political  
leaders, which he said ``inflame the passions'' and are 
``counterproductive in the context of the killings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holomisa said he would meet with relatives of the dead Wednesday  
and speak with supporters, but would not recommend special 
self-protection measures. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state must guarantee the security of all South Africans,  
irrespective of their political affiliation,'' Holomisa said.

<HEADLINE> Ship's Bow Pulled Off Oregon Beach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALDPORT, Ore. (AP) -- This time, the Navy is going to make sure  
the New Carissa never comes back. 
</P>
<P>
	The freighter's broken bow section -- which twice ran aground on  
some of Oregon's most pristine beaches -- was again being towed out 
to sea for burial, along with its 130,000 gallons of thick bunker 
fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans call for the Navy destroyer USS David R. Ray to use its  
5-inch guns to sink the ship, probably Wednesday or Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Other options were being reviewed, including air strikes and  
placing explosives aboard the wreck, said Lt. Cmdr. William Fenick, 
a spokesman for the Navy's Pacific Northwest command. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard Cmdr. Dawayne Penberthy said the 420-foot bow  
section will be sunk in about 12,000 feet of water about 250 miles 
out. By late Monday it was nearly 60 miles from shore. 
</P>
<P>
	A week ago, the tow cable between the bow section and the tug  
Sea Victory was snapped in a storm. The wreck drifted for hours 
before washing up in Waldport, 80 miles north of Coos Bay, where it 
originally ran aground Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	It was pulled off the beach Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Worries ashore turned to the estimated 70,000 gallons of oil the  
New Carissa spilled while it was aground at Coos Bay. Much of it 
has yet to wash up, though tar balls have been seen as far away as 
southern Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Biologists said 312 birds have died since the ship first spilled  
oil Feb. 8. There was oil visible on at least 139 of the birds. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the ship's 220-foot stern section still sits mired in  
the sand at Coos Bay. Salvage crews have yet to decide what to do 
with it.

<HEADLINE> FDIC Chief Yields on New Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to a public outcry over privacy,  
the head of the FDIC says she's ready to drop proposed anti-money 
laundering rules that would track bank customers' habits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public has spoken very loudly and clearly,'' Donna Tanoue,  
chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said Monday in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she will urge her colleagues on the agency's  
four-member board to agree to withdraw the proposed regulations, 
called ``Know Your Customer'' rules. The board's next meeting is 
March 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tanoue spoke as the 90-day public comment period for the  
proposal closed. On Friday, the Senate joined the torrent of 
criticism and sent a message to federal bank regulators to withdraw 
the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	By an 88-0 vote, the Senate expressed support for a measure  
directing the regulators to drop the proposed rules. Senate 
Democrats blocked a vote on actual adoption of the measure, 
sponsored by Sens. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and Wayne Allard, R-Colo., 
so it lacks the force of law. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, the Banking Committee on Thursday adopted an  
amendment to a big financial services bill that would kill the 
proposed banking rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tanoue previously had said she was reconsidering the  
proposed rules, which were denounced in a flood of angry e-mail 
starting in December. The FDIC had received more than 225,000 
e-mail messages and letters as of Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed regulations would require banks to verify their  
customers' identities, know where their money comes from and 
determine their normal pattern of transactions. The current 
requirements for banks to report any ``suspicious'' transactions to 
law enforcement authorities would be expanded. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy advocates and bankers have complained that the rules  
would transform every bank teller into a spy for Big Brother. They 
maintain the rules are unconstitutional and would violate the 
Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable search and 
seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Ms. Tanoue, the FDIC board includes Comptroller  
of the Currency John D. Hawke Jr., who oversees nationally 
chartered banks. He also believes the bank rules should be 
scrapped, he told a House subcommittee last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Another board member is Ellen Seidman, director of the Office of  
Thrift Supervision, who has not yet taken a public position on the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The thrift agency, part of the Treasury Department, wanted to  
wait until after the comment period was over before it decided on a 
position, spokesman William Fulwider said Monday. ``We will look at 
it with a sense of balance and sensitivity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth director is FDIC Vice Chairman Andrew Hove, who is  
likely to agree with Ms. Tanoue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve, which also is involved in proposing the  
bank rules, has not taken a public position on them. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules are designed to combat money laundering techniques  
used by drug traffickers and other criminals to hide illegal 
profits.

<HEADLINE> Immigration Patterns Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States is a nation built by  
immigrants, but a new look at where they come from and where they 
go shows the times are changing. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe, traditionally prime source of Americans born elsewhere,  
has lost that leading position in an era of changing immigration 
patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	And the big industrial cities of the Northeast and Midwest, the  
destination of millions of new arrivals in the last century, have 
received very little immigration in the last generation, sharply 
reducing their percentage of foreign-born residents, according to a 
Census Bureau report being released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning in the 1960s and growing in the '70s and '80s, Latin  
America and Asia sharply increased their share of immigrants, and 
an increasing share began settling in the South and West, explained 
Census population expert Campbell Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
	A century ago nearly 90 percent of foreign-born Americans came  
from Europe. But that dropped to just 22.9 percent by 1990, 
according to the compilation of historical data. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, 44.3 percent of foreign-born U.S. residents were  
from Latin America and 26.3 percent were from Asia, the Census 
Bureau reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Updated historical records show that Europeans were the main  
source of foreign-born residents from the earliest record in 1850 
through 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	But by 1990, Mexico alone was home to nearly as many U.S.  
residents as all of Europe, 4,298,014 compared to 4,350,403. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, there were 19.8 million foreign-born Americans counted  
in the 1990 census, or 7.9 percent of the nation's total 
population. A century earlier, the 1890 national head count found 
9.2 million foreign born, or 14.8 percent of the total. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's foreign-born population slipped to a low of 4.7  
percent in 1970, and then began rising again, climbing to 6.2 
percent in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-term declining percentage of U.S. residents born  
elsewhere varies considerably from place to place, but for the most 
part the nation's cities had much larger shares of people born 
elsewhere 100 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, 35.3 percent of people living in Boston were  
foreign-born in 1890, but that fell to 20.0 percent by 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same period, the share of foreign-born fell from 39.7  
percent to just 3.4 percent in Detroit; in Denver it dropped from 
23.9 percent to 7.4 percent; it fell from 36.8 percent to 6.1 
percent in Minneapolis, and in Pittsburgh it has dipped from 30.7 
percent to 4.6 percent 
</P>
<P>
	But some cities in the South and West increased their share of  
foreign-born residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami counted 59.7 percent of its residents as foreign-born in  
1990. Detailed Census records for the city don't go back to 1890, 
but 25.0 percent of Miami residents were foreign-born in 1920, and 
that was down to just 9.7 percent in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
	The portion of foreign-born residents in Houston climbed from  
11.3 percent in 1890 to 17.8 percent 100 years later. 
</P>
<P>
	And Los Angeles' 38.4 percent foreign-born in 1990 was up from  
25.3 percent a century earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	But over the same period the foreign-born share in San Diego  
slipped from 25.4 percent to 20.9 percent and in San Francisco it 
fell from 42.4 percent to 34.0 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the foreign-born U.S. residents in 1990, 44.3 percent came  
from Latin America, including Mexico; 26.3 percent from Asia; 22.9 
percent from Europe; 4.0 from North America; 1.9 percent from 
Africa; 0.5 percent from the Pacific Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1890, the shares were Europe, 86.9 percent, North America,  
10.6 percent; Asia, 1.2 percent; Latin America, 1.2 percent; 
Pacific Islands, 0.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Vikings Name Offensive Coordinator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Still stunned by last month's death of  
offensive coordinator Chip Myers, the Minnesota Vikings on Tuesday 
promoted Ray Sherman as Myers' replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherman, re-hired as quarterbacks coach in January after one  
rocky season as Pittsburgh's offensive coordinator, originally had 
been a leading candidate for the Vikings' coordinator position. 
Coach Dennis Green chose instead to elevate Myers, who had been an 
assistant in Minnesota since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherman was hired to replace Myers as quarterbacks coach. Myers  
died of a heart attack at his Long Lake home Feb. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had worked together for three years, and we were looking  
forward to working together again. It's still a shocker to me,'' 
said Sherman, the Vikings' quarterbacks coach from 1995-97. 
``There's not a day goes by that I don't think about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sherman coached in Houston (1988-89), San Francisco (1991-93)  
and with the New York Jets (1994) before coming to Minnesota in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've known Ray a long time and I consider him to be one of the  
top offensive minds in the game today,'' Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Sherman struggled through a difficult season as a  
first-time coordinator with the Steelers last season. He received 
much of the blame for Pittsburgh's offensive problems and its 
failure to reach the playoffs for the first time since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I look at it is I'm glad to be back in Minnesota,''  
Sherman said. ``I'm glad to be back with an organization that I 
spent three years with. I know the players and I know the coaching 
staff, so it's not like going into an organization where you're 
learning a new system, learning new players, learning new coaches. 
You're not starting from scratch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Vikings, Sherman will take over an offense that set an  
NFL record with 541 points last season and will return virtually 
intact in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Randall Cunningham, receiver Cris Carter and running  
back Robert Smith, three of Minnesota's seven offensive Pro Bowl 
players, were among the first to call Sherman when he got the 
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great opportunity,'' Sherman said. ``The main thing is  
just don't screw it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings expect to hire a quarterbacks coach within a week.

<HEADLINE> RJR To Spin Off Tobacco Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. plans to separate the  
second-biggest U.S. cigarette business from its food interests 
after selling its international tobacco business for nearly $8 
billion to Japan Tobacco Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin announcements today would mean a breakup of a company  
that was acquired just over a decade ago for about $25 billion in 
what was the biggest leveraged buyout to that time. 
</P>
<P>
	The company had told analysts last month that it was looking to  
sell or find a partner for its struggling international tobacco 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	But it came as a surprise that its board had also endorsed a  
plan for subsequent spinoff of the domestic tobacco business into a 
separate company. Its R.J. Reynolds Tobacco division makes Winston, 
Camels and Salem cigarettes and is second in the U.S. only to 
Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the maker of Marlboro. 
</P>
<P>
	On the news, RJR Nabisco stock jumped more than 5 percent,  
rising $1.50 to $30.12 1/2 a share by early afternoon on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been under pressure from shareholders, including  
onetime corporate raider Carl Icahn who threatened a proxy fight to 
force RJR Nabisco to separate the tobacco and food businesses. 
Icahn faced a deadline of Friday for filing a slate of candidates 
for election to the RJR board in May. A call to Icahn was not 
immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The advocates of a splitup of the tobacco and food ties argued  
the market is undervaluing the food business because of its 
connection with the potential liabilities of the tobacco 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The spinoff would leave RJR Nabisco with an 80.6 percent stake  
in Nabisco Holdings Corp., which makes products like Oreo cookies, 
Ritz crackers and Planters nuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the food and tobacco businesses will be best  
able to achieve their full potential under separate ownership 
structures,'' said RJR chairman and chief executive Steven F. 
Goldstone. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts have warned that a deal to separate all connections  
between the food and tobacco businesses would likely draw legal 
challenges from people who may have claims over tobacco-related 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The domestic tobacco company was among the four major U.S.  
tobacco companies that recently settled claims by 46 states for the 
expense of treating sick smokers by agreeing to pay $206 billion 
over 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry earlier agreed to settle suits with the four other  
states for about $40 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstone had told analysts last month that finding a way to  
give the international tobacco business greater stature was a top 
priority for the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The international tobacco business is a distant third to Philip  
Morris and British-American Tobacco PLC, and its earnings have 
fallen amid financial turmoil in its key Russian and Asian markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected the sale to generate $6 billion to $6.6  
billion, but the sale to Japan Tobacco topped that. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan Tobacco, the leading tobacco company in Japan and a  
growing overseas business, is paying $7.8 billion and is assuming 
$200 million in debt to acquire the international tobacco 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale is subject to approval by RJR Nabisco bondholders and  
regulators, but is expected to be completed within two months. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR said it would use the proceeds to reduce its debt and for  
other corporate purposes, including strengthening the position of 
its domestic tobacco business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deal will allow us to secure a base for future growth  
overseas and establish us as a global player,'' Japan Tobacco said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR said it would announce specifics on the domestic tobacco  
spinoff, pending final board approval, after the sale of the 
international tobacco business is completed.

<HEADLINE> GOP Lawmakers Push School Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans said Tuesday they will  
continue to block a new-teacher plan that Democrats want to attach 
to an education bill now caught in a political battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all care about education. I think this is all meant,  
personally, to get someone to make a vote against a program that 
could be used in a 30-second television spot,'' said Sen. George 
Voinovich of Ohio, as his fellow Republicans failed in a second 
attempt Tuesday to limit the number of proposals that can be 
attached to the ``ed-flex'' bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill, which started with broad bipartisan support but  
has become enmeshed in political scuffles, would give states more 
flexibility in the way they can spend federal education dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Voinovich, a former governor of Ohio, charged that Democrats are  
using the bipartisan flexibility plan to push through other 
initiatives they want and force Republicans into early votes 
against those ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	Since education's emergence as a popular polling issue, both  
parties have rushed to be the first to pass an education bill in 
this Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Seizing on the first education bill of the new session, Senate  
Democrats have sought to add proposals ranging from reductions in 
class size to programs on dropout prevention. The Senate was in its 
fifth day of debate; a House version is scheduled to be considered 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats insist they are not trying to embarrass  
Republicans on education. Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, 
D-S.D., said he offered unsuccessfully on Tuesday to limit the 
number of Democratic proposals to assure the bill will be completed 
by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said Democrats will keep offering their proposals, even  
if Republicans pull the bill from the floor out of frustration, and 
Democrats have to attach their plans to other measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more votes to try to block the amendments are scheduled for  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to get votes on these issues,'' Daschle said.  
``We can get them now, or we can get them later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight over the bipartisan measure has centered on Republican  
resistance to an amendment by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., that 
would reduce class sizes by hiring 100,000 teachers over the next 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	An initial $1 billion for the teacher plan was approved by  
Congress last year in a spending bill compromise. President Clinton 
has said the whole plan would require $11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the second day in a row, the Republican leadership has  
continued its efforts to stand in the way of voting on an amendment 
to finish the job of hiring 100,000 teachers to reduce class 
size,'' Clinton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Republicans fail to limit the debate, they have a plan  
that could weaken the Democrats' class-size plan by giving states 
the option of spending any new money for teachers on special 
education costs instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans resist even that, saying any proposed additions  
to the bill should wait for later this year when Congress begins 
debating the reauthorization of another major education bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said Tuesday that Democrats have  
no assurances from the Republican leadership that the other bill 
will be considered this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Mike Castle, R-Del., predicted the House version of the  
flexibility bill will pass by next week, despite chances the House 
chamber will face the same kind of Democratic amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	--------------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill number is S. 280.

<HEADLINE> Solar 'S' Mark Foretells Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists have found a way to forecast  
powerful explosions on the sun that can cause power outages, block 
radio communications and scorch satellites in Earth orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	X-ray images captured by a Japanese scientific spacecraft show  
that an S-shaped structure develops on the face of the sun several 
days before an eruption of what is called a coronal mass ejection, 
scientists announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The S-shaped sign, said Richard Canfield of Montana State  
University, Bozeman, can be used as a solar eruption warning 
signal. This would give power companies and satellite operators 
about three extra days to prepare for the effects of a coronal mass 
ejection. 
</P>
<P>
	Current technology detects the solar explosions as they happen.  
This gives some advanced warning since it takes three or four days 
for the explosive wave to reach Earth. The 'S' sign detected by the 
X-ray satellite would add days to the warning, Canfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The X-ray images will tell us when something is likely to  
happen,'' said Canfield, a co-author of research that detected the 
'S' sign. ``It could be developed into a powerful predictive tool. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would go from three or four days of warning to six or seven  
days,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coronal mass ejections are massive eruptions of electrically  
charged plasma, or superheated gas, from the outer atmosphere of 
the sun. The sudden release of energy can hurl 10 billion tons of 
gas into space at speeds of up to 2 million miles an hour. The 
energy release can equal billions of megatons of TNT, said 
Canfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Such eruptions happen frequently and usually are harmless to the  
Earth. Occasionally, however, an explosion occurs on a side of the 
sun facing the Earth, sending a massive bubble of energy directly 
at the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Earth's magnetosphere shields the planet from most of the  
violence, but the planet's magnetic field lines can be charged 
suddenly with a powerful wave of electricity. Such surges of 
electricity along power lines have caused blackouts in the past, 
burning out transformers and disrupting service for thousands of 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The wave of solar energy also can disrupt long-distance radio  
transmissions and can damage satellites that are in deep space, 
beyond the protective envelope of the Earth's magnetosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	George Withbroe, a NASA scientist, said the solar storm effects  
now are only a nuisance. Power companies protect their systems from 
the natural electrical surge, and satellites are affected only 
rarely. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Withbroe said solar eruptions could cause serious  
injury to astronauts traveling beyond the Earth's magnetosphere. He 
said astronauts in the Apollo program were at risk as they traveled 
between the Earth and the moon, but fortunately no serious solar 
storms occurred during that period. 
</P>
<P>
	When humans eventually return to the moon or voyage on to Mars,  
Withbroe said, the ability to predict solar storms could save 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we go to Mars, we will have to worry more about this,''  
said Withbroe. He said it is likely that Mars-bound spacecraft will 
be equipped with a shielded compartment, which he called ``a storm 
cellar.'' If Mars voyagers were warned in advance of an approaching 
solar storm, he said, they could retreat to the shelter until the 
danger passed.

<HEADLINE> Islanders Send Lachance to Montreal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- The New York Islanders traded defenseman  
Scott Lachance to the Montreal Canadiens on Tuesday for a 
third-round pick in the 1999 entry draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Lachance, who was chosen fourth overall in the 1991 entry draft,  
played all 450 of his NHL games on Long Island and had 26 goals, 79 
assists and 348 penalty minutes. He also played in three playoff 
games without registering a point or penalty minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little confused and a little shocked,'' Lachance said  
minutes after learning of the trade. ``I wonder about a lot of 
things, (like) why a third-round pick. No matter which way you look 
at it, a third rounder won't help (the Islanders) for four, five 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year old Lachance was New York's representative in the  
1997 all-star game. He said his career highlight was the 1992-93 
season, when the Islanders made the Eastern Conference playoff 
finals before losing to the Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of ironic that the first game of my career was  
against Montreal,'' he said. ``I'm sure I'll get the same chill my 
first game there as I did my first game here.''

<HEADLINE> Dutch Retailer Buys Pathmark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Dutch food retailer Royal Ahold bought the  
Pathmark supermarket chain Tuesday, securing a major hold over the 
supermarket industry on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahold, which already owns the Tops Market, Giant Food and Stop &AMP;  
Shop chains, will gain 132 stores in New Jersey and the New York 
and Philadelphia metropolitan areas with estimated 1998 sales of 
$3.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	It also plans to turn its 73 Edwards supermarkets in New Jersey,  
New York City and Long Island into Pathmarks, and spend money to 
renovate the stores and improve the produce selection to create ``a 
customer paradise,'' Ahold spokesman Hans Gobes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This clearly positions Ahold to be the No. 1 drug and food  
retailer in the eastern United States,'' said Burt Flickinger, a 
consultant with Reach Marketing in Westport, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, with a 10 percent share of the U.S. supermarket  
industry, should become one of the five largest chains in the 
country after several other pending mergers go through, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders last November approved Albertson Inc.'s acquisition  
of American Stores Co., which created the nation's biggest 
supermarket chain, while Kroger's acquisition of Fred Meyer Inc. 
American Stores is still pending approval. Last year, the Safeway 
chain merged with the Chicago-area Dominick's chain. 
</P>
<P>
	The chains are all trying to get bigger to compete with discount  
store giant Wal-Mart, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahold, which controls 1,000 stores on the East Coast, bought  
Giant Food Inc. of Landover, Md., last year for $2.6 billion and 
already owns the BI-LO supermarket chain in the Carolinas, Tops 
Markets in western New York and Stop &AMP; Shop in Connecticut and 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	The company may distinguish itself by focusing on urban areas,  
with stores in nearly every major city from Maine to Florida, while 
the Wal-Marts concentrate on building megastores in rural space, 
Flickinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to be a stronger competitor in a market that  
probably would benefit from a sprucing-up,'' said Tom Burnett, 
director of Merger Insight. ``Right now, there are not a lot of 
choices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pathmark, meanwhile, will receive the money it needed to  
renovate its stores, where it lags about five years behind the 
competition, analysts said. The $1.7 billion price tag includes 
$1.5 billion of Pathmark's debt, acquired while the chain fought 
off a hostile takeover attempt in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahold said it would save $30 million in the first year and $50  
million in the second by restructuring Pathmark's debt. Moody's 
Investor Service said Tuesday it would consider upgrading several 
of Pathmark's bond ratings if the merger goes through. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahold said it would also buy the outstanding shares of SMG-II  
Holdings Corp., which controls Pathmark, for $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides its U.S. stores, Ahold operates about 3,600 supermarkets  
in 17 countries, including The Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Latin 
America. Sales in 1998 were over $30 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Gobes said no store closings or layoffs were planned as a result  
of the acquisition. The chain includes 43 stores in New York, 62 in 
New Jersey, 16 in Pennsylvania and four in Delaware. It employs 
28,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahold said the sale, subject to regulatory approval, should be  
finalized in the second half of this year.

<HEADLINE> Profanity Heard on Nixon Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Richard Nixon's salty language, pure and  
unabridged, boomed from a tape machine set up in a courtroom where 
a federal judge is deciding the monetary value of the late 
president's secret White House recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	On one tape, Nixon calls an Immigration and Naturalization  
employee from California a ``kike.'' He refers to an illegal 
Mexican immigrant as a ``wetback.'' And in another tape recording, 
he utters blasphemy and profanity and says former Supreme Court 
Justice Potter Stewart ``was a little dumb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers on Monday used the tapes -- ethnic slurs and  
all -- in an attempt to convince U.S. District Judge John Garrett 
Penn that Nixon would not have tried to sell the tapes after 
leaving office. Nixon's estate argues they were worth millions of 
dollars and wants the government to compensate the estate for 
seizing them. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape recordings, played in court to a sparse audience of  
employees from the National Archives and Nixon buffs, were scratchy 
and hard to hear. But they brought back to life the Nixon 
presidency, which ended with his resignation in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	In one tape, Nixon orders the INS to check out a ``wetback,'' an  
illegal alien believed to be working as a gardener for an executive 
of the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to start taking the Times on,'' Nixon says in the  
conversation on Oct. 7, 1971. Later, he tells Attorney General John 
Mitchell on the phone: ``I want the whole goddamned bunch gone 
after.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Taylor, director of the Richard Nixon Library &AMP; Birthplace  
Foundation in Yorba Linda, Calif., accused the government trying to 
tarnish Nixon's image. 
</P>
<P>
	The nearly 3,700 hours of tapes that were secretly made while  
Nixon was in office and confiscated when he resigned on Aug. 9, 
1974, include historical information on domestic and foreign policy 
initiatives, Taylor said. Yet the government has chosen segments to 
``tear down Nixon in the eyes of the judge and the American 
people,'' Taylor, who was a longtime Nixon aide, said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has to do with the Justice Department trying to score  
legal and political points in a courtroom setting,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the October 1971 tape, an angry Nixon calls an INS employee  
in California a ``kike,'' a derogatory term for a Jewish person. 
The worker had a role in the arrest of 36 illegal Mexican 
immigrants working at a food processing plant owned by former U.S. 
Treasurer Romana Banuelos, who was appointed by Nixon and was then 
awaiting Senate confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon also indicates he wants to make trouble for former INS  
Commissioner Raymond Farrell. He tells Mitchell: ``I want you to 
scare him to within an inch of his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other conversations, Nixon discusses the drinking habits of  
then-House Speaker Carl Albert, D-Okla. When referring to Stewart, 
who was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Eisenhower, 
Nixon says: He's ``a little dumb.'' Stewart died in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nixon estate is seeking to collect $35 million in  
compensation and $175 million in compounded interest for tapes, 
photos, films and papers the government seized after Nixon left 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	The government contends the estate is entitled to nothing, but  
that if some compensation must be made, the fair market value of 
the materials would be no more than $2.2 million plus compounded 
interest. The trial is the culmination of an 18-year legal battle.

<HEADLINE> Former French Premier Acquitted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius and another  
minister were acquitted today in France's tainted blood scandal, 
but a third minister was convicted for his role in the HIV 
contaminations. 
</P>
<P>
	In what was clearly a compromise verdict, former Health Minister  
Edmond Herve was given no penalty despite his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Christian Le Gunehec said that due to the length of the  
scandal, Herve had not benefited from the ``presumption of 
innocence to which he is entitled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Court of Justice of the Republic acquitted Herve's superior,  
Social Affairs Minister Georgina Dufoix, along with Fabius, in the 
contamination of seven people who were transfused with HIV-tainted 
blood in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling by the specially constituted court came in a painful,  
protracted case infused with both cold politics and raw emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	The court was the first since World War II to try ministers for  
crimes allegedly committed in office. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a scandal that shook France's health system to the core:  
about 4,000 people contracted the AIDS virus from transfusions in 
the mid-1980s. Hundreds later died. 
</P>
<P>
	During 10 days of debate, the court, made up of three judges and  
12 legislators, was asked to untangle a complex file detailing the 
state of medical knowledge about AIDS in the mid-1980s, and what 
France was doing to fight the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Fabius, Herve and Ms. Dufoix were charged in connection with the  
AIDS deaths of five people and the contamination of two others 
during a key period in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Charged with manslaughter and ``attacking the physical integrity  
of others,'' they faced up to five years in prison and a maximum 
$90,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Herve, the lowest-ranked of the defendants, was accused by an  
investigating commission of ``strangely apathetic behavior,'' which 
led to keeping unsterilized blood products in stock after it was 
known they could be contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dufoix and Herve were also accused of a delay in making  
available imported -- and costly -- heated blood products, and of 
negligence in the screening of blood donors. 
</P>
<P>
	All three, and Fabius in particular, were accused of a strategy  
of favoritism that delayed systematic testing for AIDS, waiting for 
development of a French-made test when an American one was 
available months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants stressed they never knowingly approved the use of  
contaminated blood products, and never put commercial concerns 
ahead of health. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never did financial considerations block important  
decisions,'' Herve testified. ``The uncertainties were very big at 
a time when scientific knowledge was hesitant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most emotional testimony came from the victims.  
</P>
<P>
	``You, without doubt, still dream of being president one day, so  
you wait for this court to acquit you,'' Sylvie Rouy, 35, told 
Fabius, who has higher political ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want your compassion. I want to know why I was  
infected,'' Rouy testified from her wheelchair. She was 
contaminated during an August 1985 transfusion while giving birth. 
</P>
<P>
	State prosecutor Jean-Francois Burgelin had called for all  
charges to be dropped, saying the affair reflected ``an immense 
breakdown of French medicine'' and wasn't the fault of politicians.

<HEADLINE> Journalist Sentenced for Child Porn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENBELT, Md. (AP) -- His voice quavering, veteran reporter  
Larry Matthews offered a courtroom assurance that he'd only been 
researching a story when he downloaded and sent child pornography 
online. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Alexander Williams was unswayed Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I believe Mr. Matthews crossed the line,'' Williams said in  
sentencing Matthews to an 18-month prison term. ``I also believe 
that it was immoral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews, who was also fined $4,000, received the lightest  
prison sentence possible under federal guidelines. He faced up to 
30 years in prison and a $500,000 fine after pleading guilty in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said he would recommend Matthews serve his sentence in  
a halfway house, provided federal prison officials agree. Matthews 
was given 60 days to report to prison, although it was unclear 
whether his attorneys would try to keep him out of jail pending an 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews is the first journalist prosecuted for accessing child  
pornography on the Internet, according to the Reporters Committee 
for Freedom of the Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had likened his acts to someone buying and selling  
cocaine to write a story on drugs. Media and civil rights groups, 
meanwhile, defended his right to research a story. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can this not send a chill through any investigative  
reporter who has violated a statute in the attempt to gather a 
story?'' said Jane Kirtley, executive director of the reporters 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge in the case refused to allow Matthews to use a First  
Amendment defense, prompting him to plead guilty in July to charges 
of receiving pornographic images on his computer and transmitting 
child pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	A 55-year-old father of four, Matthews had done stories on the  
increase of child porn on the Internet in 1995 while working for 
radio station WTOP-AM in Washington. He said he wanted to expand on 
that series for magazine articles he planned to sell freelance. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews said the indictment destroyed his life, ended his  
second marriage and forced him into bankruptcy as he tried to pay 
for his defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, I guess more than 30 years as a reporter counts for  
nothing,'' Matthews said outside the courtroom after he was 
sentenced. ``I would say any journalist who does some investigative 
work has to do some upfront homework on what the laws are.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles To Play Best Vs. Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Baltimore Orioles manager Ray Miller has no  
intention of filling his lineup with minor leaguers when the team 
travels to Cuba on March 28. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what the conditions are, you have to get your team  
on the field and play it like it's a major league game because 
we're getting ready to open up the season,'' Miller said Tuesday. 
``If you do anything less than that, you're opening the door for 
injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The historic game will be the first in Cuba involving a major  
league team in 40 years. It also comes just eight days before the 
Orioles are to open the season at home against the Tampa Bay Devil 
Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell the team, `This is the last week, and everything --  
including Cuba -- is a going to be a go,' '' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said the event is somewhat similar to the Olympics in  
that it promotes goodwill between countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing how sports can create great fellowship,'' he  
said. ``It will also help promote the beauty of baseball, which is 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa, however, had a rather  
different view of the proposed home-and-home series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a good idea for several reasons,'' he said.  
``Why get it started? If I had a vote, I'd vote no.''

<HEADLINE> French Bank Makes Bid for 2 Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- France's Banque Nationale de Paris has made a bold  
bid to create the world's largest bank, offering $37.2 billion to 
buy Paribas SA and Societe Generale SA. 
</P>
<P>
	The surprise offer comes just weeks after Societe Generale moved  
to buy Paribas for $17.07 billion to create Europe's second-largest 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Banque Nationale's takeover bid, announced late Tuesday night,  
comes amid widespead consolidation among European banks, which are 
scrambling to compete in a fast-changing market with a new common 
currency and fewer barriers to financial trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Henri de Clisson, a spokesman for Banque Nationale, said the  
move is aimed at creating ``a champion of the European banking 
sector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If successful, the merger would create the largest bank in world  
with nearly $1 trillion in assets. That would surpass the $800 
billion in assets from the bank that would be created by the 
pending merger of Deutsche Bank AG and Bankers Trust Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``This really positions BNP as a major player in the European  
scene and leaves them well positioned to move into North America in 
a bigger way,'' said Keith Stock, an independent global management 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	Banque Nationale's bid would be the second-highest price ever  
paid in a bank deal, falling just shy of the $41.5 billion merger 
between NationsBank Corp. and BankAmerica Corp. last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Banque Nationale is offering 15 of its shares for seven Societe  
Generale shares and 11 of its shares for eight Paribas shares. 
Trading in shares of all three banks have been suspended on the 
Paris stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday before the offer was announced, Societe Generale  
shares fell the equivalent of $2.83 to $158.45. Paribas shares 
closed up the equivalent of 60 cents to $93.60. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consolidation is likely to continue both within countries and  
across borders, particularly as barriers to cross-border finance 
continue to break down and as the world continues to get smaller 
from a financial services standpoint,'' said Brad Ball, an analyst 
with Credit Suisse First Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	While French banks have been slow to expand into the United  
States, several European banks are making moves, including Deutsche 
Bank, HSBC, Dresdner and ABN Amro. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance companies are also getting in the game. On Monday,  
Fortis, one of the biggest insurance and banking companies in 
Europe, said it would buy American Bankers Insurance Group, a Miami 
insurer. And last month, Aegon NV said it was buying TransAmerica 
Corp. of San Francisco for almost $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	French banks have been criticized for their slow reaction to the  
consolidation on the European continent. Banks in Belgium, Italy, 
Switzerland and Spain all announced major mergers before the 
Societe Generale-Paribas deal last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Banque Nationale's takeover offer would scuttle Societe  
Generale's plans to buy Paribas, an investment bank, which had the 
blessing of the French finance minister. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined French banks would be a leader in international  
investment banking activities, ranking among the world's leaders in 
underwriting European bonds, financing trade and dealing in complex 
investments known as derivatives.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's aviation authority may  
limit or ban in-flight alcohol to combat ``air rage,'' officials

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peru's economically troubled flagship airline  
Aeroperu said Tuesday it will suspend all flights while it

</P>
<P>
	Aeroperu, Peru's largest commercial airline, will suspend  
international flights starting Wednesday and the last domestic 
flight will be flown Sunday, Aeroperu General Manager Jan Albrecht 
told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Already-purchased international Aeroperu tickets will be honored  
by U.S.-based Delta Airlines or Aeromexico, Albrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aeroperu's collapse came after American Airlines ended talks to  
buy a share of the cash-strapped air carrier, Aeroperu President 
Roberto Abusada told Dow Jones news service. 
</P>
<P>
	Aeroperu has $174 million in debts and only $50 million in  
assets, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines lost interest in buying Aeroperu after it  
became clear Peru's government was going to give a Chilean airline 
the right to operate in Peru, Abusada said.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Police in the central Mexican state of Puebla  
have arrested five men -- including an active policeman and three 
former officers -- in the kidnapping of one of the governor's 
in-laws, newspapers reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The five men were arrested Sunday after allegedly requesting a  
ransom of $500,000 for the release of Leonardo Toral Payne, an 
in-law of Puebla Gov. Melquiades Morales, who was kidnapped 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Toral was released unharmed after the suspects were arrested and  
no ransom was paid, local news media reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Puebla Attorney General Carlos Arredondo said the five were  
responsible for seven other kidnappings. He said the gang was led 
by Mexico City police officer Jose Luis Flores Villagomez, who was 
among those arrested, according to the government news agency

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Expands Presence in China </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
	SHENZHEN, China (AP) -- Microsoft Corp., eyeing a restricted but  
rapidly growing computer market in mainland China, said Wednesday 
it will start offering systems to let the Chinese download movies, 
music, e-mail and other services. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft is banking on electronics manufacturers to install the  
necessary hardware in their products that are distributed across 
China. The end-users of services provided by the so-called 
``Venus'' project will get connected to the Internet in a 
partnership between Microsoft and China Telecom. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft boss Bill Gates issued a statement early Wednesday  
lauding ``the benefits this new, specialized system can bring to 
the Chinese customer,'' although Microsoft stayed vague about many 
of the details. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates was expected in Shenzhen Wednesdsay for events surrounding  
the agreement, according to Bruce Ning, a public relations 
executive employed by Microsoft in China. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear how broad Microsoft's reach can be in a huge  
nation where the Internet has posed touchy policy questions for 
authorities who are at once encouraging its growth while also 
trying to keep tight controls on information. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite various controls and threats to information  
dissemination in China, Internet use has soared. Users topped 2.1 
million in 1998, a fourfold growth in a year, and another 1.5 
million accounts are expected to be opened this year. 
</P>
<P>
	High-tech analysts believe the growth is unstoppable.  
</P>
<P>
	A public relations adviser for Microsoft, Jenny Liu, would not  
say how many customers Microsoft is hoping to get in China. Nor 
would Microsoft discuss how much money it is investing in deals it 
was signing Wednesday with seven companies on the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's venture is the second of its kind in China for the  
U.S. software giant. 
</P>
<P>
	The first such Microsoft project was launched late last year in  
Shanghai but offers its services only through small, handheld 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Piracy of software and other Western high-tech items is a  
perennial problem in China, but Microsoft said Wednesday that in 
its latest dealings it has signed an anti-piracy agreement with 
Shenzhen, a booming southern border city not far from Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft will provide software for the Shenzhen government so  
it can go online. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal comes at a time when the Chinese government has been  
seeking to control the Internet and other innovative forms of 
telecommunications and multimedia services both for the sake of 
profit and to block the use of such services for political dissent.

<HEADLINE> Ewing Has Sore Achilles Tendon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Patrick Ewing took himself out of the New York  
Knicks' game Tuesday night against the Milwaukee Bucks when his 
sore Achilles tendon flared up just 29 seconds into the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing was taken to a hospital for an MRI, and a team spokesman  
said he would not return to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing, who missed 56 games and the first round of the playoffs  
last season with a broken wrist, has been bothered by tendinitis in 
the left Achilles tendon for several days. He missed practice 
Monday and did not participate in the team's shootaround Tuesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Achilles has been bothering me,'' Ewing said. ``I felt it  
pull and was concerned, so I took myself out of the game. I hope to 
return soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 13-year veteran and 11-time All-Star has been the Knicks'  
leading scorer and rebounder this season, averaging 17.9 points and 
10.1 boards. He averaged 28.3 points in New York's last three 
games, although he missed buzzer-beating shots that would have won 
two of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing also has been a defensive force, averaging 3.47 blocks,  
third in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Dudley replaced Ewing in the lineup and made his first  
shot 30 seconds later on a hook shot from the lane. They were 
Dudley's first points in 11 games.

<HEADLINE> The Day He Almost Stopped DiMaggio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Elden Auker still remembers that game  
back in the summer of 1941 when he almost stopped Joe DiMaggio. It 
was the day he nearly changed history, too. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio had already hit in 37 straight games, well on his way  
to a record 56. But Joltin' Joe, who died Monday, was 0-for-3 and 
down to his last-bat against the side-arming Auker and the St. 
Louis Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had struck him out the first two times and got him on a  
popup the third time,'' the 88-year-old Auker before a round of 
golf Tuesday. ``I thought I had his string stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York led 3-1 at the time, and DiMaggio was scheduled to bat  
fourth in the bottom of the eighth inning. With the game at Yankee 
Stadium, there likely would not be a ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	With one out, Red Rolfe walked. Tommy Henrich was up next, and  
he spoke with manager Joe McCarthy before stepping to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all saw him talking to McCarthy, but we didn't know what it  
was about,'' Auker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Henrich was worried that he might hit into a double play and  
deprive DiMaggio of one last chance. So Henrich bunted, bringing up 
DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no idea of what Joe's streak was at, whether it was 35  
or 36 or 40 games,'' Auker said. ``None of us on our side were 
making a big deal about it. It wasn't a legend back then. I just 
wanted to get him out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Auker recalled that DiMaggio hit a hard grounder that skipped  
off the left shoulder of third baseman Harlan Clift. The ball 
caromed into the outfield and it was scored a double, extending the 
streak to 38 games, three away from George Sisler's then-record of 
41. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to have pretty good success against him,'' Auker said.  
``He used to tell me that he had trouble picking up the ball the 
way I threw it underhanded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A few years later, he signed a picture to me,'' he said. ``He  
wrote, `To my friend Elden. A tough submarine to sink.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio went on to establish The Streak, the accomplishment  
that defined his career and an achievement that became a part of 
American history.

	Auker retired a year later after going 130-101 for Detroit, the  
Browns and Boston Red Sox. He was already a part of baseball 
history -- in 1934, while with Detroit, he lost to Dizzy Dean and 
the St. Louis Cardinals 11-0 in Game 7 of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Auker moved in 1974 to Vero Beach, spring training home of the  
Los Angeles Dodgers. He had not seen DiMaggio for 40 years or so, 
but three weeks ago attended a dinner with the Hall of Famer's 
brother, Dom, at Ted Williams' museum in Hernando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe was a gentleman, a good friend and a great ballplayer,''  
Auker said. ``He did so many things well on the field. And that 
hitting streak, that made him even more famous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, DiMaggio's streak almost got derailed that June day  
more than a half-century ago. If that had happened, who knows what 
his legacy would be? 
</P>
<P>
	``History,'' Auker said, ``would have been a lot different.''

<HEADLINE> Sony To Cut 17,000 Jobs by 2003 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Sony Corp. will cut its work force by 17,000 and  
slash the number of factories it operates worldwide in a sweeping 
restructuring designed make computers and video games a bigger part 
of its future business. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate Japan has been struggling with a stubborn recession at  
home and an economic crisis in Asia that has severely diminished 
demand in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike many of its competitors, however, Sony is still making  
money. But the company expects profits in the fiscal year ending 
this month to be almost one-third less than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially weak have been earnings on Sony's TVs, VCRs and  
portable stereos. Company executives believe making money on these 
goods will only grow more difficult, Sony president Nobuyuki Idei 
said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The organizational changes represent a bet that products such as  
computers, digital cameras and PlayStation video game consoles will 
be more important to the company's future than Walkman stereos and 
its well-known TVs. 
</P>
<P>
	The job cuts, equal to 10 percent of Sony's work force, are to  
be completed by March 2003. They will come mostly from limiting the 
number of new employees Sony hires each year instead of from 
layoffs, Idei said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony will close 15 manufacturing facilities around the world,  
leaving it with 55 plants by 2003, Idei said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts and restructuring at Sony are the latest in a string of  
similar announcements throughout Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's biggest computer maker, NEC Corp., said last month  
it will cut 15,000 jobs, or 9.7 percent of its work force, over the 
next three years as it struggles to recover from massive losses at 
its Packard Bell division.

<HEADLINE> Sears Settles Lawsuit for $72M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOFFMAN ESTATES, Ill. (AP) -- Sears, Roebuck and Co. has agreed  
settle a class-action lawsuit, by paying millions of dollars in 
cash and coupons to 11 million of its credit card holders. 
</P>
<P>
	The disagreement began when balances on credit cards were  
transferred to one of its subsidiaries, the Sears National Bank, 
Sears said Tuesday. The new bank increased the credit card's annual 
percentage rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Card holders said that was unfair. They claimed Sears had made a  
commitment to not increase the APR. But Sears said it didn't do 
anything wrong and that card holders didn't understand the 
company's information on the terms of the change in credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, which still must be approved in U.S.  
District Court, Sears will pay $72 million in cash and coupons to 
about 3 million customers -- or about $23.80 each. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined amount of cash and coupons is 50 percent of the  
estimated incremental APR class members have paid and are expected 
to pay as a result in the change in credit terms, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also calls for Sears to send coupons worth $7.50  
to all 11 million class members and to pay about $3 million for 
consumer counseling, protection and education, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears, based in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates, has 845  
full-line department stores and more than 2,000 off-the-mall stores 
nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Barbie Turns 40 on Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barbie turns 40 on Tuesday, but don't expect  
middle age to catch up on her anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the world's best-known doll is taking on a hip look as  
she enters her 40s. This year, she'll have a butterfly tattoo 
etched on her stomach and is hanging around with friends with nose 
rings. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbie-maker Mattel Inc. plans a year-long celebration for her  
40th birthday, and the festivities begin Tuesday with Barbie 
creator Ruth Handler ringing the opening bell of the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, there will be a 40th anniversary Barbie doll,  
modeled after the 1959 original; a Barbie rose by mail-order flower 
company Jackson &AMP; Perkins; and an official Barbie stamp by the U.S. 
Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The big birthday bash comes as Barbie doll sales have been  
sliding. Kids today stop playing with Barbie dolls at an earlier 
age, instead favoring high-tech toys, such as CD-ROMs and video 
games, clothes and makeup. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbie, however, remains the best-selling doll in the world,  
with sales about $2 billion a year. She's had more than 75 careers 
since was first introduced in 1959.

<HEADLINE> Klinsmann Trains With U.S. Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Even with Bruce Arena trying several new  
faces in his rebuilding of the U.S. national team, there was one 
appearance that was a shock to nearly everybody: Juergen Klinsmann. 
</P>
<P>
	The former German national team captain donned U.S. training  
attire and worked out with the American team for two 1 1/2-hour 
sessions Sunday, taking part in drills and small-sided scrimmages. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was like everybody else,'' U.S. Soccer Federation press  
officer Brian Remedi said. ``We had some fans watching and they 
didn't recognize him. He was totally low-key.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Klinsmann, who effectively retired from soccer after the World  
Cup, moved to the United States with his American wife and lives 
about 20 minutes from the U.S. training site at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. national team is preparing for its annual U.S. Cup  
tournament. On Thursday in Los Angeles, the United States plays 
Guatemala and Mexico plays Bolivia. On Saturday in San Diego, the 
Americans will take on Mexico, while Guatemala will meet Bolivia.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry To Play Game Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry's first appearance since  
undergoing colon cancer surgery last year can't come soon enough 
for the Yankees slugger. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited -- no question about it,'' Strawberry said Tuesday,  
one day before traveling to Fort Myers to play the Boston Red Sox. 
``I'm excited I'm able to get back on the field. I feel confident, 
that's the key -- having an aggressive attitude and playing the game 
as hard as you can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bothered by knee problems the past several years, Strawberry  
resumed his running program last Friday. He started taking batting 
practice last month and is making his return as Yankees designated 
hitter one week earlier than the team expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once my body told me I feel good, that's when I said go for  
it,'' he said. ``If my body didn't tell me I was feeling good, then 
I wouldn't be so anxious to play. I got to get out there. It's the 
only way I'm going to get it done. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things are moving in the right direction. I have no doubt I'll  
be ready by opening day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Strawberry still has several additional hurdles ahead before  
joining the Yankees in Oakland on April 5. He is not slated to play 
left field, where he is fighting Ricky Ledee, Shane Spencer and 
Chad Curtis for playing time, for approximately two weeks. 
Strawberry will also resume his weekly chemotherapy session on 
March 19, after a scheduled two week break. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having chemo is just a one day deal,'' said Strawberry, who  
will undergo the treatments through at least April. ``It's not a 
thing that hangs over my head the whole week. One day not feeling 
good and it's over the next day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry said he expects to feel ``a little rusty'' Wednesday.  
An added challenge will be going against Pedro Martinez, the 
scheduled Red Sox starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a good way to start back,'' Strawberry said. ``It  
doesn't matter. It's baseball. It's the same game ... that's the 
way I look at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Yankees first baseman Tino Martinez, who has slight  
swelling near his right eye after fouling a ball off his face 
Monday night, worked out and is scheduled to play Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Millionaire Gets Life Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A millionaire on Tuesday was sentenced to life  
in prison without parole for ordering the killings of two men who 
knew too much about his mob-style business operations. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury deliberated only one hour before announcing that  
Gurmeet Singh Dhinsa, who made a fortune with a chain of gas 
stations, would not be executed. 
</P>
<P>
	The same jury convicted Dhinsa, 36, last week on multiple  
racketeering charges, including rigging gas pumps to rip off 
customers, evading taxes and using deadly force to silence fellow 
Sikhs who threatened to expose him -- a capital offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Shargel, Dhinsa's attorney, said he will appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	Dhinsa arrived in the United States in 1982 from India's Punjab  
region and took a job pumping gas. He saved enough money to lease 
that gas station, then began opening others. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, his City Gas chain employed 300 people at 51  
stations in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware. Annual 
revenue topped $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But the city repeatedly cited Dhinsa for overcharging customers.  
In 1990, he was arrested in the kidnap-torture of one of his 
attendants. He served 90 days in jail on lesser charges. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, another City Gas employee vanished. When the employee's  
brother confronted Dhinsa, the businessman allegedly paid a 
criminal to kill the brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Dhinsa struck again in 1997, ordering the  
killing of a cab driver who was cooperating in an FBI investigation 
of City Gas.

<HEADLINE> Monica Yields Big Ratings for ABC / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barbara Walters' interview with Monica Lewinsky  
drew more than twice as many viewers as any other prime-time show 
show last week, giving ABC its best week in the ratings in nearly a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's 10.1 rating and 16 share for the week easily topped CBS,  
which had a 9.0 rating and 15 share, Nielsen Media Research said 
Tuesday. NBC was third with an 8.6 and 14. Fox had a 6.7 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
	The special Wednesday edition of ``20/20'' with Ms. Lewinsky,  
which had an average viewership of 48.5 million, came on the last 
day of the ``sweeps'' period, whose ratings are used to set local 
advertising rates. 
</P>
<P>
	It was ABC's best week since March 23, 1998, when it broadcast  
the Academy Awards, which were a big night for ``Titanic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC hadn't won any week in the ratings since November.  
</P>
<P>
	``Home Improvement,'' ending a two-part episode in which Jill  
had a hysterectomy, finished a strong fifth place in the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	With the sweeps period over, NBC reverted to reruns for its  
typically strong Thursday night lineup. That hurts the network's 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC won the evening news ratings with an 8.5. NBC had an 8.4 and  
CBS a 7.1. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of March 1-7, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: 
</P>
<P>
	``20/20,'' ABC, 33.4; ``Friends,'' NBC, 15.2; ``Touched by an  
Angel,'' CBS, 15.1; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 14.8; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 
14.3; ``Home Improvement,'' ABC, 14.3; ``Just Shoot Me'' Special, 
NBC 13.6; ``Jesse,'' NBC, 13.1; ``ER,'' NBC, 12.2; ``Drew Carey 
Show,'' ABC, 11.8.

<HEADLINE> IRS Can Give Wrong Answers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most of the time, the IRS is a fine place to  
get the answer to a sticky tax question. But the agency admits that 
15 percent of the answers given on its help line are wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	And the tax collectors aren't too sympathetic toward people who  
claim they made a mistake because they followed advice they got 
from the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the most part, the responsibility still lies with the  
taxpayer to file an accurate return,'' said Marilyn Soulsburg, 
acting IRS commissioner for customer service. ``That's why there's 
a bigger burden on us to make sure our quality is as high as it can 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A little more than half of American taxpayers had their returns  
professionally prepared last year, according to the IRS. Others are 
increasingly turning to computer tax software programs, which are 
modified each year to reflect changes in the tax code and ``ask'' 
people detailed questions about their finances. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS estimates that only 1 percent of returns done  
electronically contain errors, compared with 20 percent of those 
prepared on paper. 
</P>
<P>
	But millions of Americans still do their taxes with nothing more  
than a pencil, a calculator and a pot of coffee. If they get 
stumped, the IRS offers a variety of toll-free telephone lines to 
get answers. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS employs about 7,000 people in its toll-free telephone  
program, which expanded its 15,000 lines for the first time this 
year to seven days a week, 24 hours a day. Last year, almost 70 
million callers phoned the IRS for tax advice or to inquire about 
their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Medick, national director of the IRS telephone service,  
said the agency's own monitoring of calls indicates that last 
year's answers were accurate 85 percent of the time regarding tax 
law. For questions about individual taxpayer accounts, the accuracy 
rate was 90 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as 1995, the accuracy rate for both types of  
questions was placed at about 90 percent, but IRS recently switched 
to a centralized call monitoring system to replace the spot test 
calls made in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are always working to improve,'' Medick said. ``We have  
instant replay, so to speak, in the areas where we have the most 
difficulty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That ``replay'' includes bulletins sent to the 25 IRS phone  
service locations detailing areas of tax law where errors are more 
frequent. The IRS has also redoubled its training, but the 
expansion to a 24-hour system without additional staff has put a 
strain on the quality of its advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the same group of people working more hours, so we  
don't have the same skill base,'' Soulsburg said. 
</P>
<P>
	One other note: Although the taxpayer is ultimately responsible  
for all taxes, the IRS will forgive penalties if the problem is 
caused by their advice. Taxpayers who believe they were given bad 
guidance should contact the IRS to have any penalty deleted. 
</P>
<P>
	Another problem IRS has been working to overcome is the number  
of times taxpayers simply can't get through at all. A recent 
General Accounting Office report found that only about 51 percent 
of all calls were answered in 1997 -- and that was up 20 percent 
from the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the agency expanded from typical business hours to 16  
hours a day, seven days a week, and this year calls are answered 
round-the-clock all week during tax filing season -- from the 
beginning of January through mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've given people more opportunities to get through at  
different times,'' Soulsburg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another free option for taxpayers with computers is the IRS site  
on the Internet -- www.irs.ustreas.gov -- that includes thousands of 
pages of tax publications and forms. The site, visited more than 
340 million times in fiscal 1998, provides answers to frequently 
asked questions and features alerts to any widespread tax problems. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other alternatives. IRS tax help, including  
face-to-face contact, is available at 400 agency offices around the 
country, with 250 of them open Monday through Saturday through 
April 10. Taxpayers should call the IRS for more information.

	SOTO CANO AIR BASE, Honduras (AP) -- President Clinton praised  
U.S. troops today for leading military relief efforts in 
hurricane-slammed Central America. He said they helped repair a 
legacy of mistrust bred by decades of U.S. involvement in coups and 
civil wars. ``You have shown the people of Central America the true 
colors of our men and women in uniform,'' Clinton told several 
hundred men and women at this base. But Clinton will be forced to 
deal with the lingering impression of U.S. intrusion in Central 
America's affairs when he goes to Guatemala tomorrow. The 
U.S.-backed army was blamed for the deaths or disappearance of 
200,000 people during a 36-year civil war in that country.

	``The point of our mailings is not to convince people they've  
won a sweepstakes, but rather to be excited about the possibility 
of winning and to consider our products,'' Naomi Bernstein, vice 
president of marketing services for American Family Enterprises, 
said in written testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to her company, which features Dick Clark and Ed  
McMahon in its mailings, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on 
Investigations is listening to representatives of Publishers 
Clearing House, Time Inc. and The Reader's Digest Association Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Company representatives have hired some of Washington's top  
lobbying firms to convince lawmakers they have voluntarily changed 
their mailings. They contend they have taken vulnerable individuals 
off their mailing lists, clearly state the odds of winning and 
leave no doubt that purchasers and those buying nothing have equal 
chances to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have behaved ethically and honorably in dealing with our  
customers and the general public,'' said the written statement of 
Deborah J. Holland, senior vice president of Publishers Clearing 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, ranking committee Democrat Carl  
Levin of Michigan and others have sponsored legislation to impose 
strict nationwide standards on the sweepstakes industry and levy 
hefty fines for violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Davenport, senior vice president of The Reader's Digest  
Association, said in his written statement that a study of 
purchasing habits by his company ``strongly indicates that the vast 
majority of RDA's customers understand ... that no purchase is 
necessary to enter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, Levin and Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., joined witnesses  
Monday in calling the mailings deceptive because they give 
Americans -- especially the elderly, who have difficulty seeing the 
small print -- the clear impression they have won a big prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bernstein said that her company, better known as American  
Family Publishers, ``does not target any demographic groups, nor do 
we collect demographic information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The industry has expressed general support for federal  
regulation of sweepstakes mailings but left unclear whether it 
would fight the legislation. Ms. Bernstein said her company ``does 
have concerns about the specific wording of some provisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Long, executive vice president of Time Inc., denied in  
her statement that many Americans were lured into emptying their 
wallets and savings to buy magazines and other products. She said 
that ``85.6 percent of the individuals who subscribe through our 
sweepstakes promotions bought from us only once in 1998,'' and 
``98.4 percent of these subscribers ordered between one and three 
times in 1998.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time, she said, has ``preliminary concerns'' with the  
legislation and added that the company already complies with 
several key provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, five witnesses described experiences of elderly  
parents or in-laws who spent much of their savings pursuing prizes 
but never winning. A sixth witness, Eustace A. Hall, 65, of 
Brandon, Fla., broke down sobbing as he related how he repeatedly 
entered sweepstakes contests and bought the products in the belief 
that the purchases would bolster his chances of winning -- and 
helping his daughter through law school. 
</P>
<P>
	The witnesses complained about large type listing someone as a  
``guaranteed winner,'' small type showing nearly insurmountable 
odds and computer-generated language that sounded as if the 
recipient were receiving a personal letter.

<HEADLINE>  Fans, Colleagues Recall Joltin' Joe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	To those who knew him and to those who only admired him from  
afar, Joe DiMaggio was the quintessential American hero. 
</P>
<P>
	``The very mention of his name personifies class, dignity,  
elegance and professionalism, both on and off the field,'' said Tim 
McCarver, who spent two decades as a catcher and is a top baseball 
broadcaster. 
</P>
<P>
	In mid-century, when baseball stood above all American sports,  
DiMaggio symbolized what fans loved about the game. Fifty years 
later, he had lost little of his star quality. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe DiMaggio is baseball. He's a national hero,'' said Sandra  
De Santis, whose 11-year-old son Gregory placed a bouquet of 
flowers at Legends Field in Tampa, Fla., on Monday before a Yankees 
spring training game. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio also was a precursor of the modern athlete. In 1948, he  
signed the first $100,000 contract, and the paper and pen from that 
deal went on display Monday at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	And like Michael Jordan a half-century later, he was the most  
credible commercial spokesman in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Long after he retired, he was instantly recognizable in ads for  
Mr. Coffee. Even today, when those who saw him play are in their 
late 50s or beyond, a bank that retained his services has a sign 
with a ``5'' in pinstripes at Grand Central station in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Few have to ask what that means.  
</P>
<P>
	He was the reason many Italian-Americans in New York rooted for  
the Yankees, just as blacks rooted for the Brooklyn Dodgers because 
they made Jackie Robinson the first black major-leaguer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Williams, who played in the Boston outfield next to  
DiMaggio's brother, Dom, was the contemporary most often likened to 
the Yankee Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no one Ted Williams admired, respected and envied  
more than Joe DiMaggio,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Ripken of the Baltimore Orioles, a beloved player who  
shattered the consecutive games streak of Lou Gehrig, a former 
DiMaggio teammate, said: 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fortunate and lucky that I had the opportunity to talk  
baseball with him. I'm a baseball fan, and his accomplishments 
speak for themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even those who never saw him play sensed DiMaggio's majesty.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of the best in the game,'' said Mark McGwire, a  
modern-day larger-than-life hero who never got a chance to meet 
DiMaggio. ``It's a big loss for the game and for life in general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Wells, a pitcher for the Toronto Blue Jays, grew up a  
Yankee fan and met DiMaggio during his two seasons with the 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got the opportunity to talk with him and just sit there and  
see what he was all about -- it's something I will never forget,'' 
Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like millions of kids who grew up dreaming about baseball, Wells  
even entertained a vision of staring down Joltin' Joe. Asked how he 
would pitch to him, Wells replied: ``High and tight.''

<HEADLINE> Two Referees for NHL Playoff Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NHL will use two referees in all playoff  
games this season, satisfied with the way the format worked in 
selected games during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	The league instituted the change in October and every NHL team  
played 10 home and 10 road games with two referees and two 
linesman, instead of just one referee as in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL senior vice president Colin Campbell said club executives  
were ``overwhelmingly in support'' of the two-referee system for 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the system was phased in during the regular season, the  
games had a quicker pace, interference was reduced, and improper 
conduct behind the play was controlled,'' Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason for the change was to attempt to decrease fighting  
and other penalties. One referee is able to make sure players stay 
within the rules away from the puck while the other skates ahead of 
the rush up ice.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Blames Politicians for Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan blames  
politicians in Washington -- not the American people -- for the U.S. 
failure to pay $1.3 billion in arrears to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have spent too much time with ordinary Americans ... to  
blame them for their government's inability to honor its 
obligations to the United Nations,'' he said Tuesday. ``The problem 
is in Washington, and only Washington can solve it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Annan made his comments in a speech to the United Nations  
Association of the United States of America, which is spearheading 
a new campaign to lobby support across the country and in Congress 
to pay the debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign announced Monday that Ted Turner's United Nations  
Foundation has allocated $12 million over the next two years for 
the lobbying effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, President Clinton vetoed legislation that would have  
paid off a chunk of the U.S. arrears because of what he called 
unrelated abortion restrictions tacked on to the bill by 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	The amendment would bar U.S. funds from being used to support  
international family-planning groups that lobby foreign governments 
to liberalize their abortion laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has previously held up payments of U.N. debts to demand  
a reduction in the U.S. share of the budget and a streamlining of 
the world organization. Annan claims he has largely come through 
with the demanded reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary-general, who held talks with Clinton and  
congressional leaders in Washington last month, said he welcomed 
new efforts to tackle U.S. arrears and hoped they succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last two years, I have sought to convince Washington  
of the need to put the issue of the U.S. arrears behind us, once 
and for all -- above all, for Washington's own sake,'' Annan said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the association's public activities would help to ensure  
``that America's role in the United Nations of the next century 
will be as vital as it has been in the century we are about to 
leave.''

<HEADLINE> Whitney Has Alcorn Back in NCAAs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Davey Whitney needed just three years to  
get Alcorn State back into the NCAA tournament. Now he faces the 
nearly impossible task. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15th-seeded Braves (23-6) play Pac-10 champion Stanford  
(25-6), the second seed in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an invitation to disaster,'' said Whitney, the  
69-year-old coach who came out of retirement to revive the program 
he led to three NCAA appearances in the first half of the 1980s, 
the last in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this stage, we are just happy to be among the 64 teams,  
when 260-odd teams are not even playing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't take that as Whitney conceding a first-round loss.  
</P>
<P>
	After all, he was the first coach to lead a historically black  
team to an NCAA victory when the Braves beat South Alabama 70-62 in 
the opening round of the 1980 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	A year earlier, Alcorn upset Mississippi State 80-78 in a  
first-round NIT game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know something, you are not defeated until you play,''  
Whitney said. ``It can be an invitation to disaster either way, a 
disaster if they whip us too bad and more of a disaster if they 
lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alcorn, which got an automatic bid by winning the Southwestern  
Athletic Conference tournament title, has no player taller than 
6-foot-8. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford has all five starters back from last year's Final Four  
team. The Cardinal features a front line of a 7-2 center and 
forwards at 6-9 and 6-7. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have match up size-wise,'' Whitney said. ``We'll have  
to find a way to neutralize their size with our speed if we stand a 
chance against them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of the outcome, this was the kind of revival Alcorn  
officials were hoping for when they recalled Whitney to the Lorman 
campus in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitney had been fired by a previous administration in 1989  
after three straight losing seasons, including a pair of 5-23 
records. But he had led Alcorn to 17 straight winning seasons, nine 
SWAC titles, three NCAAs and two NITs. 
</P>
<P>
	The two coaches that followed Whitney were a combined 57-135 in  
seven seasons. And it was during that time that the NCAA cited the 
program for seven violations, including allegations that impostors 
took college entrance exams for players. 
</P>
<P>
	Until this year, the Braves had just one winning season since  
capturing its ninth SWAC title under Whitney in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been through so much from losing teams and coaching  
changes and everything, to finally get it right feels good,'' said 
senior guard Reuben Stiff, a four-year starter and Alcorn's leading 
scorer (12.8 ppg). 
</P>
<P>
	When Whitney returned three years ago, he said his goal was to  
get the program on track and ``have someone replace me as quickly 
as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitney, 496-301 in 28 seasons (23 at Alcorn), is not saying if  
this will be his last dance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be soon. I haven't gone through that  
decision-making process, but not any wins or losses will determine 
it,'' Whitney said. ``It will be when the program is really on 
sound footing, and it's really not sound. It's almost there.''

<HEADLINE> Espy To Advise Energy Department </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy is  
returning to the Clinton administration in a part-time, nonpaying 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	Espy will serve as a senior adviser to the Department of Energy.  
He was acquitted in December on 30 charges based on his acceptance 
of gifts from companies regulated by his former department. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be willing to serve in any capacity if the administration  
desires my help,'' Espy said Monday night while addressing the 
Mississippi Association for Educators, which gave him a civil 
rights award. 
</P>
<P>
	Espy, who plans to continue practicing law in Jackson, agreed to  
the appointment this month after deciding not to seek a statewide 
office in Mississippi.

<HEADLINE> Quebec Budget Doesn't Back Expos </HEADLINE>

	QUEBEC (AP) -- Quebec's finance minister didn't miss a beat  
Tuesday when asked why the province's new budget provided millions

spending $4 million for a fine arts museum and $3.3 million for the 
the Montreal Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>

breaks to the Expos, who may move to the United States after this 
season unless there is some public financing for a new stadium.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Expands Presence in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHENZHEN, China (AP) -- Microsoft Corp., eyeing a restricted but  
rapidly growing Internet market in mainland China, plans to start 
offering systems to let the Chinese download movies, music, e-mail 
and other services through computers, televisions and VCD players. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will really open up Internet usage in a dramatic way,''  
Microsoft chairman and chief executive Bill Gates said at a signing 
ceremony in this booming southern border city not far from Hong 
Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft is banking on electronics manufacturers to install the  
necessary hardware in their products that are distributed across 
China. The end-users of services provided by the so-called 
``Venus'' project will get connected to the Internet in a 
partnership between Microsoft and China Telecom. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear how broad Microsoft's reach can be in a huge  
nation where the Internet has posed touchy policy questions for 
authorities who are at once encouraging its growth while also 
trying to keep tight controls on information. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite various controls and threats to information  
dissemination in China, Internet use has soared. Users topped 2.1 
million in 1998, a fourfold growth in a year, and another 1.5 
million accounts are expected to be opened this year. 
</P>
<P>
	High-tech analysts believe the growth is unstoppable.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sooner or later, technology will find a way to circumvent  
restrictions,'' said Charle Peza, a telecommunications analyst at 
the Hong Kong office of investment bank Salomon Smith Barney. ``The 
policy direction in China seems to be one of opening up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A public relations adviser for Microsoft, Jenny Liu, would not  
say how many customers Microsoft is hoping to get in China. Nor 
would Microsoft discuss how much money it is investing in deals it 
was signing today with seven companies on the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's venture is the second of its kind in China for the  
U.S. software giant. 
</P>
<P>
	The first such Microsoft project was launched late last year in  
Shanghai but offers its services only through small, handheld 
computers. The Shanghai version was developed using entirely 
Western technology; on the new venture, Microsoft says it is using 
technology jointly developed by Western and Chinese experts at its 
research facility in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Piracy of software and other Western high-tech items is a  
perennial problem in China, but Microsoft said that in its latest 
dealings it has signed an anti-piracy agreement with Shenzhen, a 
booming southern border city not far from Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft will provide software for the Shenzhen government so  
it can go online. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal comes at a time when the Chinese government has been  
seeking to control the Internet and other innovative forms of 
telecommunications and multimedia services both for the sake of 
profit and to block the use of such services for political dissent. 
</P>
<P>
	China has passed laws to keep pornography -- and material that  
the government views as subversive -- off the Internet. Special 
computer crime squads have been set up. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the government in Beijing has encouraged the rapid  
spread of Internet use in China -- assuming service providers follow 
the rules, such as registering customers with the authorities.

<HEADLINE> German Joblessness Rises Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NUREMBERG, Germany (AP) -- A key unemployment indicator suggested  
Tuesday that Germany's jobs crisis may be easing, providing 
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder with a bit of good news. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's central bank reported that the seasonally adjusted  
jobless rate dipped to 10.5 percent in February from 10.6 percent 
the month before. The Bundesbank data are a closely watched labor 
market index. 
</P>
<P>
	The news didn't keep the opposition from blasting Schroeder, who  
pledged during last year's election campaign to give top priority 
to lowering joblessness and faces a slowing German economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no sign of the turnaround in the job market promised  
by the new government,'' charged lawmaker Paul Friedhoff of the 
pro-business Free Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	They pointed to a separately-released government report, which  
is not adjusted for long-term seasonal variations, that found the 
jobless rate rose slightly to 11.6 percent from 11.5 percent in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Labor Office said some 4.46 million Germans were out  
of work in February -- 9,700 more than in January. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Federation of German Labor Unions, a key ally of the  
4-month-old center-left government, took a positive view, stressing 
that unemployment now was ``remarkably stable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labor Office president Bernhard Jagoda said the latest rise in  
the actual number of jobless was due mainly to a cold February. He 
said he expects ``a clear drop in jobless'' in March. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, the jobless rate remained a steady 9.7 percent in  
western Germany, but rose slightly to 19.1 percent, from 18.9 
percent in January, in the eastern states. The figures were not 
seasonally adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
	The main opposition Christian Democrats charged that the  
government's months of wavering over changes in business taxes had 
hurt investor confidence and was killing jobs. 
</P>

	But Jagoda said Germany's high unemployment was a legacy of the  
previous government of Helmut Kohl and that the new

<HEADLINE> Steven Tyler Sues His Ex-Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Steven Tyler, lead singer of the rock band  
Aerosmith, has sued his ex-wife in an attempt to make her return 
photographs taken of him in the nude. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyler, whose last name is Tallarico, said Kathleen Tallarico was  
supposed to give him the photos as part of their divorce agreement 
in 1987. Last summer, he said he saw a news item indicating she 
planned to publish ``pornographic'' pictures in a memoir. 
</P>
<P>
	State Supreme Court Justice Walter Tolub on Monday granted a  
temporary restraining order that blocks publication of the 
photographs until the issue is settled at trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tallarico, an actress, intended to use the photos in the  
paperback edition of a book about her life titled ``Dream On,'' 
said her lawyer, Jay Butterman. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyler's lawyer, Stanford Lotwin, said the next step is a trial  
where ``we'll try to get Steven's property back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyler, 50, said in court papers that publication of the photos  
would embarrass and harm him, and she has no right to use pictures 
of him for commerce without his permission. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tallarico said she gave Tyler all of his personal  
photographs at the time of the divorce agreement and that the 
dispute centers on ``one of two campy photographs that he and I 
took of each other ... in the buff.''

<HEADLINE> Spacecraft Begins Mapping of Mars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Mars Global Surveyor has finally begun  
mapping the red planet, turning an array of instruments on Earth's 
dusty neighbor a year later than originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``All our instruments are on now,'' flight operations manager  
Joseph Beerer said Tuesday at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft, which started its primary mission Monday  
afternoon, has a camera to make wide- and narrow-angle images of 
Mars, and a laser altimeter to measure surface features by bouncing 
pulses of light off the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	It also carries a spectrometer to scan for heat transferred from  
the planet to the atmosphere and to map mineral composition, and a 
magnetometer to gather data that can be used to understand the 
interior of Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft has already delivered a preview of the science  
portion of its mission. It has sent back detailed images of such 
features as 16-mile-high Olympus Mons and the planet's ancient 
water and lava flows. 
</P>
<P>
	The surveyor was launched in November 1996 and went into orbit  
around Mars in September 1997. It was supposed to begin its primary 
mapping mission a year ago after using a process called aerobraking 
to tighten its orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Mapping had to be put off for a year because a damping mechanism  
on one of its two solar panels did not operate properly when it was 
deployed and controllers decided to avoid stressing the part by a 
gradual aerobraking. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite is in a two-hour orbit. Instruments will gather  
data during nine of each day's orbits and then the spacecraft will 
be turned to point its antenna at Earth to transmit that data 
during three orbits, Beerer said.

<HEADLINE> Court Considers Reno Probe of Starr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr passed up  
an opportunity to try to fend off a Justice Department 
investigation into his handling of the Monica Lewinsky probe. 
</P>
<P>
	In court papers filed Monday, Starr and the Justice Department  
offered no encouragement for three federal judges to step into the 
question of whether Attorney General Janet Reno can investigate 
Starr's conduct of the Monica Lewinsky investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The department says the three-judge panel which appointed Starr  
has no authority to intervene. Independent Counsel Starr says the 
conservative group that raised the issue with the judges has no 
standing to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr emphasized that his filing did not address the underlying  
issue of whether Reno ``acted improperly'' in moving toward an 
investigation of his office. That might leave the door ajar for 
Starr to argue later that Reno is acting improperly. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges directed Reno and Starr last month to submit written  
arguments after receiving a request from Landmark Legal Foundation 
of Herndon, Va., which wanted the court to block the Justice 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr and the Justice Department have been involved in a dispute  
over who should investigate the prosecutor's handling of the 
Lewinsky investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Among questions to be investigated are contacts Starr and his  
prosecutors had with lawyers for Paula Jones in her sexual 
harassment lawsuit against President Clinton. Also under scrutiny 
would be prosecutors' conduct at a Jan. 16, 1998, confrontation 
with Ms. Lewinsky, when they discussed a possible immunity deal for 
her without her lawyer present. Justice Department guidelines 
generally require the lawyer's presence. 
</P>
<P>
	Landmark Legal Foundation ``has no personal stake in the alleged  
dispute'' and ``no injury to Landmark is ... traceable to the 
attorney general's alleged actions,'' said Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	In its court papers, the Justice Department argued that the  
panel of judges ``lacks authority'' to stop the attorney general 
from investigating Starr and that the private group's application 
for a writ of prohibition against Reno should be dismissed. The 
department further argued that it seems clear the law authorizes 
Reno to police Starr's conduct because the law explicitly gives her 
power to fire him. 
</P>
<P>
	Landmark maintains only Congress can investigate Starr.  
</P>
<P>
	Nothing grants the judges ``authority to prohibit the attorney  
general from inquiring into whether `good cause' exists to remove'' 
Starr, the Justice Department said in court papers filed by 
Solicitor General Seth Waxman. 
</P>
<P>
	The department stated that the only legal provision cited by the  
private group referring to the judges' authority relates to another 
subject entirely -- the scope of the prosecutor's investigative 
jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Landmark president Mark Levin said the group's standing to bring  
the matter before the court was irrelevant because ``this is a case 
where the special division'' of judges ``exercises its own 
supervisory powers to ensure the integrity of the investigative 
process.''

<HEADLINE> Figurine Playsets Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chariot Victor Publishing is recalling about  
44,000 of its figurine playsets, the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission said Monday. The VeggieTales' Dave and the Giant Pickle 
playsets have figure parts that can come loose, posing a choking 
hazard for children. 
</P>
<P>
	The government and the Colorado Springs, Colo.-based company are  
aware of one report of a 2-year-old child found with a plastic plug 
from the playset in his mouth. According to the CPSC, six of the 
character figurines have plastic plugs in their base that can come 
out. The French Peas figurine also poses a choking hazard because 
of its size and shape. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries have been reported.  
</P>
<P>
	The playsets contain 10 figurines based on the ``Dave and the  
Giant Pickle!'' video. The sets include figurines depicting 
asparagus, peas, a grape, gourds and a pickle. They were sold in a 
mostly blue box showing scenes from the video. The product number 
is SPCN 9834501358 and is on the back of the box under the UPC 
code. 
</P>
<P>
	Major Christian bookstores and catalog companies sold these  
playsets nationwide from September 1998 through February 1999 for 
about $20. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers should immediately take the figurines and return them  
to Chariot Victor Publishing for free replacements. The company 
will reimburse consumers' postage charges. 
</P>
<P>
	For more information, consumers can call the company at  
1-800-743-2514 between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m. EST Monday through Friday. 
Consumers can also write the company at: Chariot Victor Publishing, 
4050 Lee Vance View, Colorado Springs, Colo., 80918.

<HEADLINE> Edison Brothers Files Chapter 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Edison Brothers Stores Inc. filed for  
bankruptcy protection today because of severe competition and 
disappointing operating results, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Edison, a national retail discount chain that sells apparel and  
footwear, had said Monday that it would file for bankruptcy 
protection in Delaware under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Code. 
</P>
<P>
	The filing will enable Edison to keep operating under a court's  
supervision while it develops a plan for returning to solvency, to 
facilitate a restructuring or a sale of all or parts of the retail 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Edison officials said they have no plans to lay off workers in  
its stores and distribution centers, although officials said 250 
positions at its headquarters had been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Edison emerged from a previous Chapter 11 reorganization in  
September 1997, and a new management team took over the company in 
January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Edison operates Bakers and Wild Pair footwear stores, 5-7-9  
junior apparel stores, Riggings, JW, Coda and Repp Ltd., Big and 
Tall menswear stores and Repp by Mail men's catalog.

<HEADLINE> White House Targets Farm Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cattle feedlots and large hog and poultry  
farms will face tighter regulations under a new national water 
pollution control strategy from the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	But some of the more stringent requirements, including  
compliance with permits under tougher federal standards, would not 
go into effect for several years under the plan, some 
environmentalists complained. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal strategy for reducing nutrient runoff into waterways  
from large, concentrated agricultural facilities was being 
announced today by Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists briefed by the plan on Monday said it does not  
go far enough to address the severe problems of pollution from 
thousands of large ``factory farms'' including poultry producers, 
hog farms and cattle feedlots. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will not solve the growing problem of factory farm  
pollution soon enough,'' said Robbin Marks of the Natural Resources 
Defense Council. The environmentalists said the government should 
impose a moratorium on permits for such facilities and move to 
close open-air waste lagoons at such sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said the plan will require thousands of  
additional facilities to get permits and develop nutrient 
management plans. While the regulations will not go into effect 
until after 2001, thousands of additional operators will have to 
get permits under existing standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``This comprehensive strategy tackles a major threat to water  
quality. Through tough standards and flexible new approaches, we 
can ensure communities across the country cleaner, safer water,'' 
Gore planned to tell environmental and agricultural leaders at a 
meeting at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The broad outline is similar to a draft version released last  
September and is aimed at providing the blueprint for new 
regulations to control runoff from feed lots, large hog farms and 
poultry farms. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency is to develop the new  
technology standards for reducing pollution, mostly nutrient runoff 
into lakes and streams. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, called it ``a giant leap toward holding  
the biggest livestock producers accountable for water pollution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But environmentalists were not as enthusiastic.  
</P>
<P>
	``It does nothing in the near-term to address the serious  
shortcomings of current animals waste practices,'' said Joe Rudek, 
a scientists for the Environmental Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathryn Hohmann of the Sierra Club said the plan provides ``no  
real protection of groundwater'' and will do little to address air 
pollution from such facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of cleaning up, the plan will have many of the largest  
factory farms writing up strategies for storing and disposing large 
volumes of manure, based on existing federal waste management 
standards and practices,,'' said the Environmental Defense Fund in 
a statement.

<HEADLINE> Crude Gains on Possible Cuts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures gained a second day Tuesday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange, but finished well off early highs, as market 
participants tried to determine how serious world oil producers are 
about ending a global supply glut. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, coffee and coffee futures advanced.  
</P>
<P>
	Crude matched four-month highs reached a day earlier as  
investors struggled over whether the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries would at its March 23 meeting in Vienna propose 
additional output cuts in a bid to shore up prices. 
</P>
<P>
	There was talk oil ministers had agreed on Iran's production  
targets, a move that could pave the way for a new round of cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past year, world oil producers have removed about 3  
million barrels daily from the market, but analysts have said that 
has been mitigated by increased output from Iraq and cheating among 
those who have pledged cuts. And beyond that, some say demand is so 
weak that at least 1.2 million barrels daily above the 3 million 
would need to be cut to significantly increase prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude also rose in nervous trading tied to the late-afternoon  
release of industry group American Petroleum Institute's weekly 
inventory data. Investors were taken by surprise last week when the 
group reported a sharp decline in crude inventories, which erased 
what had been a long year-over-year surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy futures have suffered for months as overproduction  
combined with back-to-back mild winters in major U.S. heating 
regions torpedoed prices and sharply reduce oil companies' profit 
margins. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil for April delivery rose 22 cents, or 1.6 percent, to  
$13.85 a barrel, the highest since Nov. 6; April unleaded gasoline 
rose 0.29 cent to 42.90 cents a gallon; April heating oil rose 0.23 
cent to 36 cents a gallon; April natural gas rose 7 cents to $1.929 
for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures rose sharply on the Board of Trade of the City of  
New York amid concern about the state of the midseason crop in 
Colombia, the world's largest producer of the gourmet-style arabica 
beans favored by American consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia growers are reporting the Mitaca, or mid-crop coffee  
harvest, may be as much as 20 percent lower than last year's 
harvest following heavy rains during the crucial flowering period. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants also bid prices higher as freight workers in  
Colombia considered striking, a move that would delay shipments. 
While the peak consumption period in both Europe and the United 
States is winding down, roasters in recent weeks have let 
inventories dwindle as they sat on the sidelines awaiting lower 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	May arabica coffee rose 2.05 cents to $1.062 a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Copper gained on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid a third  
day of sharp declines in warehouse supplies, buoying optimism that 
recent demand weakness may be reversing itself. 
</P>
<P>
	The London Metal Exchange reported inventories in its warehouses  
fell 1,550 metric tons overnight Monday to 697,050 metric tons, 
with most of that coming out of Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants pointed to heavy buying out of South Korea  
and China, which could be a sign that economic weakness in Asia may 
be showing some signs of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper is used in wiring and plumbing, mainly in the  
construction sector, but has seen its fortunes fade after global 
economic troubles sharply curtailed demand in what had been the 
fastest-growing region of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	May high-grade copper rose .45 cent to 63.10 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Nebraska Probes E. Coli Outbreak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEARNEY, Neb. (AP) -- A hazardous strain of E. coli bacteria has  
sickened at least six people, and six additional cases are 
suspected. 
</P>
<P>
	State health and agriculture had not yet determined the source  
of the infections. 
</P>
<P>
	The people affected ranged in age from 6 to 74, said state  
Epidemiologist Thomas Safranek. Two people were hospitalized, but 
he said they did not appear to be critically ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The contamination probably occurred about two weeks ago and  
could have involved just about any food, state Foods Division 
Administrator George Hanssen said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bacteria was identified as E. coli O157:H7, a strain that in  
severe cases can cause kidney failure and death. Last November, 
possible contamination with that strain led to the recall of 
600,000 pounds of frozen ground beef patties from a Chicago 
processing plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The same strain sickened hundreds of patrons of fast food  
restaurants in the West in 1993; at least four died in that 
outbreak.

<HEADLINE> New Heart Attack Drugs Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Two new clot-busting drugs appear to be as  
effective as TPA, the standard medicine for treating heart attacks, 
but much easier to administer. 
</P>
<P>
	TPA, Genentech Inc.'s flagship medicine, revolutionized the  
treatment of heart attacks, the nation's biggest killer. When given 
within a few hours of the start of pain, it dissolves the clot that 
chokes off the heart's blood supply, preventing permanent damage. 
</P>
<P>
	A major drawback of TPA is that it must be given as a continuous  
90-minute infusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, two new drugs have been developed that are equally potent  
clot dissolvers, and they can be given as quick single injections. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say the new drugs are likely to mean that heart attack  
victims can be treated faster, perhaps even before they reach the 
hospital, and this may save more lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Results of major studies with the two drugs were presented  
Tuesday in New Orleans at a meeting of the American College of 
Cardiology. 
</P>
<P>
	The drugs are lanoteplase, developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb  
Co., and tenecteplase, developed by Genentech and Boehringer 
Ingelheim. In the studies, both drugs were compared against TPA but 
not against each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all anxious to move beyond TPA,'' said Dr. Robert  
Califf of Duke University, who was not involved in the new studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenecteplase was tested on 16,950 patients in 29 countries.  
Deaths after one month were an identical 6.2 percent in patients 
getting tenecteplase or TPA. 
</P>
<P>
	Lanoteplase was tested on 15,078 patients in 35 countries. After  
30 days, 6.8 percent getting lanoteplase had died, compared with 
6.6 percent getting TPA. This difference was not statistically 
meaningful. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think more patients will be treated more effectively with a  
simpler treatment,'' said Dr. Paul Armstrong of the University of 
Alberta, one of the tenecteplase researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither new drug is available yet for routine use. Both studies  
were designed to persuade the Food and Drug Administration to 
approve the medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	TPA costs about $2,200 per patient. The companies have not  
announced how much they will charge for the new drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	TPA, short for tissue plasminogen activator, is a genetically  
engineered version of a natural clot-dissolving protein. The two 
new drugs are slightly modified versions of the same protein.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Mob Prosecutor Weisman Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Herman L. Weisman, a former New  
York prosecutor who took on the likes of mobsters Lucky Luciano and 
Bugsy Siegel, has died at 95. 
</P>
<P>
	Weisman, who died on Sunday, was a Harvard Law graduate who won  
appointment to special posts in the New York attorney general's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	He helped prosecute members of Murder Inc., a gang of contract  
killers organized by Luciano and Siegel. The organization consisted 
of at least nine killers at one point. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was little more than a baby, I remember a big black  
limousine and detectives with guns at their hips picking him up and 
taking him to court,'' recalled his son Edward Weisman. ``He needed 
protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, in private practice, the elder Weisman counted Eleanor  
Roosevelt among his clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Weisman also served as president of several Zionist  
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Economic Study Group Meets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- More than 2 1/2 years before the probable start of  
labor negotiations, baseball owners convened their latest economic 
study committee. 
</P>
<P>
	A former Senate Majority Leader and former chairman of the  
Federal Reserve were on hand Monday as baseball officials began a 
long-term discussion of the sport's fiscal disparity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too early in the process to have any idea what direction  
the group is going to go in,'' said Colorado Rockies owner Jerry 
McMorris, a vice chairman of the ``blue ribbon task force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some owners, particularly those in small markets, are calling  
for owners to again press for a salary cap. That proposal led to a 
32-day spring training lockout in 1990 and a 232-day strike in 
1994-95 -- which caused the first cancellation of the World Series 
in 90 years. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen team officials attended Monday's meeting at  
the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of ideas and thoughts to go through,''  
commissioner Bud Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1990 lockout, owners and players jointly appointed an  
economic study committee, which recommended increased revenue 
sharing among the teams, but no cap. This time, owners set up the 
group on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve from August  
1979-August 1987 and an owners' pick for the last study committee, 
is on the panel along with former Sen. George Mitchell, mentioned 
five years ago as a possible candidate for commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two outside members are Yale president Richard Levin,  
an economics professor who came up with baseball's original salary 
cap proposal during collective bargaining following the 1989 
season, and television commentator George Will, an author of two 
baseball books and a board member of the Baltimore Orioles and the 
San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the eight postseason teams all were among the 12  
highest payrolls, and the teams with the 12 lowest payrolls all 
finished with losing records. This year, the New York Yankees, 
Baltimore Orioles and Los Angeles Dodgers will start the season 
with payrolls approaching $90 million, while others such as 
Montreal will open between $10 million and $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's current collective bargaining agreement probably will  
expire after the 2001 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure there's all levels of people out there who have all  
different levels of concern,'' McMorris said. ``All we talked about 
today was the levels of disparity.''

<HEADLINE> Dustin Hoffman Lawyers Get $270,000 </HEADLINE>

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal judge ordered Los Angeles Magazine  
to pay $270,000 of Dustin Hoffman's legal fees for publishing a 
picture of the actor's head on the body of a cross-dressing man. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman's attorneys had sought $415,000.  
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman, 61, sued over the March 1997 fashion layout in which  
his face, as it appeared in ``Tootsie,'' was computer-grafted onto 
the body of a male model wearing a yellow evening gown and heels. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge in January ordered the magazine to pay Hoffman  
$3 million in damages. The publication's parent, ABC Inc., plans to 
appeal that judgment.

<HEADLINE> Educators Watch School Bill Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many educators say they're worried they will  
be left with too many kids per class and too many restrictive rules 
by the time Congress finishes work on an education bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans failed Monday evening in an attempt to limit  
the number of proposals that can be attached to the so-called 
``ed-flex'' bill, which would give states more flexibility in 
spending federal education dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats want the chance to vote on amendments including new  
money to pay for new teachers and reduce class size. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans were poised to try again today to limit debate on  
the bill. If that fails, they'll try to water down the Democrats' 
class-size proposal by giving states the option to spend the new 
money for teachers on special education. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania officials are eager to see the ``ed-flex'' bill  
approved as they face school districts that want to use federal 
money to train more reading teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They believe they've tackled the issue of math and science,''  
said Ron Tomalis of Pennsylvania's education department. ``But the 
federal regulations don't allow them the flexibility to address the 
needs of their kids. To us, this is a common sense way of looking 
at the delivery of education to our kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, a Republican, said many  
educators are frustrated that the bill, which started out popular 
and with wide bipartisan support, has become embroiled in partisan 
battles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opportunity to give more flexibility to the states will be  
imperiled if not lost if they keep playing politics,'' Ridge said 
in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since education emerged as a key issue in last November's  
congressional elections, lawmakers have been scrambling to take 
credit for action on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill is simply being held hostage by politics,'' said  
Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H. ``After someone goes out and takes another 
poll or does another focus group, I imagine we'll have more 
proposals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats say the haggling is actually a referendum on their  
proposals to reduce class size and hire new teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have offered as many different innovative ways with which to  
break this impasse as I can think of, short of just caving and 
giving up all of our rights as senators to offer education 
amendments on an education bill,'' said Democratic Senate leader 
Thomas Daschle of South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic amendments include a plan that would add to a  
$1.2 billion program passed last year to help the nation's school 
districts hire thousands of new teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have resisted putting issues such as the class size  
proposal into the ``ed-flex'' bill, saying they should be saved for 
later this year when Congress begins debating the reauthorization 
of another major education bill -- the Elementary and Secondary 
Education Act. 
</P>
<P>
	--------------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill number is S. 280

	U.S. Jets Bomb Iraqi Sites  
</P>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- U.S. fighter planes bombed several Iraqi  
air defense sites in the northern no-fly zone today, a U.S. 
military official said. Air Force F-15s fired laser-guided bombs in 
self-defense at Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery sites west and south 
of the city of Mosul, the official said. U.S. and British aircraft 
patrol no-fly zones over the north and south of Iraq, to protect 
the Kurdish minority and Shiite rebels. Iraq does not recognize the 
zones and has challenged the allied planes almost daily since 
mid-December, provoking retaliatory strikes.

	Fifth Death in Amoco Cancer Mystery  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A mysterious outbreak of brain cancer at BP Amoco  
PLC's suburban research center has claimed a fifth victim, oil 
company officials said. A company spokeswoman said the employee, 
who was not identified, was a chemical researcher at the Naperville 
facility who had been diagnosed a year ago with a malignant brain 
tumor. Since 1989, 21 workers at the facility have been diagnosed 
with benign and malignant brain tumors. Seven with malignant tumors 
worked at the building 500 complex on similar projects from the 
late 1970s to the mid-1980s. BP Amoco has funded a two-year 
investigation of the cases.

base, the headquarters for the Pentagon's Joint Task Force Bravo. 
When Mitch struck Central America last October, U.S. helicopters 
from the base rescued hundreds of Hondurans from dikes and 
rooftops. In the storm aftermath, the base has coordinated airlifts 
of food, tents and medicine. Clinton yesterday said America stands 
ready to help Central Americans rebuild from the hemisphere's worst

but an ex-health minister was convicted for his role in the 
contamination of seven people who got HIV-tainted blood under his 
watch. But former Health Minister Edmond Herve was given no penalty 
despite his conviction. The trio had been accused of manslaughter 
for delaying AIDS tests on the French blood supply. They allegedly 
passed over an American test, waiting instead for France to develop 
its own. Some 4,000 people in France got HIV from bad blood

can cut as much as 90 minutes off its 4 1/2-hour Boston-to-New York

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Real Gains Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- The Brazilian currency, the real,  
gained strength on Tuesday, reflecting the optimism that greeted 
the country's new commitments to the International Monetary Fund, 
although analysts warned that optimism could be overblown. 
</P>
<P>
	At midafternoon the dollar was being traded at 1.91, compared to  
Monday's close of 1.98. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Brazil pledged to control inflation, reduce its  
public deficit and increase trade and budget surpluses as part of 
its revamped agreement with the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The terms of the original $41.5 billion rescue package for  
Brazil's ailing economy had to be revised after Brazil floated its 
currency, the real, in January. Since then the real has lost nearly 
40 percent of its value. The first agreement was signed in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	New terms for the amount of money the central bank can spend to  
shore up the real accounted for much of the optimism. The central 
bank can use $3 billion this month alone, and whatever it doesn't 
spend can be added to the $2 billion limit for April. Limits for 
May and June were set at $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also said it expected the real to finish the year  
at 1.70 to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new agreement has given Brazil more breathing space,''  
said Marcelo Serfaty of Banco Pactual, a Brazilian investment bank. 
``It was a good start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For economist Roberto Padovani of the Tendencia Consultancy  
firm, the new agreement with the IMF ``is a short-term solution to 
the crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Social security and administrative reforms must still be  
implemented before we can the say the crisis has been brought under 
control,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised agreement is expected to clear the way for Brazil to  
receive a second installment of $9 billion that is part of the 
rescue package provided by the IMF and 20 international lenders. 
The country received a first payment of $9.5 billion last December. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the other year-end targets Brazil is aiming for include:  
16.8 percent inflation; interest rates of 28.8 percent (down from 
the current 45 percent); a $11 million trade surplus; a public debt 
of 50 percent of GDP; and a primary budget surplus of 3.1 percent 
of GDP. 
</P>
<P>
	While Brazil did not commit itself this time to any specific  
nominal public deficit goal, Amaury Bier, the finance ministry's 
economic policy director said it was expected to be 6.9 percent of 
GDP by the end of this year. The public deficit currently stands at 
about 8 percent of GDP. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday, Bier said the government will reduce investments in  
federally owned companies by 900 million reals in 1999 and levy a 
social security tax on military personnel to generate 400 million 
reals a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The recently announced increase in the financial transaction tax  
is expected to bring in another 300 million reals this year. The 
government also plans to increase electric energy fees, suspend 
some export tax incentives and increase fees on consumer loans.

<HEADLINE> IOC To Get Final Recommendations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One case remains to be resolved among members of  
the International Olympic Committee under investigation in the Salt 
Lake bribery scandal, the chief investigator says. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice president Dick Pound refused Monday to identify the member  
whose case is still being debated by his six-man panel, or to say 
what recommendations the inquiry would make on any of the 19 IOC 
members under review. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel will holds its final conference call today, ``and I  
hope we can come to substantial closure,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission then will send its recommendations to the IOC's  
ruling executive board, probably in a conference call on Wednesday, 
with the board announcing its actions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is one case on which we have not come to a resolution,''  
Pound said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	He would not say what the odds were of coming to a final  
decision on that case or if the inquiry commission would send its 
recommendations to the board if that case remained unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members already have resigned or been expelled in the  
worst scandal in IOC history. Three other members, including 
executive board member Kim Un-yong, remained under investigation 
after that initial phase of the inquiry, and 16 more names were 
added after a Salt Lake ethics panel report into the vote-buying 
that surrounded the city's winning quest for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound earlier described the latest list of offenses as far less  
serious than the first batch. 
</P>
<P>
	The five members ousted by the executive board in January, along  
with any other recommended for expulsion this week, will have to go 
before a special IOC general assembly in Lausanne, Switzerland, 
March 17-18 to try to win reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch has sent weekly  
letters to all members, explaining the status of the string of 
investigations into the alleged corruption and the changes in 
structure and rules that will be proposed next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Those reforms are expected to include an end to the wide-open  
campaigning by cities hoping to stage the Olympics, beginning with 
June's vote for the 2006 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said a proposal for a review panel to narrow the six-city  
field to two finalists, then have the full membership quickly vote 
on the winner was among the plans that could be recommended by the 
executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	The board originally had proposed stripping the membership of  
any vote but backed off that plank after a rank-and-file rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are canvassing the people involved to get a handle on what  
is the right thing to do,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC leaders also are undecided on how to conduct a crucial vote  
of confidence on Samaranch. Although it's certain that the 
membership will vote for the 78-year-old Spaniard to remain in 
power, IOC officials are uncertain whether to have a secret ballot 
or public acclamation. 
</P>
<P>
	With the world closely watching every move the IOC makes in the  
wake of its biggest corruption scandal, officials expect the 
committee will be criticized no matter what procedure is used. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC members told The Associated Press that the confidence  
question is still being debated among the general membership and 
the leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has been canvassing the opinions of IOC members and is  
expected to settle on a formula later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``What counts is not the system,'' executive board member  
Jacques Rogge said. ``What counts is whether (Samaranch) can have 
broad support, and I believe he will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those seeking a public endorsement want Samaranch to give an  
opening statement to the assembly. The IOC's longest-serving 
member, Joao Havelange of Brazil, would then take the floor and ask 
the members to acclaim Samaranch by applause. 
</P>
<P>
	A secret ballot might be more democratic because it allows  
members to vote free of outside pressure. But it could also be seen 
as lacking accountability at a time when the IOC is being urged to 
become more open. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever we do, we will be criticized,'' Rogge said.

<HEADLINE> Vizcaino Battles for Shortstop Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- When Jose Vizcaino sprained his right  
ankle last June, little did he know it would mark the end of his 
season and, perhaps, the end of his tenure as the Los Angeles 
Dodgers' starting shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	When Vizcaino signed a three-year, $9 million contract with the  
Dodgers in December 1997, it was a dream-come-true since he grew up 
in the organization, spending four years playing mostly in the 
minors before being traded to the Chicago Cubs in December 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Vizcaino hasn't played in the minors since, spending time with  
the Cubs, New York Mets, Cleveland Indians and San Francisco Giants 
before returning to the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Things haven't turned out the way he wanted, at least to this  
point, and basically through no fault of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tough year,'' he said of last season, when he played  
in only 67 games and hit .262 with three homers and 29 RBIs and 
made just four errors before being injured sliding into second base 
in Colorado on June 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was going to be a couple of weeks,'' Vizcaino  
recalled. ``I was surprised at first that I was put on the disabled 
list. It just didn't get any better. 
</P>
<P>
	``In September, I found out I had a bone spur and had surgery.''  
</P>
<P>
	Now, Vizcaino said, his ankle is 100 percent. The problem is, it  
appears Mark Grudzielanek, acquired from Montreal last July, has 
the inside track at shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have control over that situation,'' Vizcaino said.  
``My goal is to play every day. That's what I'm here for, to be an 
everyday player. I've proved I can do the job. The only thing I've 
got to prove now is I'm healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in great shape, I worked hard in the offseason, I was  
hitting a lot. It's nobody's job yet. I'm going to stay positive 
and try to win the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vizcaino, who turns 31 later this month, is earning $3 million  
this year while Grudzielanek, 28, is earning $1.9 million. It's 
uncertain whether the Dodgers will keep both, although manager 
Davey Johnson likes the versatility. 
</P>
<P>
	As an example, Vizcaino started two of the Dodgers' first three  
exhibition games at second base because Eric Young was sidelined 
with a minor injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're both everyday shortstops, we're not going to play with  
a rover out there,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone said trading one of the two -- and the one who likely  
would go is Vizcaino -- is an option, although he believes the 
Dodgers are in a position of strength having both. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to have a dance partner,'' Malone said. ``We'll see  
what the interest level is as we get closer to opening day. I think 
in the right scenario, I would see them both as starting shortstops 
-- one here and one somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vizcaino said he prefers to remain with the Dodgers.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't think about if you're traded,'' he said. ``I want to  
play here, I don't want to be traded. I want to win, and we've got 
a good chance here to win. This is where I want to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if it turns out he's a utility player?  
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to wait and see,'' Vizcaino said. ``I'm never going  
to think about that until it happens. Right now, I'm thinking about 
playing every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for Vizcaino, that's an opportunity he might not  
get with the Dodgers.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Addresses Lending Bias </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Discrimination by lenders against  
minority-owned small businesses is bad for the economy, Federal 
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent studies ``have found discrepancies in the turndown  
rates'' for small business loans and ``not all of these differences 
are readily explained by income, balance sheet factors, or credit 
histories,'' he said in a speech prepared for a Federal Reserve 
research conference in Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	More research needs to be done, he said, ``but if, after such  
examination, the gap persists, it raises disturbing questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent that market participants discriminate --  
consciously or, more likely unconsciously -- credit does not flow to 
its most profitable uses and the distribution of output is 
distorted. In the end, costs are higher, less real output is 
produced, and national wealth accumulation is slowed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Discrimination-free lending, he said, ``can generate higher  
returns to human capital and other productive resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important for lenders to understand that failure to  
recognize the profitable opportunities represented by minority 
enterprises not only harms these firms, it harms the lending 
institutions and, ultimately, robs the broader economy of growth 
potential,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> It Must Be Vikki Carr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Growing up in Southern California, Vikki Carr  
heard songs like ``Perfidia'' and ``What a Diff'rence a Day 
Makes,'' performed by popular singers like Dinah Washington or 
Frank Sinatra, and never realized they originally were performed in 
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the three-time Grammy winner knows the history of the music  
and she's celebrating it. 
</P>
<P>
	With a trio of accomplished musicians, Ms. Carr sings an  
assortment of beloved melodies in their Spanish and English 
incarnations in her new PBS special, ``Vikki Carr: Memories, 
Memorias.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Songs featured in the 60-minute show are Latin American tunes  
that made their way across the U.S.-Mexico border in the 1940s and 
1950s and in the process were given English lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1930s, trade laws restricted record imports from Latin  
America, so Mexican artists would cross the border to record on 
independent labels that had sprung up in Los Angeles to meet demand 
for Hispanic music. 
</P>
<P>
	When many American songwriters were conscripted for World War  
II, the U.S. industry turned to Mexicans to fill the void. Their 
songs in Spanish were already popular among Hispanic audiences in 
this country. In some cases, Americans were hired to write the 
English versions. 
</P>
<P>
	Taped before a black-tie audience in Los Angeles in October, Ms.  
Carr's program aired Monday night in that city. It will be shown 
Saturday in San Antonio, where she lives with her doctor husband, 
and elsewhere in the country throughout March. 
</P>
<P>
	The program is to be shown on PBS stations nationally (check  
local listings). 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very, very, very thrilled with the way it came out,''  
Ms. Carr said in a recent interview. ``It was wonderful to have the 
audience know and remember these songs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joining her on the program are vocalist Jack Jones, popular  
Mexican singer Pepe Aguilar and Cuban-born trumpet player Arturo 
Sandoval. 
</P>
<P>
	PBS, keen to attract more Hispanic viewers, approached Ms. Carr  
about doing the special. She said she agreed, but only if it were 
produced with ``class and quality.'' She believes both were 
achieved. 
</P>
<P>
	The live performance in Beverly Hills was done in an old-style  
Hollywood supper club setting. A 22-piece orchestra conducted by 
Larry Blank backs Ms. Carr and the guest artists. 
</P>
<P>
	The program is a production of KCET/Hollywood. Funding came from  
PBS and the Johnny Mercer Foundation. Joyce Campbell is the show's 
executive producer, Dan Guerrero produced and Paul Miller directed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all sat down and we tried to choose the songs that were  
most familiar to the people,'' Ms. Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among her favorites on the show are ``Solamente Una Vez'' (``One  
Time Only''), which in English became ``You Belong to My Heart'' 
and a top-selling record by Bing Crosby with Xavier Cugat's 
Orchestra; and ``Duerme'' (``Sleep''), or ``Time Was'' in English, 
a top 10 tune for Jimmy Dorsey, with vocals by Helen O'Connell and 
Bob Eberly. 
</P>
<P>
	The songs of ``Memories, Memorias'' have been performed through  
the years by Crosby, Washington, Sinatra, Nat ``King'' Cole, Doris 
Day, Glenn Miller, Mel Torme, Linda Ronstadt and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Explaining the concept of the special proved difficult at times  
as the program was in the works, Ms. Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
	While corporations are recognizing the growing population of  
Spanish-speaking Americans and are trying to market to that 
segment, Ms. Carr contends advertisers should not forget Hispanics 
like her whose families are English-speaking and have lived in the 
United States for many decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``Corporate America has to realize that we are second- or  
third-generation that were born here,'' said Ms. Carr, who is proud 
of her Mexican-American heritage. In recent years, she has become 
best known for her Spanish recordings and performances. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Florencia Bisenta de Casillas Martinez Cardona in El Paso,  
Ms. Carr began her recording career singing in English and changed 
her name to Vikki Carr ``to simplify it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My father was very hurt by it. He said, 'Isn't your own name  
good enough?''' recalled Ms. Carr, who vowed to keep reminding 
audiences of her Hispanic roots. 
</P>
<P>
	After success in English in the 1960s, Ms. Carr battled her  
recording company to let her record in Spanish in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	She won Grammys in 1985 for best Mexican-American Performance  
for ``Simplemente Mujer,'' in 1992 for best Latin Pop Album for 
``Cosas del Amor,'' and in 1995 for best Mexican-American 
Performance, Vocal or Instrumental, for ``Recuerdo a Javier 
Solis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Carr views her PBS special as a way to let a wide audience  
hear her sing in English again. Her dream is to return to English 
recordings and to be accepted as an entertainer in both Spanish and 
English. 
</P>
<P>
	With ``Vikki Carr: Memories, Memorias,'' she may be well on her  
way to reaching her goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a project of love,'' Ms. Carr said. ``I'm so proud of  
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>

	Elsewhere in television ....  
</P>
<P>
	AN AMERICAN STORY: ``The Puerto Ricans: Our American Story'' is  
the latest in a series of PBS tributes to ethnic heritage. Jimmy 
Smits, Rita Moreno, Tito Puente and other artists, educators and 
community leaders detail the customs, traditions and achievements 
of the Puerto Rican culture. The film says many Puerto Ricans live 
a bicultural existence and retain strong ties to Puerto Rico: 
``Even if you become (assimilated), your heart is really down there 
in the island,'' says musician Puente. ``The Puerto Ricans'' debuts 
Wednesday on public television stations (check local listings).

<HEADLINE> Holdsclaw Tops AP All America Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Chamique Holdsclaw, the smooth operator who has led Tennessee to  
three consecutive national championships, broke new ground as the 
leader of The Associated Press women's All-America basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw became the first player named to the first team three  
times and the first to earn All-America honors all four years of 
her college career. She made the third team as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tennessee ace and Purdue's Stephanie White-McCarty were  
voted to the first team on all 42 ballots from a national media 
panel, the only unanimous selections. They were joined on that unit 
by Tennessee's Tamika Catchings, Alabama's Dominique Canty and 
Colorado State's Becky Hammon. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other time one school had two first-team picks was  
1996, when Connecticut's Kara Wolters and Jennifer Rizzotti made 
the top five. The AP began picking a women's All-America team in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Catchings was named to the first, second or third team on 40  
ballots, Canty appeared on 39 and Hammon on 37. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's Semeka Randall was named to the second team, along  
with Amanda Wilson of Louisiana Tech, Svetlana Abrosimova of 
Connecticut, Angie Braziel of Texas Tech and Tamika Whitmore of 
Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	The third team had Maylana Martin of UCLA, Jackie Stiles of  
Southwest Missouri State, Ruth Riley of Notre Dame, Dalma Ivanyi of 
Florida International and Duke's Michele Van Gorp. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw, so versatile at 6-foot-2 that she can play any  
position on the floor, has averaged 20.9 points and eight rebounds 
in leading Tennessee to a 28-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
	With Tennessee getting more production from other positions,  
Holdsclaw's scoring average is down a little this season. But she 
has improved in other ways and is still the player the Lady Vols 
turn to when things get tight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Physically, she's more imposing now,'' said Tennessee coach  
Pat Summitt. ``She's much stronger, which I think has helped her 
around the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	'' Chamique's been able to get a lot better opportunities off  
the offensive glass, and physically be even more of a presence on 
defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw was the national player of the year last season, and  
is a candidate for that honor again. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is going to be remembered as a player of impact,'' Summitt  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty made the huge jump from honorable mention last  
year to unanimous first-team pick while leading Purdue to its 
first-ever No. 1 ranking. She's averaging 21 points and 4.6 
assists, and has helped the Boilermakers win several close games 
with key plays down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tremendous honor to be included among the top five  
players in the country,'' White-McCarty said. ``It's almost a dream 
a come true. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly I have to thank all my coaches and of course my  
teammates, because we're all in this together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canty, a second-team pick last year, has been a do-everything  
player for Alabama. Her 20-point scoring average is nearly twice 
that of anyone else on the team and she's also averaging 7.2 
rebounds and 4.3 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``The day she walked on our campus, she had an impact,'' said  
Alabama coach Rick Moody. ``Her demeanor on the floor has been just 
incredible because she's such a cool player and never once has she 
given any indication of a prima-donna attitude. That's just a joy 
to coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Catchings has been viewed as ``the next Holdsclaw'' ever since  
she arrived at Tennessee. She was a second-team All-American a year 
ago after a spectacular freshman season, and has continued to make 
big plays this season -- including a 38-point outburst against 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-1 sophomore is averaging 16.8 points, 7.3 rebounds and  
shooting 52 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Hammon has gone from a little-known high school player to the  
star of a team that has been ranked as high as fourth in the 
country. The 5-6 senior from Rapid City, S.D., averages 22.6 
points, shoots nearly 51 percent and has made 106 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	She's the leading career scorer in the Western Athletic  
Conference and had a high of 42 points at UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so rewarding for me to know all the hard work is paying  
off,'' Hammon said. ``I really didn't know how it was going to work 
coming out of high school. I didn't even know how I was going to 
fit into the program here. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be on that top unit is a huge honor.''

<HEADLINE> Fifth Death in Amoco Cancer Mystery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A mysterious outbreak of brain cancer at BP Amoco  
PLC's suburban research center has claimed a fifth victim, oil 
company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the request of the victim's family, BP Amoco would not  
identify the employee, who died Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A company spokeswoman said Monday the longtime employee was a  
chemical researcher at the Naperville facility who had been 
diagnosed a year ago with a malignant brain tumor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very sorry to lose a friend and colleague,'' said Jim  
Lowry, who heads BP Amoco's task force on the tumors. The latest 
death ``strengthens our resolve to get to the bottom of the 
issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1989, 21 workers at the facility have been diagnosed with  
benign and malignant brain tumors. Seven with malignant tumors 
worked at the building 500 complex on similar projects from the 
late 1970s to the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, six former or current scientists filed a lawsuit,  
claiming Amoco ``exhibited reckless disregard for the health and 
well-being'' of the workers and exposed them to dangerous 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco has funded a two-year investigation of the cases. The  
company said in October that investigators increasingly suspect 
chemicals used at the center are linked to the brain tumors.

<HEADLINE> White Couple Loses Black Foster Kid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- It was a battle that turned on drugs, race and  
politics. At stake was the fate of a 3-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Recovering cocaine addict Tina Olison on Monday won custody of  
her son, known as Baby T, after a court fight in which she faced 
one of Chicago's most powerful political couples. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just thank God for the chance to have a relationship with my  
child,'' Olison said. ``... This means more to me than anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Judith Brawka decided that foster parents Edward and Anne  
Burke, who are white, should transfer custody of the boy to Olison, 
who is black, over a 12-month transition period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Burkes became the boy's foster parents almost at birth three  
years ago when the 37-year-old Olison, a single mother, was 
fighting cocaine addiction. Baby T was born with cocaine in his 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke is one of the most powerful aldermen on the Chicago City  
Council, serving as chairman of the Finance Committee. Mrs. Burke 
is an appellate judge. His office did not return a call seeking 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Brawka held that the Illinois Department of Children and Family  
Services erred in putting no emphasis on the importance of black 
culture in the boy's upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless the position of the department is that there is no such  
thing as African-American culture, this issue deserves more 
attention than to check a box that says not applicable,'' Brawka 
held. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said that the youngster needs to be with his 8-year-old  
brother, who also is being returned to Olison under the court 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	``His relationship with his brother ... is a sweet note in an  
otherwise discordant symphony,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brawka is a white suburban Kane County judge who was brought in  
as an outsider to decide a case with powerful political overtones 
in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Olison says that she is now off drugs and has found religion.  
</P>
<P>
	``When God is for you, he's greater than the weight of the world  
against you,'' she told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Burkes had sought to adopt the boy and have Olison declared  
unfit. But last November, Brawka found that she was now fit to be 
his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	She warned Olison on Monday, however, that the custody transfer  
could be called off if the transition period doesn't seem to be 
working out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just as your addiction lasted for years, I must tell you this  
case may not close for a significant period of time,'' the judge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also cautioned Olison not to celebrate a victory.  
</P>
<P>
	``He is not a prize that you have won,'' Brawka said. ``He is  
not the spoils of war after a battle. He is a human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You are neither a devil nor a saint, a villain nor a hero,''  
she said. ``And neither are the Burkes.''

<HEADLINE> Alexander Jumps In GOP Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *RON FOURNIER   	
</P>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Lamar Alexander, fighting in the shadows  
of front-running GOP stars, declared his presidential candidacy 
Tuesday by urging Republicans to look beyond familiar names. He 
belittled fellow Tennessean Al Gore on the Democratic side as 
President Clinton's ``faithful assistant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This time the race is wide open,'' he said, pressing  
Republicans not to commit too early to George W. Bush or Elizabeth 
Dole. ``There is no one whose 'turn' it is,'' Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, Bob Dole's won the Republican nomination -- after  
Alexander finished a strong third in the Iowa caucuses and a 
whisper behind the second-place Dole in the New Hampshire primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Promising better schools, higher family incomes and a stronger  
military, the former Tennessee governor said on Tuesday, ``I am 
here this morning to declare that I will be a candidate for 
president of the United States. I am ready to help our country face 
the challenges of a new century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that Bush, the Texas governor and early GOP  
favorite, is not as ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new president should be someone who wants it, someone who  
is well prepared for the job and someone who knows from the first 
day that he or she is in office exactly what they will do,'' said 
Alexander, a former education secretary who has been running for 
president since the day he dropped out of the race in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't mention Bush by name, but aides said the Texas  
governor was the main target of his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, 58, also blasted Clinton and ``his faithful  
assistant,'' Vice President Gore, the most likely Democratic 
nominee. ``They have given us what their polls show them, but 
that's not leadership,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton-Gore ``magic show'' has disguised failing schools,  
bigger bureaucracies, weakening national defense and deepening 
racial polarization, Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our standards of right and wrong have sunk to a new low,'' he  
said. The first president of the 21st century must lay ``a moral 
foundation.'' He did not refer directly to the Monica Lewinsky 
inquiry or any other specific moral problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who took over as Tennessee governor in 1979 from a  
scandal-ridden administration, delivered his speech in the state 
Capitol's old Supreme Court room. Several hundred well-wishers 
filled the tiny room, their applause echoing off the chamber's 
marble walls. 
</P>
<P>
	He is to be endorsed Wednesday by Tennessee's GOP senators, Bill  
Frist and Fred Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who announced his candidacy last time wearing a  
bright plaid shirt, wore a business suit this year. He has said 
that talk about his shirt interfered with his message in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike 1996, a crowd of candidates is seeking the GOP nomination  
this time. Alexander, Bush, Mrs. Dole, Sen. John McCain of Arizona 
and Rep. John Kasich of Ohio will vie for many of the same voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Businessman Steve Forbes, former Vice President Dan Quayle,  
activist Gary Bauer, commentator Pat Buchanan and Sen. Bob Smith of 
New Hampshire are fighting on the right. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, who defeated Bob Dole in New Hampshire four years ago,  
has already announced his candidacy. So has Smith. Forbes' 
declaration is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley are the only announced  
Democratic candidates for far. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, son of former President Bush, received waves of publicity  
this week simply for forming an exploratory committee. Mrs. Dole, 
former president of the American Red Cross and wife of the 1996 
nominee, will get similar treatment Wednesday when she takes a 
similar baby step. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander bristles at the attention given his rivals, arguing  
that his agenda to improve schools, family incomes and the nation's 
security stands well against Bush and Dole, who have avoided 
detailed discussions of most national issues so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something will level the playing field,'' he told The  
Associated Press. ``It is called Iowa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has visited Iowa 121 times since 1996 and New Hampshire 38  
times. He may be the best organized candidate in those early-vote 
states and has a history of strong fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he has not done well in public opinion polls, nor does he  
seem to inspire passion among activists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forbes took risks in 1996 by endorsing the flat tax,''  
conservative organizer Grover Norquist said. ``Ronald Reagan took 
risks by saying things others weren't comfortable with saying. 
Alexander fits the Reagan tradition, but ... maybe the problem is 
he's never said anything that could cost a political price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander's rhetoric has changed little since 1996, with one  
exception: His attacks on Washington, a place he called an 
``arrogant empire'' in his 1996 announcement speech, were less 
pronounced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He wants to send federal education money directly to the states  
and reduce bureaucratic interference. Inheritance and capital gains 
taxes should be cut, as well as the penalty for married couples, he 
said. He proposes tripling the tax deduction for each child to 
$8,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his national security ideas: create a new branch of the  
armed services to stem the flow of drugs from other countries.

<HEADLINE> Princeton Gets Chance at Redemption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Ten years ago, Princeton nearly pulled off the biggest upset in  
NCAA tournament history. The Tigers get another crack at 
Georgetown, only this time in the NIT, which begins Wednesday with 
16 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers went into the 1989 NCAA tournament as a No. 16 seed,  
but gave the top-seeded Hoyas a memorable first-round scare in 
which Georgetown held on 50-49. A No. 16 seed has never defeated a 
No. 1 in the history of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a different story now,'' Tigers senior guard Brian Earl  
said. ``It's not on the same stage, it's the NIT as opposed to the 
NCAA's. And they're not so much the powerhouse, we're not so much 
the underdog. I'm sure it sparks memories, but not many.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Tigers (20-7) win this time around, it wouldn't be much  
of a surprise. Princeton's chance to make the NCAA tournament 
slipped away in a loss to Pennsylvania in its final regular season 
game, while the Hoyas (15-15) were ecstatic just to make the NIT, 
extending their streak of postseason appearances to 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Both coaches from a decade ago are gone. Princeton's Pete  
Carrill stepped down three years ago while the Hoyas John Thompson 
resigned earlier this year and the program was taken over by Craig 
Esherick, a Hoyas assistant since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	``That game put our program on the map,'' said coach Bill  
Carmody, the longtime assistant who took over from Carrill. ``A win 
there would have been the same as a loss. We couldn't have gotten 
more publicity for winning or losing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other games include Xavier (21-10) at Toledo (19-7), Hofstra  
(22-9) at Rutgers (18-12), Georgia (15-14) at Clemson (16-14), 
Seton Hall (15-14) at Old Dominion (24-8), Butler (20-9) at Bradley 
(17-11), Alabama (17-14) at Wake Forest (16-13) and Providence 
(16-13) at North Carolina State (18-13). 
</P>
<P>
	Also, it's Nevada-Las Vegas (16-12) at Nebraska (19-12),  
Pepperdine (19-12) at Colorado (17-14), Mississippi State (20-12) 
at Colorado State (17-10), Texas Christian (19-10) at Kansas State 
(20-12), Southern California (15-12) at Wyoming (17-9), 
Northwestern (15-13) at DePaul (17-12), Fresno State (21-11) at 
California (17-11) and Georgia Tech (15-15) at Oregon (16-11). 
</P>
<P>
	Since the near upset, Princeton has become a national fixture,  
going to six more NCAA tournaments and winning two first-round 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hoyas have gone in the opposite direction, compiling a 31-30  
record over the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgetown finished 0-9 against NCAA teams this year as opposed  
to Princeton's 4-3 mark. But Georgetown's young starting lineup, 
which includes two freshmen and two sophomores, has recently come 
together and the Hoyas have won six of their last 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're getting better and better,'' Carmody said. ``I watched  
films of the Rutgers and Providence games and those kids aren't 
freshmen any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the last time they played, when the Hoyas' primary scorer  
was Alonzo Mourning, Georgetown's scoring now comes from the 
backcourt and Anthony Perry's 14.3 average. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an explosive kind of player,'' said Earl, who played  
against Perry in high school in New Jersey. ``He was good then and 
I'm sure he's better now. I haven't seen much of Georgetown but 
they always bring the athletes and I'm sure they pack big guys down 
there who can get up near the rim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Princeton is led by seniors Gabe Lewullis and Earl. Lewullis  
averages 15 points per game and is best known for his layup as time 
expired to upset UCLA in the 1996 NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Another interesting note to the game is that Thompson's sons  
will be facing each other as assistants. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronny Thompson is a Georgetown assistant while John Thompson III  
will be on the Tigers bench.

<HEADLINE> Educators Watch School Bill Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many educators say they're worried they will  
be left with too many kids per class and too many restrictive rules 
by the time Congress finishes work on an education bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans failed Monday evening in an attempt to limit  
the number of proposals that can be attached to the so-called 
``ed-flex'' bill, which would give states more flexibility in 
spending federal education dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats want the chance to vote on amendments including new  
money to pay for new teachers and reduce class size. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans were poised to try again today to limit debate on  
the bill. If that fails, they'll try to water down the Democrats' 
class-size proposal by giving states the option to spend the new 
money for teachers on special education. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania officials are eager to see the ``ed-flex'' bill  
approved as they face school districts that want to use federal 
money to train more reading teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They believe they've tackled the issue of math and science,''  
said Ron Tomalis of Pennsylvania's education department. ``But the 
federal regulations don't allow them the flexibility to address the 
needs of their kids. To us, this is a common sense way of looking 
at the delivery of education to our kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, a Republican, said many  
educators are frustrated that the bill, which started out popular 
and with wide bipartisan support, has become embroiled in partisan 
battles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opportunity to give more flexibility to the states will be  
imperiled if not lost if they keep playing politics,'' Ridge said 
in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since education emerged as a key issue in last November's  
congressional elections, lawmakers have been scrambling to take 
credit for action on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill is simply being held hostage by politics,'' said  
Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H. ``After someone goes out and takes another 
poll or does another focus group, I imagine we'll have more 
proposals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats say the haggling is actually a referendum on their  
proposals to reduce class size and hire new teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have offered as many different innovative ways with which to  
break this impasse as I can think of, short of just caving and 
giving up all of our rights as senators to offer education 
amendments on an education bill,'' said Democratic Senate leader 
Thomas Daschle of South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic amendments include a plan that would add to a  
$1.2 billion program passed last year to help the nation's school 
districts hire thousands of new teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have resisted putting issues such as the class size  
proposal into the ``ed-flex'' bill, saying they should be saved for 
later this year when Congress begins debating the reauthorization 
of another major education bill -- the Elementary and Secondary 
Education Act. 
</P>
<P>
	--------------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill number is S. 280

<HEADLINE> Laredo Sizzles, Stanley Shivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stanley, Idaho, was the nation's chilliest  
community last year, while the heat was on in Laredo, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	But the long-term coldest and hottest places -- Truckee, Calif.,  
and Lake Havasu City, Ariz. -- also continued to pile up temperature 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley was the nation's coldest location on 49 days in 1998, 20  
more than the two places tied for second, Gunnison, Colo., and West 
Yellowstone, Mont., according to the annual compilation of warmest 
and coolest places published in Weatherwise magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was West Yellowstone that recorded the lowest reading in  
the 48 contiguous states at 41 below zero Fahrenheit on Dec. 21, 
1998. The daily average low reading for the year was 12.5 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the top three was Truckee, Calif., which was the  
coldest place in the 48 contiguous states on 20 days. Then came 
Jackson, Wyo., 19 days, and Alamosa, Colo., 18. 
</P>
<P>
	That brought Truckee's total so far in the 1990s to 200 days as  
the coldest spot, based on a review of the annual rankings put 
together by David Hickcox, director of environmental studies at 
Ohio Wesleyan University. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the most days as coldest for any community in this  
decade. Wisdom, Mont., was second with 172, followed by the Idaho 
town of Stanley, at 171. 
</P>
<P>
	On the hot side of the ledger, Laredo was the hottest location  
last year on 34 days, edging out Lake Havasu City at 33 and 
Lajitas, Texas, with 32 highs. 
</P>
<P>
	Coolidge, Ariz., and Presidio, Texas, tied for the next spot at  
29 days, followed by Thermal, Calif., 23 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Hickcox does not include Death Valley, Calif., in his totals  
because it so often records extreme temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	As if to prove his point, Death Valley recorded the year's  
hottest temperature, 129 degrees on July 17, and managed 125 
degrees on Aug. 5, 6 and 7. The average daily high for the year was 
97.6. 
</P>
<P>
	For the decade to date, Lake Havasu City has been the hottest  
spot 511 days, far and away ahead of second-place Bullhead City, 
Ariz., at 202, and third-place Coolidge, 189. 
</P>
<P>
	Communities that have been the coldest spot 20 or more times  
this decade are: 
</P>
<P>
	Truckee, 200 days; Wisdom, Mont., 172; Stanley, 171; Fraser,  
Colo., 160; West Yellowstone, 112; Pinedale, Wyo., 96; Alamosa, 71; 
Leadville, Colo., 65; Gunnison, 48; Winter Park, Colo., 38; 
Jackson, Wyo., 36; and Creede, Colo., 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Places that have been the hottest 20 or more days are:  
</P>
<P>
	Lake Havasu City, 511; Bullhead City, 202; Coolidge, 189;  
Lajitas, 144; Borrego Springs, Calif., 136; Palm Springs, Calif., 
132; Laredo, 127; Fort Myers, Fla., 108; Thermal, Calif., 104; 
Presidio, Texas, 102; McAllen, Texas, 72; and Yuma, Ariz., 22.

<HEADLINE> Dole Announcement Focuses GOP Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole, taking a first, formal  
step toward a possible run for president, says it's high time that 
the nation's leaders restore voters' faith in their government -- to 
``call America to her better nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was among the themes the former U.S. labor and  
transportation secretary touted in a TV ad that was to accompany 
her announcement that she was forming an exploratory committee for 
the 2000 GOP presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's announcement at a rally here moves Mrs. Dole to the  
first tier of potential Republican contenders. Most polls have 
shown her and Texas Gov. George W. Bush far ahead of lesser-known 
potential Republican rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	In making her announcement, Mrs. Dole pointed to her experiences  
serving under five presidents but maintained a distance between 
herself and any rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a politician and, frankly, today that may be a plus,''  
Mrs. Dole said in her television ad, which was to air in Iowa and 
New Hampshire. Aides said the ad would flesh out the themes of a 
Dole campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Politics and the politics of governing have become so  
negative, so paralyzed by special interests, that as a people we're 
beginning to lose faith in our own institutions,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her opening pitch took a not-too-subtle poke at President  
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I run, this will be why: I believe our people are looking  
for leaders who will call America to her better nature,'' Mrs. Dole 
said. ``Yes, we've been let down, and by people we should have been 
able to look up to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the resume Mrs. Dole brings to a field of GOP contenders  
that could reach double digits: A very prominent and widely 
recognized name, extensive government experience and decades of 
campaigning as a surrogate for her husband, 1996 GOP presidential 
nominee Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen many presidential campaigns up close,'' Mrs. Dole  
said in her 15-minute ad. ``I know what they entail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She's going to bring a grace and a dignity to the race,'' said  
Ralph Reed, a consultant and former head of the Christian Coalition 
who is offering advice to Bush. ``I'm glad she's running. This 
nominating campaign is shaping into an embarrassment of riches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After today's announcement, Mrs. Dole's opening campaign swing  
takes her to Arizona, then to New Hampshire, before she heads back 
to her home in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa's precinct caucuses mark the initial test of the  
presidential nominating season next February, while New Hampshire 
holds the first primary shortly after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole has headed the Federal Trade Commission, served as  
secretaries of labor and transportation and been president of the 
American Red Cross. Some strategists argue that her Red Cross 
background insulates her from charges often hurled at Republicans 
that the party lacks compassion. 
</P>
<P>
	She hammered that experience in her TV pitch to voters.  
</P>
<P>
	``In my eight years at the American Red Cross, I saw things that  
will haunt me the rest of my life,'' she said. ``But I also saw the 
power of the human heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole said her early travels left her ``buoyed by the  
goodness of our citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Which is why I am ready to take the next step,'' Mrs. Dole  
said. ``This week, I have filed papers to form an exploratory 
committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among benefits Mrs. Dole brings to the campaign is her gender,  
some analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gender plays into it to the extent that having a very visible  
and viable female candidate causes women voters to pay closer 
attention to the Republican primaries,'' said Ed Gillespie, a 
consultant allied with Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, a likely 
presidential candidate in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole has certainly gotten the attention of potential rivals  
like Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've long since passed the time when Americans are  
uncomfortable with women in any position of leadership,'' Gore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Reed argued that Bush has laid claim to the pillars of the  
Republican establishment, pointing to a broad range of prominent 
Republicans who joined the Texas governor last Sunday as he 
announced his exploratory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Bush exploratory committee, you had the full range of  
the diversity of the Republican Party,'' said Reed. ``Bush has 
probably raised the bar for all subsequent contenders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others suggested that front-runners like Mrs. Dole and Bush will  
stumble when they begin to face contentious issues that divide 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of soft underbelly when it comes to an issues  
campaign for this establishment candidate,'' said Greg Mueller, a 
consultant allied with publisher Steve Forbes and former 
communications director for conservative 1996 candidate Pat 
Buchanan.

<HEADLINE> Antigua Joins Trade Dispute Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) -- Antigua joined other Caribbean  
countries Tuesday in suspending a drug interdiction treaty with the 
United States because of a worldwide trade dispute over bananas. 
</P>
<P>
	Antigua does not produce bananas, but Prime Minister Lester Bird  
said the disagreement could harm the island's economy because its 
trading partners are deeply involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Antigua also shares a currency -- the Eastern Caribbean dollar --  
with several banana-producing islands, and its value could be 
affected if the islands lose their banana exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is challenging concessions the European Union  
gives to banana imports from its former colonies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to have some kind of leverage'' with Washington, Bird  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the Caribbean islands produce just 1 percent of the world  
market in bananas, some of those islands are entirely dependent on 
the trade, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have the United States move against these tiny islands ...  
that's reprehensible,'' he said. ``They are wiping out the 
agricultural base of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean 
States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, the 15-member Caribbean Community trade bloc  
agreed to suspend so-called ``shiprider'' treaties that allow the 
United States to pursue suspected drug smugglers into local 
territorial airspace and waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird said Antigua would go along with the decision by other  
Caricom leaders to suspend his country's agreement with the United 
States. Bird, who did not attend the weekend meeting, told 
reporters of his decision before voting Tuesday in parliamentary 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States won a challenge to the European banana regime  
at the World Trade Organization last year, arguing that trade 
preferences hurt U.S. and Latin American producers. 
</P>
<P>
	WTO experts are expected to rule by the end of March whether the  
EU is breaking international trade rules, and if so, what sanctions 
the United States can impose in retaliation.

<HEADLINE> Reaction Mixed to RJR Announcement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- It didn't come as a surprise to  
anyone in this tobacco town, but Tuesday's news that RJR Nabisco 
Holdings is splitting its domestic tobacco and food businesses was 
greeted with mixed views, from optimism to uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
	The R.J. Reynolds Tobacco division, which is headquartered in  
this city of 170,000, makes the cigarettes that bear its name, 
along with Camels and other brands. It is the second-largest U.S. 
cigarette maker, behind Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the maker of 
Marlboro. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR Nabisco plans to sell its struggling international tobacco  
business to Japan's largest cigarette maker, the Japan Tobacco Co., 
for $7.8 billion. It will also break off its domestic tobacco 
operations from Nabisco, its food division. The new tobacco company 
will revert to its old name, the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., and 
will be headquartered here. 
</P>
<P>
	That was good news to Walter McDowell, president of Wachovia  
Bank of North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the domestic headquarters would come back, that would be  
quite a win for Winston-Salem,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Robert Rousseau, a Reynolds retiree who now cuts hair at his  
own barber shop, was pessimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would do some damage to the economy here in  
Winston-Salem,'' Rousseau said. ``That's going to eliminate some 
jobs. I've heard some guys (from Reynolds) coming down here to get 
their hair cut and they're downsizing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Lord, professor of strategy and international business  
at the Babcock Graduate School of Management at Wake Forest 
University, said the impact on Winston-Salem will be more muted 
than it would have been a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco's place in the city's economy has been replaced by  
health care and banking while the population has steadily grown. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the changes announced Tuesday, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco was  
already working toward eliminating 1,000 jobs this year, a response 
to continued declines in smoking. It now employs about 5,000 
workers here, about half the work force of Wake Forest 
University-Baptist Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past 15 years, the company has laid off or given  
retirements to more than 9,000 workers. Many retirees are living on 
pensions and handsome stock options, but others had to find new 
jobs at lower salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Uncertainty seemed to prevail among current Reynolds workers,  
who were told the news via closed-circuit television. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a pretty good idea this was coming,'' said one  
cigarette plant worker who wouldn't give his name and said he 
didn't know what the future held. 
</P>
<P>
	A supervisor in the plant, who said he has worked for Reynolds  
for 27 years, said many employees are confused about the next steps 
the company will take. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been expecting this for some time,'' said the supervisor  
who also wouldn't give his name. ``They have been talking about 
spinning off the tobacco company for two or three years.''

<HEADLINE> Sweepstakes Promoters Defend Selves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defending their contests to outraged senators,  
the companies that flood U.S. homes with sweepstakes promotions 
insisted Tuesday that most Americans know they can win without 
buying anything. 
</P>
<P>
	Four industry executives told a hearing of their voluntary  
efforts to clearly state the rules and odds -- and to delete from 
mailing lists vulnerable Americans whom companies are now trying to 
identify. 
</P>
<P>
	The longer the defense continued, the more intense was the  
bipartisan criticism from members of the Senate Permanent 
Subcommittee on Investigations. Panel members confronted company 
officials with mailings that said, ``Open your door to $31 million 
on Jan. 31,'' ``It's down to a 2 person race for $11 million'' and 
``Yes, Reward Entitlement Granted and Guaranteed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, chairwoman of the subcommittee,  
said she was ``absolutely stunned'' by company statements that no 
``reasonable person'' would be misled by headlines that appear to 
declare someone a sweepstakes winner when the odds were minuscule. 
</P>
<P>
	By the hearing's conclusion, senators said they were more  
convinced than ever that tough federal legislation was needed to 
regulate the mailings. Collins, who faced not only the witnesses 
but a room packed with powerful Washington lobbyists, said she is 
``gaining co-sponsors every day'' for her legislation that would 
regulate the mailings and impose stiff fines for violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that these companies have hired such high-powered  
lobbyists ... shows how much money is at stake and how profitable 
the business is,'' she said. ``My hope is we'll be able to prevail 
over any lobbying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The industry representatives said they would support federal  
regulation, but wouldn't commit to specific provisions such as 
using the same size type for headlines suggesting someone is a 
winner and the notice that those not purchasing anything had an 
equal chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the committee heard accounts of elderly parents who  
kept buying magazines and merchandise they didn't need in pursuit 
of a grand prize. Tuesday, lawmakers heard the defense from Naomi 
Bernstein, vice president of marketing services for American Family 
Enterprises; Deborah Holland, senior vice president of Publishers 
Clearing House; Elizabeth Long, executive vice president of Time 
Inc.; and Peter Davenport, senior vice president of The Reader's 
Digest Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators were especially critical of a Publisher's Clearing  
House letter that quoted two company officials supposedly 
discussing how they could get a valued customer, Eustace Hall, a 
prize. ``There must be something we can do,'' one official was 
quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, a committee witness on Monday, broke down in tears during  
his appearance and told the panel that he thought the letter was a 
personal one. In fact, said Ms. Holland, the letter was sent to 9 
million recipients with only the names changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Holland said the letter was ``perfectly fine'' and called it  
``a dramatization of an actual conversation that did take place'' 
among company officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., told her, ``You lied to a customer''  
by suggesting that company officials were having personal 
discussions about him. ``That letter is perfectly a lie . . . 
purposefully false . . . purposely misleading, purposely 
deceptive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The point of our mailings is not to convince people they've  
won a sweepstakes, but rather to be excited about the possibility 
of winning and to consider our products,'' Ms. Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Holland said Publishers Clearing House supported federal  
standards, a public-private partnership between government and 
industry to end any confusion and protection programs for those who 
become addicted to sweepstakes without understanding the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport said a study by Reader's Digest ``strongly indicates  
that the vast majority of ... customers understand ... that no 
purchase is necessary to enter.'' He said the sweepstakes were 
``simply a marketing tool'' just like a department store promotion 
to lure customers inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., told Ms. Bernstein, of American  
Family Enterprises, that it was misleading to state in big 
headlines that there was a ``2 person race for $11 million'' when 
in fact the odds of winning were extremely small. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ms. Bernstein protested that the mailing also said a  
winning number had to be returned, and insisted the mailing wasn't 
deceptive, Durbin cut her off. ``This is a lie,'' he said. ''You're 
deceiving people.''

<HEADLINE> Simon: Song Honored Joe DiMaggio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Paul Simon didn't mean any disrespect to Joe  
DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon, who wrote the song that immortalized the Yankee Clipper  
for a new generation, said in an op-ed page essay in today's New 
York Times that he explained his ``Where have you gone, Joe 
DiMaggio?'' lyric to the baseball star in a chance meeting at a 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few years after 'Mrs. Robinson' rose to No. 1 on the pop  
charts, I found myself dining at an Italian restaurant where 
DiMaggio was seated with a party of friends,'' Simon wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd heard a rumor that he was upset with the song and had  
considered a lawsuit, so it was with some trepidation that I walked 
over and introduced myself as its composer. I needn't have worried: 
He was perfectly cordial and invited me to sit down, whereupon we 
immediately fell into conversation about the only subject we had in 
common. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I don't understand,'' DiMaggio told Simon, ``is why you  
ask where I've gone. I just did a Mr. Coffee commercial, I'm a 
spokesman for the Bowery Savings Bank and I haven't gone 
anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simon responded: ``I said that I didn't mean the lines  
literally, that I thought of him as an American hero and that 
genuine heroes were in short supply. He accepted the explanation 
and thanked me. We shook hands and said good night.''

<HEADLINE> Creatine May Help Muscle Therapy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A dietary supplement that athletes use to  
build muscle might offer help to patients whose muscles are wasting 
away from such diseases as muscular dystrophy, a new study 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking very large doses of creatine daily seemed to increase the  
strength of patients' muscles by about 10 percent, concludes the 
small study published Tuesday in the journal Neurology. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent scientists urged caution. The study was far too  
small and too short, lasting only a few weeks, to show if creatine 
offers lasting benefit or if high doses for long periods can cause 
side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, doctors actually tried to treat similar neuromuscular  
diseases with creatine in the 1950s, and it failed, said Dr. Audrey 
Penn of the National Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke. 
So creatine was abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm basically skeptical,'' Penn said. ``I have a feeling that  
over the longer term it might not be such an exciting result.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But those 1950s studies only looked at whether creatine could  
cure or slow the disease, not if it had a smaller benefit like 
improving muscle strength and thus quality of life, Dr. Leon 
Charash of the Muscular Dystrophy Association said. The new study 
suggests creatine might do that, so Charash's association asked 
researchers Tuesday to start larger studies quickly and promised to 
help pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``If somebody can hold a glass up and not have somebody give it  
to them, that's a small gain -- but it's very important to that 
person,'' Charash said. 
</P>
<P>
	Creatine is an amino acid found naturally in healthy muscles. It  
has become one of the biggest-selling dietary supplements, thanks 
to athletes who hope it will build muscles. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no data that confirm the safety of taking extra  
creatine for long periods or at high doses, because the government 
allows dietary supplements to sell largely unregulated. Some 
athletes have reported muscle cramps, muscle tears and dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
	Because creatine is so widely sold, neuromuscular patients  
probably will race to try it for themselves, Charash said. 
</P>
<P>
	Separate research published last week in Nature Medicine already  
had patients of Lou Gehrig's disease excited. It was only a study 
in rodents, but it suggested that creatine might be more potent 
than the only prescription therapy for the disease, a killer 
neurological disorder that also attacks muscles. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study published Tuesday, Dr. Mark Tarnopolsky of  
Ontario's McMaster University gave 81 patients with a variety of 
neuromuscular diseases 10 daily grams of creatine for five days, 
followed by 5 grams a day for another week. When patients exercised 
their legs, hands and feet, they were a little stronger after the 
creatine than before. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarnopolsky noted that such patients naturally have lower  
creatine levels than healthy people and hypothesized that boosting 
their levels helped their muscle cells hang onto cellular energy 
supplies for a little longer.

	DELEGATE, DELEGATE, DELEGATE: Many managers find it hard to  
delegate tasks because they feel insecure about losing control over 
the work or believe that giving responsibilities to subordinates 
will diminish their own importance, says Robert Heller, author of 
the book ``How To Delegate.'' Heller says managers need to look at 
the barriers they create to delegating, and realize that they will 
still maintain responsibility for getting jobs done, even if they 
aren't doing all the work themselves. He says delegating work to 
the right people should actually make a manager look better to his 
or her superiors. For those nervous about delegating, he has 
reassurance -- the more you do it, the easier it gets. 

</P>
<P>
	PLAY IT STRAIGHT: If you're sending a rejection letter, it's  
better to deliver the bad news right at the start rather than 
trying to soften the blow with a buffer, a neutral or positive 
sentence that delays the negative information. That suggestion 
comes from Kitty Locker, an associate professor of English at Ohio 
State University, who conducted experiments to see how students 
felt about different styles of rejection letters. She found the 
students reacted most negatively when the rejection was buried 
rather than stated up front; they tended to be surprised at the 
turndown after the upbeat beginning. She also found that a writer's 
attempt to end a rejection letter on a positive note only made the 
reader feel worse. 

</P>
<P>
	COACHING AND MENTORING YOUR MANAGERS: The tight job market has  
prompted many companies to spend more resources on coaching and 
mentoring their current employees, reports Manchester, a human 
resources consulting firm. Manchester says it surveyed 300 
companies across the country and found that 59 percent are offering 
coaching or other developmental counseling to managers or 
executives. An additional 20 percent said they're planning to offer 
coaching for these employees during the coming year. Companies said 
they're hoping to keep valued employees by coaching and mentoring 
them, but the firms are also making an investment in the future -- 
they want to develop new leaders and to put employees with the most 
potential on a fast career track.

<HEADLINE>  Catfish Hunter in Battle for Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A boy scampers up the stadium steps, paper  
and pen in outstretched hands, toward George Steinbrenner's box at 
Legends Field where Catfish Hunter and his wife sit alone an hour 
before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Hunter,'' the boy asks, eagerly holding up his pad.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry,'' Catfish says, a penetrating sorrow in his blue  
eyes. ``I can't sign anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lou Gehrig's disease is breaking down Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter's  
body, muscle by muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	He can still use his right arm, once the best in baseball, to  
guide the razor in his left hand when he shaves. Soon, he knows, he 
may not be able to do that. And he can still get around his beloved 
farm in a pickup truck, thanks to power steering and a long oak 
lever a neighbor made to start the ignition. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has to rely more and more on Helen, his sweetheart since  
high school and wife of 32 years. She helps him so much already, 
cutting up food, buttoning buttons, tucking in his shirttail, tying 
his shoes. His flaccid arms dangle limply. His hands are soft and 
puffy, no longer the strong hands of a pitcher or farmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always used to get up early and leave her in bed. Now I've  
got to wait until she gets up to get me dressed,'' says Hunter, who 
owns 1,000 acres of rich farmland and dense woods in his native 
Hertford, N.C. ``I'm puttin' a lot of work on her, and she's been 
strong. But once in a while we sit there and cry together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He gave himself insulin shots three times a day for diabetes  
since 1978, never complained about it. That's Helen's job now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell when she's mad at me,'' he said, joking. ``She  
twists the needle the wrong way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His smile briefly relieves the sadness in an intimate  
conversation away from the autograph seekers, reporters and cameras 
that encircled him last week when he arrived at New York Yankees 
camp. In this empty room behind home plate, he was dressed casually 
in a knit shirt and blue jeans and shared his worries about 
helplessness, about what it means to cede independence, to lose 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter is one of 30,000 Americans with Lou Gehrig's disease,  
also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS. Garbled 
instructions to brain cells from a perfectly normal gene appear to 
trigger an attack on nerves in the spinal cord and brain that 
control muscle movement. So far, the result is unstoppable: 
progressive paralysis leading to death. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll find a cure someday, and I just hope I'm still here  
when they find it,'' says Hunter, who turns 53 on April 8. A moment 
later his eyes brim with tears as he speaks of his children, Todd, 
28, Kim, 25, Paul, 18, and a 3-year-old grandson, Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to see them grow up,'' he says, his strong, gravelly  
voice cracking. 
</P>
<P>
	Control, control, control ... that was Hunter's mantra in a  
15-year Hall of Fame pitching career with the Kansas City and 
Oakland Athletics and Yankees through 1979. He could crank up a 90 
mph heater once in a while, but mostly he painted the plate 
artistically, throwing sliders and curves and fastballs that 
shifted gears to keep the batter guessing. 
</P>
<P>
	He pitched a perfect game in 1968, won 224 games in his career,  
and collected five World Series rings. Twenty-five years ago, after 
the end of his Cy Young season in 1974, he won an arbitration 
ruling against Oakland owner Charles O. Finley, left the Athletics 
and ushered in the era of big money for free agents by signing a 
five-year, $3 million deal with the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would trade all of that for good health,'' Hunter says.  
``I'd be a groundskeeper and not let anybody know me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter sat in the Yankees dugout a few days ago with two of his  
high-priced pitching descendants, Roger Clemens and David Cone, 
showing them how he placed his fingers on his slider and two-seam 
fastball. They watched with all the respect in the world for what 
he had accomplished in the game and done for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``He paved the way for me,'' says Clemens, who will earn $16.1  
million over the next two years. ``I watched him as a kid and 
didn't appreciate the type of pinpoint control he had. It's great 
to get a chance to talk to him. But it hurts to know he's 
suffering. This disease is very real. It makes you ponder what the 
future might hold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are lessons of the game and lessons of the farm, and a  
lifetime split between them has given Hunter an abiding strength 
and philosophy. From baseball, Hunter has learned to filter out 
distractions and worries, to focus on the moment. From raising 
cotton, peanuts, corn and soybeans, he has learned to cope with the 
vagaries of the weather and the markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter is, as he describes himself, ``uncomplicated, country  
born and raised, given to saying 'rivah' for river, 'dat' for that 
and droppin' the 'g' from just about everythin' I say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one-on-one when you're a pitcher,'' he says. ``It's just  
the hitter and you. I'm not worried about the guy on first or 
third, just the hitter. If you get the hitter out, you're gonna get 
the other guys out and you're gonna have a chance. A lot of people 
worry too much about different parts of the game, or different 
parts of the disease. You should take it one day at a time and go 
from there. 
</P>
<P>
	``A farmer is the biggest gambler in the world. Everythin' he  
does is a gamble. You don't know if he's gonna get his crop up, you 
don't know at harvest time if he's gonna get the right prices for 
anythin'. He's got to depend on everybody else. I've got to hope 
the doctors can prolong this thing until they find a cure. I just 
sit back and wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He jokes that now he's like former teammate Ron Guidry, ``a  
farmer who doesn't do too much hard labor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although most ALS patients die within five years, some live with  
it for decades. Cambridge physicist Stephen Hawking, a genius 
trapped in a feeble body, has had the disease for 30 years. He 
speaks by touching a computer screen that translates his words 
through an electronic synthesizer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter knows he may be just at the beginning of a long ordeal a  
year after the first symptoms appeared while he was out duck 
hunting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't lift my shotgun with my right hand,'' Hunter says.  
``It was a little bit cool that day, and I thought there was 
somethin' wrong with me that would go away. But it just kept 
gettin' worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was kinda hoping it was a tick bite. I'm always around dogs  
and stuff. Three or four doctors sent my blood off to check for a 
tick bite, but it always come back negative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter started going to doctors last March, traveling to  
Norfolk, Va., and Duke and Johns Hopkins medical centers. It wasn't 
until September that he was diagnosed with ALS. He had seen ``Pride 
of the Yankees'' and knew all about Lou Gehrig and his tragic death 
at 37 in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor's words took Hunter's breath away.  
</P>
<P>
	``Right then,'' the voluble Hunter says, ``I couldn't even  
talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter retreated with his family and friends, emerging only last  
week to accept an invitation to visit the Yankees in spring 
training. He's heard by letter or telephone from virtually everyone 
he played with and some he didn't, including Henry Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no way to cut out ALS in surgery, no magic medicine that  
will make it vanish. At least not yet. Drugs and physical therapy 
might slow it down, and Hunter is counting on that and prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard on us and the whole family, but we all just have to  
be strong,'' Helen Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	He gets new ``cures'' in the stacks of mail that arrive every  
day from around the world, but nothing his doctors are convinced 
will work. They've talked to him about a couple of promising drugs, 
including one that is injected directly into the spine. 
</P>
<P>
	He does what he can to take care of himself with health foods  
and a low-fat, low-sugar diet that he's been on for years to deal 
with diabetes. His own cookbook favorites: Seventh Game Black Bean 
Soup, Pennant Fever Pasta, Catfish Sole, and Pitcher's Mound Pie 
(apple pie with a crunchy whole wheat crust). 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter's legs and lungs are still strong enough to allow him to  
find tranquility in the familiar woods around the clear streams of 
Perquimans County, N.C., where he has fished and hunted since his 
boyhood. He was just Jim or Jimmy then, a boy who learned to pitch 
by throwing to his brothers from a mound by their daddy's 
smokehouse. The Catfish part of his name came later, courtesy of 
publicity-minded Finley, who wanted his new pitcher to have a 
homespun image. Around Hertford, 60 miles southeast of Norfolk, 
he's still just Jimmy. 
</P>
<P>
	When Hunter goes hunting now, for the exercise and the pleasure  
of being with friends, he leaves his gun behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took a gun last year the first day, and I was standin' on  
top of my truck because you've got to be a certain height off the 
ground,'' he says. ``My dogs barked and I dropped my rifle. I got 
down, picked it up, unloaded it, and didn't take a gun anymore. I 
just took my dogs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The beautiful hunting hounds he bred are another part of a life  
that's disappearing. He used to keep about 40 dogs in two kennels 
on the farm but started giving them away this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've given away all my dogs but eight,'' he says. ``I'm tryin'  
to find good homes for them. I never sold a dog, because I know if 
you give them away you give them a good home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had names for every one of them. I named some after  
ballplayers, and they turned out just like the ballplayer. I had 
two named after Jim Nash, who I started in the big leagues with. 
The dogs were big, just like Jim Nash. I called one of 'em Big Jim, 
and one of 'em Nash. Both those two were good dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I named some of 'em after ballplayers who weren't that  
good. But I better not say who those were.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter played with some of the best of his era -- Reggie Jackson,  
Thurman Munson, Lou Piniella in New York; Jackson, Rollie Fingers, 
Sal Bando, Joe Rudi in Oakland. Hunter's gifts, perhaps more 
valuable than his control on the mound, were a competitive streak 
that made those around him better and a fun-loving nature that 
brought sometimes-battling teammates together. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought I'd be 50 years old,'' Hunter says, thinking  
back on those days of pranks and parties. ``I thought I'd die 
before then. Because ballplayers when I played ball loved to have a 
good time, go out together. I loved it. I think the guys today 
don't have as much fun as we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Yankees honored him with a special day after his  
induction into the Hall of Fame in 1987, the club gave him a 
Cartier tray inscribed with his name and the tribute that he 
``taught a new generation of Yankees how to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner always claimed the $3 million he gave Hunter was  
the best money he ever spent. Hunter was ``the rock,'' Steinbrenner 
said, on which the Yankees built all their future championships. 
</P>
<P>
	In that way, Hunter was very much like Gehrig, possessed of  
innate leadership and an inner strength that will surely be tested 
by a relentless and unforgiving disease.

<HEADLINE>  DiMaggio Remembered As True Hero </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Players and fans stood in silence, staring at  
the videoboard in center field before bowing their heads in tribute 
to Joe DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	The game went on at Legends Field, but not before the New York  
Yankees paused to remember the man many considered to be the 
quintessential American hero. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, three times the American League's most valuable  
player, died Monday at his South Florida home. In 13 seasons, he 
played for 10 pennant winners and nine World Series champions with 
the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``This son of Italian immigrants gave every American something  
to believe in,'' President Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He became the very symbol of American grace, power and skill.  
... I have no doubt that when future generations look back at the 
best of America in the 20th century, they will think of the Yankee 
Clipper and all that he achieved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans stopped by Legends Field to pay their respects during the  
day. Some left bouquets of flowers and then returned for a spring 
training game against the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, the Yankees played a 90-second highlight film  
of DiMaggio and observed a moment of silence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe DiMaggio is baseball. He's a national hero,'' said Sandra  
De Santis, a Highland Park, N.J., mother, whose 11-year-old son 
Gregory placed a bouquet is front of the plaque that reads: 
</P>
<P>
	``From 1936-51, Joe led the Yankees through their most  
dominating era. His excellence on the field propelled the Bombers 
to 10 World Series and his graceful stroke was one of baseball's 
greatest pleasures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Current team members remembered him as a legend held in such  
high regard that few of them would approach him during his 
occasional visits to Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	No one wanted to infringe on his privacy. But some players, like  
pitcher David Cone, had memorable encounters with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I met him a few times,'' the right-hander said. ``He told me  
that he'd seen me pitch and sometimes I looked unhittable and 
sometimes I looked hittable. I didn't know how to take that. But 
just the fact he knew who I was was enough for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Catcher Joe Girardi talked about what a thrill it was to have  
his picture taken with DiMaggio when he threw out the first pitch 
during a playoff game in 1996. Darryl Strawberry predicted no one 
will ever hit safely in 56 straight game again, while Derek Jeter 
described DiMaggio as ``everything a ballplayer would want to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To those who knew him and to those who only admired him from  
afar, DiMaggio was an ideal role model. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really lived up to his billing,'' Cone said. ``He was the  
greatest living player. He just had such a dignity and an elegance 
about him that nobody can match in today's game. Even the greatest 
players in today's game can't match that elegance that he had. He's 
one of a kind. ... There was a real royalty to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire, himself a larger-than-life figure after hitting 70  
home runs last season, said he was saddened by DiMaggio's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of the best in the game,'' said McGwire, who never  
got a chance to meet DiMaggio. ``It's a big loss for the game and 
for life in general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Cal Ripken, who shattered the consecutive games streak of  
Lou Gehrig, a former DiMaggio teammate, said: 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fortunate and lucky that I had the opportunity to talk  
baseball with him. I'm a baseball fan, and his accomplishments 
speak for themselves. There were a lot of misconceptions about Joe 
because of his need for privacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone always wanted to ask DiMaggio for an autograph, but didn't.  
About a year ago, he bought a dozen signed baseballs from a 
collector. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why? ... Just so I'd have them,'' the pitcher said. ``I don't  
remember what the exact price was, but it was a lot.''

<HEADLINE>  Catfish Hunter in Battle for Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A boy scampers up the stadium steps, paper  
and pen in outstretched hands, toward George Steinbrenner's box at 
Legends Field where Catfish Hunter and his wife sit alone an hour 
before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Hunter,'' the boy asks, eagerly holding up his pad.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry,'' Catfish says, a penetrating sorrow in his blue  
eyes. ``I can't sign anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lou Gehrig's disease is breaking down Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter's  
body, muscle by muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	He can still use his right arm, once the best in baseball, to  
guide the razor in his left hand when he shaves. Soon, he knows, he 
may not be able to do that. And he can still get around his beloved 
farm in a pickup truck, thanks to power steering and a long oak 
lever a neighbor made to start the ignition. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has to rely more and more on Helen, his sweetheart since  
high school and wife of 32 years. She helps him so much already, 
cutting up food, buttoning buttons, tucking in his shirttail, tying 
his shoes. His flaccid arms dangle limply. His hands are soft and 
puffy, no longer the strong hands of a pitcher or farmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always used to get up early and leave her in bed. Now I've  
got to wait until she gets up to get me dressed,'' says Hunter, who 
owns 1,000 acres of rich farmland and dense woods in his native 
Hertford, N.C. ``I'm puttin' a lot of work on her, and she's been 
strong. But once in a while we sit there and cry together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He gave himself insulin shots three times a day for diabetes  
since 1978, never complained about it. That's Helen's job now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell when she's mad at me,'' he said, joking. ``She

in a knit shirt and blue jeans and shared his worries about 
helplessness, about what it means to cede independence, to lose 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter is one of 30,000 Americans with Lou Gehrig's disease,  
also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS. Garbled 
instructions to brain cells from a perfectly normal gene appear to 
trigger an attack on nerves in the spinal cord and brain that 
control muscle movement. So far, the result is unstoppable: 
progressive paralysis leading to death. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll find a cure someday, and I just hope I'm still here  
when they find it,'' says Hunter, who turns 53 on April 8. A moment 
later his eyes brim with tears as he speaks of his children, Todd, 
28, Kim, 25, Paul, 18, and a 3-year-old grandson, Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to see them grow up,'' he says, his strong, gravelly  
voice cracking. 
</P>
<P>
	Control, control, control ... that was Hunter's mantra in a  
15-year Hall of Fame pitching career with the Kansas City and 
Oakland Athletics and Yankees through 1979. He could crank up a 90 
mph heater once in a while, but mostly he painted the plate

cotton, peanuts, corn and soybeans, he has learned to cope with the 
vagaries of the weather and the markets.

<P>
	Hunter is, as he describes himself, ``uncomplicated, country

anythin'. He's got to depend on everybody else. I've got to hope 
the doctors can prolong this thing until they find a cure. I just 
sit back and wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He jokes that now he's like former teammate Ron Guidry, ``a  
farmer who doesn't do too much hard labor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although most ALS patients die within five years, some live with  
it for decades. Cambridge physicist Stephen Hawking, a genius 
trapped in a feeble body, has had the disease for 30 years. He 
speaks by touching a computer screen that translates his words 
through an electronic synthesizer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter knows he may be just at the beginning of a long ordeal a  
year after the first symptoms appeared while he was out duck 
hunting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't lift my shotgun with my right hand,'' Hunter says.  
``It was a little bit cool that day, and I thought there was 
somethin' wrong with me that would go away. But it just kept 
gettin' worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was kinda hoping it was a tick bite. I'm always around dogs  
and stuff. Three or four doctors sent my blood off to check for a 
tick bite, but it always come back negative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter started going to doctors last March, traveling to  
Norfolk, Va., and Duke and Johns Hopkins medical centers. It wasn't 
until September that he was diagnosed with ALS. He had seen ``Pride 
of the Yankees'' and knew all about Lou Gehrig and his tragic death 
at 37 in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor's words took Hunter's breath away.  
</P>
<P>
	``Right then,'' the voluble Hunter says, ``I couldn't even  
talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter retreated with his family and friends, emerging only last  
week to accept an invitation to visit the Yankees in spring 
training. He's heard by letter or telephone from virtually everyone 
he played with and some he didn't, including Henry Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no way to cut out ALS in surgery, no magic medicine that  
will make it vanish. At least not yet. Drugs and physical therapy 
might slow it down, and Hunter is counting on that and prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard on us and the whole family, but we all just have to  
be strong,'' Helen Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	He gets new ``cures'' in the stacks of mail that arrive every  
day from around the world, but nothing his doctors are convinced 
will work. They've talked to him about a couple of promising drugs, 
including one that is injected directly into the spine. 
</P>
<P>
	He does what he can to take care of himself with health foods  
and a low-fat, low-sugar diet that he's been on for years to deal 
with diabetes. His own cookbook favorites: Seventh Game Black Bean 
Soup, Pennant Fever Pasta, Catfish Sole, and Pitcher's Mound Pie 
(apple pie with a crunchy whole wheat crust). 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter's legs and lungs are still strong enough to allow him to  
find tranquility in the familiar woods around the clear streams of 
Perquimans County, N.C., where he has fished and hunted since his 
boyhood. He was just Jim or Jimmy then, a boy who learned to pitch 
by throwing to his brothers from a mound by their daddy's 
smokehouse. The Catfish part of his name came later, courtesy of 
publicity-minded Finley, who wanted his new pitcher to have a 
homespun image. Around Hertford, 60 miles southeast of Norfolk, 
he's still just Jimmy. 
</P>
<P>
	When Hunter goes hunting now, for the exercise and the pleasure  
of being with friends, he leaves his gun behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took a gun last year the first day, and I was standin' on  
top of my truck because you've got to be a certain height off the 
ground,'' he says. ``My dogs barked and I dropped my rifle. I got 
down, picked it up, unloaded it, and didn't take a gun anymore. I 
just took my dogs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The beautiful hunting hounds he bred are another part of a life  
that's disappearing. He used to keep about 40 dogs in two kennels 
on the farm but started giving them away this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've given away all my dogs but eight,'' he says. ``I'm tryin'  
to find good homes for them. I never sold a dog, because I know if 
you give them away you give them a good home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had names for every one of them. I named some after  
ballplayers, and they turned out just like the ballplayer. I had 
two named after Jim Nash, who I started in the big leagues with. 
The dogs were big, just like Jim Nash. I called one of 'em Big Jim, 
and one of 'em Nash. Both those two were good dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I named some of 'em after ballplayers who weren't that  
good. But I better not say who those were.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter played with some of the best of his era -- Reggie Jackson,  
Thurman Munson, Lou Piniella in New York; Jackson, Rollie Fingers, 
Sal Bando, Joe Rudi in Oakland. Hunter's gifts, perhaps more 
valuable than his control on the mound, were a competitive streak 
that made those around him better and a fun-loving nature that 
brought sometimes-battling teammates together. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought I'd be 50 years old,'' Hunter says, thinking  
back on those days of pranks and parties. ``I thought I'd die 
before then. Because ballplayers when I played ball loved to have a 
good time, go out together. I loved it. I think the guys today 
don't have as much fun as we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Yankees honored him with a special day after his  
induction into the Hall of Fame in 1987, the club gave him a 
Cartier tray inscribed with his name and the tribute that he 
``taught a new generation of Yankees how to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner always claimed the $3 million he gave Hunter was  
the best money he ever spent. Hunter was ``the rock,'' Steinbrenner 
said, on which the Yankees built all their future championships. 
</P>
<P>
	In that way, Hunter was very much like Gehrig, possessed of  
innate leadership and an inner strength that will surely be tested 
by a relentless and unforgiving disease.

<HEADLINE> Stranded Pakistan Seamen Reach Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH PADRE ISLAND, Texas (AP) -- The last 12 crew members  
stranded aboard a rusting cargo ship came ashore Tuesday, ending a 
10-month ordeal during which they staved off scurvy and suicidal 
thoughts and caught rain water and fish to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very thankful to God,'' Capt. Maqsood Ahmed said. ``We  
were prisoners at sea without committing a crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The seamen were the last of a 23-man crew from Karachi,  
Pakistan, to leave the Delta Pride, a broken-down freighter that 
has been anchored about four miles off the south Texas coast since 
just before Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Immigration and Naturalization Service said the  
crewmen could remain in the country for up to 30 days while they 
iron out travel plans and other details. They will stay temporarily 
in a Catholic-run refugee center. 
</P>
<P>
	Some crewmen cried when they were allowed off the ship. Chief  
officer Ahmed Shamshad bent down and kissed the pier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two or three of my men thought they'd never stand on land  
again,'' the captain said. 
</P>
<P>
	For 18 months, the 740-foot Delta Pride delivered millions of  
dollars' worth of coal, bauxite, scrap iron and grain to England, 
Asia, West Africa, the Middle East and Texas on behalf of different 
government agencies. After their last delivery, in May, they were 
sent to Tampico, Mexico. They remained in the waters there for 
nearly six months. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship's owner, Tri-star Shipping Lines of Karachi, went  
bankrupt. A financial dispute with Mexican officials followed, 
leading to the seizure of the ship's documents and the crew's 
passports. 
</P>
<P>
	SOS calls were ignored as life aboard the ship became more  
desperate by the day. With fuel gone, there was no way to run the 
air conditioner or lights, and the 30-year-old ship became dark and 
hot. The seamen eventually lived off whatever rain water and fish 
they could catch. 
</P>
<P>
	With no clean water for bathing and washing clothes, rashes and  
early signs of scurvy were setting in. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people were dying in front of me,'' said Ahmed, who was on  
his first voyage as captain. 
</P>
<P>
	By November, the men were threatening to commit mass suicide.  
That's when Ahmed found a $10 bill in his dresser drawer and was 
inspired by the words ``In God We Trust.'' He gathered his crew and 
told them they were making a 300-mile journey to the United States 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't easy. They didn't have much fuel or even enough water  
to keep the engines cool; also, two of three generators weren't 
working and the other kept catching fire. Any breakdown could have 
set them adrift for good. 
</P>
<P>
	After setting out at night to avoid Mexican officials, the Delta  
Pride made it to U.S. waters on Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. officials denied the ship permission to pull into port  
because of mechanical problems and because it lacked a certificate 
guaranteeing payment from its owners if the ship caused any damage. 
Crew members couldn't come ashore because they didn't have 
passports. 
</P>
<P>
	Five times a day, the men gathered for prayer. A New York Times  
Magazine reporter who visited in December wrote that the men spent 
the rest of their time shuffling around in slippers ``like patients 
in a hospital'' with nothing to do except think about ``frightening 
existential questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But people were working on the crew's behalf.  
</P>
<P>
	Global Ship Services of New Orleans, a supply company, provided  
a fuel shipment and medical treatment. The Greater Houston 
Pakistani Association sent supplies and helped fund trips home for 
11 crew members with health problems, leaving behind the 12 who 
were rescued Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been going to sea for 20 years,'' said Capt. Eddie Max  
Stovall of the Brazos Santiago Pilots Association, a group that 
guides ships into port and often delivered the Delta Pride 
clothing, food, cigarettes and other supplies. ``I've been through 
a fraction of what they've gone through and can relate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pakistani group in Houston offered to send them all home  
with a portion of their wages, but Ahmed refused. Some of his men 
said they would jump into the sea in shame if they didn't have all 
their money. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the abandoned ship was auctioned for scrap for  
$300,000 to ESCO, a North Carolina company. The crew had hoped to 
get at least $450,000, causing a squabble that tied up the case in 
federal court until last week, when a judge determined that the 
auction was held properly. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS waited to let the men come ashore until they had the  
money to pay their way home. It was unclear how much of the 
$300,000 would be left over to pay their wages. 
</P>
<P>
	Shamshad, the chief officer, has been working at sea for 28  
years, but he doubts he'll ever sail again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very difficult for my family,'' Shamshad said, noting  
that he's spoken to them for about three minutes in the last year. 
``It was a very bad experience.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Lower; Dow Down 25 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened lower this morning as bond prices  
eased and investors reacted to some discouraging news in the 
technology sector, which had led the broad market higher on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 25.53 at 9,702.08. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which rose to a record high  
close on Monday, was down 5.00 at 1,277.73. The technology-heavy 
Nasdaq composite index was down 3.58 at 2,394.04. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue-chip shares fell in sympathy with the bond market, where  
the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was down 9/32 point and 
yielding 5.61 percent, up from 5.59 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds were lower this morning ahead of the release of revised  
productivity figures for the fourth quarter. The report, made 
public at 10 a.m. EST, showed that the productivity of American 
workers surged at a 4.6 percent annual rate during the final three 
months of last year, the best showing in six years. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, productivity increased a healthy 2.2 percent, a  
significant improvement over the 1.2 percent gain in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds were trimming their losses immediately after release of  
the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, on the technology front, microchip maker Advanced  
Micro Devices warned of a ``significant'' first-quarter loss 
because of production problems with its best line of 
microprocessors. AMD shares were down 2 1/16 at 16 7/8. Although AMD 
trades on the New York Stock Exchange, its news pressured broad 
market indexes, which are heavily weighted in technology shares, 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly 7 to 4 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 91.2 million shares, 
up from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.15 percent.  
European bourses were lower in afternoon trading. Germany's DAX 
index was down .80 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.08 
percent, and France's CAC-40 was off 0.56 percent.

<HEADLINE> Woman Gets $3.7M in Isuzu Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VENTURA, Calif. (AP) -- A woman who lost a leg and suffered brain  
injuries in an Isuzu Rodeo accident has been awarded $3.7 million 
by jurors who found the auto company negligent in testing the sport 
utility vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Irene Gutierrez, now 23, was one of four passengers in the 1995  
Rodeo that tipped over in 1996 when the driver lost control while 
changing lanes at about 70 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Driver Richard Soliz, who suffered a separated shoulder,  
previously settled with Gutierrez and was dismissed as a defendant, 
said Christine Spagnoli, Gutierrez's attorney. The other passengers 
received minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Isuzu was ordered to pay $3.7 million for economic, pain and  
suffering damages. Soliz was found partially responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	Isuzu Motors America Inc. had not decided if it would appeal  
Friday's ruling, said Terry Maloney, vice president of corporate 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The driver handling of this vehicle and a driver's input has  
much to do with how a vehicle reacts,'' Maloney said Tuesday. ``I 
think it's important to note in this case, the jury did not find 
the design of the Rodeo to be defective in any way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maloney did not know if the 1995 Rodeo had been tested  
specifically for ``rollover resistance.'' Gutierrez's attorneys had 
the vehicle tested for rollover resistance and presented evidence 
that the vehicle tipped at 42 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez, a college student at the time of the accident, now  
lives with her family. She suffers from memory loss and impaired 
judgment, and uses a prosthetic leg.

<HEADLINE> Disabled Woman Goes on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANDUSKY, Ohio (AP) -- A disabled woman went on trial on  
child-endangerment charges Tuesday for driving her motorized 
wheelchair in the street with her daughter strapped onto her lap. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Dillery, 30, blames a lack of accessible sidewalks, and  
some disability rights activists have rallied to her side. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dillery, who has muscular dystrophy, could get up to a  
$1,000 fine and six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection began in Municipal Court despite earlier offers  
from prosecutors to drop the charges if she stays off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want people to know that just because you're in a  
wheelchair, you don't have to hide behind walls,'' Ms. Dillery 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dillery said she and daughter Kelsi were on a shopping trip  
for school clothes in July when they encountered a sidewalk that 
Ms. Dillery couldn't maneuver on. So she wheeled her motorized 
chair into the street. 
</P>
<P>
	A motorist said that they were dangerously close to traffic and  
that Kelsi, now 5, hit her head on a car's mirror. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is whether Kelly Dillery violated her duty as a  
parent,'' said city prosecutor Rob DeLamatre. ``There is no 
exception for somebody's physical condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disability activists are divided. Some say Ms. Dillery's plight  
brings attention to the kind of problem they face every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kelly is our own Rosa Parks,'' said Shona Eakim, director of  
the Ability Center of Greater Toledo, referring to the woman whose 
refusal to give up her seat on a Montgomery, Ala., bus in 1955 
helped blacks overcome segregation. 
</P>
<P>
	Others say Ms. Dillery showed poor judgment.  
</P>
<P>
	``For a mother to risk injury to her child, knowing herself what  
it's like to be disabled, I don't think she was thinking 
straight,'' said Jim Goodman of the Persons With Disabilities Law 
Center in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said that for almost two years, they have received  
complaints about Ms. Dillery riding in the streets of Sandusky. Ms. 
Dillery twice has been convicted of violating an ordinance 
prohibiting people and unauthorized vehicles from being in the 
road, the last time in January. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she tries to travel on sidewalks when possible. She  
also uses public transportation, but buses run only on weekdays and 
not at night.

<HEADLINE> Money for Clinton Museum Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- State lawmakers on Tuesday rejected a  
request for $500,000 to be put toward converting President 
Clinton's boyhood home into a museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's sponsor ran from the House chamber in tears.  
</P>
<P>
	Many representatives who voted against the bill said it had  
nothing to do with Clinton, but with the source of the money. The 
project would have been funded immediately, instead of having to 
compete later with scores of other local projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sandra Rodgers, a Democrat from Clinton's native Hope,  
rushed from the House chamber after the vote and cried in the 
Capitol halls. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want President Clinton to know that they don't support  
him, that's fine with me. I'll try to convey that message for 
him,'' said Ms. Rodgers, her voice breaking. ``I'm just really 
mad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defeat came as a shock to Ms. Rodgers, who said 85  
representatives had signed on as cosponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which needed 75 votes in the 99-member House, was  
defeated 41-8. Most members, not wanting to appear opposed to 
Clinton, either didn't vote or cast a ``present'' vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaker Pro Tem Doug Kidd, who co-sponsored the bill but then  
urged colleagues not to approve it, said many members didn't 
initially understand that the money was coming from the state's 
current budget -- not its next one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone who didn't vote, or voted no, meant  
particularly that they didn't want to do something for the 
president's birthplace,'' said Kidd, D-Benton. ``It's just good 
government to look at every bit of this stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But at least one representative said he opposed the funding  
because he opposes Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have voted for impeachment, and I think he has  
disgraced our state in a lot of ways,'' said Rep. Jim Bob Duggar, 
R-Springdale.

<HEADLINE> Sears Settles Lawsuit for $72M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOFFMAN ESTATES, Ill. (AP) -- Sears, Roebuck and Co. has agreed  
to pay a combination of money and coupons to 11 million of its 
credit card holders to settle a class-action lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears said Tuesday the disagreement began when balances on  
credit cards were transferred to one of its subsidiaries, the Sears 
National Bank. The new bank increased the credit card's annual 
percentage rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Card holders said that was unfair. They claimed Sears had made a  
commitment to not increase the APR. But Sears said it didn't do 
anything wrong and that card holders didn't understand the 
company's information on the terms of the change in credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, which still must be approved in U.S.  
District Court, Sears will pay $72 million in cash and coupons to 
about 3 million customers -- or about $23.80 each. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined amount of cash and coupons is 50 percent of the  
estimated incremental APR class members have paid and are expected 
to pay as a result in the change in credit terms, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also calls for Sears to send coupons worth $7.50  
to all 11 million class members and to pay about $3 million for 
consumer counseling, protection and education, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears, based in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates, has 845  
full-line department stores and more than 2,000 off-the-mall stores 
nationwide.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Blames Politicians for Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan blames  
politicians in Washington -- not the American people -- for the U.S. 
failure to pay $1.3 billion in arrears to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have spent too much time with ordinary Americans ... to  
blame them for their government's inability to honor its 
obligations to the United Nations,'' he said Tuesday. ``The problem 
is in Washington, and only Washington can solve it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Annan made his comments in a speech to the United Nations  
Association of the United States of America, which is spearheading 
a new campaign to lobby support across the country and in Congress 
to pay the debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign announced Monday that Ted Turner's United Nations  
Foundation has allocated $12 million over the next two years for 
the lobbying effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, President Clinton vetoed legislation that would have  
paid off a chunk of the U.S. arrears because of what he called 
unrelated abortion restrictions tacked on to the bill by 
Republicans.

<P>
	The amendment would bar U.S. funds from being used to support  
international family-planning groups that lobby foreign governments 
to liberalize their abortion laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has previously held up payments of U.N. debts to demand  
a reduction in the U.S. share of the budget and a streamlining of 
the world organization. Annan claims he has largely come through 
with the demanded reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary-general, who held talks with Clinton and  
congressional leaders in Washington last month, said he welcomed 
new efforts to tackle U.S. arrears and hoped they succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last two years, I have sought to convince Washington  
of the need to put the issue of the U.S. arrears behind us, once 
and for all -- above all, for Washington's own sake,'' Annan said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the association's public activities would help to ensure  
``that America's role in the United Nations of the next century 
will be as vital as it has been in the century we are about to 
leave.''

<HEADLINE> Actress Peggy Cass Dies at 74 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Peggy Cass, who won a 1957 Tony for her  
portrayal of Agnes Gooch in ``Auntie Mame'' on Broadway and 
reprised the role on film, has died. She was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cass died of heart failure Monday at Memorial  
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, said David Williams, her agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was just a great comedienne,'' Williams said. ``You just  
have to remember her for her generous spirit and her charming 
personality and her quick one-liners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agnes Gooch was Mame's young secretary. Ms. Cass won a Tony for  
the role on stage and was nominated for an Academy Award for the 
film musical ``Auntie Mame'' starring Rosalind Russell. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cass made her Broadway debut in ``Touch and Go'' and later  
acted in ``Bernadine'' and ``Oh, Men, Oh, Women.'' She also starred 
in ``A Thurber Carnival,'' ``The Front Page'' and ``Agnes of God'' 
on stage.

Goes Hawaiian'' (1961) and ``If It's Tuesday, This Must Be 
Belgium'' (1969).

<HEADLINE> Montana Musher Leads Iditarod </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NIKOLAI, Alaska (AP) -- Montana musher Doug Swingley defied the  
collective thinking of his fellow frontrunners Tuesday, leading 
racers into the Nikolai checkpoint in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog 
Race. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley, who won the 1995 Iditarod, drove his 14-dog team into  
this tiny Athabaskan Indian village at 1:38 p.m. Alaska time. 
</P>
<P>
	Others in the lead pack hunkered down on the snowy tundra  
outside Nikolai, waiting for the warmest part of the day to pass 
before starting to move again. 
</P>
<P>
	``For my dogs, this is cold weather,'' said Swingley, the only  
non-Alaskan ever to win the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Nikolai, on the south fork of the Kuskokwim River, is about 315  
miles into the 1,100-mile race from Anchorage to Nome. The race 
began Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Jeff King arrived in Nikolai about a  
half-hour after Swingley. He was limping and in obvious pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I twisted my knee and it hurts like hell,'' said King. ``I  
almost lost my team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King said he fell off his sled Monday between Finger Lake and  
Rainy Pass, on what many mushers described as a particularly rough 
stretch of trail. He said that while his right knee was painful, he 
would be able to stand up on it ``as long as I don't have to do any 
fancy dancing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeeDee Jonrowe, last year's runner-up, was third into Nikolai,  
followed by Norwegian Harald Tunheim and John Barron. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonrowe was the first musher out of the Rohn Roadhouse  
checkpoint, about 90 miles before Nikolai, at 12:06 a.m. Tuesday. 
Within an hour she was followed by Mitch Seavey, Ramey Smyth and 
Charlie Boulding. None of them spent more than a few minutes at the 
checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-time winner Martin Buser left Rohn at 2:57 a.m. after  
nearly seven hours of rest, and defending champion Jeff King hit 
the trail at 4:12 a.m. after a six-hour break. 
</P>
<P>
	By late morning, more than two dozen mushers had come and gone  
from Rohn, and another dozen had reached the checkpoint. They 
crowded into a small cabin to eat, rest and tell tales about their 
race so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Teasley of Wyoming, an Iditarod veteran back after a  
five-year hiatus, said his race plan was thrown off early when he 
shredded a sled runner, but had to keep using it for some 50 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things have gotten better since that discovery,'' Teasley  
said. ``I wasn't having any fun till then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Anderson, a rookie from Fairbanks, ran his dogs from the  
Rainy Pass checkpoint to Rohn -- a distance of 48 miles -- with very 
little rest. He said his team was pooped out and that he would 
likely be forced to take his mandatory 24-hour rest stop at Rohn to 
let them recharge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a rookie mistake,'' Anderson said. ``That's a real  
tough trail, and I underestimated what that would do to the dogs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Little, another Iditarod rookie, had been touted as a  
possible top-20 finisher, but he too was rethinking his strategy. 
He had been forced to drop five of his 16 dogs in the first 200 
miles due to shoulder injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember thinking 'Oh my God, what have I done?''' Little  
said after leaving four dogs at Skwentna, 100 miles into the race. 
``I'm having more fun now -- it's a challenge to keep them going for 
another 800 miles or so.''

<HEADLINE> Queen Honors Bond Star </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Roger Moore found being honored by Queen Elizabeth  
II on Tuesday a little more nerve-wracking than dodging bullets in 
her majesty's service. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a bit nervous, mainly because you don't get a rehearsal  
for this and I am used to having rehearsals before I perform,'' he 
said after the queen gave him the Commander of the Order of British 
Empire medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, 71, may be most famous as James Bond, but it was his  
UNICEF campaign for children that won him the queen's recognition. 
He has been a special ambassador for the U.N. children's charity 
for almost a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``Working with UNICEF made me grow up and recognize how  
fortunate I am,'' Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Jones was honored for his services to music and  
entertainment and received an Officer of the Order of British 
Empire medal from the queen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't bring a hat,'' the 58-year-old singer joked,  
``because I thought it might mess up my hair.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 34 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were higher in early afternoon but  
rapidly trimming their gains, as rumors circulated that more 
technology companies would report disappointing first-quarter 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 34.41 at 9,762.02. The Dow got as high as 9,798.93, up 71 
points, before backing off in early afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which rose to a record high  
close on Monday, was up 6.53 at 1,289.26, after climbing as much as 
11 points earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index was up 13.33 at 2,410.95 after  
trimming an earlier gain of 35 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors sold technology stocks at the open after an  
announcement that microchip maker Advanced Micro Devices expected 
``significant'' first-quarter loss because of production problems 
with its best line of microprocessors. AMD also announced a 
restructuring that will include cutting 300 jobs over the next six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	AMD shares were down 1 11/16 at 17 1/4. Other technology stocks  
were better behaved in late morning, but succumbed in early 
afternoon to worries that AMD may not be alone in expecting poor 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq Computer was down 1 1/2 at 32 7/8, although Dow member IBM was  
up 2 1/8 at 181. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks weren't helped much by gains in the bond market. The  
30-year Treasury bond was up nearly 1/2 point, its yield down to 5.55 
percent from 5.59 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market opened lower but turned around after a 10 a.m.  
report showing that the productivity of American workers surged at 
a 4.6 percent annual rate during the final three months of last 
year, the best showing in six years. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, productivity increased a healthy 2.2 percent, a  
significant improvement over the 1.2 percent gain in 1997. Higher 
productivity means companies are more efficient and in many cases, 
more profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	The lift in bonds supported financial services, stocks.  
Citigroup was up 1 at 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets ``were looking for reasons to rally, and that  
was as good as any,'' said Richard E. Cripps, chief market 
strategist for Legg Mason of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Longer term for the stock market, however, Cripps said he was  
concerned about a drop in cash deposits into stock funds, and an 
ongoing concentration of buying interest in the shares of 
large-capitalization companies over smaller ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our sense is that the liquidity going into the market is  
slowing, and what's happening is that the large-cap performance 
driven stocks are sucking liquidity from smaller caps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues were leading  
advancers a 6-to-5 margin. Volume on the Big Board came to 362 
million shares, up from Monday's pace of 546.45 million, up from 
Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR Nabisco shares were up 1 3/16 at 29 13/16 on the Big Board.  
The consumer-products holding corporation agreed to sell its 
international tobacco business to Japan Tobacco Inc. for $7.8 
billion, and said it will separate its U.S. tobacco unit from its 
big Nabisco food operation.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Makes N.C. Speedways Lawful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- NASCAR racing fans won't be confused with  
flower power and hippies if North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt signs 
pending legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a plan approved by the state House Tuesday, Charlotte  
Motor Speedway and North Carolina Motor Speedway in Rockingham soon 
won't have to worry about not being in compliance with a 
rarely-enforced public health law. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would exempt the two North Carolina speedways that  
stage NASCAR Winston Cup races from the law which regulates mass 
gatherings of campers. 
</P>
<P>
	The law now requires organizers of open-air events in which  
5,000 people or more gather for more than 24 hours to obtain a 
state permit, liability insurance and a performance bond. It was 
passed in the 1970s as something of an anti-Woodstock bill, 
designed to discourage the massive music festivals of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide an exemption to stadiums holding events  
with crowds of more than 70,000 and which have adjacent 
campgrounds. The two speedways are the only facilities in the state 
that would fall into that category. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte Motor Speedway -- recently renamed Lowe's Motor  
Speedway -- has seating for 156,000. The Rockingham speedway has 
seating for about 75,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Charlotte Motor Speedway learned of the law  
through media reports last year and discovered they were not in 
compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	The exemption now needs only the governor's signature to become  
law.

<HEADLINE> 4 Firms Take Red Hat Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Four technology heavyweights will make  
equity investments in Red Hat Software, a distributor of the Linux 
operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Oracle Corp., Compaq Computer Corp., IBM and Novell will each  
gain a minority stake in Red Hat, the company said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Linux was developed in the early 1990s by a Finnish student  
named Linus Torvalds. The grassroots software is edging into the 
mainstream as users embrace its flexibility and its propensity to 
avoid crashing. While the software is free and available over the 
Internet, Red Hat sells packaged versions and technical support. 
</P>
<P>
	``These were partners specifically chosen by Red Hat as leaders  
in their respective fields to help establish Red Hat as the premier 
Internet-based computing platform,'' company spokeswoman Melissa 
London said. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies will join Intel, Netscape and two venture capital  
firms that became equity investors in September. None of the 
companies will disclose how much they invested. 
</P>
<P>
	Novell's investment comes with a commitment to work with Red Hat  
to develop directory services for Linux, said Blake Modersitzki, 
director of strategic investments for Novell. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to a long relationship with them,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, IBM announced a partnership with Red Hat to start  
shipping hardware to Linux and said it would help develop the 
operating system. Last week, IBM broadened the commitment by 
releasing some Web development applications that run on Linux and 
announcing support for some other, non-Red Hat Linux flavors.

<HEADLINE> Freestyle Skier Moran Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- A former U.S. Olympic freestyle ski team  
member who suffered a severe head injury last month is out of 
immediate danger and continues to improve, doctors at Swedish 
Medical Center said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Moran, 26, was injured Feb. 20 when he landed badly after an  
aerial spin during the U.S. Freeskiing Open at Vail. He was 
airlifted to the hospital in suburban Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Moran ``is more aware and alert, is communicating with his  
family and the staff, and has begun spending some time each day 
sitting up in a chair,'' said Dr. Timothy Fullgar, a neurosurgeon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have upgraded his condition to fair and are evaluating him  
as a candidate for rehabilitation,'' said Fullgar. Doctors said 
Moran has been moved out of the Critical Care Unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Moran left the U.S. team after finishing 23rd in the moguls  
competition in the Winter Olympics last year. He skied to two World 
Cup moguls victories, a 1993 event in Breckenridge and a 1996 
competition in Altenmarkt, Austria.

<HEADLINE> MacLeod Resigns As Notre Dame Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Notre Dame basketball coach John  
MacLeod, who had just three winning seasons in his eight years at 
the school, resigned Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Mike Wadsworth said he met with MacLeod  
Tuesday afternoon and the coach indicated he wanted to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	MacLeod said in a statement: ``I think everything is in place  
for Notre Dame to make a positive move. I appreciated the 
opportunity to work here at Notre Dame and I wish the best for the 
young men who are part of the program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wadsworth refused to discuss the circumstances surrounding  
MacLeod's departure, insisting MacLeod had requested that he limit 
what he said to what was in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	But MacLeod told The Associated Press in an interview Friday  
that he expected to be back as coach despite the team's 14-16 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes I do. I really do,'' MacLeod said. ``There's nothing  
written in stone. I'm not sitting here thinking I'm not going to be 
here. I'm going on a recruit trip tomorrow. We've been working our 
tails off,'' he said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	MacLeod's Notre Dame teams were 106-124, with the only winning  
years being 18-15 in 1991-92, his first at the school, 15-12 in 
1994-95 and 16-14 in 1996-97. MacLeod, 61, had the Fighting Irish 
in the NIT twice, 1992 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	MacLeod arrived at Notre Dame in 1991 after 18 seasons in the  
NBA with Phoenix, Dallas and the New York Knicks. His combined 
record in the NBA was 707-657 and his teams went to the playoffs 11 
times, four times reaching the conference finals. He coached at 
Oklahoma before moving to the NBA, finishing with a 90-69 mark in 
six seasons there. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame moved into the Big East for the 1995-96 season and  
the Fighting Irish never had a winning season in the league with an 
overall mark of 27-45 and an 0-4 record in the Big East tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	MacLeod was selected as Big East coach of the year in 1997 and  
had players honored by the league the last two seasons, Pat Garrity 
as player of the year in 1998 and Troy Murphy as rookie of the year 
in 1999.

<HEADLINE> FIFA in Favor of Two Referee Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- The technical committee of world  
soccer's governing body on Tuesday gave support to using two 
referees in games. 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA plans to run a trial in professional leagues on all  
continents starting in July and running for the whole 1999-2000 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial would probably see referees covering half the field  
each. 
</P>
<P>
	There was ``lively debate'' at the meeting of the technical  
committee and views differed on the subject, a FIFA statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eduardo Farah, the president of the Paulista League in Brazil,  
which has already carried out unofficial experiments in about 200 
lower division matches, said actual playing time increased to more 
than 65 minutes out of the 90-minute match, and there were fewer 
fouls. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the quality of refereeing improved because the two  
referees indirectly kept an eye on one another. 
</P>
<P>
	``Better to use four eyes than four video cameras,'' said  
Tahitian member Reynald Temarii. 
</P>
<P>
	The technical committee ``did draw attention to possible  
problems with the system, such as differing interpretation of the 
laws of the game and inadequate coordination between the two 
referees,'' the statement added. 
</P>
<P>
	UEFA, European soccer's governing body, also said Tuesday it was  
expecting to be involved in a trial of the two-referee system. The 
system has already been tried out in amateur matches on the British 
island of Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	England's Premier League referee officer, Philip Don, welcomed  
the FIFA initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	``Full credit to FIFA for trying it, it'll be interesting and  
you've got to consider it,'' Don said. 
</P>
<P>
	The French sports daily L'Equipe said one trial would take place  
in the French second division.

<HEADLINE> Group: Credit Insurance a Ripoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers who buy credit insurance when they  
take out a loan, buy a car or get a credit card are being 
overcharged by $2 billion a year, Consumers Union and another group 
charged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Griffin, insurance counsel for Consumers Union, and Birny  
Birnbaum, consulting economist for the Center for Economic Justice, 
blamed state insurance regulators for what they said is lax 
supervision of credit insurance sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're asking the states to do their job,'' Birnbaum said at a  
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	An official of the National Association of Insurance  
Commissioners, which represents the state regulators, said they 
shared some of the concerns about credit insurance rates and were 
looking into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Several regulators ``have expressed concern about the credit  
industry in general'' and credit insurance rates, said Steven 
Larsen, chairman of the NAIC's market conduct and consumer affairs 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``This needs to be re-examined,'' Larsen, who also is Maryland's  
insurance commissioner, said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit insurance pays a lender, such as a bank or finance  
company, car dealer, department store or credit card company, if a 
borrower becomes disabled or dies. Other types of credit insurance 
provide for monthly payments if a borrower loses his job, or for 
repair or replacement of property bought with the loan or used as 
collateral. 
</P>
<P>
	More than $17 billion in credit insurance was sold in this  
country in 1995 to 1997, according to Consumers Union, which 
publishes ``Consumer Reports'' magazine, and the Center for 
Economic Justice, an advocate for low-income consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Although buying the insurance usually is not mandatory, the two  
groups maintain that lenders often coerce consumers into taking it. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups released a study of credit insurance sales in that  
period which concluded that most consumers are paying more than is 
reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think (most) consumers should stay away from this  
product,'' Ms. Griffin told reporters. Credit insurance ``is a bad 
deal and it's only getting worse,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	An exception, Ms. Griffin said, involves those consumers who  
live in states with cheaper rates for credit insurance or who are 
elderly or in poor health. 
</P>
<P>
	The states with the cheapest rates, according to the study, were  
New York, Maine, Pennsylvania, Vermont, New Jersey, West Virginia, 
Rhode Island, Michigan and Virginia, in that order. 
</P>
<P>
	Many consumers already have life insurance policies that cover  
their debts if they die, and homeowners insurance often covers 
property losses, Ms. Griffin noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Janet Eissenstadt, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers  
Association, agreed with that point. 
</P>
<P>
	As with any financial product, consumers should examine whether  
they need credit insurance, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Read the fine print,'' Ms. Eissenstadt advised.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> GE Buying Home-Shopping Channel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC is entering the world of fake furs, pasta  
cookers and porcelain figurines with its first investment in home 
shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC parent General Electric Co. is buying a minority stake in  
ValueVision, the third largest home-shopping cable network, hoping 
to tie the companies' TV and Internet businesses into one powerful 
retailer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Home-shopping channel offerings on cable ... represent a  
critical link from television to the evolving world of e-commerce 
and the Internet,'' said Tom Rogers, president of NBC's cable 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC will try to take advantage of its relationships with cable  
operators to get ValueVision shown in more homes. At the same time, 
NBC will help ValueVision give its Web site a face-lift as the 
companies seek to find another Internet player to join the venture. 
</P>
<P>
	For NBC, the deal adds a new type of programming to its cable  
lineup and furthers its online expansion at a time when big media 
rivals are rapidly increasing their investments in the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	ValueVision International Inc. operates the No. 3 cable  
home-shopping channel behind QVC and Barry Diller's Home Shopping 
Network. ValueVision is shown in 21.8 million U.S. homes on either 
a full- or part-time basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBC deal employs a similar strategy to Diller's plan to  
acquire Internet company Lycos Inc. and combine it with his Home 
Shopping Network and Ticketmaster operations to create a wealth of 
cross-promotion opportunities. That deal, however, has been plagued 
by opposition from Lycos' biggest shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Tuesday's deal, GE will buy up to 19.9 percent of  
ValueVision for $56 million, and has an option to raise that stake 
to 39.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors cheered the deal, sending ValueVision shares up  
$1.37 1/2, or 14 percent, to $11.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, while 
GE shares rose $1.18 3/4 to $106 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC will lend its experience to try to improve the quality of  
ValueVision's programming, while trying to expand the network's 
distribution by leaning on NBC's relationships with cable operators 
that already carry CNBC and MSNBC. 
</P>
<P>
	ValueVision, an 8-year-old company based in Minneapolis, also  
sells its goods -- which include housewares, toys, collectibles and 
clothing -- over the Internet and through catalogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Although ValueVision's sales and profits had been rising  
steadily for the past few years, its total sales dropped 13 percent 
to $138 million in the first nine months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But ValueVision has said its holiday-season sales were strong  
and CEO Gene McCaffrey said Tuesday that sales from its Web site 
soared from about $200,000 to several million dollars in the past 
year. Year-end figures are due out later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC said it will help redesign ValueVision's site and seek  
opportunities over the next year to combine the site with a portal, 
the popular Internet sites such as Yahoo! and Lycos that offer 
broader services such as e-mail, news, chat and Web searches. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC may try to merge ValueVision with Snap!, a portal in which  
NBC acquired a minority stake last year, or seek deals with other 
Internet companies. 
</P>
<P>
	GE and NBC also see cross-promotion opportunities for  
ValueVision with their other Internet investments, which include 
online car-buying service Autobytel.com, Realtor.com and iVillage 
Inc., which operates a Web site for women. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal also comes as NBC is evaluating the possibility of  
spinning off its online holdings into a separate company if Wall 
Street continues to reward Internet stocks with soaring values.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A Sony Corp.-led rally by high technology shares  
boosted Japan's Nikkei stock average Tuesday to finish above 15,000 
points for the first time since November. The dollar slipped 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 317.65 points,  
or 2.15 percent, to 15,096.70 points by the close of the afternoon 
session. On Monday, the average slid 114.95 points, or 0.77 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time the Nikkei finished above 15,000 since  
Nov. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.76 yen at 5 p.m. (0800 GMT), down 0.02 yen  
from late Monday in Tokyo but slightly above its late New York 
level of 121.66 yen overnight. The greenback ranged between 120.65 
yen and 122.02 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	High tech stocks were on the rise thanks to an increase in the  
U.S. market overnight and Sony's announcement of a major 
restructuring plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rise in the high technology sector, one of the leading  
industries in Japan, brightened the overall market,'' said 
Masatoshi Sato, manager of the investment information group at 
Kankaku Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony soared 890 yen (dlrs 7.36) to 10,940 yen (dlrs 90.41) after  
the company said it would turn three of its listed units into 
wholly-owned subsidiaries by January and slash its work force by 10 
percent by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The units were Sony Music Entertainment, Sony Chemicals and Sony  
Precision Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders lauded the deal as a sign that the influential industry  
leader is bringing its Playstation and other highly profitable 
businesses directly under the wing of the parent company. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading in the shares of the three units involved was suspended  
Tuesday morning as exchange officials verified the information. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other high-technology shares, Toshiba jumped 39 yen (dlrs  
.32) to 813 yen (dlrs 6.72), NEC advanced 45 yen (dlrs .37) to 
1,270 yen (dlrs 10.50), and Hitachi climbed 41 yen (dlrs .34) to 
808 yen (dlrs 6.68). 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the stock market remains strongly supported by  
continued foreign buying, as well as the recent fall in long-term 
interest rates and the yen. Long-term interest rates have been 
helped by the Bank of Japan's decision to ease monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the improved sentiment, traders said the market will  
probably have a difficult time climbing sharply above the 15,000 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market won't be able to move up that easily as there still  
seems to be a lot of corporations wanting to sell 
cross-shareholdings,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general manager at Nikko 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancers beat retreaters 646 to 522, while 142 were unchanged.  
Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was 
estimated at 594.84 million shares, down from 649.37 million shares 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 14.76 points, or 1.29 percent, to 1,162.51 
points. The TOPIX closed up 1.03 points, or 0.09 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar dropped after an early  
short-covering rally sputtered out amid heavy selling by Japanese 
exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar briefly broke above 122 yen early in the session, but  
dollar-long Japanese exporters and institutional investors saw that 
as the signal to resume their recent position liquidations and as a 
chance to take profits. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 132.28 yen, up from  
132.09 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond rose to 1.700 percent from Monday's finish of 1.625 
percent, driving its price down to 100.80 yen from 101.41 yen.

<HEADLINE>  Sweater Girls Winning at Dior </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- It was sophisticated sweater time Tuesday at John  
Galliano's winter ready-to-wear show for Christian Dior, with an 
updated version of the 1950s ``sweater girl'' -- this time clad in 
mohair. 
</P>
<P>
	The show featured mohair sweaters with textured weaves as  
elaborate cover-ups for trousers or a slinky skirt. The sweaters -- 
worn back to front -- were often in ecru white, worn over 
caramel-colored skirts long and short. 
</P>
<P>
	Skirts cut below the knee, buttoned up the back and worn with  
high-heeled shoes added a nice touch. 
</P>
<P>
	The back-front reverse is an idea Galliano -- and apparently his  
clients -- liked from the last haute couture collection. 
</P>
<P>
	North American Indian ideas seen in the couture collection  
surfaced again, but looking far more wearable this time, whether in 
gray and white fringed sweaters or in a long coat. 
</P>
<P>
	Fabrics were important, and the finest suede with tiny eyelet  
effects was used with charm. One terrific slim line suit in glen 
plaid had a well-cut reversible jacket to show suede eyelet 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Knits came in enormous yarns with cable and ball effects or with  
rows of feathery touches woven in. 
</P>
<P>
	Apron tops and dressy overalls worn with lacy openwork-knit  
sweaters were also on display. 
</P>
<P>
	And Galliano didn't just do black for evening.  
</P>
<P>
	There were combinations in emerald and turquoise, going to deep  
sea blue in a lacy knit sheath with a big standup collar. 
</P>
<P>
	And to get the big sweater idea across, Galliano even paired  
shiny knit toppers with pastel organza and chiffon gowns for 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretty flower prints, burgundy reds, rust and yellow-gold were  
featured in some late-day wear. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Dior show was feminine and at times sexy, the Hermes  
show by Martin Margiela appeared best suited for the horsy set. 
</P>
<P>
	Margiela, who once wrapped models in cellophane, apparently  
loves working with luxurious fabrics, but he doesn't communicate 
much joy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hermes clothes in grays, off-white, dark browns and khaki,  
and all in expensive cashmeres, alpaca and wool, did little to 
raise fashion adrenaline. 
</P>
<P>
	The ample gray sweaters, the cowl-neckline tunics, straight  
pants in soft ``comfort'' flannel, or some long taupe leather coats 
are undoubtedly rich, rustic and relaxing. But they make less of a 
fashion statement than the famed Hermes bags and silk scarves. 
</P>
<P>
	The show by Brazilian Ocimar Versolato had the models turned out  
on a revolving platform, an idea he used at a recent couture 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
	Versolato loves fabric textures, mixing mohair with feathers or  
figured silk panels, as in a mohair bustier top and figured silk 
skirts. However, some of the cuts looked awkward, especially in 
silk. 
</P>
<P>
	Short or long tunic dresses were attractive, with an ``X'' motif  
on the straight skirt and a straight jacket with high collar and 
fly-front opening. 
</P>
<P>
	And there were shades of couture in the delicate, watery-shaded  
chiffon or organza skirts. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, Christophe Lemaire showed a bouncy, sporty look with  
few pretensions. 
</P>
<P>
	He paired crisp gray shirts with jersey skirts, hipster pants  
and maybe a low hip cummerbund in pale blue. And he showed yellow 
poplin windbreakers or raincoats with gray or beige pants. 
</P>
<P>
	A handsome A-line fisherman's tunic with its big chimney collar  
looked smart over gray pants and chunky high-heeled boots.

<TEXT>
<P>
	All but one of the players on the Associated Press preseason  
All-America team were on the postseason version as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The only one who wasn't was Jason Terry, and on Monday he became  
Arizona's fourth All-America in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day during the offseason I would walk by the basketball  
office and see the photos on the wall of all the guys who have been 
All-Americans here and tried to picture myself up there,'' he said. 
``Now, to think that I will have a photo up there, makes me realize 
what an accomplishment this is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terry joined Sean Elliott (1988 and 1989), Damon Stoudamire  
(1995), Mike Bibby (1998) and Miles Simon (1998) on the wall 
outside coach Lute Olson's office. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined Elton Brand of Duke, Andre Miller of Utah, Richard  
Hamilton of Connecticut and Mateen Cleaves of Michigan State on the 
1998-99 AP All-America team. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, a 6-foot-8 sophomore center who missed almost half of  
last season with a broken foot, was the only unanimous selection. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, who averaged 17.8 points and 9.8 rebounds for the  
top-ranked Blue Devils, was named on all 72 first-team ballots by 
the national media panel to become the fourth unanimous selection 
of the '90s. The others were Christian Laettner of Duke in 1992, 
Glenn Robinson of Purdue in 1994 and Tim Duncan of Wake Forest in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unbelievable. I'm just elated right now. Just to have  
been considered for a position of first-team All-America is a 
special, special honor,'' said Brand, who shot 62 percent from the 
field. ``I knew I worked hard, and the hard work paid off. Growing 
up, it's one of the things you definitely dream of. I'm definitely 
a team person and the individual accolades come when the team 
wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand was an honorable mention All-America last season despite  
missing 15 games with the injury, but he showed he was healed this 
summer when he led the U.S. team in the Goodwill Games in scoring 
and rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, a senior guard was the second-leading vote-getter in the  
5-3-1 process, getting 330 points with 60 first-team votes. The 
Western Athletic Conference player of the year averaged 15.9 
points, 5.5 rebounds, 5.7 assists and 2.5 steals, and the 6-2 guard 
was given more credit for his team leadership than statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real honor. I can't take the credit myself because we  
have a great team and they deserve the award also,'' said Miller, 
an honorable mention last season when the Utes reached the Final 
Four. ``It makes being a leader easy when you have a team like we 
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, who won or shared Big East player of the year honors  
the last two seasons, averaged 21.0 points and 4.8 rebounds this 
season for the Huskies who were ranked No. 1 for 10 weeks. The 6-6 
junior swingman, the leading vote-getter on the second team last 
season, had 48 first-team votes and 300 points this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's worked hard at expanding his total game, and has become  
one of the top collegiate players in the nation,'' Connecticut 
coach Jim Calhoun said. ``Last year, he just missed being a 
first-team selection and this year has rightfully earned his spot 
among the top five players in college basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terry, the Pac-10 player of the year, led the league in scoring  
(22.1), assists (5.6) and steals (2.7) -- the first player to do 
that since Gary Payton of Oregon State in 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no one more deserving for this honor because of what  
he has had to go through, in that he has had to provide leadership 
to the three freshmen in our starting lineup,'' Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry, a 6-2 senior, got 48 first-team votes and 293 points, 83  
more than Cleaves, who was on 19 first-team ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves, a 6-2 junior, was a second-team choice last season and  
was named Big Ten player of the year by the league's coaches for 
the second straight year. He averaged 11.8 points and 7.2 assists 
as the Spartans won their second straight Big Ten regular-season 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to give a lot of credit to my teammates,'' he said.  
``If we wouldn't have won a championship, I wouldn't have earned 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second team was senior center Evan Eschmeyer of  
Northwestern, who had one point less than Cleaves, Chris Porter of 
Auburn, Wally Szczerbiak of Miami of Ohio, Steve Francis of 
Maryland and Trajan Langdon of Duke, a third-team choice last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The third team was Tim James of Miami, Baron Davis of UCLA,  
Scoonie Penn of Ohio State, Quincy Lewis of Minnesota and Ron 
Artest of St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Nailon of Texas Christian, an honorable mention selection  
this season, was the fifth member of the preseason team.

Western Athletic Conference player of the year averaged 15.9 
points, 5.5 rebounds, 5.7 assists and 2.5 steals, and the 6-2 guard 
was given more credit for his team leadership than statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real honor. I can't take the credit myself because we  
have a great team and they deserve the award also,'' said Miller, 
an honorable mention last season when the Utes reached the Final 
Four. ``It makes being a leader easy when you have a team like we 
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, who won or shared Big East player of the year honors  
the last two seasons, averaged 21.0 points and 4.8 rebounds this 
season for the Huskies who were ranked No. 1 for 10 weeks. The 6-6 
junior swingman, the leading vote-getter on the second team last 
season, had 48 first-team votes and 300 points this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's worked hard at expanding his total game, and has become  
one of the top collegiate players in the nation,'' Connecticut 
coach Jim Calhoun said. ``Last year, he just missed being a 
first-team selection and this year has rightfully earned his spot 
among the top five players in college basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terry, the Pac-10 player of the year, led the league in scoring  
(22.1), assists (5.6) and steals (2.7) -- the first player to do 
that since Gary Payton of Oregon State in 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no one more deserving for this honor because of what  
he has had to go through, in that he has had to provide leadership 
to the three freshmen in our starting lineup,'' Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry, a 6-2 senior, got 48 first-team votes and 293 points, 83  
more than Cleaves, who was on 19 first-team ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves, a 6-2 junior, was a second-team choice last season and  
was named Big Ten player of the year by the league's coaches for 
the second straight year. He averaged 11.8 points and 7.2 assists 
as the Spartans won their second straight Big Ten regular-season 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to give a lot of credit to my teammates,'' he said.  
``If we wouldn't have won a championship, I wouldn't have earned 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second team was senior center Evan Eschmeyer of  
Northwestern, who had one point less than Cleaves, Chris Porter of 
Auburn, Wally Szczerbiak of Miami of Ohio, Steve Francis of 
Maryland and Trajan Langdon of Duke, a third-team choice last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The third team was Tim James of Miami, Baron Davis of UCLA,  
Scoonie Penn of Ohio State, Quincy Lewis of Minnesota and Ron 
Artest of St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Nailon of Texas Christian, an honorable mention selection  
this season, was the fifth member of the preseason team.

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio's Death Lamented Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Even in places where nobody plays his game, news of  
the death of baseball legend Joe DiMaggio echoed around the world 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Attesting to DiMaggio's stature as an international icon,  
tributes to him were heard everywhere from soccer-happy Italy to 
Australia, where cricket is king and baseball almost unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	In Italy, which considered Joltin' Joe one of its own, the news  
topped TV sportscasts. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's fisherman father was from Isola Delle Femmine, an  
island just off Palermo on Sicily's northern coast. Baldassare Di 
Maggio, who lives on the isle, recalled a brief encounter with his 
famous distant cousin. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was really a good man, he seemed like someone from the  
island,'' said Di Maggio, who is a butcher. ``We like to think of 
him as one of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joltin' Joe was at least partly responsible for what interest  
there is in Italy for baseball, home to one of Europe's top 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	The slugger's death was even front page news in Hong Kong, where  
baseball is, at best, a minor sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's editions of the South China Morning Post carried  
DiMaggio's obituary on its front page, while the Hong Kong Standard 
ran its story under the Simon and Garfunkel-inspired headline 
``Nation turns its lonely eyes to DiMaggio, 84 -- Baseball mourns 
Joltin' Joe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Australia, the news of DiMaggio's death was overshadowed by  
that country's triumph in their own bat-and-ball game, cricket. 
Australia drubbed the West Indies in Port-of-Spain overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, news of DiMaggio made headlines in newspapers and radio  
bulletins. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't just baseball that spread DiMaggio's name, noted Roger  
Vaughan, a writer for Australia's AAP news agency. He was carried 
around the world with American pop culture in songs like Paul Simon 
and Art Garfunkel's ``Mrs. Robinson'' and Madonna's ``Vogue,'' and 
in Ernest Hemingway's book ``The Old Man and the Sea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Britain, where baseball isn't played, articles focused on  
DiMaggio's role as an American idol and his marriage to Marilyn 
Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
	Only The Daily Telegraph mentioned his death, briefly, on its  
front page, although all Britain's national broadsheet newspapers 
ran full obituaries as well as news stories. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the U.S., he ranks with Babe Ruth and Muhammad Ali as part  
of an elite whose achievements and persona transcended sport and 
became part of American folklore,'' The Daily Telegraph explained 
in a detailed report on an inside page. 
</P>
<P>
	The Guardian headlined its report, ``Joltin' Joe has left and  
gone away'' -- another quote from ``Mrs. Robinson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, in baseball-crazy Japan, there was no need to explain  
who DiMaggio was. 
</P>
<P>
	His death was carried prominently in all of Japan's major  
newspapers and on morning TV news broadcasts. Most also featured 
photos of him with Marilyn Monroe. The two came to Japan for their 
honeymoon in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's biggest newspaper, the Yomiuri, which also owns a  
professional baseball team, devoted nearly a quarter of its 
domestic news page to the DiMaggio story. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a major among the majors, always thinking foremost of  
the fans,'' the Yomiuri quoted Shigeo Nagashima, coach of the Tokyo 
Yomiuri Giants baseball team, as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could not see him actually play, but I learned a lot about  
baseball through his pictures,'' Nagashima, a former star slugger 
himself, said. ``I hope Japan will one day produce a player like 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1950, DiMaggio made his first visit to Japan to give  
technical guidance to Japanese players. The next year, he came back 
for Japanese-U.S. baseball games, and homered at Tokyo's Jingu 
Stadium.

<HEADLINE> Japan Tobacco Buys RJR Nabisco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan is no longer the smokers' paradise it once  
was. Smokers are declining, no-cigarette zones in restaurants are 
increasing, and anti-tobacco groups are getting bolder with 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	So the country's top cigarette company is doing the logical  
thing: it's going global. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan Tobacco Inc.'s mammoth purchase of the international  
tobacco business of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. was seen as a 
multibillion-dollar gamble to boost its overseas business. 
</P>
<P>
	``JT is trying to reach the same level as the multinational  
tobacco companies,'' said anti-tobacco activist Akinori Ito. 
``Sales in Japan are not going up and the economy is bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	JT announced late Tuesday that it has agreed to pay $7.8 billion  
-- the largest acquisition price ever paid by a Japanese company -- 
to become the world's third-largest tobacco producer, behind 
U.S.-based Philip Morris Co. and British American Tobacco PLC of 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous record was Matsushita Electric Co.'s $6.45 billion  
purchase of MCA. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deal will enable us to acquire many international business  
bases in a single stroke and face the competition as a world-class 
player,'' JT president Masaru Mizuno said late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move will not be the first appearance of the company  
overseas, but international sales have been limited for the most 
part to Asia. The new deal will allow JT to tap into growing 
markets in Africa and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes as the Japanese are gradually losing their taste  
for tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	A JT survey late last year said the percentage of Japanese  
adults who smoke had fallen for a third straight year to a record 
low 33.6 percent as awareness that smoking and secondhand smoke can 
be harmful is spreading. 
</P>
<P>
	The small anti-tobacco movement is also gaining strength. At  
least one lawsuit is pending against JT, and activists last year 
did something they never did before: filed a suit against a U.S. 
tobacco company, Philip Morris Cos. The suit is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
	But Japan is far from finished as a cigarette market. More than  
half of Japanese men still smoke, smokers can light up in more 
places than is allowed in the United States, and cigarette 
advertising is more widespread. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nabisco deal is the latest -- and most costly -- of a string  
of moved in recent years by JT to widen its nets. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, Japan's state-run tobacco monopoly until 1985, has  
diversified into an array of fields, including pharmaceuticals, 
food and real estate. It still controls nearly 80 percent of the 
home cigarette market. 
</P>
<P>
	Mizuno said his company continues to seek growth in other areas,  
but ``our core business is tobacco,'' predicting that enlarged 
Japan Tobacco will sell 460 billion cigarettes a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company earned $900 million in the year ended March 31,  
1998, on sales of $21.6 billion. It employs 20,800 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese activists saw the purchase as a cynical move by JT to  
take advantage of developing countries, where people are less 
educated about the dangers of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Japanese company is selling tobacco for its own benefit and  
it's the foreigners who will get sick,'' said Ito, a plaintiff in 
the pending suits against JT and Philip Morris. ``I feel sorry as a 
Japanese.''

<HEADLINE> 3,000 Face Quick Deportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Although President Clinton promised ``a fair  
solution'' to Central American immigration problems exacerbated by 
Hurricane Mitch, the United States is refusing to extend an amnesty 
program for some illegal immigrants from the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 3,000 illegal immigrants from El Salvador and Guatemala  
face quick deportation after the temporary amnesty program expired 
Monday, as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite protests from the governments of El Salvador and  
Guatemala, the White House said those countries are now able to 
absorb illegal immigrants who had been living in the United States 
since the storm last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was in the region Monday and visited a Nicaraguan  
village nearly leveled by a mudslide. ``I will seek a fair solution 
to all the immigration issues this tragedy has heightened,'' 
Clinton said, but he did not address the Salvadoran and Guatemalan 
complaints further. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, en route to El Salvador, Clinton told reporters on Air  
Force One that the resumption of deportations ``shouldn't affect 
too many people in the early going'' and he questioned whether he 
had any legal authority to extend the halt. 
</P>
<P>
	Traveling with him, INS Commissioner Doris Meissner said fewer  
than the 5,000 Salvadorans and Guatemalans deported last year would 
be returned this year, calling it ``not a big-deal problem.'' Last 
year, 15,000 illegal immigrants were returned to Guatemala, 
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras combined, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing, jobs and other essentials have been in short supply in  
Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador since the storm in 
late October and early November. Central American governments have 
said they can ill afford to take in returning immigrants while also 
working to improve conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-month amnesty program was intended to help ease  
financial and other problems for hard-hit Central America. It 
allowed illegal immigrants to remain and work in the United States 
while their home governments dealt with the initial devastation. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitch killed more than 9,000 people, left 2 million homeless,  
and left damage estimated at up to $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governments of El Salvador and Guatemala strongly opposed  
(new deportations) and expressed their concerns to the 
administration,'' said Dan Kane, a spokesman for the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, the administration evaluated the situation on the  
ground in both countries and has concluded that both nations are 
capable of beginning to receive their nationals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only 10 percent of those displaced by the hurricane live in  
Guatemala or El Salvador, and repairs are moving more swiftly there 
than in neighboring Nicaragua and Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
	Illegal immigrants from Nicaragua and Honduras are eligible for  
a different amnesty program that extends into next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS plans no mass deportations, Kane said. The approximately  
1,600 Salvadorans and 1,300 Guatemalans picked up as illegal aliens 
since the end of December will go before immigration judges soon in 
preparation for deportation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the amnesty program began, the INS suspended its usual  
routine of ``detaining'' illegal immigrants from both countries in 
INS facilities or local jails pending deportation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Salvadorans and Guatemalans without criminal records  
were released with a requirement that they check in with 
immigration officials during the amnesty period. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, INS officials will find, detain and move to deport them,  
Kane said.

<HEADLINE> Relatives of Haitians Await Word </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DELRAY BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- When Fremiaud Basse spoke to his  
girlfriend in Haiti a few months ago, he told her he had applied 
for U.S. citizenship and said he hoped to be reunited with her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told her, 'Wait for me,'' Basse, 44, said of Guerline  
Joseph. ``But she tried coming by herself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Lake Worth resident plans to go to the medical  
examiner's office to identify Joseph's body. The 21-year old is 
believed to be among 40 Haitians who apparently drowned. 
</P>
<P>
	Just three survivors were retrieved from the choppy waters of  
the Atlantic Ocean after two boats loaded with the refugees sank 
early Saturday. Two bodies were found. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard had ended its search Sunday and said as many as  
38 Haitians were presumed drowned. But the agency resumed the 
search Monday after community leaders accused the agency of racism. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it because they are (of) African descent?'' asked Joe  
Celestin, a former state Senate candidate who questioned why the 
search was called off less than 24 hours after the Coast Guard was 
notified. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard officials denied the accusations.  
</P>
<P>
	``The search was suspended based on survivability and the  
probability of finding somebody still alive out there,'' Lt. 
Commander Marc Woodring said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Searchers now plan to look twice more via helicopter, one using  
night-vision equipment. The search will be called off again if no 
leads are found, the Coast Guard said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Haitians were traveling a popular route for smugglers of  
humans and drugs: a 67-mile journey from the western part of the 
Bahamas to Palm Beach County, said Art Bullock of the Border 
Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither boat had life jackets, and the alleged smugglers, three  
Bahamians, were also believed drowned. 
</P>
<P>
	Basse went to the Haitian-American council Monday hoping for  
word of his girlfriend when he learned one of the two bodies found 
at sea might be that Joseph. He hoped to go to the medical 
examiner's office with Joseph's sister today to identify her body. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, though, he held onto all he had left of her:  
passport-sized photograph, with a loving message written on the 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Receive this little picture as proof of our love. Every time  
you think of me, look at this little picture,'' she wrote to him. 
</P>
<P>
	There were several smuggling attempts with higher casualties.  
</P>
<P>
	For example, in December 1982, a federal jury convicted two  
Haitians of smuggling charges related to what came to be known as 
the Voodoo voyage. As many as 90 Haitians were believed to have 
died in that trip.

<HEADLINE> Buffett's Berkshire Earns Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Berkshire Hathaway reported its 1998 earnings  
rose 43 percent from the previous year on a strong performance from 
its Geico car insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
	Berkshire, the firm founded by billionaire investor Warren  
Buffett, released only its annual earnings Tuesday. Fourth-quarter 
results were expected to be announced Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1998, Berkshire reported $2.8 billion in earnings, or $2,262  
per Class A share, up from 1997's $1.9 billion, or $1,542 per 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Geico, Berkshire's largest operation before its $22 billion  
acquisition of reinsurance company General Re Corp. of Stamford, 
Conn., was an important contributor to operating earnings with an 
underwriting profit margin of 6.7 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	In its third quarter report, Berkshire also credited Geico for  
good returns in helping Berkshire weather stock market swings. 
</P>
<P>
	Berkshire holds investments in companies including Coca-Cola  
Co., Gillette Co. and American Express Corp. It also owns 
furniture, shoe and candy companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In its yearend report, Berkshire put earnings from operations in  
1998 at $1.2 billion, and investment gains at $1.5 billion. In 
1997, operating earnings were $1.1 billion, and investment gains 
were $704 million.

<HEADLINE> Citigroup Sets Growth Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Citigroup Inc., the nation's largest financial  
services company, set a goal of doubling profits in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The aggressive growth targets, outlined Monday in a letter to  
shareholders, are an effort to show Wall Street that last October's 
merger between banking titan Citibank and brokerage and insurance 
giant Travelers Group will deliver on its promises. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Citigroup released the letter to the media just  
hours before it disclosed that it paid a total of $16.7 million in 
salaries and bonuses last year to John S. Reed and Sanford I. 
Weill, who share the titles of chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed and Weill said Citigroup will double its profits every five  
years, and achieve a 20 percent return on equity. Citigroup will 
generate double-digit growth in profits by increasing revenues and 
cutting expenses, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no details of new cuts, but the company already is  
eliminating more than 10,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The top executive to leave was president Jamie Dimon. Dimon, who  
was paid $4.95 million in salary and bonus last year, also received 
a separation package worth at least $30 million in exchange for a 
three-year ban on hiring away former colleagues, The Wall Street 
Journal reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts are expecting Citigroup to earn $3.53 a share this  
year, up from $2.66 last year, according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Travelers-Citibank merger created a one-stop financial  
behemoth offering everything from checking accounts, to insurance, 
to stock brokerage and investment banking expertise.

<HEADLINE> Jurgensen Named USA Today Editor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Karen Jurgensen, a 17-year veteran of USA  
Today and editor of the editorial page, was named the newspaper's 
editor Tuesday, succeeding David Mazzarella, who is retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Karen Jurgensen has played many important roles in helping  
develop USA Today's content since its founding in 1982 and offers 
the editing breadth and leadership skills necessary for the next 
era of the newspaper's growth,'' said president and publisher Tom 
Curley. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurgensen, 50, joined the newspaper at its founding in 1982. She  
has held several editorial positions, including senior editor for 
special projects, managing editor for cover stories and editor of 
the Life section. She began her journalism career at the Charlotte 
(N.C.) News and worked later for the Miami News. 
</P>
<P>
	She announced that she will be replaced as editorial page editor  
by Brian Gallagher, 50, who has been the page's deputy editor since 
1991. Gallagher, who is the son of the late Wes Gallagher, former 
president and general manager of The Associated Press, began his 
career with Gannett's Westchester Rockland newspaper group in 1971. 
He is a former managing editor of the Gannett News Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazzarella, 60, headed USA Today's international operations  
before becoming editor in 1994. He will continue at the newspaper 
until the end of the year as senior vice president for strategic 
projects.

	Ice, Snow Hit Midwest, East  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Schools closed and traffic slowed to a crawl  
from the Great Lakes all the way south into Georgia today because 
of a storm that dumped more than a foot of snow in places along 
with layers of ice. At least four traffic deaths were blamed on the 
weather, two in Iowa and one each in Minnesota and Indiana. The 
storm also caused flight delays and cancellations in Minneapolis, 
Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit, Pittsburgh and some Ohio cities.

	SOTO CANO AIR BASE, Honduras (AP) -- President Clinton praised  
U.S. troops today for leading military relief efforts in 
hurricane-slammed Central America and trying to repair a legacy of 
mistrust bred by decades of U.S. involvement in coups and civil 
wars. Clinton announced the award of humanitarian service medals to 
all U.S. forces who took part in the relief effort in the aftermath 
of Hurricane Mitch. U.S. troops were credited with saving more than 
1,000 people and providing medical treatment to more than 35,000 
people.

	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Lamar Alexander declared his  
presidential candidacy by urging Republicans to look beyond 
familiar names. ``This time the race is wide open,'' said the 
former Tennessee governor, pressing Republicans not to commit too 
early to George W. Bush or Elizabeth Dole. He promised to make

	Congress Targets Gun Lawsuits  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The legal battle that cities have launched  
against the gun industry got a new player today: Congress. Rep. Bob 
Barr, R-Ga., led a bipartisan group of two dozen lawmakers on a 
bill to block cities and states from filing lawsuits aimed at 
holding firearm makers and distributors accountable for gun 
violence. But Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said she intends to 
introduce legislation that would guarantee cities the right to sue 
gun manufacturers and distributors in their efforts to combat 
violence.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Addressing a Senate panel, the companies that  
flood U.S. homes with sweepstakes promotions insisted today that 
most Americans know they can win without buying anything. Industry 
executives told of their efforts to clearly state the rules and 
odds. But panel members highlighted mailings that said, ``It's down 
to a 2 person race for $11 million'' and ``Yes, Reward Entitlement 
Granted and Guaranteed.'' By the hearing's conclusion, senators 
said they were more convinced than ever that legislation was needed 
to regulate the mailings.

	ROME (AP) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami declared a new  
era of cooperation today, urging ``mutual respect'' among nations 
as he made the first visit by an Iranian leader to a Western nation 
since his country's 1979 Islamic revolution. Khatami presents 
himself as a believer in more social and political freedom at home 
and an advocate of dialogue with the West. At a state dinner hosted 
by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Khatami said Iran has no 
``intentions of hostility with any country.''

today it will sell its international tobacco business to Japan's 
largest tobacco company and will break off its domestic tobacco

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Contradicting current medical theories, a 14-year  
study of nearly 89,000 women found no evidence that a high-fat diet 
promotes breast cancer. Researchers compared the diets of the women 
without breast cancer and the 2,956 women whose breast cancer was

that a low-fat diet is still good for other aspects of health.

<HEADLINE> Death Penalty Sought for Charles Ng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Relatives of Charles Ng's victims  
recounted the horror of his crimes as prosecutors urged a jury to 
punish the convicted mass killer with the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng, 38, was convicted Feb. 24 of killing six men, three women  
and two baby boys -- 11 people in all. The jury reached an impasse 
on one murder count, and Calaveras County District Attorney Peter 
Smith said Monday the state intended to refile that charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the nine-woman, three-man jury must choose between  
capital punishment or life in prison without chance of parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert McCourt of Philadelphia choked on sobs as he took the  
witness stand Monday and told how he and his family missed his 
brother. Clifford Peranteau, 25, worked with Ng at a San Francisco 
moving company. He was last seen alive Jan. 19, 1985, and his body 
was never found. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest with you, I've put it out of my mind all these  
years because it's hard to even talk about it,'' he said. ``It's 
not like he got hit by a car or something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their mother, who has long suffered from emotional problems,  
refuses to admit that her son is dead, McCourt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't bury him. There's no body,'' McCourt told the jury.  
``I'm sure she understands, but she just won't accept it. She won't 
even let us have a service for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only two bodies were ever identified. Investigators found  
hundreds of human bone fragments, many of them burned, buried 
around Lake's cabin at Wilseyville, about 150 miles east of San 
Francisco in the Sierra Nevada foothills. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued that Ng helped Lake, a fugitive from a  
weapons charge, kill men to get their valuables and identification; 
the pair allegedly used kidnapped women as sex slaves and killed 
the babies because they were in the way. 
</P>
<P>
	During trial, jurors watched home videotapes of Ng and Lake  
taunting two bound women at Lake's house. The women were never seen 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother of one, Brenda O'Connor, said Monday she had read a  
transcript of the dialogue, including threats of rape and death, 
but that she couldn't watch her daughter being brutalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith opened the penalty hearing by telling jurors that he  
intended to ``state the obvious'' by asking that Ng be ordered to 
execution. Ng's attorney William Kelley reserved his opening 
statement until he presents his case for a life sentence.

<HEADLINE>  Eric Davis Takes a Swing at Orioles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Given a choice, Eric Davis would have  
preferred to play another season or two in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	He's with the St. Louis Cardinals now, and while he relished his  
time with the Orioles, the two-time All Star is more than a bit 
miffed that Baltimore simply let him walk away. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who batted cleanup for the Cardinals against Baltimore on  
Tuesday, said before the game the Orioles told him during the 
offseason that signing him to a new contract was not a primary 
concern -- even though he finished fourth in the AL with a 
career-high .327 batting average and set a team record by hitting 
in 30 straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the money it was going to take, I didn't see a full-time  
role for him here,'' general manager Frank Wren said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Orioles signed Albert Belle as their full-time right  
fielder and re-signed B.J. Surhoff to play left. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I know is that it was told to me that I wasn't  
a priority, so I took that to heart,'' Davis said. ``That meant I 
had to go out and solidify my situation. Was I supposed to sit 
around and wait? That wasn't going to happen. I've been around the 
game too long for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, 36, also blamed the Orioles for a sore elbow that limited  
his time in the outfield last year and said the team struggled in 
part because it took manager Ray Miller almost half the season to 
devise a set lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles were 40-50 before Davis went on a 30-game hitting  
streak from July 11 to Aug. 15. By the time he was done, Baltimore 
was 65-57 and in position to gain a wild-card berth. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I started playing every day, we started winning every  
day. Not just from what I did, but because we had a set lineup 
after the All-Star break,'' Davis said. ``When you're shuffling the 
lineup, it's hard. You play one day, sit two days, hit leadoff, hit 
eighth, you have too many things on your mind. It took us 81 games 
to figure out what our lineup should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the streak Davis was used on a periodic basis by Miller,  
who wanted to go easy on a player less than one year removed from 
colon cancer surgery. Davis was also bothered by bone chips in his 
elbow that hindered his throws from the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could have played right field last year, but they were  
trying to protect me. That's why I DH'ed,'' he said. ``Because I 
went along with the program, they used that against me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns over Davis' endurance -- he has battled injuries his  
entire career -- combined with the signing in August of designated 
hitter Harold Baines pretty much spelled the end of Davis' 
marvelous two-year run in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we got Baines it was kind of hard to find a place for  
Eric, especially with his arm. The arm was a problem,'' Miller said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, told of Miller's comments, revealed that the injury  
occurred during a drill in which the players threw from behind the 
mound before stepping onto the hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was something I shouldn't have been doing,'' he said. ``If  
they're concerned about my elbow, why didn't anyone call me? Ray 
didn't call me, Frank didn't call me. They weren't concerned about 
it when we were five games out. When I was hitting in all those 
games and doing what I was doing, they weren't concerned about my 
elbow then. So during the offseason you're concerned about my 
elbow?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who hit 28 home runs with 89 RBIs, ended up signing an $8  
million, two-year contract with the Cardinals. But he loved his 
time in Baltimore and said he enjoyed the game and the fans there 
more than anywhere he had played. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was probably the most fun I had. I had a great time in  
Baltimore; they were probably the best teammates I ever played 
with,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those players, including Cal Ripken and Brady Anderson,  
talked at length with Davis at the batting cage Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told me it's not the same around here and that I should  
still be there,'' he said. ``But that's not the case.''

<HEADLINE> Catholic Group Urges Turner Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Major league baseball officials said Tuesday  
they were looking into a Catholic organization's demands that 
Atlanta Braves owner Ted Turner be barred from the sport for a year 
because he told a Polish joke and made other comments about 
Catholics last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Droleskey, head of a group called Christ or Chaos, which  
he said has 500 members, said he wrote to baseball Commissioner Bud 
Selig asking for ``immediate action'' to suspend Turner from any 
contact with the Braves and the sport for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball spokesman Richard Levin said the complaint was taken  
``very seriously.'' He said he had not seen the letter, but ``we 
are aware of the situation. The commissioner has talked to Ted 
Turner and is looking into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Atlanta, Turner spokesman Phil Evans wouldn't comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Turner was guest speaker at the Feb. 16 dinner of the National  
Family Planning and Reproductive Association, which supports 
abortion rights, contraception and other practices opposed by the 
Catholic church. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked what he would say on meeting Pope John Paul II,  
Turner extended an upraised foot toward the audience and said, 
``Ever seen a Polish mine detector?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He later said the pope should ``get with it -- welcome to the  
20th century,'' and suggested the Ten Commandments' ban on adultery 
should be abolished. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner later offered a ``heartfelt apology'' to William Donohue,  
president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Donohue accepted the apology.  
</P>
<P>
	In June 1996, Marge Schott agreed to give up day-to-day  
operations of the Cincinnati Reds for remarks about minorities that 
baseball officials considered offensive. The ban is scheduled to 
continue through this month while she seeks a buyer for her 
controlling interest.

<HEADLINE> Italy Pushes U.S. on Gondola Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema said he expects the  
United States to continue investigating last year's cable car 
accident to make sure those responsible are found and punished. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alema, who spoke at his weekly news conference Monday, was  
reiterating demands made to President Clinton at the White House on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened is unacceptable,'' said D'Alema, referring to  
Thursday's acquittal of Capt. Richard Ashby on 20 counts of 
involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty people plunged to their death when the Marine jet piloted  
by Ashby severed a gondola cable in the Italian Alps on Feb. 3, 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian television broadcast an interview Tuesday with Ashby,  
who blamed systemwide errors for the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of mistakes that caused this accident,''  
Asbhy told Italy's TV-2. ``It's something we have to deal with the 
rest of our lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Italian Defense Minister Massimo Brutti called Ashby's remarks  
``out of place and arrogant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alema said Clinton had admitted the United States was  
responsible for the tragedy and had pledged to search for the 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian premier rejected reports that he had agreed to tone  
down his demands in the cable car case if the United States handed 
over Silvia Baraldini, an Italian citizen serving a 43-year term on 
terrorism charges. He said suggestions of a swap ``disgusted'' him. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alema said he would wait for the judiciary process in the  
United States to end before evaluating the outcome. He said it was 
premature to consider rewriting a NATO treaty that allows nations 
to try their own military officers, as was the case with Ashby who 
was tried at a court-martial in Camp Lejeune, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, if the result shows that justice cannot be done  
under this treaty, then the 18 nations that have signed the treaty 
might have to re-evaluate it,'' said D'Alema. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors alleged that Ashby, 31, was flying too fast and too  
low when he sliced the cable, which was less than 400 feet from the 
ground. The defense blamed faulty equipment and a map that did not 
show the ski lift.

<HEADLINE> Dow Drops 9; Nasdaq Falls 1 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened lower. The Dow Jones  
industrial average is down nine points in today's early going. 
Losers on the New York Stock Exchange hold a 3-2 lead over gainers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is down one point and the S&AMP;P 500  
Index is down a half point. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street may find the footing a little less than sure at  
these high levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow slipped yesterday, from the record high it set on  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	And the S&AMP;P 500 likely will have some trouble gaining much  
ground today, after it edged up to a new high yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts point to a slight uptick in bond market interest rates  
this morning, as one item that might unnerve the bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	And if that doesn't do it, there's always another public  
appearance by Alan Greenspan that might. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed chairman is to deliver a luncheon speech outside  
Washington D.C. today.

<HEADLINE> Dustin Hoffman Lawyers Get $270,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal judge ordered Los Angeles Magazine  
to pay $270,000 of Dustin Hoffman's legal fees for publishing a 
picture of the actor's head on the body of a cross-dressing man. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman's attorneys had sought $415,000.  
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman, 61, sued over the March 1997 fashion layout in which  
his face, as it appeared in ``Tootsie,'' was computer-grafted onto 
the body of a male model wearing a yellow evening gown and heels. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge in January ordered the magazine to pay Hoffman  
$3 million in damages. The publication's parent, ABC Inc., plans to 
appeal that judgment.
