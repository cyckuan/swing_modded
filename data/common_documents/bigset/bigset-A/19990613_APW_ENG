<HEADLINE> N.D. Leafy Spurge Problem Growing / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- Leafy spurge continues to grow in North  
Dakota despite a state program to distribute weed-eating bugs to 
whomever wants them. 
</P>
<P>
	North Dakota acreage affected by leafy spurge acres increased  
from about 932,000 in 1991 to 1.1 million last year, said John 
Leppert, noxious weeds specialist with the state Agriculture 
Department. The weed, if left unchecked, crowds out prairie grass, 
rendering pastures useless. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, it's getting worse,'' Leppert said. ``Anybody driving  
around North Dakota would have to be blind not to see that spurge 
is all over the place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leppert said the problem would be much worse if not for the flea  
beetle program. The beetles feed on the spurge plant, and their 
larvae tunnel through the weed's roots. Since 1991, they've been 
given to landowners free of charge during annual summer 
distribution campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's campaign got under way last week in a Burleigh  
County field, where landowners came to sweep nets over leafy spurge 
plants and collect flea beetles to introduce in other pastures. 
</P>
<P>
	Russ Arman, who owns pasture land in Grant County, collected  
bugs for the seventh consecutive year. He said the beetles are 
helping to control the spurge on his land, but he's frustrated that 
many ranchers in the county don't take the weed problem very 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see where your efforts make a difference, but you might  
have a neighbor not doing anything,'' Arman said. ``And if you're 
downriver of them, you get a new spurge crop every spring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The weed spreads through seeds and an extensive root system.  
</P>
<P>
	Leppert said there are many landowners who recognize the  
seriousness of the problem and are taking steps to address it. 
</P>
<P>
	However, ``a lot of people aren't interested, or they think it's  
somebody else's problem,'' he said. ``We need to get more people 
involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Dunn, who raises alfalfa for his horses on six acres south  
of Bismarck, said he decided to get involved this year after 
watching the leafy spurge problem on his land worsen every year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hard to find four, five years ago, but every year I can  
tell that it's increased its range,'' he said. ``This beetle 
business, if it works, will be great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-two million flea beetles were distributed to landowners  
last summer. Officials hope to increase that number this year 
during distribution events in 15 counties, Johnson said.

<HEADLINE> Facts About Detroit Auto Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	U.S. AUTO CONTRACT TALKS   	
</P>
<P>
	Companies: General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., DaimlerChrysler  
AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Union: United Auto Workers, Detroit.  
</P>
<P>
	Current contract: Signed in 1996, expires Sept. 14.  
</P>
<P>
	Workers affected: About 407,000 total; 222,000 at GM, 110,000 at  
Ford, 75,000 at DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	Significance: Though their influence is less significant today,  
the Detroit contracts historically have set precedents for wages, 
workplace improvements and benefits that later became standards 
throughout U.S. industry. UAW members remain among the highest-paid 
blue-collar workers in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Process: Introductory ``handshake ceremonies'' this week  
followed by initial presentations by company and union leaders. 
Bargaining committees then break into subcommittees to address 
union demands through August. Union typically picks a ``lead 
company'' by Labor Day, based on which has the best proposal on the 
table. Talks then intensify to reach an economic agreement with 
that company, which the other companies are expected to accept. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW chief negotiators: Richard Shoemaker, GM; Ron Gettelfinger,  
Ford; Jack Laskowski, DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	Management chief negotiators: Gary Cowger, GM; Robert Marcin,  
Ford; Thomas Gallagher, DaimlerChrysler.

<HEADLINE> Russians Keep Hold on Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO peacekeepers streaming into  
Kosovo's capital ran into resistance Sunday from Russians seemingly 
intent on controlling a strategic airfield and Serbs trying to keep 
British troops away from houses burning in a suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO soldiers in several armored personnel carriers were trying  
to work their way around roadblocks set up by Serbs near the suburb 
of Sofali in eastern Pristina. Reporters following the NATO troops 
could see houses burning in the predominantly ethnic Albanian 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	After being turned away at two roadblocks, the British troops  
were trying to get in through a back road. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the authority to go in, but we don't want to fight our  
way in,'' said Lt. Damien Walker. ``We want to do it peacefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear why the structures were being set ablaze, but  
there have been frequent reports of Serb forces setting ethnic 
Albanian houses afire as they retreat ahead of advancing NATO 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Sunday, a dozen of British armored personnel carriers  
rolled into downtown Pristina along the same route where thousands 
of Serbs had cheered arriving Russian troops more than a day 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no organized greeting for the British, but some ethnic  
Albanians on the street breathed sighs of relief. ``Yes, I feel 
safer now,'' said Hysnie Berisha, 50, holding her hand over her 
heart. ``These (British) are only a few, but those that are here 
give us some dignity. More will come and we will be more safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serbs on the street were less accommodating. Some made obscene  
gestures and grumbled complaints, but there were no attempts to 
interfere. 
</P>
<P>
	Tension was higher at the strategic airport just outside  
Pristina, were Serbs and Russians were blocking any further NATO 
troops one day after some British forces were given access to the 
airfield. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN showed footage of what it said were British and French  
military vehicles being turned back by Russians at a roadblock just 
outside the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to reporters in Skopje, Macedonia, about Russia's early  
arrival in Kosovo, NATO Supreme Commander Gen. Wesley Clark said, 
``No plans have been disrupted whatsoever by this bizarre event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We had no intention of using the airport for any deployment  
purposes,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in Pristina, informed Serb sources said three Serb  
policeman had been shot and killed by ethnic Albanian rebels of the 
Kosovo Liberation Army in a northern suburb of Pristina. The report 
could not be independently verified. 
</P>
<P>
	On Kosovo's southern border, the first big contingent of U.S.  
Marines and Army troops was preparing to move into the province, 
several days sooner than initially anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	An Army column including tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles was  
stopped at the border waiting to cross in the afternoon. The group, 
with 100 to 150 soldiers, was expected to take over control of the 
area around Kacanik from British troops on the main road north 
toward Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving toward the border behind them was a column of about 1,000  
Marines bound for Gnjilane in southeastern Kosovo, the town 
intended as the headquarters for American operations in the 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	The first big Kosovo-bound international aid convoy also  
departed Skopje and crossed the border Sunday. Fifty vehicles were 
carrying 250 tons of supplies organized by the World Food Program, 
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and other aid groups, said 
convoy spokeswoman Paula Gedini. She said the convoy was headed for 
Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the difficulties at the Pristina airport, British troops  
busily fanned out around the perimeter of Pristina, taking up 
positions along main roads. Lt. Gary Bond, who was with about a 
dozen armored vehicles, said soldiers were reconnoitering the area, 
searching for helicopter landing sites and setting up field 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Brigadier Robert Baxter was looking over an abandoned factory  
near the edge of the city. ``I'm trying to find a home for 
headquarters,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO security force initially was expected to set up its  
command center at the airport, but that facility's status remained 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. President Bill Clinton was to talk by telephone Sunday with  
Russian President Boris Yeltsin to discuss the troop deployment and 
the role Russia would play in the peacekeeping mission, but 
progress on the diplomatic front seemed slow. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO and Russian commanders met face-to-face Saturday to discuss  
control of the airport, which the Russians took over after arriving 
unexpectedly in Pristina early Saturday. Top U.S. officials sought 
to dismiss indications of a rivalry with the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a coordinated occupation right now and the final details  
are going to be worked out,'' said Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Serbs believe NATO forces will be unable or unwilling to  
save them from revenge attacks by ethnic Albanians, and see Russian 
troops - greeted with cheers by thousands of local Serbs when they 
arrived early Saturday - as their protectors. 
</P>
<P>
	A British pool reporter described a tense encounter Saturday  
when Russian and Serb troops initially barred British forces from 
the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The impasse at the airport wasn't resolved, the report said,  
until negotiations were convened between the Russian commander, his 
Serb counterpart and British Brigadier Adrian Freer, commander of 
the British 5th Airborne brigade. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's SKY news, citing reports from the airport, reported  
that NATO and Russian commanders had reached a deal on sharing the 
runway. 
</P>
<P>
	``The latest we're hearing from the airfield there is that Col.  
Gen. (Viktor) Zavarzin, the Russian commander, has just said they 
settled concrete questions,'' said Chris Bellamy, a defense analyst 
for the network. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's ITAR-Tass news agency reported that Zavarzin and the  
operation commander for the Kosovo mission, British Lt. Gen. Mike 
Jackson, met late Saturday to discuss ``interaction'' in the 
peacekeeping mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not touch upon issues of big policy, we settled  
specific issues of interaction aimed at implementing the U.N. 
Security Council's resolution on stabilization in Kosovo,'' 
Zavarzin was quoted as saying. He was promoted by Yeltsin Saturday, 
after the Russian troops beat NATO to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin's top foreign affairs aide, Sergei Prikhodko, said  
Saturday that Yeltsin had given the order to send his troops into 
Pristina, but that the timing of the move -- before NATO forces 
entered Kosovo -- was the decision of the Russian military. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 100 additional Russian troops were expected to move  
soon into Kosovo from nearby Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has been expected to take part in the peacekeeping force,  
but U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott has failed in 
negotiations so far to resolve differences with Moscow over who 
would command the Russians and where they would be based.

<HEADLINE> Insects May Help Solve Murders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Investigators realized centuries ago  
that insects could help them solve murders. 
</P>
<P>
	In China, legend has it, authorities asked villagers to lay  
their tools in the sunlight after a slaying involving a sickle. 
Flies flew to one of the displayed tools, prompting a swift 
confession from its owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientific advances aside, that's about how it works today.  
Police collect maggots, flies and beetles from a crime scene and 
send them to a forensic entomologist so he can pinpoint the time 
and location of death. 
</P>
<P>
	Trouble is, police aren't scientists. They don't always know  
what to collect and how to preserve the samples. Enter Penn State's 
three-day course in forensic entomology. 
</P>
<P>
	Run by professor Ke Chung Kim, the goal is to show investigators  
how to collect crime-scene insects so the evidence will stick in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the cases that I get, they already got the material  
and they ask me, `What can you do with it?''' said Kim, who has 
taught the class annually for seven years. ``Most investigating 
agencies cannot or do not employ a forensic entomologist. So the 
best thing to do is train these guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's class, held in May, began with a visit to the pigs.  
Kim's assistant took dead pigs to woods on the outskirts of campus. 
He laid them on the grass, one in the sun and two others under 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Within 10 minutes, the first flies arrived to lay their eggs.  
</P>
<P>
	``When a body dies, there are chemical changes that occur almost  
instantaneously,'' said R.P. Withington III, the assistant. ``And 
the bugs pick up on that almost as quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the first day of class, 13 prosecutors, police officers,  
coroners and state troopers filed into the woods behind Kim. Law 
enforcers from as far away as New York City, Oklahoma and Virginia 
attended. 
</P>
<P>
	The stench was all-too-familiar to career investigators. A few  
steps farther and they came to a decomposing body, sprawled out and 
crawling with maggots and beetles. 
</P>
<P>
	The group peered down at the crawling mass. One of them took  
photographs. A day later, they collected samples, preserved them in 
alcohol and return to a laboratory for closer inspection. 
</P>
<P>
	What the students take away from the class are the nuances of  
forensic entomology. The scientists want to know how many bugs were 
on the body and where they were found. But they also need to know 
about weather conditions, the humidity, the temperature of the 
insect masses. They might also want dirt samples. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you come to this class, you find out what you didn't  
collect,'' said Joe Taussi, an investigator in the Middlesex 
County, N.J., prosecutor's office. ``You're like, `Wow, I should 
have done that, I didn't do that.''' 
</P>
<P>
	With complete information, entomologists can figure out how long  
the insects had been alive -- which tells them how long the person 
had been dead. Their estimates are frequently more precise than 
coroners' reports, which rely on body heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not really an exact science,'' Kim said. ``But  
decomposition has definite stages. All we are doing is applying 
knowledge of insects to societal problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim testified in 1990 in an Erie murder trial. His estimate of  
the time of death contradicted the coroner's report and fell in a 
two-hour window for which the suspect had no alibi. The suspect 
later confessed. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim can repeat that success only if investigators collect  
samples correctly. Many don't. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have sent him dry, shriveled insects. One autopsy  
report indicated thousands of maggots; Kim received exactly three. 
Another vial, slipped in an unpadded envelope, arrived shattered. 
</P>
<P>
	But most investigators know that insects can pay dividends when  
they are processed correctly. A Rutgers University entomologist 
examined samples from one corpse for Taussi's office and reported a 
time of death that eliminated the suspect's alibi. 
</P>
<P>
	``Science is very powerful,'' Taussi said. ``Most times, people  
are in awe. They say, `These people must know what they're talking 
about, they're scientists.' And sometimes, that's all it takes in 
an interrogation. Sometimes, it's all you have, and doing it 
correctly makes a difference.''

<HEADLINE> Dole Campaigning for Mrs. Dole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (AP) -- Bob Dole returned to the campaign  
trail Sunday, calling on old political friends to help Elizabeth 
Dole's bid for the Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, the unsuccessful Republican presidential nominee in 1996,  
said he and his wife make a powerful team, with each having long 
ties to Iowa and Mrs. Dole's ability to attract ``women and others 
who have felt a little distant from our party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what she does is she puts a smile on the face of the  
Republican party,'' Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	This was his initial campaign swing on her behalf, and he met  
with longtime backers and worked to raise money in western Iowa and 
Omaha on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	He conceded that Texas Gov. George W. Bush is the front-runner  
but said his wife has the skills and assets needed to make it a 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to have a coronation, we're going to have a  
process here,'' Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole has said repeatedly that her husband has stayed away  
from the campaign trail to allow her to establish her own identity. 
While she has campaigned for decades on her husband's behalf, this 
is her first race on her own. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's her campaign, it's not my campaign,'' Dole said. ``You  
know I want to be helpful, just as she was helpful to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign aides said Dole brings a particular ability to the race  
after having twice won Iowa's precinct caucuses when he 
unsuccessfully sought the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	He won the caucuses in 1988 before fading from the race and won  
them again in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole had raised some eyebrows when he joked earlier this spring  
about possibility giving some money to Arizona Sen. John McCain, 
who also is pondering a bid for the GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said Sunday that any controversy over that issue has  
faded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never was in the doghouse,'' he said. ``You can have friends  
in this business and still be loyal to your number one candidate, 
and that is Elizabeth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole said his wife is carefully building a campaign organization  
but the real campaign is months away. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are not that many people listening now,'' Dole said. ``I  
mean all the political junkies are listening. I bet 90 percent of 
the American people haven't tuned yet on the election.''

<HEADLINE> Automakers, UAW Begin Contract Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- National labor talks between Detroit's automakers  
and the United Auto Workers begin this week in the midst of 
record-breaking sales that have left General Motors Corp., Ford 
Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG flush with cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The triennial negotiations kick off today with ceremonial  
handshakes over the main bargaining table at Ford headquarters. 
Similar ceremonies are set for Tuesday at DaimlerChrysler and 
Wednesday at GM. 
</P>
<P>
	The health of the U.S. auto industry and the costly lessons  
learned from last year's devastating UAW strikes against GM 
decrease the chance for a walkout after this year's contracts 
expire Sept. 14, some industry analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got tough issues, but nobody wants to put the  
moneymaking on hold to sort it out,'' said labor professor Harley 
Shaiken at the University of California-Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's talks will cover about 407,000 UAW members at  
assembly and parts plants nationwide, down 15,000 from 1996. More 
than half work for GM. 
</P>
<P>
	Job security, health care costs, overtime demands and the  
assignment of work to outside suppliers are among the top issues in 
this year's talks, as they were during the last round in 1996. But 
since then, the industry has been through a tumultuous series of 
reorganizations, cost-cutting programs, acquisitions and mergers. 
Each of Detroit's automakers is financially stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to note that for all the changes this is a very  
healthy industry, one that has enjoyed record profits and sales on 
a sustained basis,'' UAW spokesman Frank Joyce said. ``It's a good 
environment for negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though times are good, Detroit executives note that they remain  
under extreme pressure to keep costs down, invest heavily in new 
models and technology, and simplify the way they build and sell 
vehicles. With production capacity worldwide far exceeding demand, 
automakers can no longer simply pass on higher labor costs to 
consumers, as they did for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of their Asian and European competitors, meanwhile, compete  
directly on American soil with a growing number of modern, 
efficient, nonunion plants -- a sore point for Detroit and the UAW. 
</P>
<P>
	Against this backdrop, the union is faced with the same problems  
that have challenged its leaders for the past 20 years: How do they 
slow the steady decline of high-paying assembly jobs as the 
industry becomes more efficient and needs fewer workers? And as 
suppliers take on a larger role in the design and assembly of cars 
and trucks, how can the union expand its influence? 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW only recently has begun to reverse its membership slide,  
largely by signing up more workers in non-automotive industries. 
More than half of its active membership is still employed by the 
Detroit automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last round of auto talks, the union won a conditional  
guarantee that at least 95 percent of UAW jobs at each plant would 
be maintained during the life of the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of focus this year will be on GM, which abandoned its  
combative stance toward the UAW after last year's strikes cost it 
about $2 billion and some of its U.S. market share. But GM has 
managed to continue offending UAW leaders as it seeks ways to cut 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, GM had been publicly promoting ambitious plans  
to assemble small cars using ``modular'' assembly techniques. GM 
says it needs to make the change because its current small cars 
built in North America don't make money. 
</P>
<P>
	In GM's modular plants, most of the subassembly work would be  
done by lower-cost suppliers who would deliver preassembled parts 
clusters, such as an entire dashboard or interior module, to the 
assembly plant. Far fewer UAW workers would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW president Stephen P. Yokich has declared modular assembly a  
dead issue, but to some extent all three automakers have already 
adopted or are planning to use more modular techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	GM and the union also will have to resolve the future of the  
42,640 UAW members at Delphi Automotive Systems Corp., the big 
parts unit the automaker divested last month. The union is 
expecting that those workers will remain under the next GM 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The future of parts workers will be an issue at Ford, too, which  
is preparing plans to spin off its Visteon parts unit. At Ford and 
GM, management is likely to seek a lower wage for new hires at the 
parts concerns so they can more effectively compete against 
nonunion suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	At DaimlerChrysler, the company that resulted from last year's  
acquisition of Chrysler Corp. by Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, the UAW 
is seeking stronger assurances that the automaker won't hinder its 
attempt to organize the Mercedes-Benz plant in Alabama and three 
Freightliner commercial truck plants in the Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	Though DaimlerChrysler's official position is that it's neutral  
in the organizing drives, executives realize it's a sensitive issue 
that could cause problems in this year's talks. And there is likely 
to be some concern among UAW negotiators about who's calling the 
shots at the Chrysler unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Daimler is a company used to dealing with a union and  
negotiation, but it's not going to be the same as Chrysler,'' said 
John Revitte, a labor professor at Michigan State University. ``The 
fact that it's now a German company is going to change things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW, meanwhile, has sent signals that it will consider a  
longer-term contract, most likely a four-year deal. That would make 
the next contract expire in 2003, a year after the union's 
leadership is scheduled to change.

	Not exactly places you'd expect to find people relaxing in  
grandma's old rocking chair. But administrators in several cities 
say an amazing thing has happened since they installed the 
traditional seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I began to see that people slowed down,'' said Paulette  
Purgason, who set 20 chairs out at the Charlotte, N.C. airport. 
``The very personality of a rocking chair says sit, relax, take a 
moment. When you sit in one, a metamorphosis occurs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea seems to be catching on. Rocking chairs have been  
installed in at least two other airports -- in Columbia, S.C., and 
Wilmington, N.C. -- at malls, and at an outdoor square in 
Pittsburgh's downtown business district. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is a symbol of home and hearth and motherhood ...  
of all things wonderful,'' said Bernie Lynch, executive director of 
Pittsburgh's Market Square Association, who purchased 30 extra-wide 
rocking chairs for the plaza. ``I want people to feel safe and warm 
and comfortable. That's the goal of any urban environment, but many 
are so stark and cold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The popularity of the comfy chairs may be picking up, along with  
nostalgia for the old-fashioned country look as the nation nears 
the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	``Heading into the millennium we see people a little frightened  
of the unknown, and so I think people are really hanging on to bits 
and pieces of yesterday,'' said Robbie Sumberg, co-director of 
Westport, Conn.-based Showoffs, a design marketing consulting firm. 
``The rocking chair is one of those classic American icons that 
will always fit in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Presley, a spokeswoman for Lebanon, Tenn.-based Cracker  
Barrel, which sells rocking chairs from the porches of its 
restaurants nationwide, said the solid oak chairs have become a top 
item. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nowadays, rocking chairs aren't just a southern thing,'' she  
said. ``We've found as we've expanded that people all over the 
country enjoy them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the restaurant chain orders some 2,750 new rockers to  
sell each week. 
</P>
<P>
	The rocking chair was probably invented in Europe, but it came  
to prominence in America and hit its height of popularity in the 
19th century. 
</P>
<P>
	A mini-revival occurred in the 1960s sparked by President  
Kennedy's well-publicized use of the chairs after a back injury. 
One of the Kennedy rockers fetched $453,000 at auction in 1996, and 
several others have attracted big spenders. 
</P>
<P>
	W.C. Paige III, whose father sold Kennedy the rocking chairs  
back in the 1960s -- for $35 each -- said business is picking up once 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the past five or six years it seems like the interest is  
coming back,'' said Paige, who with his father runs the P&AMP;P Chair 
Company in Asheboro, N.C. ``It seems like people are going back to 
wanting a more relaxed atmosphere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chairs aren't just fun. Sitting in them may be good for you.  
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Watson, director of the center for clinical research on  
aging at the University of Rochester's school of nursing, said a 
study she did involving elderly people indicated that using rocking 
chairs may release pain-relieving chemicals in the brain called 
endorphins. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no reason to think the same benefits would not apply to  
younger people, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it can hurt. It's a wonderful form of mild  
exercise and it could have potential benefits,'' Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim DeSimone, a spokesman for Orlando, Fla. Mayor Glenda Hood,  
said life has improved since about 15 rocking chairs were placed in 
a park outside the new city hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are filled with people every day,'' said DeSimone. ``Even  
if you have a lot of work yourself and are rushing past, it's nice 
to see people relaxing and enjoying themselves.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil To Auction Oil and Gas Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil is getting ready to offer  
for sale sections of Latin America's largest country for 
exploration to foreign oil companies after the breakup of a 46-year 
state monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the world's largest oil companies are to bid for 27  
potential oil and gas sites at a massive auction Tuesday and 
Wednesday. Among 37 bidders are Shell, Esso, Texaco and Mobil. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first auction of its kind since state company  
Petrobras' monopoly was abolished almost four years ago. Petrobras 
will participate at the auction and may form partnerships with 
foreign firms. 
</P>
<P>
	David Zylberstztajn, director of the Brazil's National Oil  
Agency, the industry regulator, predicts that $15 billion to $20 
billion will be invested in Brazil over five years following the 
auction. He believes 300,000 jobs will be created. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil produces about two-thirds of the 1.8 million barrels of  
oil it consumes daily. The rest are imported from Argentina, Mexico 
and Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> Aid Workers Follow Troops to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Aid workers armed with enough flour  
to bake 45,000 loaves of bread and thousands of ready-to-eat meals 
rolled into Kosovo on Sunday, following rifle-toting soldiers in 
the second stage of the region's peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
	While the NATO force is to rebuild law and order in Kosovo, the  
aid workers are to help reconstruct civilian life. Eventually, that 
will mean restoring a court system, municipal administrations, even 
holding elections. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``first and foremost is the humanitarian task,'' said Sergio  
Vieira de Mello, the U.N. interim special representative for 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Vieira de Mello led fewer than 100 U.N. and other aid workers  
into Kosovo from neighboring Macedonia on Sunday, taking the same 
route NATO tanks rumbled over at the start of the peacekeeping 
deployment Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The humanitarian convoy included 50 trucks loaded with food,  
blankets, bottled water, tents and plastic sheeting that will be 
distributed over the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	World Food Program spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume said the  
aid brought in Sunday included 48,000 ready-to-eat meals donated by 
the United States. The meals, similar to those soldiers are issued, 
included crackers, beans, lentils, jam and cookies. 
</P>
<P>
	The flour was to distributed to Kosovo bakeries. The initial aid  
team's first priority was assessment -- which bakeries could handle 
how much of the huge load, which roads and bridges could handle the 
weight of loaded aid trucks, which warehouses could store food. One 
of two U.N. warehouses in Kosovo was discovered Sunday to have been 
burned. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial aid is for an estimated 500,000-600,000 people  
believed to be displaced within Kosovo. Another 860,000 who fled to 
neighboring countries were being advised to stay in camps, with the 
situation in Kosovo still being too insecure and uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the refugees start coming back in large numbers, that would  
be a huge problem,'' Berthiaume said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vieira de Mello said he was confident the peacekeeping and  
humanitarian missions would one day make Kosovo safe for both the 
ethnic Albanian refugees who have been fleeing for months and the 
Serbs who have been leaving since the peace plan was signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbs fear retribution for the part some of them played in the  
campaign to drive Albanians from Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Bugner Fights Again at 49 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLD COAST, Australia (AP) -- Joe Bugner, at 49, won what he said  
was the final fight of 32-year career Sunday when American Levi 
Billups was disqualified for repeated low blows in the ninth round. 
</P>
<P>
	Bugner, a Hungarian who has been living in Australia since the  
early 1980s, twice went the distance with Muhammad Ali, once in a 
world title fight in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	He won the British, European, Commonwealth, Australian and the  
World Boxing Federation heavyweight titles at various times in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Bugner has announced his retirement three times previously but  
said he is convinced he will stay retired this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think after 32 years in the business I've had a very good  
run and I'm very proud to go out on this fight,'' said Bugner. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the bout, Bugner's wife Marlene said she would insist he  
quit for life. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had my way I would have had him call it quits 22 years  
ago,'' Marlene Bugner said. ``It's terrifying every time he gets 
into the ring. I know he's said he was retiring a few times before 
but this time it's definite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bugner's record is listed at 69 victories, 13 losses and a draw.

<HEADLINE> Starr To Continue Clinton Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prosecutor Kenneth Starr said Sunday he has no  
choice but to keep investigating the Clintons, a course that could 
collide with the 2000 presidential election campaign and a possible 
Senate run by the first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said he regards the coming criminal trial of Clinton  
friend Webster Hubbell -- based on an indictment that refers 36 
times to Hillary Rodham Clinton -- as an important step in the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking forward to a trial this summer, that's what  
we're preparing for right now,'' Starr said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Sunday, The Washington Post reported in a book excerpt that  
President Clinton's lawyer, Robert Bennett, was suspicious of 
Clinton's denials of extramarital relationships and warned him 
bluntly to tell the truth in the Paula Jones case or ``your 
political enemies will eat you alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said his investigation unavoidably has been prolonged  
because he has run into incomplete cooperation in many instances. 
</P>
<P>
	``For my part, I just wish we had had full cooperation from the  
outset,'' Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton White House has gone to court to challenge Starr on  
many aspects of his nearly five-year investigation. In addition, 
Hubbell and other witnesses have not provided Starr with answers to 
key questions he is investigating, such as the role of Mrs. 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, witnesses such as Clinton Whitewater partner Susan  
McDougal refused to testify to a grand jury in 1996 and 1998. 
Jurors deadlocked at Mrs. McDougal's recent obstruction and 
contempt trial, and Starr has abandoned the case against her. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize that we need to move forward promptly,'' Starr  
said, but ``some things are entirely out of my control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Mrs. Clinton's possible Senate bid from New York  
was affecting his office's decision-making, Starr said, ``We strive 
mightily while providing public information, public education, to 
divorce our decisions from politics whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said he ultimately will file a final report on his  
investigation, as mandated by the independent counsel statute 
expiring this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made no decisions with respect to the specific  
contents of the report,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office will prosecute Hubbell in federal court starting  
Aug. 9 on charges of concealing his and Mrs. Clinton's legal work 
on a fraudulent Arkansas land deal. The 1,050-acre development 
called Castle Grande contributed to the financial collapse of the 
S&AMP;L owned by the Clintons' Whitewater partners. 
</P>
<P>
	The work that Hubbell and Mrs. Clinton did on the project was  
not revealed until Mrs. Clinton's billing records turned up in the 
White House family residence in 1996 under still-unexplained 
circumstances. Prosecutors had been looking for the documents since 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The case could be postponed further if Hubbell seeks court  
appeals on legal issues. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate case, Hubbell is charged by Starr's office with  
tax evasion on hundreds of thousands of dollars in income, some of 
it in payments arranged by friends of the president when Hubbell 
was under investigation by Starr's office in 1994. That case is on 
hold pending a federal appeals court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's TV appearance coincided with the publication of excerpts  
from a new book that says in the days before Clinton was questioned 
in the Jones case, the president's lawyer thought his client's 
``Achilles' heel'' was not Monica Lewinsky, but rather an Arkansas 
woman. The woman had met Clinton four times in less than three 
months between his 1992 election and 1993 inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
	The book by Post reporter Bob Woodward says Bennett told Clinton  
in preparation for his civil case testimony on Jan. 17, 1998, that 
``your political enemies will eat you alive if there's anything in 
that deposition that isn't truthful. ... You are dead. You are 
dead!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I hear you,'' Clinton is said to have replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Woodward's book, ``Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of  
Watergate,'' says Clinton denied to his lawyer that he'd had 
relationships with a list of women. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Bennett was said to have joked: ``After this case  
is over, your reputation as a womanizer may go down the drain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another reported conversation in preparation for the  
president's testimony in the Jones case, Bennett told Clinton, ``If 
you're caught ... in the White House, I'm not good enough to help 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a prison,'' Clinton is said to have replied. ``I  
purposefully have no drapes on the windows.'' As for women, ``I'm 
retired, I'm retired,'' Clinton told Bennett, according to the 
book. Clinton was later impeached but survived the attempt to 
remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett did not return a call Sunday and the White House  
declined comment.

<HEADLINE> Pres. Bush To Stay Out of Son's Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) -- With a promise to ``stay out of his  
way,'' former President George Bush said Sunday that his son is 
prepared to follow his footsteps to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``My contribution will be letting him find his own way,'' the  
former president said in a picture-taking session promoting George 
W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush men were joined by their wives: Barbara Bush and  
daughter-in-law Laura. Rounding a corner at her family's summer 
estate and spying 150 journalists, the former first lady quipped, 
``Where were you in `92?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reminder of her husband's failed 1992 reelection campaign  
broke the ice. It was all smiles and giggles and warm hellos after 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like old times,'' the ex-president said as he walked  
up to a microphone set in front of a breathtaking view of the 
Atlantic Ocean. He nodded and waved to familiar faces in the press 
corps. 
</P>
<P>
	His son, the twice-elected Texas governor and front-running GOP  
presidential candidate, kidded the father for jumping out of an 
airplane last week to celebrate his 75th birthday. ``Happy 
birthday, Sky King,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And his mother made her endorsement official. ``I think we did  
right with this boy,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Bush visited his parents between campaigns stops in  
Iowa and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	The Family Bush is an American political dynasty. The former  
president's father, Prescott Bush, was a U.S. senator. Two of his 
sons -- Jeb of Florida and George W. of Texas -- are Republican 
governors. 
</P>
<P>
	A few feet from the Bushes, a Texas flag whipped in the wind  
beneath the Stars and Stripes. When Jeb visits, the Florida flag 
also waves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like dynasty-type stuff,'' said the former president,  
wearing a blue jacket from the Camp David presidential retreat. 
``We never felt we were entitled to anything, and dynasty connotes 
a kind of expectation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the Texas governor clearly hopes to benefit from the family  
name. He is raising money and drawing talent from his father's 
political network. 
</P>
<P>
	A new Time magazine survey suggested 63 percent of Americans see  
George W. Bush as a lot like his father. A Newsweek poll found 49 
percent of respondents felt being the son of a former president 
will help him. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Bush's popularity has risen since he left office,  
although some social conservatives who dominate early primary 
voting still resent him for breaking his no-new-taxes pledge. 
</P>
<P>
	George W. will set his own course, father and son agree.  
</P>
<P>
	``I will stay out of the issue business in terms of the  
campaign,'' the former president said. ``I think that's the right 
way to do it. I had my chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he might help raise money if asked by his son.  
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't need a voice from the past,'' the elder Bush said.  
``I'll try to stay out of his way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Bush says he learned a lot from his father's defeat,  
including that ``I'll still have a great life'' if he loses. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Bush was an ambassador to China, head of the GOP,  
director of the CIA and vice president before becoming president -- 
a resume much longer than his son's. But he said his son has 
``executive experience'' and will probably be a better campaigner. 
</P>
<P>
	When the session ended, Bush the son held out his right hand --  
palm up. Bush the father clapped his hand into his son's. There was 
a loud smack, and they shook.

<HEADLINE> O's Ripken Has First Six-Hit Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Orioles' Cal Ripken had the first six-hit  
game of his career -- the first ever by a Baltimore player -- against 
the Braves on Sunday night, including two homers that moved him 
past Johnny Bench and Graig Nettles into 32nd place on the career 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken was 6-for-6 with six RBIs, raising his average to .331.  
He hadn't gotten five hits in a game since May 5, 1985 at 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of nice at 38 to have a first in your career,''  
Ripken said. ``Everything has to go right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since coming off the disabled list in mid-May, Ripken is hitting  
.367 (40-for-109), raising his season average to .328. Sunday 
night's performance lifted his batting average by 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was seeing the ball pretty well. I got some good pitches to  
drive,'' he said. ``I had a good swing and the ball fell. It's the 
kind of night you hope to duplicate, but you probably won't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His first homer, a three-run shot, capped a five-run opening  
inning for the Orioles. He added a two-run homer in the fourth to 
stretch Baltimore's lead to 11-0, drawing a standing, towel-waving 
ovation from the Atlanta fans as he crossed home plate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles third baseman, best-known for his record playing  
streak, now has 391 homers in his career, breaking from tie with 
Johnny Bench (389) and moving past Nettles (390) as well. Next on 
the list: Joe Carter with 396. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken has 17 two-homer games in his career, the last coming at  
Detroit on Sept. 15, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the homers and a run-scoring double in the  
seventh, Ripken also had singles in the third, sixth and ninth 
innings.

<P>
	``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' the swinging sequel  
to the surprise 1997 comedy hit about the oversexed man of mystery, 
opened with a groovy gross of nearly $54.7 million to blast ``The 
Phantom Menace'' out of first place, according to industry 
estimates Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	On a huge weekend at North American theaters, the ``Star Wars''  
prequel did continue to pack in audiences, bringing in $25.4 
million Friday through Sunday to bring the George Lucas film near 
the $300 million mark after just four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Force was no match for the retro silliness of Austin  
Powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Starring Mike Myers as both the dentally challenged super spy  
and his nemesis Dr. Evil, ``Austin Powers 2'' far exceeded industry 
expectations, collecting more in its first three days than the 
original made in its entire theatrical run as it set or neared 
several box office records. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the top-opening comedy (beating last year's ``The  
Waterboy,'' which debuted with $39.4 million), the top June opener 
(beating ``Batman Forever'' with $52.7 million in 1995) and the No. 
2 non-holiday weekend opener (behind only ``The Phantom Menace'' 
with $64.8 million last month). Numbers are not adjusted for 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There seemed to be a hunger for a comedy,'' said New Line  
distribution head Al Shapiro, who also noted that audience 
expectations for the sequel started to build as the original caught 
on in video. 
</P>
<P>
	After near-disasterous test screenings befuddled preview  
audiences more than they amused them, ``Austin Powers: 
International Man of Mystery'' opened with a so-so $9.5 million in 
May 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The film caught on over the summer and ended up grossing a  
respectable $53.9 million, turning a profit because the budget was 
only about $16 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the video release that turned Austin Powers into a  
pop cultural phenomenon, becoming the No. 1 seller in 1998 and 
racking up another $44 million. Soon, fans started aping his silly 
phrases -- ``Yeah, baby!'' and ``Oh, behave!'' -- and throwing Austin 
Powers theme parties. 
</P>
<P>
	A sequel was shot with twice the budget, again starring Myers.  
Audience appetites were whetted with a hilarious trailer that poked 
fun at the ``Star Wars'' hype, though ``Austin 2'' would generate 
more than its share of marketing craziness, with a big soundtrack 
featuring Madonna and promotional tie-ins with everything from milk 
to Virgin Atlantic Airways. 
</P>
<P>
	Given a summer season slot with no comedy competition and shown  
in a record 3,312 theaters -- more than even last year's 
``Godzilla'' -- the sequel soared, taking audiences on a time-travel 
trip back to the 1960s so Austin could find his stolen mojo: his 
life-giving force, what some might call the libido. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined with the staying power of ``The Phantom Menace,'' which  
lost just 23 percent of its audience, and ``Notting Hill,'' with 
just a 25 percent dip, ``Austin Powers 2'' helped boost box office 
up 36 percent ahead of the same weekend last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Notting Hill'' collected $11.2 million for third. ``Instinct''  
had $6.8 million for fourth and ``The Mummy'' had $5.1 million for 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
are to be released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' $54.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' $25.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Notting Hill,'' $11.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Instinct,'' $6.8 million  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``The Mummy,'' $5.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Entrapment,'' $2.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``The Matrix,'' $2.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``The Thirteenth Floor,'' $1.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Never Been Kissed,'' $850,000.

<HEADLINE> Rockslide in National Park Kills 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A rockslide killed one  
person and injured numerous others Sunday night near a village 
housed by Yosemite National Park employees, a park spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The slide occurred about 7:35 p.m. when rocks broke loose from  
the western shoulder of the Glacier Point apron, spokesman Bob 
Roney said. 
</P>
<P>
	The exact number of people hurt was not known but Roney said  
they had suffered multiple injuries. The identity of the person 
killed was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 300 cabins were being evacuated from the Curry Village  
area. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now we have every spare park ranger or other employee  
involved in search and rescue operation,'' Roney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some visitors reported seeing a giant cloud of dust near the  
village. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, about 500 park employees and visitors were  
evacuated from the same village when rocks fell more than 3,000 
feet from Glacier Point to the Yosemite Valley floor. There were no 
injuries or major damage.

	Russians Block British From Airport  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A top British military official  
tried angry words and body language, but failed today to persuade 
Russian soldiers to allow British troops to enter the airport in 
the capital of Kosovo. Control of the airport has become a tense 
issue since early yesterday, when Russian troops moved into the 
city ahead of British peacekeepers. The Russians settled at the 
airport, which was supposed to be the headquarters for the 
international peacekeeping operation. The Russians' actions have 
raised concerns that they plan to create a de-facto Serbian sector 
in Kosovo.

them, officials said. Also today, British paratroopers killed a 
Yugoslav police reservist after he fired at them. British troops 
elsewhere reported counting nearly 100 bodies in mass graves found 
during patrols of Kacanik, a town in southern Kosovo. A German 
journalist was killed today by unknown gunmen, but there are few 
details on the incident.

	NEWRY, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Police and politicians in  
Northern Ireland blamed the Irish Republican Army for abducting and 
slaying a notorious drug dealer today. The victim's half-naked 
body, wrapped in a blood-stained sheet, was discovered dumped by a 
roadside in the IRA's rural stronghold of South Armagh several 
hours after masked men abducted him at gunpoint from the bar of 
Newry's only hotel. His wife, who was with him, wasn't hurt. Police 
confirmed the victim was one of Northern Ireland's most infamous

	NEW YORK (AP) -- After a weekend of scouring their computers for  
the latest e-mail virus to bombard the Internet, systems managers 
are bracing for a new work week and the threat of new infections 
when workers log on. The Worm.Explore.Zip virus, which is 
transmitted via e-mail, has struck thousands of machines, but so 
far hasn't spread as widely as the Melissa virus that hit in late 
March. But fears remained today that the outbreak may have fallen 
dormant over the weekend with most people not working, and could 
start spreading again when employees return tomorrow and turn on 
their computers.

Frontier Corp. in a bold move to bust their agreement to merge with 
Global Crossing Inc. and create a telecommunications powerhouse. 
The deal would give Qwest a piece of the local phone markets in 14 
western states with the addition of Baby Bell U S West and 
strengthen Qwest's long distance business with the addition of 
Frontier, the No. 5 long distance company.

	Drunk Driving Penalties Tougher

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reflecting tougher punishment for those who  
mix drinking and driving, over half a million motorists were on 
probation or behind bars for DWI in 1997, almost twice the level of 
the mid-1980s, the government said today. During the same period, 
drunken driving arrests dropped -- from 1.8 million in 1986 to 1.5 
million in 1997 -- even though the number of licensed drivers 
increased almost 15 percent, to 183 million, according to the 
Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics.

report also offers good news to female smokers who fear that giving 
up tobacco and nicotine will lead to weight gain. Researchers found

	Clinton, Yeltsin To Talk  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Clinton and Russian President Boris  
Yeltsin are expected to speak by telephone today to discuss 
Russia's role in the Kosovo peacekeeping force. Meanwhile, U.S. 
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott met with Foreign Minister 
Igor Ivanov, following up drawn-out talks over the previous 48 
hours. He said the U.S. was considering ``a zone of 
responsibility'' for Russian peacekeepers, the Interfax news agency 
reported. He did not elaborate, and it was unclear whether NATO 
would bend on Russian demands over a separate sector outside NATO 
control.

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A small group of Russian soldiers

airport area, although allied troops fanned out around the rest of 
Kosovo's capital and British forces rode through downtown. NATO and 
Russian commanders met face-to-face yesterday to discuss control of 
the airport, but results were inconclusive. But Britain's SKY news 
reported that NATO and Russian commanders had reached a deal on 
sharing the runway.

dropping any pretense that he is only considering a campaign. ``You 
can expect someone named George W. to win this nomination,'' the 
Texas governor said. Addressing supporters on his first campaign 
trip, Bush left no doubt that his ``exploratory committee'' will 
evolve into a full-fledged campaign. ``I'm ready,'' he told about 
200 supporters who greeted him at the airport. ``I intend to win

intelligence assessment was completed late last year. The paper 
says it was based on evidence from a senior Soviet defector and 
blood samples from North Korean soldiers showing smallpox 
vaccinations. Officials told the Times the assessment was an 
important factor in President Clinton's recent decision to not 
destroy American stockpiles of the virus.

to have 270 rolls of pennies delivered to an Armstrong County

major-league hit and got plenty of support when Brady Anderson, 
Mike Bordick and Will Clark homered in the first inning. Albert 
Belle, who was benched Friday night after a shouting match with

the batting order. He went 2-for-4 with a stolen base and an 
intentional walk.

the Stanley Cup finals by beating the Buffalo Sabres 2-1 Saturday 
night. The Stars take a 2-1 edge into Game 4 on Tuesday, with two 
of the final three games, if necessary, in Dallas. Dallas had every 
reason to lose but didn't, killing off eight Buffalo power plays -- 
one a two-man advantage -- and overcoming a groin injury that forced 
Hull to the locker room after less than three minutes of ice time.

<HEADLINE> GOP Boosts Cultural Pollution Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Littleton, Colo., school shooting offers  
evidence of America's growing acceptance of violence, explicit 
language and incivility, and its unwillingness to stand up for 
right and wrong, the congressman who represents the town said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the GOP's weekly radio address, Rep. Tom Tancredo promoted  
legislation aimed at ``cleaning up the pervasive cultural 
pollution'' in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our material wealth has increased, but our cultural wealth has  
been squandered,'' said Tancredo, R-Colo. ``We have to come to 
tolerate ever more outrageous behavior, choosing to look that other 
way rather than appearing to be judgmental.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Americans ``now must turn our resolve to cleaning up the  
pervasive cultural pollution that has seeped into the nation,'' the 
congressman added. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 20, two students at the suburban Denver high school  
barged into the building with guns and homemade bombs, killing 12 
classmates and a teacher before the pair committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Tancredo said government has a role to play in reversing the  
process of cultural decay. He touted legislation the House soon 
will consider that would curb children's access to explicit sexual 
or violent movies, video games and other attractions of modern 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of the legislation -- sponsored by Rep. Henry  
Hyde, R-Ill. -- would restrict sexually explicit or violent material 
from being made available to minors, much as current law shelters 
them from obscene material.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. 1, Argentina 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kasey Keller saved a penalty kick. Then  
Joe-Max Moore made it look all the better with a goal in the 88th 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The result was a 1-0 victory by the United States over Argentina  
on Sunday, and coach Bruce Arena likes what he sees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a year away from being a pretty good national team,''  
Arena said. ``That's our timetable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, who entered the exhibition game as a substitute in the  
60th minute for a hobbling Eddie Lewis, ran toward the top of the 
penalty area and accepted a backheel feed from Ernie Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Before an RFK Stadium crowd of 40,119, Moore's left-footed shot  
easily beat goalie German Burgos to the upper left corner. It was 
his 19th goal in international competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was planned,'' Arena cracked. ``I told (Moore) to go score  
a goal. ... We're a little thin outside in the midfield. I told Joe 
to be prepared to play in any of those positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore's winner came after Keller snuffed Gustavo Lopez's penalty  
kick in the 42nd minute. Keller made the most critical of his seven 
saves after referee Rodrigo Badilla penalized defender C.J. Brown 
of the United States for upending Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez sent a low shot to Keller's left. Keller tricked him into  
shooting there by stutter-stepping to his right, then gobbling up 
the shot with a quick move the other way. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the rule changes that allow the goalkeeper to move, all  
you try to do is keep them guessing,'' Keller said. ``If he had to 
take it over, I'm sure he'd put it further in the corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States improved to 4-1-2 since Arena took over as  
coach in November 1998. The Americans next play in the FIFA 
Confederations Cup in Mexico in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina, preparing for the Copa America Cup in Paraguay this  
month, tied Mexico 2-2 in Chicago on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Marcelo Bielsa, whose team needs to enliven its attack,  
complimented the rebuilding U.S. team as ``very good and 
challenging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Argentines outshot the Americans 17-14 but were unable to  
finish their chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some very obvious missed opportunities,'' he said.  
``We could not capitalize on 13 goals we could have possibly had.''

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Survivors To Apply for Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Needy Holocaust survivors living in Israel may  
apply this week for aid from a $59 million humanitarian fund set up 
by Swiss banks and corporations, fund organizers said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund was established to assist destitute survivors of the  
Holocaust. It is separate from a $1.25 billion fund set up in 
August by Switzerland's two largest banks and intended for holders 
of dormant wartime accounts and their heirs. 
</P>
<P>
	Holocaust survivors are suing other European insurance companies  
and banks for unclaimed wartime accounts and life insurance 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors with monthly incomes equivalent to $875 or less will  
be able to pick up applications from 700 post offices nationwide 
starting Monday, said Avraham Burg, co-chairman of the World Jewish 
Restitution Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	About 60,000 Israelis who lived under Nazi occupation are  
believed to be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Burg blamed delays in paying out the money on a power struggle  
among governmental branches that wanted to control distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expected that here there would be much greater awareness  
and sensitivity to the situation here,'' Burg said at a news 
conference, noting that 100,000 needy Holocaust survivors in the 
United States and eastern Europe have already received payments 
from the $180 million in total set aside by the Swiss. 
</P>
<P>
	The $59 million set aside for Israeli survivors arrived months  
ago, but disbursal was delayed while government agencies and 
survivor groups agreed on a distribution system. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors may submit applications until October. The money will  
then be divided evenly among those found eligible and disbursed 
through local post offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust. Some 300,000  
survivors and their heirs live in Israel today.

	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- If Texas A&AMP;M coach Mark Johnson isn't sitting  
in a dugout or studying a scouting report, he often daydreams of 
dropping a fishing line in a mountain creek. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson relaxes by thinking about his hometown of Las Vegas,  
N.M., a town of 15,600 residents on the east side of the Sangre de 
Cristo mountains in northern New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a beautiful area,'' Johnson said. ``I used to go up  
Gallinas Canyon. I like to stream fish, and I was 20 minutes away 
from that. I love fishing for trout and walking the streams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Aggies play Cal State-Fullerton in an elimination game  
Monday at the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	After this week, Johnson will resume his work as coach of Team  
USA. The collection of college and other amateurs plays this summer 
against the national teams from Japan, Nicaragua and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Another American team, made up of Class AAA pros and players  
from the 40-man rosters of major-league clubs, will compete at the 
Pan American Games in Canada as baseball follows the trend of 
professionals in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson grew up in Las Vegas, where his father was an  
administrator at New Mexico Highlands University, and became an 
All-WAC outfielder at New Mexico during the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	He broke into coaching as an assistant with the Lobos and moved  
on to Arizona, Mississippi State and Texas A&AMP;M. He worked under two 
of the best-known college coaches: Jerry Kindall in Tucson and Ron 
Polk at MSU. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said bringing the Aggies to Omaha and being named coach  
of the United States team were big honors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an amazing thing for me when I think of being from a  
small town like Las Vegas,'' he said. ``I've been really fortunate 
that things fell right for me. I got around the right people and 
got some good breaks.''

from as they strolled in front of the new-look Rosenblatt Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The city spent $4.7 million to renovate the entrance of the ball  
park for this year's College World Series, trading parking space in 
a bid to make the event more enjoyable for fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The improvements include brick columns separating wrought-iron  
gates, new restrooms, a picnic area and the centerpiece -- a statue 
of celebrating players called ``The Road to Omaha.''

	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- If Texas A&AMP;M coach Mark Johnson isn't sitting  
in a dugout or studying a scouting report, he often daydreams of 
dropping a fishing line in a mountain creek. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson relaxes by thinking about his hometown of Las Vegas,  
N.M., a town of 15,600 residents on the east side of the Sangre de 
Cristo mountains in northern New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a beautiful area,'' Johnson said. ``I used to go up  
Gallinas Canyon. I like to stream fish, and I was 20 minutes away 
from that. I love fishing for trout and walking the streams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Aggies play Cal State-Fullerton in an elimination game  
Monday at the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	After this week, Johnson will resume his work as coach of Team  
USA. The collection of college and other amateurs plays this summer 
against the national teams from Japan, Nicaragua and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Another American team, made up of Class AAA pros and players  
from the 40-man rosters of major-league clubs, will compete at the 
Pan American Games in Canada as baseball follows the trend of 
professionals in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson grew up in Las Vegas, where his father was an  
administrator at New Mexico Highlands University, and became an 
All-WAC outfielder at New Mexico during the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	He broke into coaching as an assistant with the Lobos and moved  
on to Arizona, Mississippi State and Texas A&AMP;M. He worked under two 
of the best-known college coaches: Jerry Kindall in Tucson and Ron 
Polk at MSU. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said bringing the Aggies to Omaha and being named coach  
of the United States team were big honors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an amazing thing for me when I think of being from a  
small town like Las Vegas,'' he said. ``I've been really fortunate 
that things fell right for me. I got around the right people and 
got some good breaks.''

	 *RENOVATED ROSENBLATT:* Fans had plenty of activities to choose  
from as they strolled in front of the new-look Rosenblatt Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The city spent $4.7 million to renovate the entrance of the ball  
park for this year's College World Series, trading parking space in 
a bid to make the event more enjoyable for fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The improvements include brick columns separating wrought-iron  
gates, new restrooms, a picnic area and the centerpiece -- a statue 
of celebrating players called ``The Road to Omaha.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  U.S. 1, Argentina 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kasey Keller saved a penalty kick. Then  
Joe-Max Moore made it look all the better with a goal in the 88th 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The result was a 1-0 victory by the United States over Argentina  
on Sunday, and coach Bruce Arena likes what he sees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a year away from being a pretty good national team,''  
Arena said. ``That's our timetable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, who entered the exhibition game as a substitute in the  
60th minute for a hobbling Eddie Lewis, ran toward the top of the 
penalty area and accepted a backheel feed from Ernie Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Before an RFK Stadium crowd of 40,119, Moore's left-footed shot  
easily beat goalie German Burgos to the upper left corner. It was 
his 19th goal in international competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was planned,'' Arena cracked. ``I told (Moore) to go score  
a goal. ... We're a little thin outside in the midfield. I told Joe 
to be prepared to play in any of those positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore's winner came after Keller snuffed Gustavo Lopez's penalty  
kick in the 42nd minute. Keller made the most critical of his seven 
saves after referee Rodrigo Badilla penalized defender C.J. Brown 
of the United States for upending Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez sent a low shot to Keller's left. Keller tricked him into  
shooting there by stutter-stepping to his right, then gobbling up 
the shot with a quick move the other way. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the rule changes that allow the goalkeeper to move, all  
you try to do is keep them guessing,'' Keller said. ``If he had to 
take it over, I'm sure he'd put it further in the corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States improved to 4-1-2 since Arena took over as  
coach in November 1998. The Americans next play in the FIFA 
Confederations Cup in Mexico in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina, preparing for the Copa America Cup in Paraguay this  
month, tied Mexico 2-2 in Chicago on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Marcelo Bielsa, whose team needs to enliven its attack,  
complimented the rebuilding U.S. team as ``very good and 
challenging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Argentines outshot the Americans 17-14 but were unable to  
finish their chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some very obvious missed opportunities,'' he said.  
``We could not capitalize on 13 goals we could have possibly had.''

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Builds in Atlantic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Tropical Storm Arlene, the first of the season, saw  
its top winds drop from 60 mph to 50 mph late Sunday and was still 
spinning almost aimlessly deep in the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm posed no immediate threat to land.  
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said it still could gather some strength Monday, and  
the storm might threaten Bermuda at some point beyond the reach of 
the National Hurricane Center's three-day forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the (U.S.) East Coast is in the future of this  
storm, but Bermuda -- we'll be looking at that. But it's not a big 
deal right now,'' said hurricane specialist Miles Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 p.m. EDT, Arlene's center was near 29.3 north latitude and  
59.6 west longitude, or about 375 miles east-southeast of Bermuda 
and 1,250 miles from the Florida coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Storm-force winds of 39 mph extended up to 105 miles from the  
center, which was heading west at near 5 mph. Arlene was expected 
to make a gradual turn toward the northwest either Monday or 
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE>  Runner Marion Jones Returns to N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Marion Jones won the long jump on her sixth  
leap after three scratches Saturday at the Pontiac Grand Prix 
Invitational, an effort that was the best by an American this year 
but left her lying in the sand pit gripping her knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones went 23 feet on her final jump to overtake Adrien Sawyer,  
who jumped 22-4 1/2, and hyperextended her knee in the process. Sawyer 
had the best American jump this year, 22-5 1/4. Jones was one-half 
inch short of the best jump in the world this year by Fiona May of 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-event meet was held at the North Carolina State track  
where Jones trains six times a week. It was the final competition 
for most U.S. athletes before the USA Championships later this 
month in Eugene, Ore. The meet was held before the Foot Locker 
Outdoor Championships for high school athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones zipped down the runway on her first two jumps, but  
couldn't best 22-1 3/4 on either attempt. She encouraged the crowd to 
cheer her on by clapping her hands over her head, but on the next 
three jumps she scratched. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the first legal jump, it was time to crank it up,''  
Jones said. ``I definitely had a seven-meter jump in me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After landing on her sixth and final try, Jones grabbed her  
right knee and sat in the pit until her distance was measured. 
Jones was able to walk away and later came to the awards platform 
with an ice pack wrapped around her knee. She described the injury 
as a hyperextension. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came down wrong on my knee,'' Jones said. ``I think I scared  
myself a little bit. ... Sitting here now, I'm not really concerned 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After she won, Jones was surrounded by high school athletes  
snapping pictures and clamoring for autographs as she iced her 
right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's my hero,'' said 15-year-old Chinel Davis, a sprinter and  
long jumper from Bardonia, N.Y. Jodi Schlesinger, 18, a triple 
jumper from Bardonia, said she was going to take some of the sand 
from the long jump pit as a souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
	Jearl Miles-Clark was clocked in 50.68 seconds in the 400  
meters, the best time in the world this year. The best clocking had 
been 50.76 by Cathy Freeman of Australia and Suziann Reid of the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Regina Jacobs improved her best time of this year in the 800 --  
1:59.64 -- with a 1:58.55. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so inspired by all the high school athletes, I was not  
going to dog it around the track,'' said Jacobs, who admits she's a 
high school track ``junkie.''

<HEADLINE> Starr To Continue Clinton Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prosecutor Kenneth Starr said Sunday he has no  
choice but to keep investigating the Clintons, a course that could 
collide with the 2000 presidential election campaign and a possible 
Senate run by the first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said he regards the coming criminal trial of Clinton  
friend Webster Hubbell -- based on an indictment that refers 36 
times to Hillary Rodham Clinton -- as an important step in the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking forward to a trial this summer, that's what  
we're preparing for right now,'' Starr said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Sunday, The Washington Post reported in a book excerpt that  
President Clinton's lawyer, Robert Bennett, was suspicious of 
Clinton's denials of extramarital relationships and warned him 
bluntly to tell the truth in the Paula Jones case or ``your 
political enemies will eat you alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said his investigation unavoidably has been prolonged  
because he has run into incomplete cooperation in many instances. 
</P>
<P>
	``For my part, I just wish we had had full cooperation from the  
outset,'' Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton White House has gone to court to challenge Starr on  
many aspects of his nearly five-year investigation. In addition, 
Hubbell and other witnesses have not provided Starr with answers to 
key questions he is investigating, such as the role of Mrs. 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, witnesses such as Clinton Whitewater partner Susan  
McDougal refused to testify to a grand jury in 1996 and 1998. 
Jurors deadlocked at Mrs. McDougal's recent obstruction and 
contempt trial, and Starr has abandoned the case against her. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize that we need to move forward promptly,'' Starr  
said, but ``some things are entirely out of my control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Mrs. Clinton's possible Senate bid from New York  
was affecting his office's decision-making, Starr said, ``We strive 
mightily while providing public information, public education, to 
divorce our decisions from politics whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said he ultimately will file a final report on his  
investigation, as mandated by the independent counsel statute 
expiring this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made no decisions with respect to the specific  
contents of the report,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office will prosecute Hubbell in federal court starting  
Aug. 9 on charges of concealing his and Mrs. Clinton's legal work 
on a fraudulent Arkansas land deal. The 1,050-acre development 
called Castle Grande contributed to the financial collapse of the 
S&AMP;L owned by the Clintons' Whitewater partners. 
</P>
<P>
	The work that Hubbell and Mrs. Clinton did on the project was  
not revealed until Mrs. Clinton's billing records turned up in the 
White House family residence in 1996 under still-unexplained 
circumstances. Prosecutors had been looking for the documents since 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The case could be postponed further if Hubbell seeks court  
appeals on legal issues. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate case, Hubbell is charged by Starr's office with  
tax evasion on hundreds of thousands of dollars in income, some of 
it in payments arranged by friends of the president when Hubbell 
was under investigation by Starr's office in 1994. That case is on 
hold pending a federal appeals court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's TV appearance coincided with the publication of excerpts  
from a new book that says in the days before Clinton was questioned 
in the Jones case, the president's lawyer thought his client's 
``Achilles' heel'' was not Monica Lewinsky, but rather an Arkansas 
woman. The woman had met Clinton four times in less than three 
months between his 1992 election and 1993 inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
	The book by Post reporter Bob Woodward says Bennett told Clinton  
in preparation for his civil case testimony on Jan. 17, 1998, that 
``your political enemies will eat you alive if there's anything in 
that deposition that isn't truthful. ... You are dead. You are 
dead!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I hear you,'' Clinton is said to have replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Woodward's book, ``Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of  
Watergate,'' says Clinton denied to his lawyer that he'd had 
relationships with a list of women. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Bennett was said to have joked: ``After this case  
is over, your reputation as a womanizer may go down the drain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another reported conversation in preparation for the  
president's testimony in the Jones case, Bennett told Clinton, ``If 
you're caught ... in the White House, I'm not good enough to help 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a prison,'' Clinton is said to have replied. ``I  
purposefully have no drapes on the windows.'' As for women, ``I'm 
retired, I'm retired,'' Clinton told Bennett, according to the 
book. Clinton was later impeached but survived the attempt to 
remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett did not return a call Sunday and the White House  
declined comment.

<HEADLINE> Vaccine-Refusing Marines Face Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TWENTYNINE PALMS, Calif. (AP) -- A military judge ruled on Friday  
that five Marines who refused to take anthrax vaccinations must 
face separate courts-martial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Ken Martin also sharply limited the evidence that the  
defense may use at the trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he was ``not going to second-guess the secretary of  
defense,'' Martin denied a defense request to call more than three 
dozen witnesses to testify about the vaccine's safety and 
effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	The five have pleaded innocent to charges of refusing to obey an  
order. If convicted, they face up to six months in jail, bad 
conduct discharges, fines and reduction to the rank of private. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants are among about 200 U.S. military personnel who  
have refused Pentagon-ordered vaccinations intended to protect them 
in case anthrax is used in biological warfare. They have raised 
questions about possible side effects, including sterility. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense had said it wanted to put the vaccine on trial.  
</P>
<P>
	``While this was not entirely unexpected, the judge has severely  
limited the scope of what we will be able to argue,'' said Mark 
Zaid, a civilian attorney for the men. ``We won't be able to call 
in people to challenge its safety, which is what we wanted to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Facing trial are Jason Austin, 22, of Fritch, Texas; Michael  
McIntyre, 22, of Mount Vernon, Wash.; Jared Johnston, 19, of 
Henryetta, Okla.; Michael Metzig, 20, of San Diego; and Jared 
Schwartz, 20, Henderson, Ky.

<HEADLINE> Qwest Bids $55B for Telecom Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Qwest Communications International Inc. made a  
surprising $55 billion offer Sunday to acquire U S West Inc. and 
Frontier Corp. in a bold move to bust their agreement to merge with 
Global Crossing Inc. and create a telecommunications powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver-based Qwest is the nation's fourth-largest long-distance  
telephone company. The deal would give Qwest a piece of the local 
phone markets in 14 western states with the addition of Baby Bell U 
S West and strengthen Qwest's long distance business with the 
addition of Frontier, the No. 5 long-distance company. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest is offering $78 a share in stock for U S West and $73 a  
share in cash and stock for Frontier. Qwest would sweeten each bid 
by $2 a share if both companies agree to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Both those bids are higher than Global Crossing's offer to pay  
about $63 a share in stock for both U S West and Frontier in 
separate deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing is a Bermuda-based startup company with plans to  
link the world's continents with high-speed Internet cables. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing stock, however, has fallen 16 percent in recent  
weeks as the companies have had a hard time selling investors on 
the benefits of combining their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the clear superiority of our offer to the proposed  
Global Crossing merger, we would like to meet with you and your 
advisors as soon as possible,'' wrote Joseph P. Nacchio, Qwest 
chariman and chief executive officer, in letters to the heads of U 
S West and Frontier. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing officials declined comment on the deal Sunday. U  
S West and Frontier officials could not immediately be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet is revolutionizing the telecommunications industry  
and is driving a string of merger bids. As high-speed connections 
link more homes and businesses, telecom and cable companies alike 
are betting big on the potential profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, AT&AMP;T Corp. won a bidding war with Comcast for  
MediaOne Group Inc., a Denver-based cable company. AT&AMP;T, the 
nation's largest long distance company, is gambling that television 
cables will be the way to carry Internet, voice and data traffic in 
the future.

<HEADLINE> Caps' Owners Have Some New Ideas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Watch the guy selling hot dogs at the MCI  
Center next season. He just might be the owner. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, the Washington Capitals were in the Stanley Cup  
finals. This season, they were out of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the team has new owners who are intent on reviving the  
Capitals, on the ice and at the gate. Ted Leonsis and Jonathan 
Ledecky are promising the same kind of innovative ideas that made 
them millionaires in computers and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be very accessible,'' Ledecky said. ``We're  
going to be at all the games, and we're going to wear beepers so 
there if fans are having problems with their game experience they 
can dial a number and get us. 
</P>
<P>
	``I personally plan to take on all the different functions at  
the arena and literally be a concession stand guy and a guy selling 
hot dogs and sodas in the crowd and sitting with the fans in the 
upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have buttons that say, `Hi, I'm the owner, ask  
me a question. It's going to be wild, wild in a positive way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Capitals, who lost about $20 million last season, have a  
season-ticket base of 4,000-5,000 fans. These days, it takes a 
minimum of 12,000 season tickets just to get an expansion 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	High ticket prices, a losing season after last year's success  
and the lack of hockey tradition make the team a hard sell. It's 
not unusual to hear fans of the visiting team outcheer the home 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell you how rock bottom it is,'' Leonsis said. ``Two  
weeks ago I went to the local book store, and they must have 
100,000 books there. I went to the sports section and there were 
racks and racks, literally 100 books on baseball, basketball, 10 
books on Michael Jordan alone, 20 books on golf, 20 books on 
bodybuilding, 10 books on mountain climbing -- and there were three 
books on hockey. So when I asked the woman at the checkout counter 
why, she said, `No one here loves hockey.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonsis, 42, is the president of the interactive properties  
group with America Online. Ledecky, 41, is the founder, cofounder 
or director of 10 publicly traded companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with team president Dick Patrick, they bought the Capitals  
from 75-year-old Abe Pollin for about $80 million, ushering in a 
new generation of ideas based on old-fashioned concepts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe this sounds corny, but I think the players should meet  
and thank the fans all the time,'' Leonsis said. ``I think the 
players should shake hands before games, and I think the players 
should be in chat rooms. I think the players should be posting 
their own message boards. I think the players should be scheduling 
events online so the fans can get to know them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If history is any indication, Leonsis will accomplish his goals.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, Leonsis was on a flight from Miami to Atlanta when the  
plane lost its flaps and landing gear. The passengers had about a 
half-hour to consider their fates before the pilot attempted, 
successfully, a very rough landing. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a long time,'' Leonsis said. ``I was nervous, frankly.  
I didn't want to die. I just said if I live, I'm going to play 
offense for the rest of my life. 
</P>
<P>
	``About a week later, over the weekend, I wrote down 101 things  
to do before I die, and I try to do two or three a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first 25 were sports-related -- Leonsis was single at the  
time -- and the goals included playing Augusta National golf course, 
catching a foul ball, making a hole in one, meeting Mickey Mantle, 
buying a sports team, winning an NBA championship and winning a 
Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The nonsports items included meeting the president, publishing a  
novel, making a movie, doing a standup comedy routine and traveling 
to outer space. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that he's bought the Capitals, Leonsis says he's  
accomplished ``68 or 69'' of the 101. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been clipping them off,'' he said. ``So it really has  
been a way to coalesce my thinking, goals I want to achieve. So 
when this opportunity came up, I jumped at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonsis envisions a five-year turnaround for the Capitals from a  
marketing standpoint. The first step will probably be a reduction 
in ticket prices, followed by an upgrade in the entertainment 
offered during timeouts and intermissions. He and Ledecky watched 
many recent playoff games, including Boston vs. Buffalo, taking 
notes along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll know we've arrived when it's like Boston, where there was  
like two dozen fans from Buffalo,'' Leonsis said. ``And whenever 
they stood up to cheer, they were just cheered over. You didn't 
know they existed. That would be a good barometer of when we've 
arrived.''

<HEADLINE>  Victory Gallop Wins Stephen Foster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Trainer Elliott Walden wasn't sure how  
Victory Gallop would fare in his first start since a third-place 
finish in the Dubai World Cup in March. 
</P>
<P>
	His questions were answered quickly Saturday as the 4-year-old  
winner of the 1998 Belmont Stakes ran 1 1/8 miles in a track-record 
1:47.28 to win the $827,250 Stephen Foster Handicap for 3-year-olds 
and up at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This horse has been training just great,'' Walden said. ``I  
must have had 10 people come up to me the last two days and tell me 
I was a cinch just from seeing him train. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know about that Dubai thing. I've been waiting to  
run him and had been excited about it. Everybody wants to label the 
fact that they don't come back from Dubai well. I hope this puts it 
to bed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The advertised showdown between two former Triple Crown race  
winners eventually turned into a one-horse show. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Jerry Bailey and carrying 120 pounds, Victory Gallop --  
who finished second in the 1998 Kentucky Derby and Preakness to 
Real Quiet -- breezed past 1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner 
Silver Charm in the stretch and beat him by 8 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-year-old gray, ridden by 1999 Kentucky Derby and Preakness  
winner Chris Antley and carrying a race-high 123 pounds, broke 
strong but flattened out in the final furlong in losing his fourth 
consecutive race. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just kind of ran an even race,'' said Antley, who was  
aboard the Bob Baffert-trained colt for the first time. ``I thought 
I had him in pretty good position but he just didn't fire when we 
needed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Victory Gallop, who earned $512,895, went off at 6-5 and paid  
$4.60, $2.60 and $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Nite Dreamer, who carried 110 pounds and was ridden by Pat Day,  
finished second, five lengths back, and paid $4.80 and $2.10. 
Littlebitlively, who carried 115 pounds and was ridden by Calvin 
Borel, was another three-quarters of a length back in third and 
paid $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Silver Charm were Precocity, Da Devil and Connecting  
Terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Littlebitlively, who lost by a head to Silver Charm in last  
year's Clark Handicap, dueled with Connecting Terms for the first 
three-quarters of a mile. As the field moved around the far turn, 
Nite Dreamer made his bid for the lead as Victory Gallop charged 
from the back of the seven-horse field to take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey said he was amazed by the power in Victory Gallop's  
stride as he took the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``He dropped back farther than I thought he would, about 12 or  
14 lengths off the lead,'' Bailey said. ``He was content to be 
there until I pulled the trigger. And then it was the most powerful 
rush I've felt around a turn since I've been riding. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cigar made strong moves all the way in races, but when horses  
take off like that and make up the kind of time he did today, it's 
just devastating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ride was Antley's first major race since pulling up an  
injured Charismatic as the colt neared the finish line in the 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic broke two bones in his lower left foot and was  
retired following surgery to repair the damage. Veterinarians 
credited Antley, who jumped off and immediately picked the leg up 
to keep weight off it, with preventing more serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I truly feel revived because the horse is OK -- that was my  
biggest concern,'' Antley said. ``Charismatic has given me so much 
in my career and my comeback. ... He gave me some of my greatest 
moments ever. I felt something was wrong and what I did was simply 
instinct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Antley said Charismatic had been on his mind a lot since the  
Belmont but had no effect on the way he rode Silver Charm on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``New race, new horse, new beginning and a lot of hope,'' Antley  
said.

<HEADLINE> Drunk Driving Penalties Tougher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reflecting tougher punishment for those who  
mix drinking and driving, more than half a million motorists were 
on probation or behind bars for DWI in 1997, almost twice the level 
of the mid-1980s, the government said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	During the same period, drunken driving arrests dropped -- from  
1.8 million in 1986 to 1.5 million in 1997 -- even though the number 
of licensed drivers increased almost 15 percent, to 183 million, 
the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau attributed the decline in arrests in part to the  
aging of licensed drivers. Younger drivers are more prone to drink 
and drive. In 1997, 54 percent of licensed drivers were aged 40 or 
older, up from 46 percent in 1986. The older the driver over age 
21, the lower the rate of DWI arrests, the government reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those convicted of DWI in 1997, 454,500 were on probation,  
41,100 were in local jails and 17,600 were in state prisons. In 
1986, 270,000 people were behind bars or on probation for DWI. 
</P>
<P>
	One expert said the figures reflect success in getting ``social  
drinkers'' to become more responsible and failure in dealing with 
the hardest-core group of drunken drivers: those who have a serious 
problem with alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	Without alcohol treatment programs, ``these are just drunk  
drivers waiting to get back on the road,'' said Terry Schiavone, 
president of the National Commission Against Drunk Driving, a 
private group. ``Jail and probation have never cured the drunken 
driving problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-six percent of DWI offenders on probation were in alcohol  
treatment programs in 1997, according to the bureau study. 
</P>
<P>
	Support for Schiavone's view that the half million drivers now  
under correctional supervision are ``hard-core'' includes: 
</P>
<P>
	--About half of DWI offenders in local jails reported consuming  
the equivalent of about 12 beers or six glasses of wine in the 
hours leading up to their arrest. About half those on probation 
said they had been drinking for at least three hours before their 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	--A third of DWI offenders on probation said they drank every day  
and two-thirds of them said they had used drugs in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	--A third of DWI offenders on probation and nearly two-thirds of  
those incarcerated reported prior DWI sentences. Eight percent of 
those on probation reported three or more previous DWI offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	For every 1,000 DWI arrests in 1997, 347 offenders were jailed  
or placed on probation -- up from 151 in 1986, according to the 
study. The punishment rate continues a trend that began in the late 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	In its survey based on interviews with the offenders and  
record-gathering, the Justice Department concluded: 
</P>
<P>
	--People convicted of DWI are about five years older, better  
educated and more often white than those convicted of other crimes. 
Men account for over 90 percent of DWI offenders in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	--In 1990, 327 of every 1,000 people arrested for DWI were on  
probation or behind bars, more than double the figure of 151 just 
four years earlier. In 1990, the number of drivers under 
correctional supervision was actually greater than it was seven 
years later, 593,000 compared to 513,200 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	--Convicted DWI offenders in jail were sentenced to serve 11  
months on average, while state prisoners convicted of DWI were 
sentenced to serve an average of 49 months.

<HEADLINE> Florida Volleyball Player Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Jeni Jones sat on the bed and held her  
arms straight out. They felt like jelly. 
</P>
<P>
	With one hand the doctor pushed down lightly on an arm. It  
easily gave way, bouncing off her hip and dangling in front of her. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks earlier, the 5-foot-10 middle blocker with 9-foot-8  
vertical reach had been one of the best athletes at the University 
of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Now she was stricken with a rare virus that rendered her muscles  
nearly useless. She was expected to miss a year. Maybe her career 
was through. 
</P>
<P>
	Her finely tuned body had been ravaged by Guillain-Barre  
syndrome, which causes temporary paralysis and leaves some victims 
incapacitated for years. Her determination, however, never 
slackened. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine months after the humbling encounter in the hospital, Jones  
was again one of Florida's best athletes. She returned for her 
senior season stronger than before. 
</P>
<P>
	Her comeback earned her the Honda Inspiration Award, given  
annually to a female athlete who has overcome physical adversity. 
It will be presented Monday in Reno, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody who was around Jeni during that time  
could walk away without being affected,'' Florida coach Mary Wise 
said. ``Watching the onset of the illness and then watching how 
hard she worked to come back, you had to be affected by it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' mother, Ann Bunn, drove from Birmingham, Ala., and kept  
vigil in the hospital, watching her daughter deteriorate during 
nine fretful days. Later, in Alabama, Bunn heard the daily reports 
as the team, Jones' friends and coaches helped her on the road 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think 99 percent of the people would have dropped out of  
school, come home, rested, taken an incomplete, come back the next 
year,'' Bunn said. ``Jeni wasn't about to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The virus struck quickly. It was Halloween night in Columbia,  
S.C., hours before an important match against South Carolina. 
Jones, who had seemed sluggish the last few days, felt a tingling 
sensation in her feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The trainer told Wise that Jones could not play that night. The  
coach's gut response: Can't we just loosen the tape? This is my 
starting middle blocker. She wouldn't miss a game for anything. 
</P>
<P>
	Within 24 hours, Jones was in the hospital being tested for a  
variety of illnesses, including cancer and multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the virus was spreading, moving from her feet to her  
torso to her arms. Eventually, a related disease called Bell's 
palsy paralyzed the muscles in her face, rendering her unable to 
blink, smile or convey any expression to the dozens of teammates, 
coaches and friends who flooded the hospital room each day. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedridden, unable to walk or smile, Jones was already thinking  
about a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like I've always been training for something,'' Jones  
said. ``It would be so foreign for me, as an athlete brought up to 
give 100 percent all the time and not supposed to give up, to not 
try. Hard work. You give it all the time. You can't just turn it 
off like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rehabilitation went slowly. One of the first days out of the  
hospital, it took her, with the help of friends, nearly two hours 
to get up the stairs to her second-floor apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	The struggles, emotional and physical, continued.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was one of the strongest people on my team and all of the  
sudden, I needed help walking,'' Jones said. ``When you've never 
been sick before and you have to rely on other people to help you 
walk across the room, it's humbling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the rehab progressed and the muscles strengthened, Jones soon  
learned her volleyball skills were still there. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the 1998 season approached, she was a better player.  
And not just physically. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had never really been able to relax and enjoy playing,'' she  
said. ``An attitude like that not only affects you, it affects 
everyone around you. After this, it was just like, it's not worth 
it. It was not worth all the energy I wasted getting so upset with 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones became a better server, a better hitter, an improved  
player. She set career highs in almost every statistical category. 
</P>
<P>
	She fulfilled the goal Wise sets for every player who comes to  
her program -- make the senior season the best. She was placed on 
the All-Southeastern Conference second team and helped the Gators 
return to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, you have to be surprised by something like this,''  
Wise said. ``But she's one of the hardest workers I've ever seen. I 
always knew that if coming back could be accomplished through hard 
work, there was no doubt Jeni would be back.''

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the former  
president who once called himself Mexico's favorite villain, met 
expressions of almost visceral hatred Sunday while on his first 
trip to Mexico after four years of self-imposed exile. 
</P>
<P>
	In a near-unanimous show of disapproval, Mexicans vented their  
anger against Salinas, who left the country in disgrace in March 
1995, three months after the end of his six-year presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	He is widely blamed for the collapse of the Mexican peso three  
weeks after he left office, sending Mexico into an economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a public-relations effort, Salinas gave interviews to  
Mexico's two TV networks and offered a press conference, but his 
attempts to defend his image appeared to have failed. 
</P>
<P>
	At the press conference Saturday, he said that a ``tenacious''  
four-year media campaign had been waged against him. 
</P>
<P>
	He told reporters on Saturday he had planned to leave Sunday  
morning. However he apparently changed plans. Local radio stations 
reported he was still in Mexico City Sunday night, attending a 
family gathering. 
</P>

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Federal anti-narcotics agents raided 176  
properties -- including luxurious antique-furnished homes -- 
belonging to imprisoned bosses of the Cali drug cartel, authorities 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In operations that began last week, agents took control of  
houses, ranches, apartments and offices in 11 cities belonging to 
convicted drug traffickers Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rodriguez brothers were caught by police in 1995 and  
sentenced to 10 and 20 years in jail respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	The properties -- with an estimated value of $14.8 million -- had  
been registered in the name of third parties, said the DAS state 
security agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia enacted sweeping asset forfeiture legislation in 1996  
that allowed authorities to seize properties belonging to convicted 
drug traffickers. 
</P>

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- An armed gang posing as visitors to a  
Brazilian prison overpowered two guards Sunday and allowed 60 of 66 
inmates inside to flee, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gang of four pulled out guns as the guards opened the main  
gates at visiting time, detective Elias Kobachi said by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Some escapees fled in six cars they stole from where they were  
parked near the prison in Sumare, 110 miles northwest of Sao Paulo, 
she said. Only three inmates were immediately recaptured. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a week ago, in the biggest prison break in Brazil's  
history, 315 inmates fled a prison near Sao Jose dos Campos, in Sao 
Paulo state. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, some 2,200 inmates have escaped from prisons  
and precinct jails in the state. In 1998, the total was 5,888, 
according to police figures. 
</P>

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil is getting ready to offer  
sections of Latin America's largest country for exploration to 
foreign oil companies after the breakup of a 46-year state 
monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the world's biggest oil companies are to bid for 27  
potential oil and gas sites at a massive auction Tuesday and 
Wednesday. Among 37 bidders are Shell, Esso, Texaco and Mobil. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first auction of its kind since the state-owned  
Petrobras' monopoly was abolished almost four years ago. Petrobras 
will participate at the auction and may form partnerships with 
foreign firms. 
</P>
<P>
	David Zylberstztajn, director of the Brazil's National Oil  
Agency, the industry regulator, predicts that $15 billion to $20 
billion will be invested in Brazil over five years following the 
auction. 
</P>

<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A leading Venezuelan historian on  
Sunday called for the armed forces to intervene if President Hugo 
Chavez uses a constituent assembly to dissolve Congress and the 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, the leader of a failed 1992 coup attempt, has said that  
an assembly to be elected July 25 to rewrite Venezuela's 
constitution should dissolve the other branches of government 
because they are corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	But historian Jorge Olavarria, who Sunday officially announced  
his candidacy for the election, said that would be the equivalent 
of a coup, in effect giving Chavez dictatorial powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition is expected to  
dominate the assembly. He argues that the assembly will have the 
right to shut down Congress and the courts, which he says would be 
replaced by institutions created by the assembly.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Four-time Olympic gold medalist Amy Van  
Dyken won a 50-meter freestyle race tonight, her first competitive 
race since she had shoulder surgery last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Dyken, 26, won gold medals in the 1996 Summer Games in the  
50 freestyle and 100 butterfly, and as a member of the 400 
freestyle and 400 medley relay teams. 
</P>
<P>
	But she injured her right shoulder while lifting weights on May  
10, 1997, and couldn't take a single stroke in the pool for months 
without significant pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Dyken, the American record-holder in the 50 at 24.87  
seconds, was timed in 25.95 Saturday night during the Charlotte 
UltraSwim. It wasn't close to her personal best, but it fulfilled 
her modest expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I wasn't going to have a good start because it hurts my  
shoulder a lot at the start,'' Van Dyken said. ``I usually build up 
(speed) during the race, and that's what I did. It looked like I 
was going to lose for a while, but I just kicked it into another 
gear, and it worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Dyken, who has aspirations of competing in the 2000 Olympics  
in Sydney, Australia, is working her way back into shape. Charlotte 
was a positive step, one she hopes will help land her a spot on the 
U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, it's just make the team,'' Van Dyken said. ``I  
took that first step this morning in making my Olympic trials 
qualifying time, which I didn't have going into this meet. I've 
made the first step, the next step is to work hard, see what I can 
do and whatever happens is going to happen.''

<HEADLINE> Italian Goalie Injured by Explosive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- An explosive thrown from the stands injured a  
goalkeeper during a third-division playoff game Sunday, the last 
day of the Italian soccer season. 
</P>
<P>
	Marco Borghetto of Lumezzane dropped to the ground after the  
device landed nearby during the second half of a 2-1 loss to 
Pistoia. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old goalie was taken to the hospital, and his  
injuries and condition were not immediately clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Lumezzane said it will protest the game, which determined a spot  
in Serie B and was played in Cremona, a neutral site. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	--Five police officers were injured trying to separate opposing  
hooligans before a Serie B game in Genoa. 
</P>
<P>
	--One officer was hurt when scuffles broke out at a train station  
in Verona between groups of fans en route to different games. 
</P>
<P>
	--Seventeen hooligans detained after clashing with police before  
a Serie B game in Ravenna were banned from attending games for a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	On the field, Reggina, never before in Serie A, and Lecce were  
promoted to the first division with victories Sunday. Verona and 
Torino already had clinched the other two berths in Serie A. 
</P>
<P>
	Reggina edged Torino 2-1 in a game the referee ended in the 87th  
minute because fans stormed the field to celebrate. Reggina, 
founded in 1914, is the first club from the poor southern region of 
Calabria to reach Serie A in 16 years.

<HEADLINE> O's Ripken Has Five-Hit Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Baltimore's Cal Ripken had his first five-hit  
game in more than 14 years Sunday night against the Braves, 
including two homers that moved him past Johnny Bench and Graig 
Nettles into 32nd place on the career list. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken was 5-for-5 after a seventh-inning double gave him six  
RBIs on the night, raising his average to .324. It was the fifth 
time in his career that he had five hits in a game, but the first 
since May 5, 1985 at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	His first homer, a three-run shot, capped a five-run opening  
inning for the Orioles. He added a two-run homer in the fourth to 
stretch Baltimore's lead to 11-0, drawing a standing, towel-waving 
ovation from the Atlanta fans as he crossed home plate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles third baseman, best-known for his record playing  
streak, now has 391 homers in his career, breaking from tie with 
Johnny Bench (389) and moving past Nettles (390) as well. Next on 
the list: Joe Carter with 396. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken has 17 two-homer games in his career, the last coming at  
Detroit on Sept. 15, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the homers and run-scoring double, Ripken also  
had singles in the third and sixth innings as the Orioles built a 
20-1 lead by the eighth.

<HEADLINE> United 2, Crew 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Jaime Moreno and Marco Etcheverry hooked  
up on two goals and D.C. goalkeeper Tom Presthus had two saves in a 
two-minute span late in the game as United held off the Crew 2-1 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus (7-5) was held under two goals for the ninth time this  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Mareno, who scored his fourth and fifth goals, took a pass from  
Etcheverry, sprinted about 40 yards past three defenders and fired 
a shot from about 15 yards past Mark Dougherty to give United a 1-0 
lead in the 34th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 66th minute, Moreno split Michael Clark and Robert  
Warzycha and sent a shot across the box into the left corner past a 
diving Dougherty. 
</P>
<P>
	Etcheverry set up Moreno with a 30-yard pass that rolled  
untouched from near midfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Cunningham, who didn't play in the first half, scored his  
team-leading fifth goal the 69th minute for Columbus, which went 57 
minutes before testing Presthus. 
</P>
<P>
	United (9-3) played without four starters: forward Roy Lassiter,  
defenders Jeff Agoos and Carlos Llamosa, and midfielder Richie 
Williams. They played for the U.S. national team Sunday in its 1-0 
win over Argentina in RFK Stadium in Washington 
</P>
<P>
	Crew forward Stern John and defender Ansil Elcock missed the  
game to play for Trinidad &AMP; Tobago in the championship game of the 
Copa Caribe tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus missed opportunities to tie in the 75th and 77th  
minutes when Presthus stopped Jeff Farrell from in close and 
blocked Cunningham's drive from the top of the box. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Kmosko missed a chance to tie the game in the 62nd minute  
when his twisting, right-footed shot sailed just to the left of the 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	A.J. Wood set up Mareno's first goal with an interception. He  
quickly fed the ball ahead to a cutting Etcheverry. He dribbled a 
few feet before spotting Mareno breaking down the center of the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Mareno easily dribbled past Matt Chulis and Mike Lapper, dodged  
a sliding Warzycha, and scored. 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Brian McBride started for Columbus after missing four  
games with a fractured cheekbone. He wore a protective mask.

<HEADLINE> Preview Capsule of NBA Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A look at the two teams in the NBA Finals:  
</P>
<P>
 *SAN ANTONIO (37-13 regular season, 11-1 postseason) vs. NEW YORK  
(27-23, 11-4)	
</P>
<P>
	Probable starters: San Antonio -- C David Robinson (15.2 pts, 9.1  
reb, 1.9 stl, 2.08 blk), F Tim Duncan (21.5 pts, 10.4 reb, 2.83 
blk), F Sean Elliott (13.6 pts, 3.6 reb), G Mario Elie (16.4 pts, 
3.3 reb), G Avery Johnson (14.1 pts, 7.5 ast). New York -- C Chris 
Dudley (2.8 pts, 4.8 reb), F Kurt Thomas (5.2 pts, 4.8 reb), F 
Latrell Sprewell (18.5 pts, 4.2 reb), G Allan Houston (17.5 pts), G 
Charlie Ward (4.2 pts, 3.8 ast, 1.5 stl). 
</P>
<P>
	Key reserves: San Antonio -- G Jaren Jackson (20.8 mins, 8.9  
pts), F Jerome Kersey (12.3 mins, 2.8 pts, 2.5 reb), F Malik Rose 
(10.8 mins, 3.3 pts, 2.3 reb), G Steve Kerr (8.8 mins, 2.5 pts). 
New York -- F Marcus Camby (24.9 mins, 10.6 pts, 7.6 reb, 1.87 blk, 
1.4 stl), G Chris Childs (25.9 mins, 4.1 pts, 5.5 ast), F Larry 
Johnson (33.2 mins, 12.7 pts, 4.9 reb). 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries: San Antonio -- G Avery Johnson bruised his knee in the  
conference finals. New York -- C Patrick Ewing is out with a torn 
Achilles tendon. F Larry Johnson is day-to-day with a sprained 
knee. G David Wingate is questionable with a torn quadricep muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	Season series: Did not play.  
</P>
<P>
	Spurs advantages: Size, rebounding, interior defense, health,  
depth. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio's tandem of Duncan and Robinson presents serious  
matchup problems for the injury-depleted Knicks, who won't be able 
to put Ewing on Robinson and might not be able to put Johnson on 
anybody if his sprained knee is slow to heal. If Duncan and 
Robinson get into foul trouble, there's plenty of size in reserve 
with Rose, Kersey and Will Perdue. San Antonio's shot blocking 
skills are superior to those of any team the Knicks have faced so 
far. The Spurs are well-rested coming off two straight sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
	Knicks advantages: Speed, athleticism, backcourt scoring,  
intangibles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks found they could thrive in the conference finals when  
they quickened the pace against the old and slow Indiana Pacers. 
The Spurs are a lot quicker, but the Knicks -- especially Sprewell 
and Camby -- can still score and draw fouls in transition. If 
Sprewell and Houston are clicking together, New York's backcourt 
will outscore San Antonio's. As for intangibles, it seems like most 
of the lucky bounces are going their way. They are a confident 
bunch despite their injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Storyline: Nobody expected the Knicks to be where they are, and  
nobody expects them to have much of a chance against what appears 
to be a superior opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Knicks in 7.

<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Desert Waves, a 9-year-old gelding who was  
supposed to be the pacesetter, surprised the field by winning the 
$276,250 King Edward Breeders' Cup Handicap at Woodbine on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of Alysheba covered 1 1/8 miles on the turf in 1:46 2-5 and  
finished a length in front of Crown Attorney. Down the Aisle was 
another 1 1/4 lengths back in third in the field of seven horses 3 and 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first win for Desert Waves since Aug. 31, 1997, when  
he also beat Down the Aisle and Crown Attorney in the 1 1/2-mile 
Niagara Handicap at Woodbine. 
</P>
<P>
	Desert Waves returned $10.60, 4.50 and 2.60. Crown Attorney paid  
$4.50 and $2.30, while Down the Aisle was $2.20 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	``He ran a really big race today,'' jockey Neil Poznansky said  
of Desert Waves. ``We got off real easy in the fractions part and 
when I asked him down the lane, he really kicked off. There wasn't 
much speed in the race and we got away with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $165,750 purse pushed Desert Waves' career earnings to  
$1,217,029.

<HEADLINE> White House China Collection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The shimmering candlelight reflected in the  
porcelain, the silver, the cut-glass decanters, did nothing to 
disguise the fact that this was the most infamous midnight supper 
ever served at the president's house. 
</P>
<P>
	For when the 40 clamorous British officers and guests had eaten  
their commandeered meal, Adm. Sir George Cockburn pushed back his 
plate, rose in his spurred boots, toasted England's prince regent 
and ordered the White House be burned. 
</P>
<P>
	Before deserting the White House at the approach of enemy  
forces, first lady Dolley Madison had ordered dinner be prepared in 
anticipation of an American victory. The British found the table 
set and wine in decanters ready on the mahogany sideboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``The British officers attacked the table, making a party of the  
occasion, while the sailors prepared the place for burning,'' 
writes William Seale, in ``The President's House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By dawn on the morning of Aug. 25, 1814, the mansion was a  
smoking ruin. Its sandstone walls were cracked, soot-stained and 
broken, its timbers charred, its contents -- including china used by 
Presidents Washington, Adams and Jefferson -- burned to powder. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, 185 years later, candlelight again gleamed on White  
House china, glass and silver. But no one suggested the evening be 
concluded with a fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The American plates ordered by President Wilson in 1918 greeted  
guests at a state dinner honoring the president of Hungary, their 
broad gold and cobalt-blue double borders framing the presidential 
eagle in gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Diners were served on the American china ordered in 1934 by  
President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the inner border of gold roses and 
plumes incorporating elements from the Roosevelt coat of arms. The 
Wilson and Roosevelt services were filled out this decade by 
purchases of reproductions ordered by first lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The stories of the Wilson and Roosevelt plates, and the long and  
distinguished history of dining at the White House, are 
incorporated in a newly revised, reissued and lavishly illustrated 
book, ``Official White House China, 1789 to The Present,'' 
published by The Barra Foundation and Harry N. Abrams Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Written by the late Margaret Brown Klapthor, former curator of  
the First Ladies Hall at the Smithsonian Institution, it was 
revised and updated by Betty Monkman, curator of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	White House china also is a star this summer and fall at an  
exhibition at the Woodrow Wilson House here. It includes selections 
from the presidential china collection of Seth Charles Momjian and 
throws a wider net, including family china from presidential 
families, yachts and airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Momjian collection includes a plate from a family service  
used by President Monroe between 1817 and 1825. Monroe was the 
first president to live in the White House after it was rebuilt, 
and he was largely responsible for refurnishing it in the best 
French taste. English china just wouldn't do in a house so recently 
burned by English troops. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 19th century and beyond, most White House guests were  
impressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The china was white and gold and blue with a crest, the eagle  
of course,'' wrote Mrs. James Dixon, a Connecticut congressman's 
wife, describing a pre-Christmas dinner given in 1845 by President 
Polk. 
</P>
<P>
	The food served that evening included canvasback duck, turkey,  
oyster pies, ``ham deliciously garnished, potatoes like snowballs, 
pate de fois gras, jellies, orange and lemon charlotte russe ... 
and everything one can imagine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For most of the 19th century, older White House china was  
routinely given away or auctioned off. 
</P>
<P>
	As new services were purchased, national themes were  
increasingly used. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most flamboyant services was introduced by first lady  
Lucy Hayes in the late 1870s. It featured bold designs with native 
American animals, fish and plants, including a large, curled-edge 
platter with a strutting wild turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	Theodore Roosevelt's wife, Edith, also a collector, stopped the  
selling or giving away of White House china, ordering damaged 
pieces to be shattered and thrown in the Potomac River. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1917, first lady Edith Wilson created the ground-floor China  
Room to show the collection to the public. The following year, she 
and the president ordered the first American-made state service. 
</P>
<P>
	White House china was purchased with government money through  
the 1960s. Since then, the cost has been borne by private 
donations, including the ``Nancy Reagan red'' state china with its 
gold-hatched red border. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reagan china drew criticism for extravagance, even though no  
public money was used to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
	First lady Mary Lincoln also was scolded in the press for  
ordering new, purple-bordered china at the opening of the Civil 
War. 
</P>
<P>
	There is one intriguing note.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the British officers present at Cockburn's notorious  
dinner was Lt. Beauchamp Urquhart, who helped himself to President 
Madison's dress sword. He later told a London journal that ``one of 
the soldiers tied up the plates and knives and forks in the 
tablecloth, and brought them away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If so, Ms. Monkman, the White House curator, says there is no  
evidence they still exist.

<HEADLINE> Fugitives Tricked in Prize Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- The allure of a car and other prizes  
proved enough to win more than 70 curious fugitives something they 
hadn't bargained for -- free lodging in Oakland County's lockup. 
</P>
<P>
	Assorted probation violators and other felons headed out  
Saturday to the Pontiac Silverdome eager for prizes they were told 
awaited them. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they got a free trip to jail, courtesy of Pontiac and  
Oakland County authorities, The Oakland Press of Pontiac and The 
Detroit News reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're shocked and surprised,'' Lt. Steve Sitar said. ``And  
then we'll get some statements, `Do I still get my TV?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The sting involved mailing out notices weeks ago to some of the  
county's most elusive criminals, informing them that a set of free 
Silverdome tickets, a television and possibly a car were waiting at 
the stadium as part of a random drawing. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs outside the Silverdome said a group called P.O.P.  
Productions was giving away the prizes. The acronym doesn't stand 
for anything, police Capt. Mike Milosic said. 
</P>
<P>
	It means, ``You got popped,'' said Milosic, who wore a special  
red P.O.P. shirt with the Silverdome emblazoned on it.

<HEADLINE> NBA Mulls Age Limits for Rookies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NBA commissioner David Stern said he'd like to  
see an age limit for young players coming into the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern told The Washington Post in an interview published in  
Monday's editions that with more and more young players leaving 
college early, or skipping it altogether, to turn pro, he'd like to 
work with the players' union to impose a minimum age limit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the right to set an age limit in the collective  
bargaining agreement,'' Stern said. ``I believe we can work 
together to come up with something that is legally correct and will 
withstand legal challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said that Dan Wasserman, the spokesman for the  
National Basketball Players Association, did not return several 
calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes Stern would like to see would not come in time to  
limit the 1999 NBA draft, which will be held in Washington on June 
30. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Post, the NBA would try to follow the lead of  
the NFL, which has a rule that requires players to have been out of 
high school for three years before they are eligible for the draft.

	US Fears Russian Problem in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. officials are concerned that confusion  
over Russia's role in postwar Kosovo could undermine NATO's effort 
to take an evenhanded approach to emptying the province of Serb 
troops and securing the return of ethnic Albanian refugees to their 
shattered villages. NATO's plan, based on Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic's agreement to withdraw his military and allow 
an international force into Kosovo as peacekeepers, now must be 
adjusted to account for Russia's surprise decision to put troops 
into Kosovo without coordinating with the Western alliance. Russia 
has traditional ties to the Serbs, who are a minority in Kosovo.

	State Dept. Sends Mission to China  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senior State Department official is going to  
Beijing with a report on the accidental bombing of the Chinese 
Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and a goal of putting strained 
U.S.-China relations back on course. Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright said Sunday that Undersecretary Thomas Pickering and other 
administration officials will again tell the Chinese that the May 7 
bombing, which killed three Chinese citizens, was a ``tragic 
accident.'' They were leaving Monday. Pickering will also stress 
that the United States believes the relationship with China is an 
important one ``that needs to get beyond this,'' Albright said on 
NBC's ``Meet the Press.''

by the International Olympic Committee executive board in a bid to 
close the five-month controversy swirling around the Australian IOC 
member. Coles -- who was already censured in March for his role in 
the Salt Lake City scandal -- had been under the threat of expulsion

	Talks Begin Between Automakers, UAW

<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- National labor talks between Detroit's automakers  
and the United Auto Workers begin this week in the midst of 
record-breaking sales that have left General Motors Corp., Ford 
Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG flush with cash. The triennial 
negotiations kick off Sunday with ceremonial handshakes over the 
main bargaining table at Ford headquarters. Similar ceremonies are 
set for Tuesday at DaimlerChrysler and Wednesday at GM. The health 
of the U.S. auto industry and the costly lessons learned from last 
year's devastating UAW strikes against GM decrease the chance for a 
walkout after this year's contracts expire Sept. 14, industry 
analysts say.

	U.S., Russia Negotiate Kosovo Roles  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the first substantial U.S. ground forces  
entered Kosovo, administration officials reported progress today on 
a deal that would allow the Russian military to play a peacekeeping 
role without undermining NATO control. President Clinton and 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed their generals should work 
out details for the first 200 or so Russian troops that already are 
in Kosovo while talks continue on command arrangements for a larger 
contingent, a White House spokesman said. The lead Russian troops 
arrived yesterday in Pristina ahead of alliance forces. They 
blocked NATO from reinforcing British troops at the airport.

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Aid workers armed with enough flour  
to bake 45,000 loaves of bread and thousands of ready-to-eat meals 
rolled into Kosovo today, following rifle-toting soldiers in the 
second stage of the region's peace plan. While the NATO force is to 
rebuild law and order in Kosovo, the aid workers are to help 
reconstruct civilian life. Eventually, that will mean restoring a 
court system, municipal administrations, even holding elections. 
The humanitarian convoy included 50 trucks loaded with food, 
blankets, bottled water, tents and plastic sheeting that will be 
distributed over the next few days.

	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Joel Holoubek, a French coin dealer,  
outplayed 89 other pianists to win the International Piano 
Competition for Outstanding Amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Holoubek, one of six finalists, thrilled a packed auditorium at  
Texas Christian University on Sunday with pieces by Ravel and 
Dutilleux. 
</P>
<P>
	He won $2,000, regular seats at the prestigious Van Cliburn  
International Piano Competition and a chance to play with an 
orchestra in Paris sometime before 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	While Holoubek took home the top prize, Alexandre Bodak, a  
French physician, was the audience favorite. He won a collection of 
piano music on compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
	The competition featured performers from nine countries. It was  
sponsored by the Van Cliburn Foundation, the same organization that 
runs the main piano competition every four years. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time amateurs have competed. Only those 30 or  
older who are not professional pianists or piano teachers could 
participate. The headline event usually includes pianists younger 
than 30 who are on the path of a musical career.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Fall Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gasoline prices dropped nearly 3 cents  
per gallon nationwide in the past three weeks, but the decline 
might stall if crude oil prices continue to rise, an industry 
analyst said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The national weighted average, including all grades with taxes,  
was $1.1902 per gallon Friday, down 2.78 cents from the previously 
survey on May 21, said Trilby Lundberg, publisher of the Lundberg 
Survey of 10,000 stations across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	A good supply of domestic crude has helped shield American  
motorists from price hikes by OPEC and other oil-producing 
countries. But if crude prices continue to rise, U.S. pump prices 
might level off during the summer driving season, Ms. Lundberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gas prices dropped for 1 1/2 years until bottoming out in  
mid-February, when the average for all grades was 99.8 cents per 
gallon. That was followed by a hikes in the spring before prices 
topped out at an average of $1.2337 in early May. 
</P>
<P>
	At self-service pumps, the average for regular unleaded on  
Friday was $1.1320, mid-grade averaged $1.2333 and premium $1.3183. 
</P>
<P>
	For full-service, the average was $1.5159 for regular, $1.6031  
for mid-grade and $1.6771 for premium.

<HEADLINE> O's Ripken Has First Six-Hit Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Orioles' Cal Ripken had the first six-hit  
game of his career -- the first ever by a Baltimore player -- against 
the Braves on Sunday night, including two homers that moved him 
past Johnny Bench and Graig Nettles into 32nd place on the career 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken was 6-for-6 with six RBIs, raising his average to .331.  
He had five previous five-hit games, but none since May 5, 1985 at 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	His first homer, a three-run shot, capped a five-run opening  
inning for the Orioles. He added a two-run homer in the fourth to 
stretch Baltimore's lead to 11-0, drawing a standing, towel-waving 
ovation from the Atlanta fans as he crossed home plate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles third baseman, best-known for his record playing  
streak, now has 391 homers in his career, breaking from tie with 
Johnny Bench (389) and moving past Nettles (390) as well. Next on 
the list: Joe Carter with 396. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken has 17 two-homer games in his career, the last coming at  
Detroit on Sept. 15, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the homers and a run-scoring double in the  
seventh, Ripken also had singles in the third, sixth and ninth 
innings.

<HEADLINE> Biologists Find Ga. Cave Critters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLIMAX, Ga. (AP) -- Climax Cave's dark, jagged mouth sits at the  
bottom of a 65-foot depression hewn from limestone by rainwater 
over eons. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a sizable feat to reach it. Visitors clamber down steep  
banks littered with uprooted trees and leaves. One false step could 
mean a dangerous tumble. 
</P>
<P>
	Biologists are willing to make the journey to Climax Cave and  
about 200 other caves in Georgia. They hope to identify species, 
assess the condition of the caves and develop a plan for protecting 
the delicate and sensitive ecosystems. 
</P>
<P>
	During a six-hour visit to Climax Cave, near the small town of  
Climax in the state's southwest, the biologists discovered the rare 
Georgia blind salamander, known to live at only two locations. 
</P>
<P>
	They also found the Dougherty Plain crayfish and the  
Southeastern myotis bat, both rare and in need of preservation. 
Thousands of years of evolution in a dark environment has left the 
crayfish and salamander completely devoid of skin pigment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really don't know what lives in caves,'' said John Jensen,  
a biologist for the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. 
``We've kind of put the cave ecosystems on the back burner, but 
it's important to know what occurs in caves so we can conserve and 
manage them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Species documented so far in north Georgia caves include the  
Tennessee cave salamander, the gray bat and a host of beetles, 
crayfish and spiders. 
</P>
<P>
	Periodically, Jensen and fellow biologist Jim Ozier crawl into  
coveralls and don helmets to descend into the darkness of a new 
cave. They have checked about 30 since the study started last July. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the things we're taking a look at are tiny things --  
beetles, spiders, millipedes,'' Ozier said. ``Some occur nowhere 
else but in caves and sometime just in one or two caves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among other caves on the biologists' list is Ellison's Cave in  
northwest Georgia. It's a 600-foot pit thought to be the deepest in 
the eastern United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every cave is different,'' Jensen said. ``Some have vertical  
pits that you have to rappel into. They're big black holes and that 
can be spooky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some have big doors,'' he said. ``Some have narrow cracks that  
you have to crawl through. That's kind of spooky, but once you get 
in there, the stuff that's there is so interesting and beautiful 
that it kind of takes the fear away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Information collected during the survey will be used to preserve  
caves on public land and to advise people who own caves on private 
land -- like Climax Cave owned by cattle rancher G.W. Long.

<HEADLINE> Experts Fear E-Mail Virus Mutations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After a weekend of scouring their computers for  
the latest e-mail virus to bombard the Internet, systems managers 
were bracing for a new work week and the threat of new infections 
when workers log on. 
</P>
<P>
	The Worm.Explore.Zip virus, which is transmitted via e-mail and  
ruins files on infected computers, has struck tens of thousands of 
machines, but so far hasn't spread as widely as the Melissa virus 
that hit in late March. 
</P>
<P>
	But fears remained Sunday that the outbreak may have fallen  
dormant over the weekend with most people not working, and could 
start spreading again when employees return Monday morning and turn 
on their computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Another concern, anti-virus experts said, has been scattered  
reports of new symptoms being detected among infected machines, a 
sign the bug may be more complex than first thought, said Mark 
Zajicek, a member of the Computer Emergency Response Team at 
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Bureau of Investigation was trying to track down the  
author of the virus, but the agency declined to provide any updates 
on the probe over the weekend. It took only days earlier this 
spring for authorities to trace the digital footprints of Melissa 
and the Chernobyl virus that struck in late April. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus, first detected June 6 in Israel, did most of its  
damage on Thursday and Friday, infecting computer systems at 
several big corporations including AT&AMP;T, Boeing, General Electric 
and even Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Nervous calls to computer support lines dropped off sharply this  
weekend after two frenzied days of combat against the bug, which 
uses guile like Melissa to spread and then inflicts a 
Chernobyl-like attack on individual machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Worm.Explore.Zip targets computers using Microsoft Windows  
operating systems. The virus arrives in a person's e-mail box as a 
timely reply from an acquaintance, inviting the recipient to open 
an attached file that will unleash a two-pronged attack: It spreads 
by sending a copy of itself to the address of any arriving e-mail 
and destroys files stored on a person's machine, including those 
created by the popular programs Microsoft Word and Excel.

<HEADLINE>  German Troops Under Fire in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRIZREN, Yugoslavia (AP) -- German troops came under heavy sniper  
fire Sunday in this southern Kosovo city and killed at least one 
armed man and wounded another in the firefight. A German soldier 
suffered an arm wound. 
</P>
<P>
	The German peacekeepers had been greeted earlier by cheering  
ethnic Albanians when they entered Prizren, Kosovo's second-largest 
city, in Germany's first major military deployment on foreign soil 
since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	As they approached the center of the city on a main street along  
the Bistrica River, sniper fire crackled from a hill and houses. 
German soldiers took cover and began shooting back. 
</P>
<P>
	The Germans' heavy fire blasted a yellow Lada car with two  
occupants. One was slumped dead over the steering wheel and the 
other was badly wounded and screaming for help before he was 
evacuated by German medics. 
</P>
<P>
	German soldiers said that the men shot first and that grenades  
and semi-automatic weapons were found in the car. 
</P>
<P>
	As reporters hid behind vehicles, German soldiers took up  
defensive positions below the hill from which the sniper fire was 
coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're all over the place,'' one soldier said. ``They're  
drunks with guns and grenades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanian teen-agers scrambled about, helping the Germans  
locate sniper positions. One boy told the soldiers he had seen Serb 
snipers hiding in a Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the firefight, arriving German soldiers got a taste  
of Prizren's ethnic tensions. Although initially basking in the 
cheers of a flower-bearing crowd, they quickly had to break up an 
angry confrontation between ethnic Albanians and departing Serb 
militiamen. 
</P>
<P>
	The residents threw stones at some Serb militia vehicles, kicked  
at them and cursed. Serbs aimed their weapons at the Albanians, but 
did not shoot. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,000 German soldiers with tanks and other armored  
vehicles were expected to be in the city 55 miles southwest of the 
provincial capital, Pristina, by nightfall. The German forces in 
and around Prizren eventually are to number 8,500 -- post-war 
Germany's largest foreign military deployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping the lid on ethnic tensions and creating safe conditions  
for refugees to return could prove a difficult task for the 
Germans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Prizren area holds some of the Serbian Orthodox Church's  
most cherished sites and some people fear ethnic Albanians might 
vandalize the buildings in retaliation for abuses by Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Church leaders called Sunday for protection of Serb clergy  
remaining in Prizren, the independent Beta news agency reported. It 
said a Serb clergyman was attacked in Ljubizda, a village near 
Prizren. 
</P>
<P>
	As they entered Kosovo from Albania early in the day, the German  
units passed through a heavily vandalized Yugoslav customs post 
where looters had taken nearly everything they could carry -- from 
tables to toilets. 
</P>
<P>
	On the 11-mile road from the border to Prizren, almost no  
residents were seen although the troops passed 200 to 300 Serbian 
soldiers who were withdrawing, many of them appearing downcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of concrete anti-tank barriers were strewn along the  
roadside and bomb craters and two ruined buses offered signs of the 
recently ended fighting in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	The villages en route appeared to be deserted, many of the  
houses apparently abandoned even as they were being built.

<HEADLINE> Expansion Prompts Worker Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unemployment and inflation are at their lowest  
in three decades, two economic facts that have helped cause the 
worker shortage now plaguing American businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Why is this happening?  
</P>
<P>
	Call it Alan Greenspan's Grand Experiment.  
</P>
<P>
	Inflation has remained docile despite strong economic growth.  
That has prompted Greenspan and his colleagues at the Federal 
Reserve to let the unemployment rate fall far below levels which 
used to trigger rising wage demands. Higher wages are usually a 
major contributor to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Fed feared inflation, it would raise interest rates to  
slow the economy. Because interest rates remain low, economic 
growth has continued at a strong pace, driving the jobless rate 
even lower and making qualified workers more difficult to find. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, America is enjoying 8 1/2-years of uninterrupted economic  
growth -- the longest stretch in peacetime history. Long periods of 
growth push the unemployment rate still lower as employers search 
harder to fill new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists still believe there is a threshold of employment  
where workers become so scarce that their demands for higher pay 
will finally spur inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	But they now admit this threshold is far below the 6 percent  
unemployment rate they once agreed on. Why this has occurred is the 
subject of heated debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic optimists believe there's been a fundamental change in  
the U.S. economy because of the billions of dollars businesses have 
spent on computers and other productivity-enhancing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Productivity -- the amount of output per hour of work -- has been  
rising over the past three years at close to a 2 percent average 
rate. Higher productivity means employers can pay workers more 
without raising the cost of their products. 
</P>
<P>
	Pessimists believe that the increase in productivity so far has  
been too small to really influence inflation much. They credit the 
combination of extremely low inflation and high employment to a 
host of temporary factors. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of these factors relate to recessions in Asia and other  
regions which have rewarded American consumers with falling prices 
for a variety of imported goods -- everything from gasoline to 
autos. 
</P>
<P>
	There are signs that good news is coming to an end. Consumer  
prices took a big upward leap in April and financial markets are 
bracing for the Fed to start raising interest rates, which will 
slow the economy and send unemployment higher. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the betting at present is that the Fed will be able to  
accomplish a soft-landing, in which the economy will slow enough to 
keep inflation under control but not enough to cause a recession. 
That feat was last accomplished in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Analysts Expect Tight Credit Policy / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If the Federal Reserve takes a step to tighten  
its credit policy later this month, it won't catch anybody on Wall 
Street by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the Fed embarks on a sustained strategy of pushing  
interest rates higher over the next several months, that might be a 
different story. 
</P>
<P>
	As the yield on long-term Treasury bonds climbed above 6 percent  
last week for the first time in more than a year, analysts on the 
Street said it was an odds-on bet that the Fed would opt for higher 
short-term rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``By now, U.S. credit markets are pricing in a near certainty  
that the Fed will raise interest rates by 25 basis points (or 
hundredths of a percentage point) on June 30,'' said Dan Bernstein 
at the Westport, Conn., money-management firm of Bridgewater 
Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein pointed out that a July futures contract for federal  
funds, or overnight loans between banks, recently traded at just 
under 5 percent, nearly a quarter-point more than the Fed's current 
target of 4.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Although rising rates have prompted some sporadic selling in the  
stock market in recent weeks, most analysts argue that there isn't 
any cause for alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a rate hike, investors should not be overly  
concerned,'' says Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at the St. 
Louis-based brokerage firm of Edward Jones. ``Historically, the 
stock market on average has been higher after one or two rate 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``The greatest risk to the market is a Fed that waits too long  
to kill the inflation threat, then is forced to follow through with 
multiple rate hikes in an effort to play catch-up. Once the 
inflation beast has escaped, it takes considerably more effort to 
corral it and kill it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Hoey, chief economist and research director at the  
Dreyfus Corp., the big New York money management firm, says he 
distinguishes between ``full stop'' Fed tightenings designed to 
rein in a runaway economy, and ``tap-on-the-brakes'' tightenings 
intended more as precautionary measures. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I think we'll see is a tap-on-the-brakes tightening --  
nothing too dramatic,'' Hoey said at a meeting with reporters last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the world economy, the news is relatively good. The  
prospects are for a sustainable world expansion.'' In the United 
States, he added, ``it is probable that the cyclical lows in 
inflation have already occurred. However, the coming inflation 
cycle is likely to be relatively mild.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From this kind of talk, it's evident that Wall Streeters don't  
want to see persistent bad news on inflation AFTER the Fed has 
taken steps to tighten credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks have kept their bull market going even as rates on  
30-year Treasury bonds have climbed from about 4.7 percent last 
October to 6 percent now. Very few analysts, though, are looking 
for any significant further increase in long-term rates. So further 
pressure on the bond market could spell trouble for stocks as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Lavery, a consultant to Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., says a move to  
tighter credit is likely ``not because the Fed believes that any 
meaningful cyclical re-escalation of inflation is a prospect, but 
in order to maintain credibility in the eyes of the ultimate 
policeman of the financial markets, the bond market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Concludes Skrainka: ``We continue to believe that there are  
powerful forces keeping inflation in check: Strong labor 
productivity and an abundance of almost everything with the 
exception of labor. 
</P>
<P>
	``With very few inflationary pressures in the pipeline, the Fed  
is unlikely to engage in a series of rate hikes. A more likely 
scenario is one little tap on the brakes, just to make sure the 
economy does not travel at an unsafe speed.''

	Albright: Serb Withdrawal Going Well  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says the  
Serb military withdrawal from Kosovo is going smoothly. Albright 
said that already some 11,000 Serbian troops and police had left 
Kosovo and that 35 percent of their armored vehicles are out, as 
are 15 percent of their tanks. NATO has estimated there were about 
40,000 Serb troops in Kosovo when the alliance suspended its 
airstrikes last Thursday. Albright also said she was confident that 
differences with Russia over the surprise entry of Russian troops 
ahead of NATO peacekeepers would be worked out.

	1st Big U.S. Unit Enters Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The first big unit of U.S. Army  
troops has entered Kosovo from Macedonia. The Pentagon says several 
hundred soldiers in tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles are heading 
north toward the capital of Pristina. About 1,000 Marines are also 
set to enter Kosovo. In eastern Pristina, NATO soldiers in several 
armored personnel carriers were trying to work their way around 
roadblocks set up by Serbs near the suburb of Sofali. After being 
turned away at two roadblocks, the British troops were trying to 
get in through a back road. Meanwhile, there are reports of Serb 
forces setting ethnic Albanian houses afire as they retreat ahead 
of advancing NATO troops.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States is dispatching an envoy to  
China in hopes of repairing relations damaged by NATO's accidental 
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia. Chinese officials 
have demanded a full accounting of the incident and want those 
responsible punished. Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering will 
lead a team of administration officials departing tomorrow for 
Beijing. Other matters have chilled ties, including allegations of 
Chinese theft of U.S. nuclear secrets.

	India Claims Capture of Kashmir Peak  
</P>
<P>
	DRAS, India (AP) -- Indian troops captured a key mountain peak in  
Kashmir from guerrillas today, officials said, following an 
all-night battle that began as India and Pakistan ended 
unsuccessful talks to end the fighting. The summit of Tololing Peak 
is near a cease-fire line with Pakistan and overlooks Indian's 
northern highway. That capture and what officers said was the 
anticipated seizure of a nearby peak would help secure a vulnerable 
stretch of Indian highway that has been under constant bombardment 
from artillery units inside of Pakistan. India blames the month-old 
hostilities on Pakistan, accusing it of sending hundreds of 
soldiers and mercenaries over the cease-fire line that divides the 
Himalayan territory between the two powers.

<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Pope John Paul II returned in triumph  
today to the square where he began his crusade against communism 20 
years ago, telling 1 million of his countrymen that God had 
answered their prayers. The 79-year-old pontiff looked and sounded 
tired. His words in 1979 became a rallying cry against repression, 
inspiring the Solidarity movement that toppled communism 10 years 
later. During the Mass, the pope beatified 108 Poles killed during 
World War II, the latest in a series of Poles honored as martyrs 
during the trip.

	MIAMI (AP) -- Tropical Storm Arlene, the first of the season,  
built to 60 mph winds today and experts said it could strengthen 
even more as it spins deep in the Atlantic. A forecaster said the 
storm might threaten Bermuda at some point. At 11 a.m. EDT, 
Arlene's center was near 29.2 north latitude and 58.4 west 
longitude, or about 430 miles southeast of Bermuda and 1,100 miles 
from the mid-Atlantic coast. Storm-force winds of 39 mph extended 
up to 115 miles from the center, which was drifting northwest near 
2 mph.

	GOLD COAST, Australia (AP) -- Forty-nine year-old Joe Bugner won  
what he said was the final fight of 32-year career today when 
American Levi Billups was disqualified for repeated low blows in 
the ninth round. Bugner twice went the distance with Muhammad Ali, 
once in a world title fight in 1975. He won the British, European, 
Commonwealth, Australian and the World Boxing Federation 
heavyweight titles at various times in his career. Bugner's record 
is listed at 69 victories, 13 losses and a draw.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Honors Ford's Theatre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tap dancing, gospel, country music, jazz and  
an operatic version of the ``Battle Hymn of the Republic'' were on 
the bill for President Clinton Sunday night at the taping of a 
television special honoring Ford's Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
	The performers, the president and his wife, Hillary Rodham  
Clinton, came together to honor the theater at which President 
Lincoln spent many enjoyable nights during the Civil War and where 
he was assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's Theatre, Clinton said, ``is a profoundly important part  
of our history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it always is at Ford's, the box in which Lincoln and his  
party were seated the night of his assassination in April 1865 was 
draped with flags and bunting. 
</P>
<P>
	The gala is the 20th television tribute to Ford's, which  
reopened as a theater in 1968 after being used for other purposes 
for 103 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Performers included a 13-year-old Welsh soprano, Charlotte  
Church, who sang ``Amazing Grace''; country-western singer Alan 
Jackson; jazz vocalist Diana Krall and 9-year-old tap dancer 
Cartier Anthony Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyric soprano Kathleen Battle ended the show with a performance  
of the ``Battle Hymn of the Republic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't help thinking when Kathleen Battle came out and  
sang the 'Battle Hymn of the Republic' that it was at this theater 
that Abraham Lincoln kept up his love of music,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that as the Lincoln funeral train crossed the  
country on its way to the late president's home at Springfield, 
Ill. the bands at every stop played the song. 
</P>
<P>
	They understood, he said, that it represented Lincoln's cause  
and his character.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's aides catalogued  
every phone call, every meeting and every note passed between their 
boss and Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin over the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	It's proof, they let reporters know, that their guy commanded

</P>
<P>
	That the Serbs -- nudged by Chernomyrdin, who was nudged by Gore  
-- accepted U.S. demands and retreated from Kosovo is a plus for the 
vice president as he formally launches his campaign this week for 
the top job, Democrats and Republicans agree. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovo crisis, and its potential to erupt into a ground war  
with U.S. casualties, reminded American voters that foreign policy 
counts, ``that the United States is going to be in the business of 
using force overseas and a president is going to have to know how 
to do that,'' said Robert Kagan, a veteran of President Reagan's 
State Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the general perception is that Kosovo was a success, it may  
be perceived that Gore has the experience in leadership around the 
world,'' Kagan said. 
</P>
<P>
	But diplomacy is tricky business, and the Kosovo story -- moving  
to the chapter where nearly 30 nations send armed peacekeepers into 
the volatile province -- is not yet finished. 
</P>
<P>
	It was at his dining room table that Gore laid out for  
Chernomyrdin, the go-between with Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic, the United States' bottom line. The scene won Gore 
credit from President Clinton for keeping fragile U.S.-Russian 
relations ``on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president was eager last week to showcase his prowess  
with the Russians. But, since his daughter's Harvard graduation 
ceremony fell on the day of the Serb retreat, he left the first 
victory lap to Clinton. By the time Gore made his morning-after 
round of network TV interviews, surprise Russian troop movements 
overnight into Serbia robbed him of the chance to strut his 
commander-in-chief stuff. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, the -- we didn't know they were going to go right  
there,'' Gore stammered on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo is perhaps a plus more for the liabilities that it  
diminishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since he's the quasi-incumbent, he won't now be in position to  
have to defend an unpopular war into the winter just as the 
campaign is heating up,'' said Richard Haass, who was a top 
National Security Council official in the Bush administration. 
</P>
<P>
	One top Democratic strategist, demanding anonymity, called  
Kosovo the single most difficult foreign policy issue of the 
Clinton administration and acknowledged that if it had hung around 
for the next 18 months, it could have been ``deadly'' for Gore's 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore's White House staff diligently reported to  
journalists a running ``tick tock'' of the vice president's 
diplomatic work on Kosovo, his campaign aides insisted they were 
above considering the political implications. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just not looking at it in that context,'' said deputy  
campaign chairman Marla Romash. ``If the peace is real and if our 
optimism turns to reality, it's good for America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peace immediately dulled the bite of Republican opponents  
Elizabeth Dole and Arizona Sen. John McCain, who won attention for 
their fledgling campaigns by harshly questioning the Clinton-Gore 
team's resolve to face down Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can argue about whether we should have become involved in  
this conflict and about how we prosecuted the war, but we should 
all agree that our victory is very good news for the United States, 
NATO and for the world,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	All Dole had to say was that Clinton should have been tougher on  
Milosevic from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	With peace, candidates win back the chance to talk about Social  
Security, school safety and the economy -- domestic issues that 
pollsters say will be more decisive in the 2000 race. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain pollster Bill McInturff said that may be the biggest plus  
for Gore. ``If you're the incumbent vice president running for 
office, you want people focusing on what's happening in the country 
because for the most part, people feel things have gone good for 
the past six years,'' he said. ``You don't want them focusing on 
how screwed up things are around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, in announcing his candidacy  
in Iowa on Saturday, touched implicitly what could be the rawest 
remaining foreign-policy nerve for Gore -- allegations of overall 
incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will rebuild our military power because a dangerous world  
still requires a sharpened sword. I will move quickly to defend our 
people and our allies. I will have a foreign policy with a touch of 
iron,'' Bush pledged. 
</P>
<P>
	Potential pitfalls do remain for Gore: a disaster in military  
readiness; another face-off with Saddam Hussein in Iraq; a 
political or financial meltdown in Russia; another flare-up of 
nuclear tensions in South Asia or more damning evidence of letting 
U.S. secrets slip to the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Iraq comes back -- and I don't think Saddam all of a  
sudden gave up building weapons of mass destruction just because we 
stopped paying attention -- and when China remains an issue, a win 
in Kosovo doesn't cancel those out,'' said Kagan.

<HEADLINE> Automakers Mull New Car Materials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pete Peterson remembers all too well how his  
steel industry lost its grip on beverage cans and handed the market 
to aluminum in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	So as auto companies facing tighter environmental standards look  
for ways to make lighter cars that burn less fuel, Peterson is 
determined not to let history repeat itself. 
</P>
<P>
	The competition is fierce as automakers consider a new mix of  
materials in tomorrow's cars. Aluminum bills itself as a lighter 
alternative to steel, forcing steel to spend millions of dollars 
simply to protect its turf. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sat back when the aluminum can came around and thought they  
couldn't possibly succeed,'' said Peterson, head of the auto 
marketing group at U.S. Steel. ``We lost that whole market to them 
because we didn't take the threat seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson oversaw the Pittsburgh steel maker's marketing division  
for can-production products when aluminum began cutting into 
steel's dominance, even though the steel industry thought it had a 
better, cheaper product. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, aluminum is the material used to make virtually  
every can in the United States for beer and carbonated beverages. 
</P>
<P>
	In autos, aluminum has seen its use double in the past decade  
and set a usage record in the 1999 model year. The gains largely 
have been in the engine and other under-the-hood parts, but cars 
with aluminum exteriors have begun emerging. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without sacrificing safety, aluminum allows manufacturers to  
reduce the mass of autos,'' said J. Stephen Larkin, president of 
The Aluminum Association, a Washington-based trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	He said an aluminum car can be 22 percent larger than a steel  
car of the same weight -- an important attribute given motorists' 
growing affinity for large sport utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Audi, Honda and Plymouth are among the manufacturers that have  
introduced aluminum-intensive cars, although those models are 
luxury or specialty cars sold at a premium. 
</P>
<P>
	Costs and the need for different manufacturing and repair  
techniques have held back aluminum's wider usage in cars. Plastics 
and other materials face similar challenges. Steel now has a 55 
percent market share in autos, compared with about 7 percent each 
for aluminum and plastics. 
</P>
<P>
	To prevent a recurrence of the erosion that took place with  
cans, the steel industry has spent more than $20 million over the 
past half-decade to develop a new steel auto body that is 25 
percent lighter than the typical body. The new frame uses 
higher-strength steel and new manufacturing techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry is working to lighten other auto parts as well,  
effectively raising the standards that competing materials will 
have to meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to be outdone, aluminum companies this month announced a  
joint venture with the nation's biggest automakers to find ways to 
cut costs and improve manufacturing techniques, thereby cutting 
into steel's incumbency advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a real horse race,'' said David Cole,  
director of the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation 
at the University of Michigan. ``Just because you're in the cab 
driver's seat now doesn't mean things won't change and you'll be 
the winner forever. The steel industry is running very scared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The research on lighter cars is driven in part by a  
government-industry challenge to develop by 2004 a car that can get 
80 miles from a gallon of gas. Automakers are also preparing for 
future government pollution-control requirements expected to be 
even more restrictive than current standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Autos represent a large market for both steel and aluminum, and  
both industries are fiercely jockeying for an edge even though car 
makers expect future vehicles to contain some mixture of steel and 
aluminum, as well as other materials. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that people tend to think of this as an  
either-or proposition,'' said Chris Terry of the U.S. Council for 
Automotive Research, a partnership of DaimlerChrysler, Ford and 
General Motors. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the number of cars produced each year is growing, all  
materials are likely to gain even if single-car percentages change, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Underscoring the intensity of the rivalry, the aluminum and the  
steel industries have battled in recent weeks through press 
releases, with each claiming environmental benefits over the other. 
</P>
<P>
	The aluminum industry has said that for every pound of aluminum  
use, replacing two pounds of steel in autos, can save 20 pounds of 
carbon dioxide emission over the lifetime of that vehicle. The 
steel industry countered that any savings would not come for 
decades because making aluminum is dirtier than making steel. Each 
industry faulted the assumptions used in the other's studies. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel industry does acknowledge some of aluminum's  
environmental benefits, while the aluminum companies do concede 
their product costs more than steel on a per-pound basis. So both 
industries are working to improve on their advantages. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason why the industry is investing as heavily as it is  
in new designs, new technology and new products is we have got to 
be a moving target,'' said Andrew Sharkey, chief executive of the 
industry trade group, the American Iron and Steel Institute. 
``Steel is the familiar material, and what we're trying to show is 
we've just begun to scratch the surface.''

<P>
	HICKMAN, Ky. (AP) -- A car ran off a bridge and landed  
upside-down in a creek, killing the driver and all four of his 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	State police were investigating what caused the car driven by  
Maurice Tucker, 56, of Hickman, to crash Saturday, said dispatcher 
Heather Fagan. 
</P>

	Officials said the car apparently ran up a concrete guide before  
falling at least 15 feet into the creek and landing upside-down in 
5 to 6 feet of water.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Drop Nearly 3 Cents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gasoline prices dropped nearly 3 cents  
per gallon nationwide in the past three weeks, but the decline 
might stall if crude oil prices continue to rise, an industry 
analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
	The national weighted average, including all grades with taxes,  
was $1.1902 per gallon Friday, down 2.78 cents from the previously 
survey on May 21, Trilby Lundberg, publisher of the Lundberg Survey 
of 10,000 stations across the country, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A good supply of domestic crude has helped shield American  
motorists from price hikes by OPEC and other oil-producing 
countries. But if crude prices continue to rise, U.S. pump prices 
might level off during the summer driving season, Ms. Lundberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gas prices dropped for 1 1/2 years until bottoming out in  
mid-February, when the average for all grades was 99.8 cents per 
gallon. That was followed by a hikes in the spring before prices 
topped out at an average of $1.2337 in early May. 
</P>
<P>
	At self-service pumps, the average for regular unleaded on  
Friday was $1.1320, mid-grade averaged $1.2333 and premium $1.3183. 
</P>
<P>
	For full-service, the average was $1.5159 for regular, $1.6031  
for mid-grade and $1.6771 for premium.

<P>
	BROOKLYN, Mich. (AP) -- Steve Park picked up where he left off  
last year at Michigan Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	In August 1998, the Northport, N.Y. driver recorded his best  
career finish during the Pepsi 400 -- 11th place. On Sunday, Park 
bettered that with a sixth-place showing in the Kmart 400. That 
even beat team owner Dale Earnhardt's 16th-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were trying to get a top-10 finish and we almost got a  
top-five finish,'' Park said. ``We were catching up there at the 
end. If we'd had a couple of more pit stops we probably would have 
been a lot better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Park, who started from the 10th position, said his team has  
improved since adding Paul Andrews as crew chief. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole deal has been different the last four or five  
weeks,'' he said. ``We've had good ingredients with people and cars 
and motors to run well. But we just didn't have the leader to lead 
this team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Its just real nice to be able to go to a Winston Cup race and  
qualify 10th and be able to advance your position and finish sixth. 
I'm really looking forward to the rest of the season now.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ROLLING ROOKIE*: Rookie Tony Stewart turned in one of his most  
impressive driving performances of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting from the 28th position, Stewart weaved his way to ninth  
place. It was his fifth top-10 finish in his last six races. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a top-10 finish and I should be happy with that, but we  
gave up a couple of positions,'' Stewart said. ``We didn't get all 
the fuel in on our last stop and I had to feather the throttle 
during the entire last run. I think we could have beaten a couple 
of guys if I had been able to go full throttle. I ran out just as 
(race-winner Dale) Jarrett captured the checkered flag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A top-10 finish appeared to only be a dream early in the race  
when Geoffrey Bodine and Stewart made contact in Turn 4, causing 
damage to Stewart's right front. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could tell the car wasn't as good after that,'' Stewart  
said. ``I don't know what the deal was.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LONE NON-SURVIVOR*: The lone driver to not finish the race was  
Jimmy Spencer, who was forced out with engine problems after 
completing 159 laps. 
</P>
<P>
	``It blew up real early,'' Spencer said of the motor.  
``Something happened to it real early in the race and we just kept 
riding around trying to get all we could get. It was missing when 
they dropped the green flag, so it evidently gave way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer has failed to finish in five of 14 races this season.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HOPES SEVERED*: Bill Elliott's chance at victory were dashed by  
some debris scattered on the track. 
</P>
<P>
	While running in sixth place on lap 168, some debris on the race  
track came through the bottom of Elliott's car and broke his oil 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we broke an oil line underneath the front,'' said  
Elliott, who finished 41st. ``It just started smoking. We had a 
good car. 
</P>
<P>
	``We needed to be a little bit better, but Jarrett was just  
awesome. We weren't bad compared to (Jeff) Gordon and the rest of 
the guys, but man, it's heartbreaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott led from laps 22 to 24 and laps 26 to 28. Each time he  
gave up the lead to Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PIT STOPS*: A crowd estimated at a record 160,000 watched  
Sunday's race. ... Five Pontiacs finished in the top 10 -- Ward 
Burton, Bobby Labonte, Ernie Irvan, John Andretti and Stewart. ... 
Darrell Morrow, a crewman for Mark Martin, fell to the ground after 
being hit by an air wrench during an unscheduled pit stop. He 
refused medical treatment and continued with his duties.

<HEADLINE> Bangor Jail Holds Hostile Travelers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGOR, Maine (AP) -- It sounds like a bad joke: An international  
traveler has a few too many drinks on the plane, causes a ruckus 
and wakes up in a jail cell -- in Bangor, Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	But three Brits currently housed in the county jail aren't  
laughing. As air rage increases, more and more trans-Atlantic 
pilots are making pit stops here to drop off unruly passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like being chucked off the bus,'' says Jeff Russell,  
marketing director at the Bangor International Airport. ``I'm sure 
it's an unpleasant surprise to wake up in Bangor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The airport embraces its role of taking menacing passengers out  
of the friendly skies. 
</P>
<P>
	In an average year, eight to 12 planes divert to Bangor to drop  
off belligerent passengers, like an Italian tourist who assaulted a 
flight attendant last spring when she told him he couldn't smoke in 
the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	About 25 percent of landings are by pilots who never planned on  
coming here but land for mechanical malfunctions or medical and 
refueling emergencies. They take advantage of the runway at this 
former Air Force base, which at 11,439 feet is long enough to 
accommodate the space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of nasty passengers seems to be growing.  
</P>
<P>
	In the last five weeks, three British men have ended their  
travels in Bangor after acting up in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Neal, a 25-year-old from Milton Keynes, England, woke up  
in the Penobscot County Jail after smashing video equipment and a 
Plexiglass interior window on his May 3 flight from Florida to 
England. 
</P>
<P>
	He was so drunk that he doesn't remember breaking the window or  
telling fellow passengers he hoped they would ``get sucked out and 
die,'' his lawyer says. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal pleaded guilty in federal court to interfering with a  
flight crew. In state court, he pleaded guilty to disorderly 
conduct and failure to submit to arrest. He was sentenced to 60 
days in jail and ordered to pay $28,875 restitution to Airtours 
International. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 5, two Delta Air Lines flight attendants were treated at  
a Bangor hospital after Christopher Bayes, 41, of Manchester 
attacked them for refusing to give him more alcohol on his flight 
from Atlanta to England. 
</P>
<P>
	After a bloody clash, the flight attendants tied Bayes up with  
linen napkins from first class and sat on him until they reached 
the gate. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayes was charged with assault, interference with a flight crew  
and causing an aircraft to make an unscheduled landing. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third case, Shabiyah Negus Davidson, 18, of West  
Midlands, England, went berserk May 26 and grabbed a female 
passenger by the throat on his flight from Jamaica to Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said he lost control after ingesting a potentially lethal  
dose of cocaine he was smuggling in a swallowed plastic bag. 
Davidson was charged with assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three in a month is getting to be a little much,'' says FBI  
Special Agent Paul Palumbo, who handles the air rage incidents with 
a partner. ``We have to go out in the middle of the night and meet 
the plane, which is no fun. Once or twice a year would be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The inconvenience is shared by passengers who are delayed and  
airlines that lose thousands of dollars. For landing fees and 
services, Bangor International collects up to $5,000 on each flight 
diverted here, Russell says. 
</P>
<P>
	Cynthia Kain, spokeswoman for the Association of Flight  
Attendants in Washington, says air rage is a growing problem. 
``Imagine going to work with the expectation that you might be 
screamed at, hit or kicked while doing your job,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	The union is supporting proposed legislation in Congress that  
would ban offenders from air travel for a year and raise the 
penalty for interfering with a flight crew from $1,100 to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta Air Lines, which diverted Flight 064 to drop Bayes in  
Bangor, has no tolerance for unruly passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are going to be put on the ground and when the door opens  
the law is there waiting for you,'' says spokesman Bill Barry in 
Atlanta. ``We make it clear that if you are going to be one of 
those very few abusive passengers, you will face the full penalty 
of the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics compiled by government agencies indicate that 25  
percent of air rage incidents involve alcohol; 16 percent, disputes 
over seating assignments; 10 percent, smokers who can't light up; 9 
percent, carry-on luggage; 8 percent, problems with flight 
attendants; and 5 percent, food. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bangor, home to horror writer Stephen King and a 31-foot  
statue of Paul Bunyan, is happy to welcome these hostile passengers 
and the planes that drop them off. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people come off the airplane and say 'Bangor  
where?''' Russell says. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do become the butt of the joke, but look who's laughing  
now.''

<HEADLINE> Starr To Continue Clinton Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prosecutor Kenneth Starr said Sunday he has no  
choice but to keep investigating the Clintons, a course that could 
collide with the 2000 presidential election campaign and a possible 
Senate run by the first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said he regards the coming criminal trial of Clinton  
friend Webster Hubbell -- based on an indictment that refers 36 
times to Hillary Rodham Clinton -- as an important step in the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking forward to a trial this summer, that's what  
we're preparing for right now,'' Starr said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Sunday, The Washington Post reported in a book excerpt that  
President Clinton's lawyer, William Bennett, was suspicious of 
Clinton's denials of extramarital relationships and warned him 
bluntly to tell the truth in the Paula Jones case or ``your 
political enemies will eat you alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said his investigation unavoidably has been prolonged  
because he has run into incomplete cooperation in many instances. 
</P>
<P>
	``For my part, I just wish we had had full cooperation from the  
outset,'' Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton White House has gone to court to challenge Starr on  
many aspects of his nearly five-year investigation. In addition, 
Hubbell and other witnesses have not provided Starr with answers to 
key questions he is investigating, such as the role of Mrs. 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, witnesses such as Clinton Whitewater partner Susan  
McDougal refused to testify to a grand jury in 1996 and 1998. 
Jurors deadlocked at Mrs. McDougal's recent obstruction and 
contempt trial, and Starr has abandoned the case against her. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize that we need to move forward promptly,'' Starr  
said, but ``some things are entirely out of my control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Mrs. Clinton's possible Senate bid from New York  
was affecting his office's decision-making, Starr said, ``We strive 
mightily while providing public information, public education, to 
divorce our decisions from politics whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said he ultimately will file a final report on his  
investigation, as mandated by the independent counsel statute 
expiring this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made no decisions with respect to the specific  
contents of the report,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office will prosecute Hubbell in federal court starting  
Aug. 9 on charges of concealing his and Mrs. Clinton's legal work 
on a fraudulent Arkansas land deal. The 1,050-acre development 
called Castle Grande contributed to the financial collapse of the 
S&AMP;L owned by the Clintons' Whitewater partners. 
</P>
<P>
	The work that Hubbell and Mrs. Clinton did on the project was  
not revealed until Mrs. Clinton's billing records turned up in the 
White House family residence in 1996 under still-unexplained 
circumstances. Prosecutors had been looking for the documents since 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The case could be postponed further if Hubbell seeks court  
appeals on legal issues. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate case, Hubbell is charged by Starr's office with  
tax evasion on hundreds of thousands of dollars in income, some of 
it in payments arranged by friends of the president when Hubbell 
was under investigation by Starr's office in 1994. That case is on 
hold pending a federal appeals court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's TV appearance coincided with the publication of excerpts  
from a new book that says in the days before Clinton was questioned 
in the Jones case, the president's lawyer thought his client's 
``Achilles' heel'' was not Monica Lewinsky, but rather an Arkansas 
woman. The woman had met Clinton four times in less than three 
months between his 1992 election and 1993 inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
	The book by Post reporter Bob Woodward says Bennett told Clinton  
in preparation for his civil case testimony on Jan. 17, 1998, that 
``your political enemies will eat you alive if there's anything in 
that deposition that isn't truthful. ... You are dead. You are 
dead!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I hear you,'' Clinton is said to have replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Woodward's book, ``Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of  
Watergate,'' says Clinton denied to his lawyer that he'd had 
relationships with a list of women. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Bennett was said to have joked: ``After this case  
is over, your reputation as a womanizer may go down the drain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another reported conversation in preparation for the  
president's testimony in the Jones case, Bennett told Clinton, ``If 
you're caught ... in the White House, I'm not good enough to help 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a prison,'' Clinton is said to have replied. ``I  
purposefully have no drapes on the windows.'' As for women, ``I'm 
retired, I'm retired,'' Clinton told Bennett, according to the 
book. Clinton was later impeached but survived the attempt to 
remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett did not immediately return a call Sunday and the White  
House offered no immediate comment.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Judge Speaks His Mind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, a man once  
bewildered by a courtroom demonstration on downloading software, is 
proving a quick study on the technical jargon of the Microsoft 
trial -- and a short fuse with some of the legal arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the antitrust trial began in October, Jackson has flashed  
anger at lawyers and witnesses, laughed openly at videotape showing 
Microsoft chief Bill Gates ducking questions from the government 
and secretly arm-twisted both sides to negotiate a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has struggled to remain awake on occasion, appearing to  
doze during dull testimony in the warmth of the crowded courtroom 
after lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Musing aloud, the federal judge wondered at one point whether  
Microsoft products were being priced low as cigarettes might be -- 
to hook consumers and reap higher profits in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	When an economist testifying for Microsoft asserted ``there  
isn't any evidence of that kind of addiction'' with products such 
as Windows, Jackson answered, ``Do you have kids?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He will sometimes take over questioning a witness, forcing  
lawyers to wait quietly. He was obviously proud when it was clear 
he had grasped the concept of computer ``intranets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his progress on the intimidating minutiae of the  
high-tech world, a clash of legal and computer cultures is apparent 
in the trial: He almost never hears testimony before 10 a.m. and 
ends the day before 5 p.m., in contrast to hours kept by technology 
workers -- one e-mail from a top executive cited as evidence was 
time-stamped 3:01 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	He is fond of sailing on weekends.  
</P>
<P>
	Even before his verdict, expected later this year, Jackson is  
making a mark on the industry he is judging. 
</P>
<P>
	His comments during the trial have been known to sway the stock  
market, such as when he described America Online's purchase of 
Netscape Corp. as possibly a ``very significant change in the 
playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the trial resumes this week, Microsoft will question David  
Colburn, an AOL executive, about the $10 billion purchase of rival 
Netscape. Netscape is the Internet software company presented as 
the most prominent victim of Microsoft's alleged aggression toward 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft argues the deal illustrates competition is  
sufficiently robust in the high-tech industry that federal 
intervention is not required. 
</P>
<P>
	The government argues Microsoft's interest in AOL's purchase is  
a sideshow. But the judge at least suggested otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said his first impression was that the deal ``could very  
well have some immediate effect'' on issues argued at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is thirsting for signals that the judge might think  
important,'' said Daniel Wall, a San Francisco antitrust lawyer. 
``This wasn't a signal -- he shot up a flare so you couldn't miss 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Ousted IOC Official Details Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An IOC official ousted in the bribery scandal  
involving Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter 
Olympics insists that gifts and favors he received never influenced 
his vote, the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Agustin Arroyo, an attorney and former diplomat from Ecudaor who  
left the IOC in disgrace because of the allegations, said he 
regarded favors by Tom Welch, who headed Salt Lake City's winning 
bid, were gestures of personal generosity. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Tom, it was always with an embrace,'' said Arroyo, the  
first ousted IOC official to detail his side of the story to a U.S. 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1991 visit to Utah -- not gifts or favors -- prompted him to  
vote for Salt Lake City for the 1998 Winter Games, Arroyo said. 
However, that bid was won by Nagano, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	After learning that Salt Lake was going to try again for the  
2002 Games, Arroyo said it was impossible to influence him because 
he already believed the Salt Lake area was the best candidate for 
the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``You try to bribe a person who is either undecided or is for  
someone else,'' said Arroyo, 75. ``Do you believe that during the 
second bid Salt Lake City needed to bribe a person that in the 
first bid ... voted for Salt Lake City?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arroyo, the son of a former president of Ecuador, also said he  
has never seen some of the gifts that investigators say he received 
from SLOC officials, including a $3,000 cashier's check. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a spreadsheet prepared by investigators and  
obtained by the Times, the Salt Lake bid committee spent $33,569 in 
expenses to woo Arroyo and his family, including a $475 ruby pin 
and a $5,077 payment to allow his wife to accompany him to Budapest 
for an IOC trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the biggest expenses was a ``scholarship'' for  
stepdaughter Nancy Rignault de Chezeuil, who was in her 40s and not 
in school at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Arroyo met Welch in 1989, when Salt Lake City was bidding for  
the 1998 games at a convention in Puerto Rico. The two men and 
their wives, as well as some of their grown children, became good 
friends, Arroyo said. 
</P>
<P>
	After he was appointed to the IOC at the Mexico City Summer  
Games in 1968, he said he was drawn into a culture of gift-giving 
and lavish perks that were treated as tokens of friendship. 
</P>
<P>
	Arroyo's claims of innocence were merely excuses, said Dick  
Pound, the IOC vice president who headed the commission this year 
that recommended the expulsions of Arroyo and five other IOC 
executive board members. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commission and the executive board were collectively  
satisfied that Arroyo's was a case that called for the action that 
was taken,'' Pound said.

<HEADLINE>  Twins' Hawkins Leaves Game </HEADLINE>

<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Minnesota's LaTroy Hawkins was hit by a hard  
one-hopper from Jeromy Burnitz in the first inning and had to leave 
the Twins' game against the Milwaukee Brewers on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Twins ahead 1-0, Jeff Cirillo singled with two outs in  
the bottom of the first. Burnitz followed with a wicked shot which 
nailed Hawkins just below the knee cap on his left leg. Cirillo 
advanced to third as the balled rolled toward the Brewers' dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawkins took a few steps toward first, but then fell to the  
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Benj Sampson relieved Hawkins who limped off the field with help  
from manager Tom Kelly and the trainer.

<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Every time the Miami Hurricanes go to the  
interview room, their bilingual side comes out. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Del Castillo of WFBA Radio in Miami does play-by-play of  
the games in Spanish for listeners back in South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hispanics love baseball,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	During both of the Hurricanes' post-game news conferences, Del  
Castillo has asked questions in English, repeated them in Spanish 
and received answers in both languages. 
</P>
<P>
	After Miami beat Alabama 8-1, Del Castillo asked right fielder  
Manny Crespo to discuss a seventh-inning bunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Crespo responded in Spanish as pitcher Alex Santos, who speaks  
Portuguese and some Spanish, translated for first baseman Kevin 
Brown. Crespo hesitated briefly before saying his answer again in 
English. 
</P>
<P>
	Del Castillo said he has broadcast baseball on the radio in  
Miami about five years, but this is his first College World Series. 
He said his tapes are used by other Spanish-language television and 
radio stations in the Miami area. 
</P>
<P>
	Crespo, pitcher David Gil and utility player Javier Rodriguez  
are among the Miami players who speak Spanish.

<P>
	 *STREAM FISHING:* If Texas A&AMP;M coach Mark Johnson isn't sitting  
in a dugout or studying a scouting report, he often daydreams of 
dropping a fishing line in a mountain creek. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he relaxes by thinking about his hometown of Las  
Vegas, N.M., a town of 15,600 residents on the east side of the 
Sangre de Cristo mountains in northern New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a beautiful area,'' Johnson said. ``I used to go up  
Gallinas Canyon. I like to stream fish, and I was 20 minutes away 
from that. I love fishing for trout and walking the streams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Aggies play Cal State-Fullerton in an elimination game  
Monday at the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	After this week, Johnson will resume his work as coach of Team  
USA. The collection of college and other amateurs plays this summer 
against the national teams from Japan, Nicaragua and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Another American team, made up of Class AAA pros and players  
from the 40-man rosters of major-league clubs, will compete at the 
Pan American Games in Canada as baseball follows the trend of 
professionals in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson grew up in Las Vegas, where his father was an  
administrator at New Mexico Highlands University, and became an 
All-WAC outfielder at New Mexico during the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	He broke into coaching as an assistant with the Lobos and moved  
on to Arizona, Mississippi State and Texas A&AMP;M. He worked under two 
of the best-known college coaches: Jerry Kindall in Tucson and Ron 
Polk at MSU. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said bringing the Aggies to Omaha and being named coach  
of the United States team were big honors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an amazing thing for me when I think of being from a  
small town like Las Vegas,'' he said. ``I've been really fortunate 
that things fell right for me. I got around the right people and 
got some good breaks.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RECORD CROWD:* The attendance of 24,859 for the late game  
between Rice and Oklahoma State was a record for a College World 
Series contest. The previous mark of 24,456 came during last year's 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been another good series at the gate. The crowd of 23,302  
for Saturday night's game between Stanford and Cal State-Fullerton 
was the third straight time the Rosenblatt Stadium fans set a 
record for the session. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OUCH, THAT HURTS:* It was bad enough that Alabama lost to  
Miami. Some of the Tide players took a few lumps during the game, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	Brent Boyd was hit on his left thumb by Miami starter Alex  
Santos with two outs in the top of the third. Boyd grabbed his hand 
and fell to the ground, where he stayed for about a minute as 
trainers attended to him. 
</P>
<P>
	He was applauded when he got up and walked to first base. His  
thump appeared swollen but Boyd stayed in the game and even dived 
at a ground ball by Bobby Hill in the bottom of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	With Hill on second later in the inning, shortstop Andy Phillips  
came up limping briefly on a pickoff attempt. Phillips seemed to 
have his leg collapse under his weight as he tried to block the 
bag. Hill was safe on the play. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, in the bottom of the sixth, Phillips took another one  
for the team when Mike Rodriguez slid into second and spiked him in 
the calf. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials reported no serious injuries.  
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THEATER OF DREAMS:* About 400 people, including College World  
Series players, their friends and family members, attended a 
screening of Kevin Costner's new film ``For the Love of the Game'' 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict?  
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty good,'' said Cal State-Fullerton pitcher John  
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Costner, in town for Saturday night's game between the Titans  
and Stanford, also attended the screening at the Oak View Theater. 
He signed autographs for a long line of players and other fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Cal State-Fullerton coach Augie Garrido, who now coaches  
at Texas, plays the manager of the New York Yankees. Fullerton 
coach George Horton said Garrido and Costner are longtime friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Mota, the son of former Los Angeles Dodgers player Manny  
Mota and an infielder on the Titans' 1984 NCAA championship team, 
is cast in the film as shortstop for Costner's team, the Detroit 
Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it was fabulous,'' Horton said.  
</P>
<P>
	Costner plays an aging pitcher who is throwing a perfect game  
against the Yankees. The film is set over the course of the game, 
with flashbacks of a love story and other scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	Horton said Costner fans, especially women, will appreciate key  
locker room and shower scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a Kevin fan, the word will get out,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Costner left Omaha after the screening.

is cast in the film as shortstop for Costner's team, the Detroit 
Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it was fabulous,'' Horton said.  
</P>
<P>
	Costner plays an aging pitcher who is throwing a perfect game  
against the Yankees. The film is set over the course of the game, 
with flashbacks of a love story and other scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	Horton said Costner fans, especially women, will appreciate key  
locker room and shower scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a Kevin fan, the word will get out,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Costner left Omaha after the screening.

<HEADLINE> Wildfire Destroys 17 Homes in Ariz. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITERIVER, Ariz. (AP) -- Crews on Sunday contained a large  
wildfire that destroyed 17 homes and forced 300 people to evacuate 
their homes on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	About 800 air and ground crews Sunday morning formed a  
containment line around the fire that began Friday and quickly 
spread to more than 4,000 acres, said U.S. Forest Service spokesman 
Joe Spehar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the crews are doing mop up,'' Spehar said after the  
fire was declared contained early Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The wind-driven fire, north of Whiteriver and about 130 miles  
northeast of Phoenix, is believed to be human-caused and an 
investigation is pending, Spehar said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire had burned nearly seven square miles of ponderosa pine  
trees and heavy brush, consuming 4,163 acres before it stabilized. 
At one point, the flames stretched more than 400 feet into the air, 
Spehar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody was injured, he said.

<HEADLINE> Exercise Is Limited for Retarded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seth Schroeder used to exercise a lot --  
running, swimming, and playing basketball and racquetball. No 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys at the basketball court won't let you in,'' said  
Schroeder, 25, who has Down syndrome. ``They won't let me play the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Davis, Calif., man and others with mental retardation face  
extra barriers that keep them from getting exercise doctors say 
they may need more than the non-disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even in the quote, normal, population, you have an obesity  
problem, and you put that into a handicapped, mental retardation 
situation, and it's compounded,'' said Dr. Tom Nordstrom, a 
Bridgewater, N.J., orthopedic surgeon whose patients include people 
with cognitive disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Down syndrome's signs include poor muscle tone as  
well as the tendency to be overweight. And people with medical 
conditions that include retardation may have other physical 
problems that can be addressed with exercise. Down syndrome 
patients need movement exercises to fight the arthritis to which 
they are prone, Nordstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
	The most prominent organization supporting exercise among the  
mentally retarded, Special Olympics, concedes the need is far more 
than it can handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We serve about 1.2 million athletes worldwide,'' said Special  
Olympics spokeswoman Charmaine Dittmar at the organization's 
Washington headquarters. ``There are an estimated 169 million 
people worldwide with mental retardation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outreach is part of the problem for Special Olympics -- making  
sure the retarded and their caregivers know about programs in their 
areas, Dittmar said. Another is simply keeping the programs going -- 
arranging for essentials such as funding and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the program culminates in the Special Olympics Summer  
Games, which are expected to draw more than 7,000 athletes from 150 
countries to Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill and Carey, N.C., June 
26-July 4. 
</P>
<P>
	However, although Special Olympics prides itself on working with  
all levels of ability, its focus is on sports-type activities like 
those found in the Olympics. Training is ``obviously geared to a 
specific sport,'' Dittmar said. 
</P>
<P>
	And training to compete in an event is a different goal than  
simply doing exercise to get or stay in shape, or to reduce the 
risk of disease. Federal exercise guidelines call for at least 30 
minutes of moderate activity such as brisk walks, on most days of 
the week, as a way to do this. 
</P>
<P>
	For many of the mentally retarded, regular exercise may only  
require someone to walk with them. But that person may be hard to 
find. Caregivers may not have the time, and volunteers may be too 
few -- if they are available at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder, for instance, did well when he had a volunteer from  
the University of California at Davis helping him, said Schroeder's 
mother, Jane Wyerman. When the student volunteer graduated and 
left, things began to fall apart, she said. ``He's not in any 
formalized program right now as it relates to exercise,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Exercise facilities don't know how to deal with the retarded,  
Wyerman said. It's not a tough job, but health club staffers, for 
instance, are not trained in this, she said. Mentally retarded 
exercisers need help in such things as making sure they don't try 
to lift so much weight that they would injure themselves, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Exercise instructors may be reluctant to take this on, said  
Jamie Elliott, a Davis municipal employee who coordinates 
recreational activities for persons with disabilities. In one case, 
an aerobics instructor refused to take a 27-year-old cognitively 
disabled woman into a class, Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason given was that the woman pounded her feet, and the  
instructor felt this could raise the risk of injury, Elliott said. 
But the instructor offered no evidence of risk and refused to 
consider any adaptations that could reduce the foot-pounding, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And providing regular exercise opportunities could strain  
already-strained programs for people with disabilities. ``My 
program is not focused on exercise activities,'' Elliott said. ``We 
are more recreationally-socially oriented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paradoxically, retarded exercisers may be especially motivated  
to continue workouts because they know it is good for their 
physical condition, said Dr. Bernard Stulberg, a Cleveland 
orthopedic surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the mentally compromised patient may be more  
responsive to doing this and maintaining an exercise regimen,'' 
Stulberg said. What's more, these patients are more likely to stick 
with exercise as a habit, once it has been made a part of their 
lives, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Exercise helped him, Schroeder said. ``It made me lose weight,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a trim, good-looking Down syndrome kid -- and he still  
is, but he put on considerable weight,'' Wyerman said. It's been a 
year and a half since her son did regular exercise, although he 
still runs occasionally, she said. He also still likes sports, and 
would like to play basketball again, Wyerman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, being active improved his mood, Wyerman said. ``Seth is  
a bit of a volatile personality, and if we can send him off to 
shoot some baskets, it usually helps,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> US Suspects Some of Smallpox Weapon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Government officials say Russia, Iraq and North  
Korea are probably concealing the deadly smallpox virus for 
military use, The New York Times reports in Sunday editions. 
</P>
<P>
	A secret federal intelligence assessment was completed late last  
year. It was based on evidence that includes disclosures by a 
senior Soviet defector, blood samples from the North Korean 
soldiers that show smallpox vaccinations and the fairly recent 
manufacture of smallpox vaccine by Iraq, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials told the Times that the assessment was an important  
factor in President Clinton's recent decision to reverse course and 
forgo destruction of American stockpiles of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the United States, only Russia retains openly declared  
stocks of the virus. The intelligence assessment concludes that 
Russia is most likely hiding additional stocks of the virus at 
military sites, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the United States has about 56,000 troops stationed  
near Iraq and North Korea and is periodically bombing Iraq, the 
officials told the newspaper there are appears to be no imminent 
military threat involving the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus that causes smallpox is known as variola. It ravaged  
the globe, killing millions and crippling man survivors. Victims 
had high fever, nausea and a pronounced rash. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States unilaterally renounced germ warfare in 1969  
and lobbied for a 1972 international treaty banning such arms that 
more than 100 countries, including the Soviet Union, signed.

<HEADLINE> Small Booksellers Struggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Founded in 1872, Lauriat's Booksellers survived  
the Great Fire that wiped out most of the city's downtown that 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But 127 years later, Lauriat's couldn't stand the heat from  
Amazon.com, barnesandnoble.com and Borders.com. 
</P>
<P>
	As the venerable chain announced plans to liquidate its stores  
last week, booksellers across New England said they are struggling 
to hang onto customers in an era of instant online gratification 
and giant corporate chains. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eventually there will be one bookstore and that bookstore will  
be called Amazon.com,'' said a glum Joe Porth, assistant manager of 
the Lauriat's in Copley Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, he'll be out of work and shoppers will be out of a  
bookstore. The plaza's other bookshop, Rizzoli Bookstore, announced 
plans to leave weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Porth said he sees little hope for smaller booksellers, even  
regional chains, against the onslaught of megastores -- real and 
virtual. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you find a pharmacy that isn't CVS, a hardware store that  
isn't Home Depot, or a theater that isn't a Sony or a Loews?'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Waterstone's, a popular chain of British bookshops,  
pulled out of the Boston area, closing locations in Faneuil Hall, 
the city's Back Bay neighborhood and the Burlington Mall. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of smaller chain stores like Lauriat's, Waterstone's  
and Rizzoli mirrors the loss of independent booksellers in the 
region over the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Membership in the New England Booksellers Association now hovers  
at 500, down from 535 three years ago, said executive director 
Rusty Drugan. Of those, 225 stores are in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	To make things worse, the American public bought fewer books  
last year, 1.1 billion compared to 1.2 billion in 1997. Plus, 
online bookstores are getting far more attention than they deserve, 
Drugan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All they have is a database that the independents have had  
access to forever,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Independent stores have books that don't even appear on  
Amazon,'' he added, citing local authors and local publishing 
houses he said were passed over by the virtual bookseller. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller booksellers are finally putting up a fight for their  
corner of virtual book business, with powerful outlets in Harvard 
Square leading the way for the independents. 
</P>
<P>
	WordsWorth Books and the Harvard Book Store have launched their  
own Web sites -- wordsworth.com and harvard.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``Real Books. Real Booksellers. Real Bookstore,'' says  
WordsWorth's site in a dig at online competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	But Amazon.com says it is not to blame for driving little  
bookshops out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only since 1997 have we been considered a serious mainstream  
bookstore, and the unfortunate demise of independent bookstores 
began long before that,'' said spokesman Bill Curry in a telephone 
interview from the company's Seattle headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether online or off-line, the people who are going to  
survive are going to best meet customer needs. The independent 
stores that are thriving are doing just that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Willard Williams, co-owner of New Hampshire-based Toadstool  
Bookshops, said cyberspace can best help his operation by marketing 
the pleasures of visiting a bookshop in person. 
</P>
<P>
	``We as bookstores need to continue trying to make our stores  
more interesting places to be ... we need to tailor our selections 
to what people are really interested in,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugan agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't do the independent bookstores any good to tell  
people to buy from them just because they're independent,'' he 
said. ``People need to see the connection with their lives ... 
local bookstores supporting local kids, literacy programs and local 
authors.''

<HEADLINE> Qwest Bids $55B for Telecom Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a bid to be among those still standing after  
a wave of consolidation sweeps the telecommunications industry, 
Qwest Communications International Inc. is making a bold $55 
billion bid to acquire U S West Inc. and Frontier Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The unsolicited bids announced Sunday aim to break up the two  
companies' agreements to be acquired by Global Crossing Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver-based Qwest is the nation's fourth-largest long-distance  
telephone company also offers Internet and data communications 
services to businesses and consumers. The deal would give Qwest a 
piece of the local phone markets in 14 western states with the 
addition of the Denver-based Baby Bell U S West. It would 
strengthen Qwest's long distance business with the addition of 
Rochester, N.Y.-based Frontier, the No. 5 long-distance company, 
which also has local phone, cellular, paging and Internet 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest is offering $78 a share in stock for U S West and $73 a  
share in cash and stock for Frontier. Qwest would sweeten each bid 
by $2 a share if both companies agree to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Both those bids are higher than Global Crossing's offer to pay  
about $63 a share in stock for both U S West and Frontier in 
separate deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing is a Bermuda-based company with plans to link  
the world's continents with high-speed fiber optic cables. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing stock, however, has fallen 16 percent in recent  
weeks as the companies have had a hard time selling investors on 
the benefits of combining their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the clear superiority of our offer to the proposed  
Global Crossing merger, we would like to meet with you and your 
advisors as soon as possible,'' wrote Joseph P. Nacchio, Qwest 
chairman and chief executive officer, in letters to the heads of U 
S West and Frontier. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West and Frontier both said they would review the offers and  
declined to comment further. Officials from Global Crossing 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet is revolutionizing the telecommunications industry  
and is driving a string of merger bids. Companies are hoping that 
the next generation of high-speed Internet technologies will link 
more homes and businesses, providing a wealth of new opportunities 
to sell goods and provide information and entertainment. These 
hopes have prompted telecom and cable companies to make big bets on 
mergers so they can gain the size and market share that will be 
keys to new profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``These new companies like Qwest and Global Crossing are  
building state-of-the-art fiber optic networks which are the key to 
the future of a communications company, but they don't have the 
customers or revenues yet,'' said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent 
telecom analyst. ``On the other hand, companies like U S West and 
Frontier have the older networks but they have the customers and 
revenue. So it's natural for the two of them to get together,'' 
Kagan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, AT&AMP;T Corp. won a bidding war with cable TV company  
Comcast for MediaOne Group Inc., another cable company. AT&AMP;T, the 
nation's largest long distance company, is gambling that television 
cables will also be the way to carry Internet, voice and data 
traffic in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Other telecom companies such as Qwest and U S West are banking  
on an alternative high-speed Internet technology that uses 
traditional telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	If Qwest is successful in its takeover quest, the combined  
company would have revenues of $22 billion in 2000 and serve 31 
million customers. Currently, Qwest has just $2.24 billion in 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest estimates the united company could save as much as $11.1  
billion in operating costs and capital investments, and generate up 
to $3.1 billion in sales as it expands local telephone service as 
well as data and Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a heady undertaking, and not without risks. Global  
Crossing, or another telephone company, could raise the stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We entered this planning to win,'' Nacchio said in an  
interview. ``That will remain unchanged, irrespective of anyone 
else's entering it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Qwest's offer is accepted by U S West, the company's chairman  
and chief executive officer, Solomon D. Trujillo, would be invited 
to become the vice chairman of Qwest. Trujillo and three other U S 
West directors would also be asked to join Qwest's board. 
</P>
<P>
	For Frontier, Qwest is offering two seats on its board,  
including one for Joseph P. Clayton, Frontier's chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors that Qwest was eyeing U S West surfaced last month when  
Global Crossing struck its deal with the Baby Bell. But the 
whispers grew louder last week, and U S West's stock rose 56 1/4 cents 
Friday to $54.87 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange. Qwest's stock 
gained $1 Friday to $44.87 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The tandem bid for Frontier, however, was quite unexpected.  
Frontier's stock closed Friday down 25 cents to $55.43 3/4, also on 
the Big Board.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Mike Colangelo, making his major league  
debut, was hurt in a collision in the outfield Sunday in the 
seventh inning of the Anaheim Angels' game against Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo was taken to UC Irvine Medical Center with a high back  
injury and an injured left wrist, Angels spokesman Tim Mead said. 
Colangelo was talking and able to move his limbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo, playing left, and center fielder Reggie Williams were  
both running full speed for a fly in the gap hit by Steve Finley. 
Williams caught the ball and immediately crashed into Colangelo, 
who lay on the field for about 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Angels trainers tended to Colangelo, who was placed on an  
immobilizing board for precautionary and taken off the field on a 
medical cart. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo, 22, was just called up from Anaheim's Triple-A  
Edmonton farm team and singled in the first inning. He walked and 
grounded out his next two times up. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hitting .362, with 13 runs scored and nine RBIs in 26  
games at Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams remained in the game.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Joe-Max Moore scored in the 88th minute and  
Kasey Keller blocked a first-half penalty kick Sunday, leading the 
United States past Argentina 1-0 in an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, who entered the game as a substitute in the 60th minute

<P>
	Keller made the most critical of his seven saves in the 42nd  
minute after referee Rodrigo Badilla penalized defender C.J. Brown

<HEADLINE> Special Coach Wins Churchill Feature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Special Coach took the lead on the far  
turn and pulled away for a 3 3/4-length victory Sunday over Silver 
Chadra in the $290,500 Jefferson Cup for 3-year-olds at Churchill 
Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Cornelio Velazquez, the 15-1 long shot covered 1 1/8  
miles on the firm turf in 1:49.82 and paid $33, $15 and $8. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Chadra, ridden by Pat Day, laid just off the lead but  
could not gain on the leader and paid $7.60 and $4.60. Air Rocket, 
the 5-2 favorite ridden by Jerry Bailey, finished another 
three-quarters of a length back in third in the field of 12 and 
paid $3.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Special Coach, owned by the Dixon Raysing Stable and trained by  
William March, won for the fourth time in five career starts on the 
grass and second time in three starts this year. The Florida-bred 
son of Zafarrancho collected $180,110 for Sunday's win to increase 
his lifetime earnings to $248,615.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Returns to Site of 1979 Mass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Pope John Paul II returned in triumph  
Sunday to the square where he began his crusade against communism 
20 years ago, telling 1 million of his countrymen that God had 
answered their prayers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 79-year-old pontiff, his head still bandaged from a cut  
received in a fall a day earlier, looked and sounded tired. But his 
words received repeated applause from the attentive crowd, the 
largest since the start of his pilgrimage nine days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The nearly three-hour Mass was held in the former Victory Square  
where -- on his first trip as pope back to his communist homeland in 
1979 -- John Paul ended his homily with a prayer for the Holy Spirit 
to ``renew the face'' of Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	His words became a rallying cry against repression, inspiring  
the Solidarity movement that toppled communism 10 years later. 
</P>
<P>
	``In those difficult times, we asked that his power might be  
poured into the hearts of men and women and that hope might be 
stirred in them,'' John Paul said Sunday. ``Is not all that 
happened at that time in Europe and the world, beginning with our 
own homeland, God's response?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The political, social and economic changes, he said, have  
enabled people and nations ``to see anew the splendor of their own 
dignity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under a giant white dove -- symbolizing the Holy Spirit -- on the  
facade of the Grand Theater, the pope repeated his call for renewal 
to a crowd that included Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek and President 
Aleksander Kwasniewski. 
</P>
<P>
	``We support in prayer all efforts of the authorities aimed at  
the good of the nation,'' the pope said, an apparent reference to 
further measures needed to address high unemployment and other 
painful effects of the transition to a free-market economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before leaving, he invoked the prayer of two decades ago,  
imploring the Holy Spirit ``at the threshold of the third 
millennium'' to ``keep descending and constantly renew the face of 
the earth, of this Polish earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the Mass, the pope beatified 108 Poles killed during  
World War II, the latest in a series of Poles honored as martyrs 
during the trip. They included nuns and priests who helped save 
Jews from the Nazis and seminarians killed at Dachau. 
</P>
<P>
	Two others also were beatified -- Regina Protmann, who began an  
order of nuns in the 16th century devoted to helping the suffering 
and dying, and Edmund Bojanowski, a 19th-century Pole who 
established a congregation of nuns devoted to children and the 
sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Under threatening skies that sprinkled showers once during the  
Mass, more than 350,000 packed the vast square, renamed for World 
War I independence hero Jozef Pilsudski, while hundreds of 
thousands filled nearby streets far from the papal altar. 
</P>
<P>
	About 500 yards away, Zdzislaw Mioduszewski stood with his wife  
and three children, unable to see the pope. ``We could have stayed 
home and watched on television, but we wanted to share the 
experience,'' he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul received three stitches Saturday after slipping at the  
Vatican Embassy in Warsaw. The bandage on his temple was smaller 
Sunday and the pope was able to wear his gold miter again, but the 
Vatican offered no update on his condition. 
</P>
<P>
	His schedule has remained unchanged, with three other events  
planned Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope has walked slowly, using a cane, since a 1994 hip  
replacement. He sometimes slurs his speech and his left hand 
trembles, possible symptoms of Parkinson's disease, a progressive 
neurological disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in the crowd recalled a robust John Paul arriving 20 years  
ago for what they described as a vitalizing experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a great outburst of euphoria at the end,'' said  
Maria Sciegienko, 64. ``Some were clapping, some were crying. It 
was a very special time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 13-day pilgrimage next takes John Paul to Krakow, where he  
studied for the priesthood and served as archbishop before assuming 
the papacy in 1978.

<HEADLINE> TWA, Union Reach Tentative Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Trans World Airlines and its major union  
representing flight attendants, mechanics and other workers reached 
a tentative agreement Sunday on a new contract, possibly averting a 
strike that could have jeopardized the long-struggling company. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Association of Machinists said it would cancel  
the rank-and-file voting that began last week, and then present the 
new contract offer to its members. The union represents 16,000 of 
TWA's 21,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders agreed there would be no work stoppages during the  
monthlong ratification process. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IAM will recommend to our members that they vote `yes' on  
ratification of these revised proposals, which represent a 
significant improvement over previous contract offers from TWA,'' 
union official William O'Driscoll said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA chief executive Bill Compton said employees ``recognizes  
that our employees need the largest raise we can profitably provide 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the new pact will be released Tuesday in Kansas City,  
where the union is based. Workers will begin voting on it on 
Wednesday. The airline is based in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA has survived two trips to bankruptcy court in the 1990s,  
largely because union members have given up salary and other 
benefits to keep the company afloat. The losses have been reduced 
in recent years, but the company has continued to lose money. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Compton warned that TWA ``simply does not have the  
resources to afford a strike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On May 28, TWA presented what it described as its ``last, best  
offer,'' and the rank-and-file had been voting on it even though it 
did not have the approval of union leaders. That deal would have 
brought TWA employees to about 90 percent of the airline industry 
standard by 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The new deal nullifies the previous bid and those earlier votes.  
</P>
<P>
	Compton said the sides continued to talk after the voting had  
begun on the last offer. Meetings on the new proposal began in 
earnest last Tuesday and negotiators worked virtually non-stop 
until Sunday morning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always had an interest in coming up with a package that  
would be endorsed by the Machinists,'' he said. ``It is always 
better to get a deal that is endorsed by both sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The airline's previous offer received little support. Union  
members had also cast ballots on whether to approve limited strikes 
targeting key flights during the Fourth of July weekend, typically 
one of the year's busiest weekends for airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Many union employees had expressed anger at the airline over the  
last proposal, saying they were getting nothing back after years of 
sacrificing wages. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Driscoll said he thought that rancor would dissipate after the  
employees see the latest contract proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers affected by the new offer include flight attendants,  
mechanics, ramp workers and passenger service personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees at the airline's domestic hub at Lambert Airport in  
St. Louis welcomed news of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The airline couldn't afford a strike, and neither could the  
members of the union,'' said Ted Evans, a skycap at Lambert for 24 
years. ``I'm very glad they've got it resolved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TWA suffered last year when baggage handlers, mechanics and ramp  
workers briefly walked off the job, effectively shutting down the 
airline's hub at Lambert Airport in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The union is seeking payback for years of what the airline  
acknowledges were subpar wages and cuts in benefits and retirement 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA hasn't turned a profit in 10 years. In 1998, the airline  
lost almost $5 per paying passenger for every 1,000 miles. Since 
1989, TWA has lost more than $2 billion.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Dallas Stars coach Ken Hitchcock admits  
he's lost control of the locker room. Don't alert the news media -- 
it isn't as bad as it sounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock doesn't say he lost control of his team, he's just  
letting the veterans pass along his message rather than stand up 
and talk to 20 or so players himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you talk to a group of 20 players, there's no impact,''  
Hitchcock said. ``You have to have leaders and let them push the 
message across. If I think there's a problem, I (bring) the 
veterans in and say, `Here's the problem, go solve it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock says it's all part of coaching in the '90s. Hitchcock  
calls himself an ``old-school'' coach who is trying to live with 
the new times. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has become less of Xs and Os, and more of a people  
business,'' Hitchcock said about his relationship with his players. 
``I'm still running drills. Players want a similar routine. (But) 
I'm adapting to compromise.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STAR-CROSSSED:* Miroslav Satan was a 40-goal scorer for the  
Sabres during the season, but has practically disappeared in the 
playoffs with only three goals in nine games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars have been particularly tough on the Sabres' top  
goal-scorer in the finals, holding him to no goals and only one 
assist. Asked if he felt any pressure, Satan said, ``Yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``I tried to respond (Saturday night) the best way I  
can, but right now (the Stars are) backchecking hard. There is not 
too much room; not only me, but the whole team has problems 
creating in their zone. I think that is the key why we only had 12 
shots last night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff is perplexed about Satan's playoff  
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought added ice time might get him going,'' Ruff said.  
``We tried to get him away from a couple of their matchups; tried 
to get him away from a couple of their defensive pairs. We tried 
everything, but we didn't get a lot out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ONE-TEAM MAN: *Does Ken Hitchcock want to coach another team  
other than the Dallas Stars? Not likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to be a one-team coach,'' Hitchcock said. ``I have  
no interest in moving my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock is in his fourth season with the Dallas Stars after  
being hired in the middle of the 1995-96 season. Hitchcock coached 
in Canadian juniors for six years and coach two teams in three 
years in the IHL before joining the Stars. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE:* Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff wasn't worried  
that his team was down 2-1 in the best-of-7 Stanley Cup finals with 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was the best-of-3, I'd be really scared right now,''  
Ruff quipped. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NO MORE MR. NICE GUY:* Mike Modano had three penalties in the  
second period in Dallas' 2-1 victory over Buffalo on Saturday 
night: tripping, slashing and interference. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's Modano, he was gooning it up pretty good,'' Dallas  
coach Ken Hitchcock said, getting a chuckle from the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano is the Stars' all-around best player and known more for  
his scoring than his physical play. 
</P>
<P>
                           	 *--------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WHAT A GUY!:* One Dallas player who impresses Buffalo's Mike  
Peca is impressed with is 39-year-old Guy Carbonneau. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a guy that still has a tremendous amount of energy and  
applies it each and every shift. I think the younger guys are 
always learning from stuff like that, when you get a guy that is 39 
who is still working and doing all the little things.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NOT JUST ANOTHER JOE:* Joe Nieuwendyk has established himself  
as a star of the first order with Dallas in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	His 11 goals are tops and his game-winner in Saturday's 2-1  
victory over Buffalo was his sixth, tying an NHL record set by 
Colorado's Joe Sakic in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Nieuwendyk said his success started early with the Calgary  
Flames. As a 22-year-old, he was part of a Stanley Cup-winning team 
in 1989 and learned good work habits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very fortunate to be on a strong Calgary team,''  
Nieuwendyk said. ``I was taught the value of hard work, of what it 
takes to get to the finals at this level.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SITTING PRETTY:* How pivotal was it for the Dallas Stars to win  
Game 3 on Saturday night and take a 2-1 lead in the finals? 
</P>
<P>
	Only this: Teams that have won the third game of a best-of-7  
series that is tied 1-1 have won the Stanley Cup 17 of 20 times. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THE LAST WORD:* Brett Hull is a doubtful starter for Tuesday  
night's Game 4 of the Stanley Cup finals because of a groin injury, 
and Stars coach Ken Hitchcock was asked if he would possibly be 
behind the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Absolutely not, said Hitchcock.  
</P>
<P>
	``If Hull's not playing, he's not coming on the bench,''  
Hitchcock said. ``Enough is enough, as far as his opinions are 
concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hull is one of the NHL's most opinionated players and is shy  
about sharing his views.

<HEADLINE> Commissions Criticized As Futile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the mad dash for answers after the school  
shooting in Littleton, Colo., lawmakers are proposing everything 
from tougher restrictions on access to guns to school prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	There even are suggestions for a ``study commission'' -- a kind  
of graveyard where policymakers bury problems they cannot, or will 
not, solve themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever name is used -- blue ribbon commission, special task  
force, select advisory panel -- the intent usually is clear, one 
Congress watcher says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beware of the politician who rises to strike a pose of great  
concern about an issue and then recommends a commission,'' says 
Paul Light, director of governmental studies at the Brookings 
Institution. ``That is a sure sign that he or she does not know 
what to do and hopes to postpone the inevitable day that they'll 
actually be called to account.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two recent commissions -- one created by Congress and the other  
by President Clinton -- spent months studying the financially ailing 
Medicare program and the country's racial divide without reaching a 
consensus. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who served on panels that studied  
entitlement programs, the Internal Revenue Service and, this year, 
Medicare, says commissions are useful. 
</P>
<P>
	For one, he says, the way Congress operates -- with two distinct  
legislative chambers and structured committee system -- limits the 
opportunities for lawmakers to work together to tackle a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a small item to bring people together that are of  
different parties, in almost different worlds in the House and 
Senate and allow them to sit for a long period of time,'' Kerrey 
said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the school shooting April 20, the entertainment industry,  
the media and the Internet all have gotten blamed for glorifying 
violence. Many have urged stronger gun restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Further study could not hurt, particularly on an issue where the  
existing research is so ``ideologically tinged,'' Light says. 
Still, he believes commissions generally are not worth much. 
</P>
<P>
	The House is expected Wednesday to begin debating gun control  
and measures to crack down on juvenile crime. The Senate passed a 
juvenile justice bill last month that includes several gun control 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at all levels of government use study commissions,  
often to delay the day of reckoning. But in some cases, they do 
manage to shed light on issues and their recommendations are 
adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional analysts estimate that hundreds of study  
commissions have been created over the years, though precise 
figures are not available. 
</P>
<P>
	Some are effective and memorable.  
</P>
<P>
	The Kerner and Warren commissions -- on 1960s race rioting and  
the assassination of President John F. Kennedy -- are among them. 
Others include the military base closure commissions and, most 
recently, the panel that recommended major IRS reforms that were 
adopted last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A national gambling study commission created by Congress plans  
to release its final report Friday to the White House and Congress, 
with recommendations to slow down new casinos and lotteries 
nationwide, increase to 21 in the minimum betting age and offer 
more help for addicted gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	Most study panels, however, just fade into oblivion.  
</P>
<P>
	``No one knows their name,'' said Marshall Wittman, director of  
congressional relations at the conservative Heritage Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the shooting April 20 in Colorado:  
</P>
<P>
	--President Clinton has ordered a Federal Trade  
Commission-Justice Department study of the marketing practices of 
the movie, recording and video game industries. The Senate-passed 
juvenile justice bill included a similar requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	--Clinton held a White House session on youth violence and  
requested a report on its causes from Surgeon General David 
Satcher. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> German Troops Under Fire in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRIZREN, Yugoslavia (AP) -- German troops came under heavy sniper  
fire Sunday in this southern Kosovo city and killed at least one 
armed man and wounded another in the firefight. A German soldier 
suffered an arm wound. 
</P>
<P>
	The German peacekeepers had been greeted earlier by cheering  
ethnic Albanians when they entered Prizren, Kosovo's second-largest 
city, in Germany's first major military deployment on foreign soil 
since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	As they approached the center of the city on a main street along  
the Bistrica River, sniper fire crackled from a hill and houses. 
German soldiers took cover and began shooting back. 
</P>
<P>
	The Germans' heavy fire blasted a yellow Lada car with two  
occupants. One was slumped dead over the steering wheel and the 
other was badly wounded and screaming for help before he was 
evacuated by German medics. 
</P>
<P>
	German soldiers said that the men shot first and that grenades  
and semi-automatic weapons were found in the car. 
</P>
<P>
	As reporters hid behind vehicles, German soldiers took up  
defensive positions below the hill from which the sniper fire was 
coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're all over the place,'' one soldier said. ``They're  
drunks with guns and grenades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanian teen-agers scrambled about, helping the Germans  
locate sniper positions. One boy told the soldiers he had seen Serb 
snipers hiding in a Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the firefight, arriving German soldiers got a taste  
of Prizren's ethnic tensions. Although initially basking in the 
cheers of a flower-bearing crowd, they quickly had to break up an 
angry confrontation between ethnic Albanians and departing Serb 
militiamen. 
</P>
<P>
	The residents threw stones at some Serb militia vehicles, kicked  
at them and cursed. Serbs aimed their weapons at the Albanians, but 
did not shoot. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,000 German soldiers with tanks and other armored  
vehicles were expected to be in the city 55 miles southwest of the 
provincial capital, Pristina, by nightfall. The German forces in 
and around Prizren eventually are to number 8,500 -- post-war 
Germany's largest foreign military deployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping the lid on ethnic tensions and creating safe conditions  
for refugees to return could prove a difficult task for the 
Germans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Prizren area holds some of the Serbian Orthodox Church's  
most cherished sites and some people fear ethnic Albanians might 
vandalize the buildings in retaliation for abuses by Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Church leaders called Sunday for protection of Serb clergy  
remaining in Prizren, the independent Beta news agency reported. It 
said a Serb clergyman was attacked in Ljubizda, a village near 
Prizren. 
</P>
<P>
	As they entered Kosovo from Albania early in the day, the German  
units passed through a heavily vandalized Yugoslav customs post 
where looters had taken nearly everything they could carry -- from 
tables to toilets. 
</P>
<P>
	On the 11-mile road from the border to Prizren, almost no  
residents were seen although the troops passed 200 to 300 Serbian 
soldiers who were withdrawing, many of them appearing downcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of concrete anti-tank barriers were strewn along the  
roadside and bomb craters and two ruined buses offered signs of the 
recently ended fighting in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	The villages en route appeared to be deserted, many of the  
houses apparently abandoned even as they were being built.

</P>
<P>
	BREMERTON, Wash. (AP) -- John O. Jarstad, a former sports  
announcer, journalist and Tacoma city councilman, died Saturday of 
heart failure and diabetes. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1940s, Jarstad was sports editor of the Bremerton Sun and  
the radio voice of the Bremerton Bluejackets, a minor-league 
baseball team. He later broadcast baseball on TV for the Seattle 
Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League, and he hosted an outdoors 
show on Seattle's KOMO-TV for 13 years in the 1950s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarstad served on the Tacoma City Council in the late 1960s and  
early 1970s, served a term as the city's deputy mayor and made an 
unsuccessful bid for Congress in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarstad is survived by his wife, Barbara, his son, three  
daughters, a brother and two sisters.

<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Jabu Nkosi, a jazz keyboardist  
who played with such luminaries as Miriam Makeba and Harry 
Belafonte, has died of heart failure. He was 46. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunday Times said Nkosi had high blood pressure, diabetes  
and cirrhosis of the liver. It did not say when he died. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of legendary alto sax and clarinet player Zakes Nkosi,  
Jabu Nkosi left school at an early age and began performing jazz 
with friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
	He never learned to read music but amazed fellow musicians with  
his intuitive grasp of harmony and other concepts. Nkosi's keyboard 
style was characterized by his delicacy and ability to improvise. 
</P>
<P>
	Nkosi was frequently hospitalized the last two years, which  
limited his performances and his financial resources. He lived in 
the black township of Alexandra near Johannesburg, unable to afford 
electricity.

<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Carmen Perry, whose translation of a Mexican  
officer's memoir ignited controversy because it described the 
supposed capture and execution of Davy Crockett at the Alamo, died 
Friday. She was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a quarter-century after its publication, ``With Santa  
Anna in Texas: Diary of Jose Enrique de la Pena'' remains the 
subject of debate among historians. 
</P>
<P>
	De la Pena, a lieutenant colonel who served under Mexican Gen.  
Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, described how Crockett and six other 
Alamo defenders were captured alive after the March 1836 battle. 
The account says that on Santa Anna's orders, Crockett and the 
others were stabbed with bayonets and shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditional accounts have the Alamo volunteers fighting to the  
end, sometimes in hand-to-hand combat. Legend holds that Crockett 
wielded his long-rifle, Betsy, like a club before he fell near the 
front doors of the Alamo's chapel. 
</P>
<P>
	After her translation of the diary was published in 1975, Ms.  
Perry received threatening mail and phone calls from people who 
questioned why she was dishonoring the Texas hero. 
</P>
<P>
	Born on July 4, 1905, in Torreon, Mexico, to a Spanish mother  
and German father, Ms. Perry and her two brothers were taught to 
speak German, English, Spanish and Catalan, a dialect of French and 
Spanish spoken in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Perrys fled Mexico at the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution  
and settled in San Antonio. Ms. Perry obtained a master's degree in 
Spanish literature from the University of Texas and became a 
leading translator and researcher at the Daughters of the Republic 
of Texas Library at the Alamo from 1959 to 1968.

<HEADLINE> Report: LA Kings Name Murray Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Andy Murray, an assistant coach for  
three NHL teams, will be the new coach of the Los Angeles Kings, 
the Press-Telegram of Long Beach reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray was attending a coaching clinic in Calgary and could not  
be reached for comment. He, his wife Ruth and their three children 
were expected to come to Los Angeles for a news conference 
scheduled for Monday, an NHL source told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Kings spokesman Mike Altieri refused to comment Sunday, except  
to say the team will announce its new head coach at a noon news 
conference Monday near the site of the unfinished Staples Center, 
which will house the Kings and NBA's Lakers and Clippers beginning 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings fired Larry Robinson in April, just days after the  
team missed the playoffs for the third time in his four years as 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The 48-year-old Murray served on the coaching staffs of three  
NHL teams -- as an assistant with the Philadelphia Flyers in 
1988-1990; the Minnesota North Stars in 1990-91, when they reached 
the Stanley Cup final; and as associate coach of the Winnipeg Jets 
in 1992-1994. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hired as coach of Canada's national team in 1996 and the  
squad had a 77-29-14 record in his two seasons. The team won a gold 
medal at the World Championships in 1997 before Murray left in May 
1998 to spend more time with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past year, Murray has been the hockey coach at  
Shattuck-St. Mary's, a prep school in Faribault, Minn., about 25 
miles south of Minneapolis. Under Murray, the school went 70-9-2 
and won the Midget Triple A USA Hockey national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	John Sumner, Shattuck-St. Mary's athletics director, said he  
knew Murray was offered the job but didn't know whether he 
accepted.

<HEADLINE> Goodyear, Sumitomo Finalize Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. completed an alliance with Japan's  
Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. on Sunday, returning the Akron, 
Ohio company as the world's top tire maker for the first time in 
more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear will pay $936 million to Sumitomo, acquire 10 percent  
of the manufacturer and help form six joint ventures around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo, which has rights to the Dunlop tire brand in major  
world markets, will get a 1.4 percent stake in Goodyear in a stock 
swap valued at $88 million earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance is expected to save $300 million to $360 million  
during the next three years, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Price, a spokesman for Goodyear, said it is too early to  
speculate about whether there will be job cuts, but ``anything 
major is not likely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For consumers, the alliance will mean the Dunlop brand will be  
available in more places, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was announced in February, but final agreements were  
signed Sunday in Tokyo. Joint ventures will begin in September, the 
companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance makes Goodyear a $15 billion player in the $70  
billion tire industry. More consolidation in the industry is 
expected as rivals try to protect their profits amid extra capacity 
and cheap imports from Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	``With SRI's strength in Japan and Europe, and Goodyear's  
reputation in North America and Europe, the alliance will be a 
formidable player in the world tire industry,'' said Sumitomo 
Chairman Naoto Saito. 
</P>
<P>
	Samir Gibara, Goodyear chairman and chief executive officer,  
said the alliance will help the companies compete and provide 
benefits to employees, customers, shareholders and suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Bridgestone Corp. and France's Michelin SA have  
dominated the tire industry for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear has been the world's third-largest automobile tire  
maker, with about 17 percent of the global tire industry. The deal 
gives it about 22 percent of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo, based in Kobe, Japan, is Japan's third-largest tire  
company. It has annual sales of about $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear earned $682 million on $12.6 billion in sales last  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately from Sunday's deal, Goodyear said it is cutting 4,200  
jobs worldwide, or about 4 percent of its 97,000-member work force, 
to save $150 million in expenses annually. Cuts were announced in 
Gadsden, Ala., Freeport, Ill., Europe, Latin America and Goodyear's 
chemical, engineered products and Asia tire divisions.

<HEADLINE> Silver Charm Retires, Becomes Stud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Silver Charm, the 1997 Kentucky Derby and  
Preakness winner who thrilled racing fans with his whisker-thin 
victories and defeats, has been retired after a fourth-place finish 
in a stakes race at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-year-old horse will start a career as a stallion, his  
owners, Bob and Beverly Lewis, said Sunday. Silver Charm retires in 
third place on the thoroughbred career earnings list behind Cigar 
and Skip Away. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's given so much to horse racing and he's performed  
beautifully and given a lot of excitement for all of us,'' Beverly 
Lewis said in an interview from the couple's home in California. 
``The time has come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dappled-gray Silver Charm finished 8 1/2 lengths behind Victory  
Gallop in the Stephen Foster Handicap on Saturday, his fourth 
straight defeat. In his previous start, Silver Charm bled and wound 
up sixth in the March 28 Dubai World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday was his last race,'' Bob Lewis said. ``At its  
conclusion, I just looked at (trainer) Bob Baffert, and he looked 
at me, and we both agreed that retirement time had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came out of the race in great shape, ... and he's going to  
be retired in beautiful condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm ended his career winning half of his 24 starts and  
earned $6,944,369, behind only Cigar's $9,999,815 and Skip Away's 
$9,616,360. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said Silver Charm had bulked up, weighing in excess of  
1,300 pounds, which was affecting his performance on the track. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's really grown into that enormous frame that he has,''  
Lewis said. ``... To get that jump start that he had been able to 
before just took a lot of ability. He wasn't able to go on with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a time when horses tell you whether they want to  
continue to run or not. And I think that time has arrived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Silver Charm became the first horse since Sunday  
Silence in 1989 to win both the Derby and Preakness, the first two 
legs of the Triple Crown. Like Sunday Silence, Silver Charm came up 
short in the Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm failed to hold off Touch Gold over the final eighth  
of a mile and finished second, three-quarters of a length back in 
the seven-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	The gray horse became a favorite of racing fans at Churchill  
Downs, where thousands gathered for his final workout before 
heading to the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has so many fans, it's just unreal,'' Beverly Lewis said.  
``Wherever he goes, he's accepted as a true champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the horse had been training well before the Stephen  
Foster, but didn't have that ``extra punch'' for the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want him to retire with dignity and grace, and that's what  
I think he'll do,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm's victories also included the 1998 Dubai World Cup  
and a dead-heat with Wild Rush in the Kentucky Cup Classic 
Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	He became renowned for his razor-thin finishes at the wire. Only  
twice did Silver Charm win by more than two lengths, and seven of 
his defeats were by a length or less. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just a joy to be associated with,'' Beverly Lewis said.  
``He's given us the time of our lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's the second time this month the Lewises have retired one of  
their champions to what they hope will be a long career as a 
stallion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewises also own Charismatic, this year's Derby and  
Preakness winner who broke down in a third-place finish at the 
Belmont. The colt underwent successful surgery and has been retired 
to a stud career. 
</P>
<P>
	Beverly Lewis said she expected the Florida-bred Silver Charm to  
stand at stud in Kentucky, but that a horse farm had not been 
chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just an awesome horse,'' Bob Lewis said. ``So magnificent  
in appearance and so professional. He looks to be the kind of horse 
that will not only be a great athlete, but go on to become a 
meaningful and outstanding stallion.''

<HEADLINE> Sabres Look To Rebound in Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres admire the Dallas Stars,  
maybe too much. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars have taken a 2-1 lead in the best-of-7 Stanley Cup  
finals, and the Sabres have collected more pointers than points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can learn from them,'' Buffalo center Curtis Brown said  
Sunday, the day after center Joe Nieuwendyk's two goals and the 
Stars' defense conspired to smother the Sabres and quiet the first 
Buffalo crowd to witness a Cup final in 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they do so well is just get the puck through,'' Brown  
said. ``By the time it gets to the net they have traffic there and 
the rebounds pop out. I've seen them score a few that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres saw Dallas do a lot of impressive things at both ends  
of the rink as the Stars made Nieuwendyk's goals stand in a 2-1 win 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The relatively young and inexperienced Sabres watched and  
learned as the Cup finals became a classroom conducted by Stars 
coach Ken Hitchcock and his veteran players. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're the best club in the league defensively,'' Sabres  
coach Lindy Ruff said. ``They don't give up a lot of opportunities. 
Their forwards backchecked as well as any in the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo's power play sputtered and its best players except for  
goaltender Dominik Hasek all but disappeared. Most of the Sabres' 
shots never reached goalie Ed Belfour and only one of them got past 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were the better team, I'm not going to sugar-coat it,''  
Ruff said. ``They played better in their end, they played better in 
our end. They had more scoring chances and their special teams were 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team has faced adversity before. We'll bounce back.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres don't have a lot of room to bounce. Another loss this  
Tuesday would put them in a 3-1 hole with the series shifting to 
Reunion Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to limit their time down low with the puck and try to  
keep it out of our end,'' Sabres defenseman Rhett Warrener said. 
``With Joe Nieuwendyk, if we can give him less room and less time 
with the puck, that's going to be a lot better for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo's lone goal was scored during a delayed penalty call  
against Dallas and broke a scoreless tie in the second period. Fans 
who had waited for a shot at the Cup since Buffalo's six-game loss 
to Philadelphia in 1975 roared. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars smothered the Sabres and their crowd.  
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres could not make their normally potent power play work.  
They came up empty while skating with the extra man eight times and 
managed just one shot in their first five power plays. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars had only two power plays, yet outshot the Sabres 29-12  
in the game. They also blocked 19 attempted shots by Buffalo while 
Belfour was forced to handle just 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't get many power-play opportunities and we need to  
generate some offense there,'' Ruff said. ``They block the shots, 
and the key here is to get the shots through somehow. In the first 
period I think they blocked nine of our shots and that eliminates a 
lot of offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miroslav Satan, the Sabres' leading scorer during the regular  
season who had returned to form after an ankle injury in the first 
round of the playoffs, got off only two shots in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do feel the pressure and I'll try to respond the best way I  
can,'' Satan said. ``But right now there's not too much room and 
our whole team is having problems creating anything in their zone. 
That's the key why we had only 12 shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drought led to the Sabres' first playoff loss at home after  
seven victories at Marine Midland Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing we've been able to do is use our day off well and  
learn some things from the tape and come back focused,'' Sabres 
captain Michael Peca said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo will have to shoot quicker and more accurately to win.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a combination of trying to get the shots off a little  
quicker and making some better decisions,'' Peca said. ``Overall 
it's getting the shots off quicker and not winding up for the big 
slap shots, just snapping it through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peca said the Sabres also must re-establish their forechecking  
and work together better. 
</P>
<P>
	``The forwards have to come back and be a lot more available for  
the defensemen,'' Peca said. ``Our `D' have made a lot of good 
plays but we're not getting over the red line to give them an 
outlet.''

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Activist To Release Memoir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the pantheon of Vietnam War activists,  
Daniel Ellsberg stands apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Hailed as a hero by many, denounced as a traitor by an American  
president, he survived political and legal assaults to become a 
symbol of one person's ability to change history. 
</P>
<P>
	A 47-volume Defense Department study of the U.S. role in  
Indochina over three decades was classified top secret when 
Ellsberg, a Defense Department analyst, decided to copy it and give 
it to The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times and the Washington Post published the study as ``The  
Pentagon Papers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, almost 30 years later, Ellsberg is excavating his past from  
boxes of documents that form the basis for his memoir. And he's 
sorting out what was accomplished by his actions, which could have 
been punished by 115 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Did his release of the Pentagon Papers help end the Vietnam War?  
No one is certain, least of all Ellsberg. More than likely, he 
says, it stopped the war from escalating. 
</P>
<P>
	He is convinced that President Nixon would have expanded the war  
had he not feared Ellsberg would disclose even more information. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without Nixon's obsession with me, he would have stayed in  
office,'' Ellsberg said in an interview. ``And had he not been 
removed from office, he would have continued the bombing (in 
Vietnam).'' 
</P>
<P>
	But those who were part of the episode that resulted in  
Ellsberg's federal trial for espionage and conspiracy view his 
legacy in broader terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Dan did goes far beyond the war,'' said Leonard  
Weinglass, an attorney who was part of Ellsberg's defense team. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he represents is someone who broke ranks with the policy  
priesthood and was willing to risk the betrayal label for the sake 
of revealing a policy that had gone awry,'' he said. ``Where are 
the people today who would break ranks and reveal such a policy?'' 
</P>
<P>
	ACLU lawyer Mark Rosenbaum, who as a 24-year-old law student  
took a leave from Harvard University to work on Ellsberg's behalf, 
sees him as the ultimate whistle-blower. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what Dan did was to open up for the country the  
recognition that government did not tell the truth,'' Rosenbaum 
said. ``It was a coming-of-age moment for the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ellsberg remains wiry and energetic at 68. His hair is silver,  
his eyes still flashing blue. And three decades after he risked 
everything to stop the war, the ghosts of Vietnam, Nixon and the 
advisers Nixon delegated to silence him still linger. 
</P>
<P>
	Seated in the front window of a Washington restaurant, he points  
to a place across the street and says, ``That's where I met with 
John Ehrlichman last year. We had lunch and talked for about six 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got on very well,'' he adds.  
</P>
<P>
	The hunter and the hunted making peace.  
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman, Nixon's top domestic adviser, went to prison for his  
role in the 1971 break-in at the office of Dr. Lewis Fielding, a 
psychiatrist who had treated Ellsberg. Ellsberg believes Nixon 
assigned Ehrlichman to ``neutralize'' him. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon ``had been quoted as using words like traitor about me.  
But I'd always heard he had changed,'' Ellsberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was surprised when Ehrlichman called.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was doing a documentary based on his story, and he felt it  
was very important to include me,'' he said. ``He wanted to get me 
on camera, but that never happened.'' Ehrlichman died Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fielding break-in led to dismissal of charges against  
Ellsberg on grounds of outrageous government misconduct. It led to 
revelations, too, about the Watergate scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon, who resigned in 1974 over Watergate, wrote in his  
memoirs: ``I still believe that it is a tragedy of circumstances 
that ... John Ehrlichman went to jail and Daniel Ellsberg went 
free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Why was Nixon so intent on getting Ellsberg? The former Pentagon  
insider thinks he knows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nixon knew from almost the first day I had other documents  
that I had not released, including documents from his own National 
Security Counsel,'' he said. ``He didn't know how much I had. But 
he thought if I released them, it would expose his Vietnam 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nixon had a secret plan and I did know what it was,'' Ellsberg  
said. His contention: Nixon planned to continue the war 
indefinitely with U.S. air support for South Vietnamese troops on 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon sent Ellsberg to Vietnam, and he returned knowing  
the war was not being won. In 1969 he decided to release the 
Pentagon Papers to the newspapers to show a pattern of deception 
that he believed guided U.S. foreign policy for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, he said, he could have published it on the Internet, a  
lot less cumbersome than making multiple copies of 7,000 pages of 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellsberg's current cause is preventing nuclear arms  
proliferation. He has been jailed many times in anti-nuclear 
protests the last 20 years and has moved to Washington to further 
his efforts. His wife, Patricia, lives in their home in Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	Their son, Michael, 22, is a law student at Brown University,  
where he recently had an opportunity to chide Robert McNamara, an 
architect of the war his father opposed. Speaking to a class last 
month, the former defense secretary acknowledged harboring doubts 
the United States could win the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had you spoken frankly,'' Michael Ellsberg told McNamara, ``it  
seems years of war could have been avoided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ellsberg is writing his memoirs and supports himself with  
lecture fees and research grants on nuclear issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenbaum predicts Ellsberg will be seen as a towering figure.  
</P>
<P>
	``There hasn't been anyone else that took such a lonely and  
principled stand,'' Rosenbaum said. ``He did take on the 
government.''

<HEADLINE> Matchups in NBA Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A position-by-position look at the matchups in the NBA Finals  
between the San Antonio Spurs and New York Knicks: 
</P>
<P>
 *CENTER:   	
</P>
<P>
	David Robinson vs. Chris Dudley. A complete and utter mismatch  
in every way. Robinson is the superior offensive player, able to go 
strong to the hoop, shoot jumpers and draw fouls, and is a better 
rebounder, shot blocker and help defender. Dudley is a big body 
with six fouls. 
</P>
<P>
	Advantage -- Spurs.  
</P>
<P>
 *POWER FORWARD:   	
</P>
<P>
	Tim Duncan vs. Kurt Thomas-Larry Johnson. Another mismatch, even  
more so if Johnson's sprained knee keeps him out of the first few 
games. Duncan is fundamentally sound, a superb low-post scorer, a 
shot-blocker and a better passer and free throw shooter than he was 
last season as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	Advantage -- Spurs.  
</P>
<P>
 *SMALL FORWARD:   	
</P>
<P>
	Sean Elliott vs. Latrell Sprewell. One of the more intriguing  
matchups, and one the Knicks need to win in order to have any 
chance for a title. Sprewell is an outstanding slasher and scorer 
and one of the best finishers around the basket in the NBA. Elliott 
is a better 3-point shooter. 
</P>
<P>
	Advantage -- Knicks.  
</P>
<P>
 *SHOOTING GUARD:   	
</P>
<P>
	Mario Elie vs. Allan Houston. Elie, the brashest player on the  
Spurs, and Houston, one of the quietest Knicks, are a study in 
contrasts. Houston, while inconsistent, is a much better shooter 
and scorer. Elie is the superior defender. 
</P>
<P>
	Advantage -- Knicks.  
</P>
<P>
 *POINT GUARD:   	
</P>
<P>
	Avery Johnson vs. Charlie Ward-Chris Childs. The Knicks will use  
Ward as their starter and Childs as their finisher, sometimes 
playing the two alongside each other in a three-guard alignment. 
Ward has been playing poorly of late, while Johnson has 
consistently made teams pay for leaving him open. 
</P>
<P>
	Advantage -- Spurs.  
</P>
<P>
 *RESERVES:   	
</P>
<P>
	Jaren Jackson, Steve Kerr, Jerome Kersey, Malik Rose and Will  
Perdue vs. Childs, Marcus Camby, Herb Williams and Thomas (if 
Johnson is healthy). Camby is the best player on either bench, 
capable of infusing the Knicks with energy, speed and athleticism. 
In Rose, Kersey and Perdue, the Spurs have lots more height than 
the Knicks. San Antonio also has the edge in 3-point shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Advantage -- Spurs.  
</P>
<P>
 *COACHES:   	
</P>
<P>
	Gregg Popovich vs. Jeff Van Gundy. No one gave Popovich much  
credit for the Spurs' success this season, as evidenced by his 
sixth place showing in coach of the year balloting. Van Gundy has 
been brilliant in the postseason after being stubborn in the 
regular season and nearly losing his job. 
</P>
<P>
	Advantage -- Knicks.  
</P>
<P>
 *INTANGIBLES:   	
</P>
<P>
	Low exposure vs. bright spotlight. The pressure of the NBA  
Finals is a whole lot different than anything that comes before it, 
and certain Western Conference marquee players have been known to 
experience brain lock under that pressure in recent years. The 
Knicks shouldn't have a problem with the extra attention, given 
that they play in the unrelenting glare of the nation's No. 1 media 
market and have survived a soap opera season with endless injuries, 
controversies and distractions. 
</P>
<P>
	Advantage -- Knicks.

<HEADLINE> Arum Offers Suggestions for Boxing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANASTOTA, N.Y. (AP) -- Promoter Bob Arum took his place Sunday  
among the ring's legends in the International Boxing Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Someday, he told thousands of well-wishers, he hopes to  
accomplish something to deserve his place there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes people get an award and then what they do  
subsequently justifies the award. ... I hope that will be the case 
in my situation,'' Arum said during a 10th anniversary induction 
ceremony attended by nearly three dozen past and present champions, 
including Sugar Ray Leonard, Joe Frazier, Floyd Patterson and Leon 
and Michael Spinks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe some day I will really be worthy of this honor you have  
given me today,'' said Arum, who entered the hall along with five 
other living inductees: heavyweight Jimmy Bivins, featherweight 
champion Eusebio Pedroza of Panama, bantam great Khaosai Galaxy of 
Thailand, publicist Irving Rudd and celebrated English manager 
Mickey Duff. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking blame for some of the problems that have beset boxing  
during the last generation, Arum threw out a challenge to himself 
and other fight fans to help boxing ``reestablish itself as the 
major sport it truly is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a day where levity had been the prevailing tone among the  
earlier recipients, Arum turned serious at the end of the ceremony 
to offer three suggestions to improve boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the continued exploitation of fighters by managers and  
promoters a problem that has soured boxing's public image, Arum 
urged his listeners to help lobby Congress for approval of the 
so-called Muhammad Ali bill, a proposal by Arizona Sen. John 
McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's legislation would require promoters and organizers of  
major boxing events to disclose more financial information and to 
inform state boxing commissions of charges, costs and fees they 
take out of a boxer's purse. The proposal has passed in the Senate 
but has not been taken up by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Arum also said boxing needs one principal body, some type of  
private commission, to run the sport and pilot it through the 
Internet Age if it is to compete globally with other sports. 
Antitrust regulations would require Congressional approval for such 
a body, but the boxing industry itself must finance it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lastly, and to the cheers of all the boxers, Arum said boxing  
needs to develop a pension fund like other major sports have. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boxing must take care of its own. The past fighters. The  
current fighters. And the future fighters. We don't want the 
fighters to go the community to help. We in boxing must create a 
fund to help those fighters,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arum has been one of boxing's most prominent promoters since  
1966, when he promoted the first fight he ever attended, Muhammad 
Ali vs. George Chuvalo. In 1980, he began the Top Rank Boxing 
series, which became one of ESPN's highest rated regular shows. 
Among the matchups he has brought to the ring were Arguello-Pryor, 
Leonard-Hagler, Hagler-Hearns and Ali-Spinks II. 
</P>
<P>
	While Arum's words brought applause, the biggest ovation Sunday  
was for Bivins, a longtime contender who defeated eight future 
champions but never got a shot at a title fight during a 15-year 
career. Last year, a penniless Bivins was rescued by police and 
family after being found in the attic of his son-in-law's home, 
malnourished, abused and near death. 
</P>
<P>
	At age 79 and fully recovered, Bivins strode slowly to the  
podium as he received a minute-long standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you for cheering like that for me,'' Bivins said softly  
when the applause had quieted. His words ignited another round of 
applause. ``I never figured I'd get a chance to be in front of a 
people like this. ... Everybody talked about I was a bum. But this 
bum came to be somebody.''

<HEADLINE> Aerospace Cos Assume Big Competitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LE BOURGET, France (AP) -- From rockets built in China to  
passenger jets made in Brazil, a growing number of smaller 
aerospace companies are carving successful niches and even 
competing head-on with industry heavyweights like Boeing Co. 
</P>
<P>
	A few have chosen to go it alone, like China Great Wall Industry  
Corp., producer of ``Long March'' rockets used to send commercial 
satellites into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Others prefer forming joint projects with bigger, richer  
companies as a way of sharing costs, technologies and the risk of 
failure in one of the world's most capital-intensive businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone trying to launch new projects is looking for  
partners,'' said Robin Ho, project manager for Taiwan's Aerospace 
Industrial Development Corp. ``That's the concept in the aviation 
industry now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ho spoke at the Paris Air Show, which opened to the public on  
Sunday. The show is the biggest event of its kind in the aerospace 
industry -- an eight-day sales promotion for makers of commercial 
and military aircraft and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,800 companies are participating this year at Le  
Bourget airfield north of the French capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents and young children thronged the show Sunday, packing the  
aisles in indoor exhibit halls and scanning the sky for flight 
demonstrations by cutting-edge jets like the Eurofighter. A 
vintage, World War II-era P-51 Mustang also made a rare, aerobatic 
display. 
</P>
<P>
	For Indonesian Aerospace Industries, the show was an opportunity  
to promote its twin-engine military transport, the CN-235. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, known by its Indonesian acronym IPTN, teamed up  
with CASA of Spain to build the plane. Now it hopes to develop a 
130-seat passenger jet, a step that would put it into direct 
competition with Boeing and Airbus Industrie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see how we can compete with Boeing or Airbus in  
America or Europe,'' said sales and marketing executive Agung B. 
Ismadi. But IPTN is targeting business in Southeast Asia, where 
Ismadi said he sees ``a very big opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The near-collapse of Indonesia's economy has forced IPTN to  
delay development of commercial planes until it can find another 
wealthy partner to share the development costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel Aircraft Industries International has followed a similar  
strategy, linking up with bigger firms like TRW and Raytheon to 
develop new projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``The secret to winning today is giving local companies some  
participation to help offset the cost,'' said IAI International 
vice president Marvin Klemow. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1954 with just seven employees, the Israeli  
government-owned firm has grown into a conglomerate with a work 
force of 13,000 and annual sales of more than $2 billion, Klemow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's competing head-on with Boeing to sell early-warning  
aircraft to Australia. It hopes to sell 174 attack helicopters to 
Turkey, where its competitors include Italy's Agusta. 
</P>
<P>
	IAI is happy to cut deals to improve its odds. Even if Agusta  
wins the Turkish sale, IAI has agreed to provide night-targeting 
equipment for use with the Italian helicopters, Klemow said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's Embraer is another niche producer with eyes on a larger  
market. The company's president, Mauricio Botelho, said Saturday 
that he has been negotiating with several potential partners in 
hopes of expanding its role as a builder of regional passenger 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week it announced the sale of 100-seat commercial jets to  
the Swiss airline Crossair, showing that it wants to grow at the 
expense of established companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Denel, a South African arms manufacturer, also is looking for a  
foreign partner to improve its access to capital and advanced 
technologies, said Willie Pienaar, the company's regional manager 
for Europe. Like IPTN of Indonesia, Denel has built its business in 
specializing in supplying regional markets, like Africa and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	The China Great Wall Industry Corp. has bucked the trend toward  
joint ventures, building its own rockets to carry satellites for 
foreign customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Its main target for business is Asia, where its relatively cheap  
price for launching satellites gives it a competitive edge, said 
Wei Zeng, a company planning assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing, which has its own rocket program, acknowledges the  
threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know it's a commodity business,'' said Jim Albaugh,  
president of Boeing's Space and Communications Group. ``And we're 
going to have to keep moving that price point down.''

<HEADLINE> Murdoch May Buy Publishing Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. reportedly is in  
discussions to acquire the publishing companies William Morrow &AMP; 
Co. and Avon Books. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies, owned by Hearst Corp., would be added to  
Murdoch's HarperCollins group if the deal is concluded, the 
Hollywood Reporter said, quoting unidentified sources who described 
the talks as ``advanced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marcia Horowitz, a Murdoch spokeswoman, had no comment Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Telephone messages seeking comment were left at the New York  
City offices of William Morrow and Avon, which were closed over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based News Corp. reportedly has held talks with several  
mid-sized players in its effort to expand its trade book publishing 
presence. The company had been talking with Viacom Inc. about 
merging HarperCollins with Viacom's Simon &AMP; Schuster, but those 
discussion broke off, the Reporter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several big publishers have merged in recent years, as companies  
seek to cut costs and gain market share. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann bought the  
biggest U.S. book publisher, Random House, from Advance 
Publications, for a price estimated by analysts at between $1.1 
billion and $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of authors raised objections to the merger, saying it  
would create a ``new economic behemoth'' with the potential to 
restrict readers' choices and authors' ability to market their 
works. Nonetheless, the Federal Trade Commission authorized the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Bertelsmann also bought Bantam Books in 1977 and owns Doubleday,  
Dell-Delacorte and Broadway Books. 
</P>
<P>
	Also last year, Viacom Inc. sold the educational, professional  
and reference divisions of Simon &AMP; Schuster to the British media 
group Pearson for $4.6 billion.

<HEADLINE> Brazil To Auction Oil and Gas Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil is getting ready to offer  
for sale sections of Latin America's largest country for 
exploration to foreign oil companies after the breakup of a 46-year 
state monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the world's largest oil companies are to bid for 27  
potential oil and gas sites at a massive auction Tuesday and 
Wednesday. Among 37 bidders are Shell, Esso, Texaco and Mobil. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first auction of its kind since state company  
Petrobras' monopoly was abolished almost four years ago. Petrobras 
will participate at the auction and may form partnerships with 
foreign firms. 
</P>
<P>
	David Zylberstztajn, director of the Brazil's National Oil  
Agency, the industry regulator, predicts that $15 billion to $20 
billion will be invested in Brazil over five years following the 
auction. He believes 300,000 jobs will be created. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil produces about two-thirds of the 1.8 million barrels of  
oil it consumes daily. The rest are imported from Argentina, Mexico 
and Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> Nethercutt Seeking Fourth Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- George Nethercutt, whose pledge to serve  
only three terms in the U.S. House help him upset Speaker Tom Foley 
in 1994, announced Sunday he had changed his mind and would seek a 
fourth two-year term in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a mistake when I chose to set a limit on my service,''  
Nethercutt, R-Wash., said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	An official for U.S. Term Limits said the group would spend  
close to $1 million in an effort to defeat Nethercutt. 
</P>
<P>
	Nethercutt made term limits the central theme of his 1994  
campaign against Foley, whom he cast as a career politician, and 
won an upset victory during that year's Republican takeover of 
Congress. Foley served in the U.S. House for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory gave Nethercutt instant standing in the new  
Republican majority and he was rewarded with a seat on the House 
Appropriations Committee -- a rarity for a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
	He won re-election twice while promising to keep his pledge to  
serve only three terms. 
</P>
<P>
	But beginning in 1997, the former attorney said he might run for  
a fourth term if he were convinced it would be good for his 
district. This year, he has said repeatedly in speeches that he 
considers term limits a mistake and that he wished he had never 
made the promise.

	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Saying the vice president was a strong  
advocate for urban America, more than 100 mayors announced their 
support Sunday for Al Gore's 2000 campaign for president. 
</P>
<P>
	``We represent every region of the United States and we are here  
to make sure Al Gore becomes the next president of the United 
States,'' said New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial, speaking at a news 
conference at the U.S. Conference of Mayors annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining him were dozens of other city leaders, including mayors  
Clarence Harmon of St. Louis, Sharon Sayles Belton of Minneapolis, 
Bill Campbell of Atlanta and Scott King of Gary, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 167 mayors have pledged their support to the Democrat for  
next year's election.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Haley Barbour, co-chairman of Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush's presidential exploratory committee, said Sunday 
that Bush, the GOP front-runner, was not taking Vice President 
Gore's candidacy lightly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have to be very careful the Republicans don't  
underestimate Al Gore. I don't. Not because I know of some great 
strength he has, but it's foolish in politics to underestimate your 
opponent. And we just should not underestimate Albert Gore. I don't 
think George Bush will ...,'' Barbour said on ``Fox News Sunday.

	NOTTINGHAM, N.H. (AP) -- Just 40 miles from where Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush was serving lobster to the traveling press, former 
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander on Sunday dined on hamburgers and 
hot dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander met with about 100 voters at a cookout in Pawtuckaway  
State Park, just across New Hampshire's border with Maine. Bush was 
visiting his father, former President George Bush, at the family 
home in Kennebunkport, Maine. 
</P>
<P>

his low-key event would contrast with Bush's visit to New Hampshire 
on Monday.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Gore's campaign chairman said  
Sunday that Gore has fared poorly in polls against Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush and other Republicans because he has not received 
the credit he deserves for the administration's successes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a member of this team that is responsible for all these  
successes. And members of the team don't always get credit,'' said 
Tony Coehlo, appearing on ABC's ``This Week.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the Republican National  
Committee said one of the party's missions was to ensure Americans 
got to know the ``real Al Gore.''	   ''He said he cleared land in Tennessee with mules and a 
double-bladed ax. He grew up in a luxury hotel right in Washington. 
He's really not Daniel Boone, he's the boy from embassy row,'' Jim 
Nicholson said on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So we are going to point out to people that luxury hotel in  
Washington where he really was raised,'' he said.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leon Panetta, a former White House chief of  
staff to President Clinton, said Sunday that GOP Gov. George W. 
Bush of Texas might find campaigning for president becomes rougher 
as people get to know him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look, the governor is a decent man; he's committed to public  
service. He has done a pretty good job as governor in Texas. But 
nobody knows what his positions are on national issues,'' Panetta 
said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And that is what is going to be tested over these next few  
months. And when that's tested he's going to be running into a lot 
of land mines within his own party and within the American people 
as well.''

<HEADLINE> Cos. Anxious in Tight Labor Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Chamber of Commerce chief in Grand Forks, N.D., is excited  
about a new source of potential workers -- Kosovo refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	A North Carolina store manager doesn't dare dismiss his tardy  
clerks -- replacements are too hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
	With unemployment dipping to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent, tight  
labor markets are pinching companies from coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
	In the worst-hit areas, the Midwestern heartland and Carolina  
regions where jobless rates have fallen below 2 percent, the 
grinding worker shortage is a desperate obsession. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies are more creative than ever in their recruiting. Some  
are also more worried than ever about their survival. 
</P>
<P>
	``The level of desperation has been shocking to me,'' says Becky  
Kelso, a director of the Minnesota High Tech Association, just back 
in Minneapolis after several weeks touring the state. ``I've been 
surprised at the true level of shortage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For American workers, it's dream time. College students and the  
highly skilled are swimming in job offers. And groups rarely 
courted -- minorities or disabled people -- are getting more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	It's true that in the post-Baby Boom 1990s, fewer young people  
are entering the work force. But the main reason for the shortage 
is less a shrinking work force than it is a swelling economy: 11 
million new jobs have been created in the nation's longest 
peacetime expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially hard hit are the Midwest and South. In April,  
Minneapolis-St. Paul had the country's lowest jobless rate of 1.6 
percent, followed by two North Carolina cities -- Greensboro and 
Winston-Salem -- with 1.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	At least North Carolina attracts newcomers. Migration into North  
Carolina rose 1 percent to 70,000 last year, adding to a population 
of 7.55 million. In contrast, net immigration to Minnesota -- 
population 4.5 million -- was 10,000 last year, down from 20,000 the 
year before. 
</P>
<P>
	``People consider us to have a weather issue,'' quietly confided  
Libby Starling, research director of the Minnesota Department of 
Economic Security. Minnesota winters average a chilly 13 degrees, 
compared with North Carolina's 43 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	In December the state launched its ``Come Home to Minnesota''  
campaign to recruit ex-Minnesotans, through local mailings to 
graduates, a statewide job bank and gentle pressure from relatives. 
One state economist jokingly calls it the ``granny network.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Two Harbors, a town of 3,650 people about 100 miles north of  
Minneapolis, local articles about the campaign drew a flurry of 
telephone job inquiries. A new Web site is up, and local 
development leader Mike Valentine plans to mail fliers to high 
school graduates of the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
	There, the campaign is doubly important. Not only does Two  
Harbors need workers, but it's also trying to recruit high-tech 
firms that are skeptical their labor needs will be met. 
</P>
<P>
	``We say, `Workers will come if jobs come,' and they say, `Prove  
it,''' Valentine says. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not surprising companies want such assurances. More than 40  
percent of high-tech firms told the state last year they had 
trouble filling customer orders due to the labor shortage. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, 15 of the Minnesota High Tech Association's 700  
members spent $330,000 on a radio, billboard and television 
campaign to win Minnesotans back from Silicon Valley. The response 
to ``Upgrade to Minnesota'' was 12,000 resumes, although 
association members won't say how many people were hired. 
</P>
<P>
	States are scouring unusual places for workers.  
</P>
<P>
	The Minnesota High Tech Association is now looking for  
technology workers in prisons, the National Guard and a program for 
impoverished senior citizens. The association hopes to identify 
potential employees, then teach them high-tech skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there are the refugees.  
</P>
<P>
	Grand Forks wants to do good while easing its 2 percent jobless  
rate. The city hopes to bring in 30 Kosovo refugee families over 
the next year, says Bob Gustafson, Chamber of Commerce president. 
</P>
<P>
	``They come in with a tremendous work ethic,'' he says, citing a  
Bosnian who started an espresso bar in town. 
</P>
<P>
	About 65 city leaders met last week at the Holiday Inn to firm  
up the plan to offer the refugees jobs at the local airplane 
manufacturer, hospital, university and potato processing company, 
and train them if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Around the country, companies are boosting benefits, paying  
bonuses to workers who bring in new hires, stepping up college 
recruiting. But in the tightest labor markets, employers are doing 
it all at once, running faster and faster to find the elusive 
worker. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last year, machinery company ACR Industries in suburban  
Detroit started giving $500 bonuses to workers who bring in new 
employees, plus $1,500 more if the recruits stay a year. It's 
rehired retirees, spent $2,000 on an elaborate Help Wanted sign out 
front, listed job openings on its delivery trucks and set up at job 
fairs for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``You feel very lucky if at the end of everything, you've hired  
a couple of people,'' ACR's human resources director David Johnson 
says with a sigh. He notes that ACR pays trainees $8 an hour, while 
workers at the McDonald's down the street start at $9. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies that can beat the crunch with ingenuity and innovation  
will almost certainly emerge stronger in the new, faster-moving 
economy. But some are worried they won't survive that long. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Haddock, assistant manager of the Belk department store in  
Winston-Salem, said employees are getting disrespectful and tardy 
because they know they can get another job any time. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we continue this decline, the kind of service customers are  
going to get really worries me,'' he says. ``I don't know where 
it's going to end.''

<HEADLINE> Stars Can't Keep Stars Healthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Three games into the Stanley Cup finals and  
here's the scenario: The Dallas Stars are running out of healthy 
scorers. The Buffalo Sabres may be running out of time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars keep getting their stars hurt, yet keep winning games  
with the most determined -- or is it fanatical? -- defensive clamp 
job seen in the championship round in years. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Cup finals taking a two-day break before Game 4 on  
Tuesday night at Marine Midland Arena, the Stars lead 2-1 and must 
win only twice more to hoist their first cup. 
</P>
<P>
	If they do win it, they might want to let their shot-blocking,  
breakaway-stopping defensemen and backcheckers do it, because 
they've done the heavy lifting in a series where defense was 
supposed to rule, and has. 
</P>
<P>
	Case in point: The Stars limited Buffalo, on home ice no less,  
to a record-tying 12 shots and to 0-for-8 on the power play in a 
momentum-creating 2-1 victory in Game 3 Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory didn't come without a price; Brett Hull, the  
eighth-leading scorer in NHL playoff history, strained a groin he 
injured twice previously this season and may not play Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stars coach Ken Hitchcock, who has the luxury of possessing  
three premier playoff scorers when many NHL teams would love to 
have one, joked that Hull isn't as much day to day as ``hour to 
hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Hull, who scored goals in the first two games, ``probably''  
won't play Tuesday, Hitchcock said. If he doesn't, he might be 
replaced on the Mike Modano-Jere Lehtinen top line by, of all 
people, defenseman Darryl Sydor. 
</P>
<P>
	A curious move, considering Hull has 76 career playoff goals and  
Sydor has five? Probably not in a series where only 14 goals have 
been scored and the teams are 4-of-34 on the power play. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydor was switched from forward to defenseman by his juniors  
coach, who, coincidentally, was Hitchcock. The Stars' coach said 
Modano is delighted at the possibility of playing alongside a 
physical, space-creating player like Sydor, especially since open 
ice has been at a premium so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mo has a lot of fun if we just turn him loose,'' Hitchcock  
said. ``It will be go, go, go, and that's how he likes it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Modano wasn't sure if he could go at all in Game 3 because of a  
painful wrist injury that requires him to wear a rubberized cast. 
But he felt much better after getting a pain-killing injection 
before the game, and said Sunday he feels better still. 
</P>
<P>
	With Hull playing only three shifts and Modano hurting, Joe  
Nieuwendyk scored both goals Saturday and has a playoff-record 
tying six game-winning goals and a team-high 11 goals and 10 
assists in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the question is when -- or if -- Hull will return. He injured  
his groin twice previously this season and, the second time, he 
didn't return for a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, these are the Stanley Cup finals, when even the most  
significant of injuries usually don't take long to heal. Hull 
waited 13 seasons to return to the Cup finals and isn't likely to 
be too patient with this injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's like a shark, he's always lurking. You always feel like  
he is one shot away from scoring,'' Hitchcock said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres feel the same way about 40-goal scorer Miroslav  
Satan. But he has seemed star-struck in the finals, going scoreless 
and taking only two shots in 66 1/2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Any time Satan steps onto the ice, he has been shadowed by  
Dallas' twin-tower defensemen Derian Hatcher and Richard Matvichuk 
or slowed in the neutral zone by the Stars' back-checking forwards. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Satan is feeling the pressure to score not only from his  
coach, Lindy Ruff, but the championship-starved populous of 
Buffalo. Sabres fans already can sense another final-round failure 
to match the Bills' four ego-deflating losses in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I do feel the pressure,'' Satan said. ``I tried to  
respond the best way I can but they are backchecking me hard. There 
is not too much room right now, not only for me but for the whole 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff, with the advantage of making the final line change at  
home, tried matching Satan against different lines and giving him 
more playing time in Game 3, but with no change in luck or 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought the added ice time might get him going,'' Ruff said.  
``Obviously, we need him if we are going to win this series. We 
tried to get him away from a couple of their matchups, tried to get 
him away from a couple of their defensive pairs, but didn't get a 
lot out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Except a loss, one that forces the Sabres to win at least once  
more in Dallas if they are to rally and finally bring a winner to 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was the best-of-3, I would really be scared,'' Ruff  
said. ``If we are a team that deserves a Stanley Cup, we should be 
able to win three out of four games. If not, we are not good enough 
to win it.''

<HEADLINE> Qwest Bids $55B for Telecom Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Qwest Communications International Inc. made a  
surprising $55 billion offer Sunday to acquire U S West Inc. and 
Frontier Corp. in a bold move to bust their agreement to merge with 
Global Crossing Inc. and create a telecommunications powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver-based Qwest is the nation's fourth-largest long-distance  
telephone company. The deal would give Qwest a piece of the local 
phone markets in 14 western states with the addition of Baby Bell U 
S West and strengthen Qwest's long distance business with the 
addition of Frontier, the No. 5 long-distance company. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest is offering $78 a share in stock for U S West and $73 a  
share in cash and stock for Frontier. Qwest would sweeten each bid 
by $2 a share if both companies agree to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Both those bids are higher than Global Crossing's offer to pay  
about $63 a share in stock for both U S West and Frontier in 
separate deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing is a Bermuda-based startup company with plans to  
link the world's continents with high-speed Internet cables. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing stock, however, has fallen 16 percent in recent  
weeks as the companies have had a hard time selling investors on 
the benefits of combining their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the clear superiority of our offer to the proposed  
Global Crossing merger, we would like to meet with you and your 
advisors as soon as possible,'' wrote Joseph P. Nacchio, Qwest 
chariman and chief executive officer, in letters to the heads of U 
S West and Frontier. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing officials declined comment on the deal Sunday. U  
S West and Frontier officials could not immediately be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet is revolutionizing the telecommunications industry  
and is driving a string of merger bids. As high-speed connections 
link more homes and businesses, telecom and cable companies alike 
are betting big on the potential profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, AT&AMP;T Corp. won a bidding war with Comcast for  
MediaOne Group Inc., a Denver-based cable company. AT&AMP;T, the 
nation's largest long distance company, is gambling that television 
cables will be the way to carry Internet, voice and data traffic in 
the future.

	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- If Texas A&AMP;M coach Mark Johnson isn't sitting  
in a dugout or studying a scouting report, he often daydreams of 
dropping a fishing line in a mountain creek. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson relaxes by thinking about his hometown of Las Vegas,  
N.M., a town of 15,600 residents on the east side of the Sangre de 
Cristo mountains in northern New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a beautiful area,'' Johnson said. ``I used to go up  
Gallinas Canyon. I like to stream fish, and I was 20 minutes away 
from that. I love fishing for trout and walking the streams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Aggies play Cal State-Fullerton in an elimination game  
Monday at the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	After this week, Johnson will resume his work as coach of Team  
USA. The collection of college and other amateurs plays this summer 
against the national teams from Japan, Nicaragua and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Another American team, made up of Class AAA pros and players  
from the 40-man rosters of major-league clubs, will compete at the 
Pan American Games in Canada as baseball follows the trend of 
professionals in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson grew up in Las Vegas, where his father was an  
administrator at New Mexico Highlands University, and became an 
All-WAC outfielder at New Mexico during the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	He broke into coaching as an assistant with the Lobos and moved  
on to Arizona, Mississippi State and Texas A&AMP;M. He worked under two 
of the best-known college coaches: Jerry Kindall in Tucson and Ron 
Polk at MSU. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said bringing the Aggies to Omaha and being named coach  
of the United States team were big honors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an amazing thing for me when I think of being from a  
small town like Las Vegas,'' he said. ``I've been really fortunate 
that things fell right for me. I got around the right people and 
got some good breaks.'' 
</P>

<P>
	 *RENOVATED ROSENBLATT:* Fans had plenty of activities to choose  
from as they strolled in front of the new-look Rosenblatt Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The city spent $4.7 million to renovate the entrance of the ball  
park for this year's College World Series, trading parking space in 
a bid to make the event more enjoyable for fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The improvements include brick columns separating wrought-iron  
gates, new restrooms, a picnic area and the centerpiece -- a statue 
of celebrating players called ``The Road to Omaha.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes a real positive impression,'' said Bill Marcil, 39,  
an Omaha psychiatrist. ``It really does make you feel like you're 
in a major league atmosphere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A live band played at the entrance the first two days of the  
series. Fans shopped for CWS souvenirs at vendors' stands and 
checked out booths set up by baseball equipment manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Others visited the NCAA's welcome tent, where dance music blared  
as fans gazed at displays on championship events and leafed through 
pamphlets on academic standards for potential student athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great,'' said Kris Holm, 29, who works at a brokerage  
firm in Minneapolis. ``We just came down to see the games. It 
looked like fun.''

<P>
	 *HOMETOWN BOY:* Oklahoma State reserve outfielder Mike Lorsbach  
is back in his hometown this week. He grew up in Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorsbach, a freshman, was recruited by Nebraska and Creighton  
but opted for Oklahoma State after attending coach Tom Holliday's 
summer camp before his senior year at Millard North High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been fine to go to either of those Nebraska  
schools but I wanted to go somewhere warmer,'' Lorsbach said. ``I 
just wanted to go somewhere south of Nebraska and I wanted a school 
that was in the top 20 or 25.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also was lured by the prospect of a College World Series  
trip. This year, the Cowboys are making their 19th appearance in 
Omaha.

<HEADLINE> Coles Resigns From Sydney Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Phil Coles resigned from the Sydney  
2000 Organizing Committee on Monday but retained his seat on the 
IOC, Olympic officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise deal was offered by the International Olympic  
Committee executive board in a bid to close the five-month 
controversy swirling around the Australian IOC member. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles -- who was already censured in March for his role in the  
Salt Lake City scandal -- had been under the threat of expulsion 
from the IOC for further alleged ethical misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive board announced that it was maintaining the ``most  
severe warning'' which Coles received in March for accepting lavish 
hospitality from Salt Lake City bid officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The board said Coles would now receive a ``reprimand'' for  
serious negligence and proposed that he be ineligible to serve on 
any IOC commission or working group for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement announced that Coles had resigned from the board  
of the Sydney organizing committee. Sydney organizers have 
repeatedly pushed for Coles to be ousted from the local panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The board said it found no ``sanctionable offense'' in the fact  
that Coles had written memos on IOC members. Those memos, prepared 
for the Sydney bid committee, were apparently passed on to Salt 
Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the other hand, by not taking all necessary precautions to  
avoid the disclosure of such notes, Mr. Coles was guilty of serious 
negligence,'' an IOC statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sydney, Coles charged that ``political pressures'' had forced  
him off the SOCOG board but said he was relieved he will keep his 
IOC position. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's another disappointing day for me,'' Coles said. ``Still,  
being on the IOC is nice and I appreciate that but it's a sad day 
that political pressures have forced this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles said he believed SOCOG president Michael Knight had forced  
his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I put it on the table to the IOC that I was open for a meeting  
with Michael Knight which obviously wasn't accepted by him so I 
resigned,'' Coles said. ``There was never any suggestion that I 
would resign from the SOCOG board to keep my role with the IOC, 
never.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles temporarily stepped down from the Sydney board in February  
after being implicated in the Salt Lake vote-buying case. He has 
since been stripped of his role in organizing the Olympic torch 
relay in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	But Knight and other Australian Olympic officials have demanded  
that Coles leave for good, claiming the scandal was detracting from 
the games and scaring away sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Olympic rules, Coles has an automatic seat on the Sydney  
board as one of two IOC members from Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coles case has overshadowed other issues as the IOC meets in  
Seoul for a three-day executive board meeting, followed by a 
four-day session of the general assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of the session is Saturday's selection of the  
host city for the 2006 Winter Games. Six European cities are in the 
running. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the IOC meetings began, Coles expressed confidence he  
would be cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles told The Sun-Herald newspaper in Sydney he expected to  
reclaim his key posts in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll just be glad when all this business is finally put to  
rest,'' he said. ``I'll have more to say when my name is finally 
cleared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles reiterated his contention that he was the victim of a  
political vendetta in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe my name has been turned into a political football  
and I'm talking of people in high places on both sides of state 
politics,'' Coles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has been questioned three times by IOC investigators for  
alleged abuse of his office. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, he received a ``most severe'' warning from the IOC for  
accepting lavish travel and other incentives during Salt Lake's 
winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. Six members were expelled 
and four resigned in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles' case was left open amid further accusations of ethical  
violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC later examined claims by Coles' ex-wife that the couple

<HEADLINE> Report: FAA Probes Emery Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Federal aviation regulators reportedly are  
investigating allegations that Emery Worldwide improperly shipped 
hazardous materials, failed to notify pilots of hazardous cargo and 
concealed problems from inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration began a nationwide  
investigation more than a month ago into the alleged violations, 
Bill Wilkening, manager of the FAA's Dangerous Goods/Cargo Security 
Division in Washington, D.C., told the Dayton Daily News for 
Sunday's edition. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephones at the division's offices rang unanswered over the  
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Emery Worldwide spokesman Rocco Sacci told the newspaper that  
Emery Worldwide and Emery Worldwide Airlines cannot respond 
directly to any current or pending government agency investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a statement to the newspaper, he said, ``The two  
companies have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars and thousands 
of hours in development and training to achieve what we believe to 
be the finest program for the handling of hazmat shipments that can 
be found in the air industry. Our service centers are very 
sensitive to the training, acceptance and proper handling of all 
shipments that fall into the dangerous goods category.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sacci said the companies have not been told of any violations  
regarding hazardous material handling or other operational issues 
other than minor administrative errors. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged that FAA inspectors have been auditing Emery  
Worldwide's operations. Sacci would not elaborate Sunday when 
reached by The Associated Press at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA probe is focused on Emery's North American freight hub  
at Dayton International Airport through which much of the company's 
cargo -- including hazardous materials -- flows, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily News said it obtained copies of documents made  
available to the FAA showing that Debbra O. Bullock, a hazardous 
materials supervisor at Emery's Dayton hub, repeatedly brought 
complaints of violations to her superiors, but she said little was 
done. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bullock, 40, told the newspaper she has been interviewed  
extensively by the FAA. She continues to work at Emery in another 
supervisory job. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bullock has an unpublished telephone number and could not be  
reached for additional comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines are permitted to carry hazardous materials, but the  
shipments are subject to strict federal regulations and require 
special labeling, documentation, handling and loading. 
</P>
<P>
	Emery Worldwide operates one of the biggest U.S. airlines  
specializing in freight, serving customers from small retail 
shippers to auto companies and the Department of Defense. Based in 
Redwood City, Calif., Emery Worldwide has more than 75 cargo 
aircraft, 2,000 trucks and vans, and 560 service centers in 229 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	A unit of CNF Transportation Inc., Emery moves more than 4  
million pounds of freight per day through Dayton. Hazardous 
material shipments account for less than 3 percent of Emery 
Worldwide's total annual shipments, Sacci said.

<HEADLINE>  German Troops Under Fire in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRIZREN, Yugoslavia (AP) -- German troops came under heavy sniper  
fire Sunday in this southern Kosovo city and killed at least one 
armed man and wounded another in the firefight. A German soldier 
suffered an arm wound. 
</P>
<P>
	The German peacekeepers had been greeted earlier by cheering  
ethnic Albanians when they entered Prizren, Kosovo's second-largest 
city, in Germany's first major military deployment on foreign soil 
since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	As they approached the center of the city on a main street along  
the Bistrica River, sniper fire crackled from a hill and houses. 
German soldiers took cover and began shooting back. 
</P>
<P>
	The Germans' heavy fire blasted a yellow Lada car with two  
occupants. One was slumped dead over the steering wheel and the 
other was badly wounded and screaming for help before he was 
evacuated by German medics. A woman resident was also reported 
wounded by snipers. 
</P>
<P>
	German soldiers said that the men shot first and that grenades  
and semi-automatic weapons were found in the car. 
</P>
<P>
	As reporters hid behind vehicles, German soldiers took up  
defensive positions below the hill from which the sniper fire was 
coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're all over the place,'' one soldier said. ``They're  
drunks with guns and grenades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanian teen-agers scrambled about, helping the Germans  
locate sniper positions. One boy told the soldiers he had seen Serb 
snipers hiding in a Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the firefight, arriving German soldiers got a taste  
of Prizren's ethnic tensions. Although initially basking in the 
cheers of a flower-bearing crowd, they quickly had to break up an 
angry confrontation between ethnic Albanians and departing Serb 
militiamen. 
</P>
<P>
	The residents threw stones at some Serb militia vehicles, kicked  
at them and cursed. Serbs aimed their weapons at the Albanians, but 
did not shoot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we may not have everything under control at present,  
we have enough presence in town to believe there will be a safe 
withdrawal'' of Serbs, said Brig. Gen. Fritz von Korff, commander 
of the German-Dutch brigade in Prizren. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the number of troops under his command would double to  
about 2,400 on Monday. But he warned that Prizren was still ``a 
dangerous place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,000 German soldiers with tanks and other armored  
vehicles were expected to be in the city 55 miles southwest of the 
provincial capital, Pristina, by nightfall. The German forces in 
and around Prizren eventually are to number 8,500 -- postwar 
Germany's largest foreign military deployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping the lid on ethnic tensions and creating safe conditions  
for refugees to return could prove a difficult task for the 
Germans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Prizren area holds some of the Serbian Orthodox Church's  
most cherished sites and some people fear ethnic Albanians might 
vandalize the buildings in retaliation for abuses by Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Church leaders called Sunday for protection of Serb clergy  
remaining in Prizren, the independent Beta news agency reported. It 
said a Serb clergyman was attacked in Ljubizda, a village near 
Prizren. 
</P>
<P>
	As they entered Kosovo from Albania early in the day, the German  
units passed through a heavily vandalized Yugoslav customs post 
where looters had taken nearly everything they could carry -- from 
tables to toilets. 
</P>
<P>
	On the 11-mile road from the border to Prizren, almost no  
residents were seen although the troops passed 200 to 300 Serbian 
soldiers who were withdrawing, many of them appearing downcast.

<HEADLINE> Airbus Notes Soft Industry Downturn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LE BOURGET, France (AP) -- Airbus Industrie sees a  
softer-than-expected downturn in the aerospace industry and hopes 
to book around 300 orders for its aircraft in 1999, Chairman Noel 
Forgeard said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not as pessimistic as I was earlier,'' Forgeard said at a  
news conference at the Paris Air Show. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest air show, held every two years at Le Bourget  
airport north of Paris, opened to the public Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The air show, expected to draw some 300,000 visitors, is a forum  
for showing off the latest aerospace technology and for sealing and 
announcing lucrative contracts in the multi-billion dollar 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight-day air show opened Saturday to the press on an  
ominous note with the crash of a Russian Sukhoi-30 MK, a fighter 
jet making a demonstration flight. The two pilots safely ejected 
from the flaming aircraft which tumbled to the ground far from the 
crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, it was business as usual.  
</P>
<P>
	Airbus' Forgeard said the European consortium booked 560  
aircraft orders in 1998 with a total value of $39 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Including contracts to be unveiled during the air show, Airbus  
has booked a total of 190 orders since the beginning of this year, 
Forgeard said. Airbus plans to deliver 293 planes this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Airbus Military Co., the defense arm of Airbus  
Industrie, said it expects to receive firm commitments for its 
A400M military transportation aircraft project by early 2000. First 
deliveries are expected by 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	The commitments are expected to come out of discussions with  
seven European governments -- France, Germany, Italy, the U.K., 
Belgium, Spain and Turkey, an AMC statement said. The seven have 
expressed needs for a total of 288 A400M aircraft, to be designed 
to transport a 30-ton payload over a distance of up to 3,230 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The aircraft faces fierce competition from Lockheed Martin Corp.  
The U.S. defense aerospace group is trying to convince European 
governments to opt for its C130J, the latest version of its 
Hercules air transportation aircraft, which is already flying. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments, French aerospace group Dassault Aviation  
plans to split its military and civil businesses by the end of 1999 
to facilitate the integration of its defense unit into future 
European jet fighter programs, Chairman Serge Dassault said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, known for its Mirage and Rafale jet fighters, as  
well as for its Falcon business jets, will create two fully-owned 
units: Dassault Defense and Dassault Falcon, 
</P>
<P>
	Dassault Aviation has no immediate plan to float the new units  
on the stock market, Serge Dassault said.

<HEADLINE> Entry Finishes 1-2 at Hollywood Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- French-bred Silic scored a nose victory  
over Ladies Din in the $350,000 Shoemaker Breeder's Cup Mile on the 
turf at Hollywood Park on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two, racing as an entry, battled through the stretch after  
making their way through traffic in the race for 3-year-olds and 
up. Each carried 124 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Silic, ridden by Corey Nakatani, started slowly and was seventh  
among the eight runners through the first half-mile. Still fifth 
after three-quarters of a mile, he went wide on the turn into the 
stretch and took the lead. He was timed in 1:32.94. 
</P>
<P>
	Ladies Din, ridden by Kent Desormeaux, was fourth much of the  
race until driving to briefly catch the winner in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning entry paid $10.20, $8 and $5.40. The 3-1 second  
favorite Hawksley Hill, was third, one-half length back, and paid 
$3.20 to show. Poteen finished fourth, a neck behind Hawksley Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Brave Act, a slight favorite at 11-4, was fifth after staying  
near the middle of the pack throughout. Chullo was sixth followed 
by Fabulous Guy and Lord Smith. Indian Rocket was scratched on 
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Beats Argentina in Soccer 1-0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Joe-Max Moore scored in the 88th minute and  
Kasey Keller blocked a first-half penalty kick Sunday, leading the 
United States past Argentina 1-0 in an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, who entered the game as a substitute in the 60th minute  
for a hobbling Eddie Lewis, ran toward the top of the penalty area 
and accepted a backheel feed from Ernie Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Before an RFK Stadium crowd of 40,119, Moore's left-footed shot  
easily beat goalie German Burgos to the upper left corner. It was 
his 19th goal in international competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller made the most critical of his seven saves in the 42nd  
minute after referee Rodrigo Badilla penalized defender C.J. Brown 
of the United States for upending Gustavo Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez sent a low shot to Keller's left. Keller tricked him into  
shooting there by stutter-stepping to his right, then gobbling up 
the shot with a quick move the other way. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States improved to 3-1-3 since Bruce Arena took over  
as coach in November 1998. The Americans next play in the FIFA 
Confederations Cup in Mexico in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina, preparing for the Copa America Cup in Paraguay this  
month, tied Mexico 2-2 in Chicago on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> TWA, Union Reach Tentative Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Trans World Airlines and its major union  
representing flight attendants, mechanics and other workers reached 
a tentative agreement Sunday on a new contract, possibly averting a 
strike that could have jeopardized the long-struggling company. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Association of Machinists said it would cancel  
the rank-and-file voting that began last week, and then present the 
new contract offer to its members. The union represents 16,000 of 
TWA's 21,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders agreed there would be no work stoppages during the  
monthlong ratification process. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IAM will recommend to our members that they vote `yes' on  
ratification of these revised proposals, which represent a 
significant improvement over previous contract offers from TWA,'' 
union official William O'Driscoll said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA chief executive Bill Compton said the company ``recognizes  
that our employees need the largest raise we can profitably provide 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the new pact will be released Tuesday in Kansas City,  
Mo., where the union is based. Workers will begin voting on it on 
Wednesday. The airline is based in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis television stations reported that the new contract is  
for just 18 months rather than the previous 2 1/2-year offer. TWA 
spokesman Jim Brown would not comment on the length of the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA has survived two trips to bankruptcy court in the 1990s,  
largely because union members have given up salary and other 
benefits to keep the company afloat. The losses have been reduced 
in recent years, but the company has continued to lose money. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Compton warned that TWA ``simply does not have the  
resources to afford a strike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On May 28, TWA presented what it described as its ``last, best  
offer,'' and the rank-and-file had been voting on it even though it 
did not have the approval of union leaders. That deal would have 
brought TWA employees to about 90 percent of the airline industry 
standard by 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The new deal nullifies the previous bid and those earlier votes.  
</P>
<P>
	Compton said the sides continued to talk after the voting had  
begun on the last offer. Meetings on the new proposal began in 
earnest last Tuesday and negotiators worked virtually non-stop 
until Sunday morning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always had an interest in coming up with a package that  
would be endorsed by the Machinists,'' he said. ``It is always 
better to get a deal that is endorsed by both sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The airline's previous offer received little support. Union  
members had also cast ballots on whether to approve limited strikes 
targeting key flights during the Fourth of July weekend, typically 
one of the year's busiest weekends for airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Many union employees had expressed anger at the airline over the  
last proposal, saying they were getting nothing back after years of 
sacrificing wages. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Driscoll said he thought that rancor would dissipate after the  
employees see the latest contract proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers affected by the new offer include flight attendants,  
mechanics, ramp workers and passenger service personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees at the airline's domestic hub at Lambert Airport in  
St. Louis welcomed news of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The airline couldn't afford a strike, and neither could the  
members of the union,'' said Ted Evans, a skycap at Lambert for 24 
years. ``I'm very glad they've got it resolved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TWA suffered last year when baggage handlers, mechanics and ramp  
workers briefly walked off the job, effectively shutting down the 
airline's hub at Lambert Airport in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The union is seeking payback for years of what the airline  
acknowledges were subpar wages and cuts in benefits and retirement 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA hasn't turned a profit in 10 years. In 1998, the airline  
lost almost $5 per paying passenger for every 1,000 miles. Since 
1989, TWA has lost more than $2 billion.

<HEADLINE> Cate Blanchett Mulls Perks of Acting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Acting isn't everything for Cate Blanchett, the  
Oscar-nominated star of ``Elizabeth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But having a normal life isn't easy for the movie star who got  
married two years ago, so the best perks accompanying the filming 
of her upcoming movie, ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' in Rome, 
Naples, and Venice were the romantic locales. 
</P>
<P>
	``I finally had a honeymoon with my husband in Italy,''  
Blanchett says in Sunday's Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Australian actress also costars in the upcoming  
film ``An Ideal Husband,'' an adaptation of the Oscar Wilde play of 
the same name. She plays the overly moralistic Lady Gertrude 
Chiltern, a part she chose because of its inherent challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	I thought ``it would be interesting to play a prig who  
unravels,'' Blanchett said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe you have to fall in love with your character.  
It's important to present the unpalatable, flawed side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blanchett's other film credits include ``Pushing Tin,''  
``Paradise Road'' and ``Oscar and Lucinda.''

<HEADLINE> State Department Sending China Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering is  
going to Beijing to discuss NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy 
in Belgrade and repair faltering U.S.-China relations, Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said Pickering would lead  
a team of administration officials departing Monday for Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit comes as several matters have chilled bilateral  
relations: allegations of Chinese theft of U.S. nuclear secrets; 
stalled talks on China's entry into the World Trade Organization; 
and Congress is debating China's future trade status. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to NATO's errant bombing of the embassy May 7, China  
cut off military contacts, suspended the WTO talks and allowed 
demonstrators to stone the U.S. embassy in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese officials have demanded a full accounting of the  
incident and wants those responsible punished.

	Albright said Pickering would explain to the Chinese what went  
wrong when a U.S. plane bombed the embassy instead of the intended 
Serbian target several blocks away. She said he would also 
emphasize that ``this was a tragic accident,'' a conclusion the 
Chinese government officially has refused to accept. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickering will carry the message that U.S.-China relations are  
important, ``one that needs to get beyond this,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The relations have taken some steps backward as a result of the  
bombing, she said, ``but I believe that we must move forward, as do 
they, in terms of rekindling the WTO talks and other issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China and the United States this spring were within sight of a  
broad market-opening agreement as a prelude to China's entry to the 
WTO. But the talks slowed as a result of the nuclear theft charges, 
which heightened anti-Chinese sentiment in Congress, and then broke 
down after the Belgrade incident. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. negotiators insist that WTO agreement would benefit the  
United States, applying international trade rules to China and 
reducing tariffs that contributed to a $57 billion surplus in 
China's favor last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has begun its annual debate over whether to go along  
with President Clinton's decision to extend normal trade status to 
China for another year. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is expected to abide by that decision, as it has every  
year since 1980, but only after a noisy debate in which critics 
will assail China for its trade practices, human rights record and 
threats to U.S. security.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the former  
president who once called himself Mexico's favorite villain, left 
Mexico on Sunday after his first visit in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	In a near-unanimous show of disapproval, Mexicans vented their  
anger against Salinas, who left the country in disgrace in March 
1995, three months after the end of his six-year presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	He is widely blamed for the collapse of the Mexican peso three  
weeks after he left office, sending Mexico into an economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a public-relations effort, Salinas gave interviews to  
Mexico's two TV networks and offered a press conference, but his 
attempts to defend his image appeared to have failed. 
</P>
<P>
	At the press conference Saturday, he said that a ``tenacious''  
four-year media campaign had been waged against him. 
</P>

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Federal anti-narcotics agents raided 176  
properties -- including luxurious antique-furnished homes -- 
belonging to imprisoned bosses of the Cali drug cartel, authorities 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In operations that began last week, agents took control of  
houses, ranches, apartments and offices in 11 cities belonging to 
convicted drug traffickers Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rodriguez brothers were caught by police in 1995 and  
sentenced to 10 and 20 years in jail respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	The properties -- with an estimated value of $14.8 million -- had  
been registered in the name of third parties, said the DAS state 
security agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia enacted sweeping asset forfeiture legislation in 1996  
that allowed authorities to seize properties belonging to convicted 
drug traffickers.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- An armed gang posing as visitors to a  
Brazilian prison overpowered two guards Sunday and allowed 60 of 66 
inmates inside to flee, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gang of four pulled out guns as the guards opened the main  
gates at visiting time, detective Elias Kobachi said by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Some escapees fled in six cars they stole from where they were  
parked near the prison in Sumare, 110 miles northwest of Sao Paulo, 
she said. Only three inmates were immediately recaptured. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a week ago, in the biggest prison break in Brazil's  
history, 315 inmates fled a prison near Sao Jose dos Campos, in Sao 
Paulo state. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, some 2,200 inmates have escaped from prisons  
and precinct jails in the state. In 1998, the total was 5,888, 
according to police figures.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil is getting ready to offer  
sections of Latin America's largest country for exploration to 
foreign oil companies after the breakup of a 46-year state 
monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the world's biggest oil companies are to bid for 27  
potential oil and gas sites at a massive auction Tuesday and 
Wednesday. Among 37 bidders are Shell, Esso, Texaco and Mobil. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first auction of its kind since the state-owned  
Petrobras' monopoly was abolished almost four years ago. Petrobras 
will participate at the auction and may form partnerships with 
foreign firms. 
</P>
<P>
	David Zylberstztajn, director of the Brazil's National Oil  
Agency, the industry regulator, predicts that $15 billion to $20 
billion will be invested in Brazil over five years following the 
auction.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A leading Venezuelan historian on  
Sunday called for the armed forces to intervene if President Hugo 
Chavez uses a constituent assembly to dissolve Congress and the 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, the leader of a failed 1992 coup attempt, has said that  
an assembly to be elected July 25 to rewrite Venezuela's 
constitution should dissolve the other branches of government 
because they are corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	But historian Jorge Olavarria, who Sunday officially announced  
his candidacy for the election, said that would be the equivalent 
of a coup, in effect giving Chavez dictatorial powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition is expected to  
dominate the assembly. He argues that the assembly will have the 
right to shut down Congress and the courts, which he says would be 
replaced by institutions created by the assembly.

<HEADLINE> Astros Have Suffered Health Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- On the day Astros manager Larry Dierker had a  
seizure and collapsed in the Houston dugout during a game, former 
star pitcher J.R. Richard threw out the ceremonial first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	How eerie.  
</P>
<P>
	On July 30, 1980, Richard collapsed while working out in the  
Astrodome. Unlike Dierker, who had what physicians called a grand 
mal seizure, an ailment associated with epilepsy, Richard had a 
stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard fell along the first-base line, just a few feet from  
where Dierker collapsed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery was required to remove a blood clot in Richard's right  
arm, and the health problem pretty much ended the promising career 
of what was then one of baseball's most dominating pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker's difficulty, which forced suspension of Sunday's game  
against San Diego, is the latest in a line of non-baseball health 
problems to involve the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1962, Jim Umbricht came to the then-Houston Colt .45s and  
became one of the top relief pitchers in the game. Two years later, 
he died of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Wilson pitched two no-hitters for the Astros, set a club  
record with 18 strikeouts in a game in 1968 and made the NL 
All-Star team in 1971. He died in January 1975, asphyxiated in his 
car as it idled in his garage. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, first base coach Jose Cruz left the team May 10 for  
treatment for an irregular heartbeat. Six days later, hitting coach 
Tom McCraw left for treatment of prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker, who said he didn't really believe in ``the curse,''  
suggested that with the hundreds of players to wear the Houston 
uniform, ``some of them were bound to encounter bad luck and bad 
health along the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps Houston has had more than its fair share of  
misfortune,'' he added. ``But I don't think Stephen King will want 
to write a book about it.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Member Offered a Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Phil Coles could keep his seat on the  
International Olympic Committee while giving up his role with the 
2000 Sydney Games. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the unusual compromise put forward by Olympic leaders in  
a bid to close the five-month controversy swirling around the 
Australian IOC member. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the  
executive board proposed on Sunday that Coles resign from the board 
of the Sydney organizing committee in exchange for being allowed to 
remain an IOC member. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles -- who was already censured in March for his role in the  
Salt Lake City scandal -- has been under the threat of expulsion 
from the IOC for further alleged ethical misconduct, including 
compiling sensitive dossiers on his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive board had been expected to issue a final ruling on  
the Coles case Sunday, the first day of a weeklong series of 
Olympic meetings in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	The board examined the report of a three-member investigative  
panel but deferred a decision until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report is there,'' IOC director general Francois Carrard  
told a news conference. ``There was some discussion. I have no 
further comments. The decision will be tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sources said the delay allowed time for Coles to consider  
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, who has steadfastly refused to resign from his IOC or  
Sydney posts, was in Sydney on Sunday. He was expected to arrive in 
Seoul late Monday or Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise appeared intended to satisfy the demands of  
Sydney organizers, who have repeatedly pushed for Coles to be 
ousted from the local committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles temporarily stepped down from the Sydney board in February  
after being implicated in the Salt Lake vote-buying case. He has 
since been stripped of his role in organizing the Olympic torch 
relay in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	But organizing chief Michael Knight and other Australian Olympic  
officials have demanded that Coles leave for good, claiming the 
scandal was detracting from the games and scaring away sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Olympic rules, Coles has an automatic seat on the Sydney  
board as one of two IOC members from Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coles case has overshadowed other issues as the IOC meets in  
Seoul for a three-day executive board meeting, followed by a 
four-day session of the general assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of the session is Saturday's selection of the  
host city for the 2006 Winter Games. Six European cities are in the 
running. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the IOC meetings began, Coles expressed confidence he  
would be cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles told The Sun-Herald newspaper in Sydney he expected to  
reclaim his key posts in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll just be glad when all this business is finally put to  
rest,'' he said. ``I'll have more to say when my name is finally 
cleared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles reiterated his contention that he was the victim of a  
political vendetta in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe my name has been turned into a political football  
and I'm talking of people in high places on both sides of state 
politics,'' Coles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has been questioned three times by IOC investigators for  
alleged abuse of his office. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, he received a ``most severe'' warning from the IOC for  
accepting lavish travel and other incentives during Salt Lake's 
winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. Six members were expelled 
and four resigned in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles' case was left open amid further accusations of ethical  
violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC later examined claims by Coles' ex-wife that the couple  
received jewelry valued at $6,000 from a businessman associated 
with the Athens bid for the 1996 Games. No action was taken. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest investigation centers on accusations that Coles, and  
his partner Patricia Rosenbrock, had compiled secret dossiers on 
IOC members for Sydney's successful 2000 bid and passed them on to 
Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Pal Schmitt, an IOC vice president, has accused Coles of  
breaking ``unwritten ethical rules'' and acting ``against the 
dignity, the pride of IOC members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Dick Pound, another IOC vice president and a personal friend  
of Coles, dismissed the dossiers as ``normal chitchat'' among bid 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's done all the time,'' Pound said.

<HEADLINE> Shootings Prompt Rise in Therapy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Columbine High School shooting did more  
than shock Americans about the realities of teen-age violence. It 
also prompted them to examine their own children more closely. 
</P>
<P>
	Mental health clinics and therapists across the country say  
they've seen a surge of younger patients since the April 20 
shootings in Littleton, Colo., as concerned parents and educators 
seek help for kids whom they suspect of serious emotional problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to open up 12 more beds in the last six weeks for  
adolescents and children,'' said Roxane Harcourt, chief operating 
officer of Charter Indianapolis Health Care System. Harcourt said 
the hospital has seen a 30 percent increase in patients under 17 in 
the past six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Magellan Behavioral Health, which refers 64 million adults and  
children to mental-health programs nationwide, said its calls in 
May jumped 25 percent over the same month the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears that people all across the country are so shaken by  
this incident that they're not taking any chances,'' said Erin 
Somers, a spokeswoman for Columbia, Md.-based Magellan. 
</P>
<P>
	The massacre in Littleton, in which two students killed 12  
classmates, a teacher and themselves, followed other fatal school 
shootings in recent years in Pearl, Miss., West Paducah, Ky., 
Jonesboro, Ark., and Springfield, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings are making parents take more notice of the  
psychological needs of children. 
</P>
<P>
	``People and schools have become more aware that mental illness  
is out there,'' said Mary, whose 12-year-old son threatened another 
student and was diagnosed with manic depression shortly before the 
Littleton shootings. The secretary from Alexandria, Va., asked that 
her full name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
	Her son, Danny, told a fellow sixth-grader at his school last  
December that he planned to ``get a gun and kill her.'' That got 
Danny suspended for five days. At the time, even though he was 
being treated for depression, no one knew he suffered from bipolar 
disorder, a disease that produces extreme mood swings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now since Littleton, the school is more aware that kids suffer  
from mental illness,'' said Mary. ``If it happened now, they would 
have demanded Danny get a psychological evaluation before coming 
back to school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Danny would have been helped sooner, she believes.  
</P>
<P>
	Henry Gault, a child psychiatrist in the Chicago suburb of  
Northbrook, Ill., said he has received 15 referrals from schools to 
evaluate students over the past seven weeks, compared to the one or 
two he normally receives in the waning weeks of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been doing this for 20 years and I've never had this  
many,'' Gault said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Fassler, a child psychiatrist in Burlington, Vt., noted  
that despite heightened concerns, more needs to be done to treat 
mentally ill children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only one child in four receives the help they need,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tide-Canes Baseball Rivalry in Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- A matchup between Alabama and Miami in the  
College World Series is becoming a familiar sight. Hurricanes coach 
Jim Morris said it is developing into a regular rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've played them six times and we're 3-3,'' Morris said  
Saturday. ``We know we're going to have to play hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said pitching will be the difference when the top-seeded  
Hurricanes (47-13) play the Crimson Tide (52-14) on Sunday. Morris 
is going with right-hander Alex Santos (11-3, 3.10 ERA). 
</P>
<P>
	``Santos doesn't look like the kind of pitcher that gives up the  
kinds of runs that we've been getting,'' Alabama coach Jim Wells 
said. ``He doesn't walk very many people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells will counter with right-hander Manny Torres (10-2, 4.89  
ERA), who battled injuries and arm fatigue over the past two 
seasons. He expects to be challenged by the Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're an aggressive team,'' Torres said. ``They put the bat  
on the ball. But if I get into the groove early, I think I'll have 
a shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an elimination game, Oklahoma State (46-20) plays Rice  
(58-14). 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama leads the series against Miami 8-5 but the last three  
meetings have all come in Omaha. The Tide has a 16-game winning 
streak after beating Oklahoma State 11-3 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Santos was scheduled to start for the Hurricanes in the opener  
against Rice, but Morris put in David Gil shortly before the first 
pitch. Miami won 8-4 after trailing 4-0 in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It (the decision) had absolutely nothing to do with Alabama,''  
Morris said. ``I don't think you can look ahead in this tournament. 
If you start looking ahead, you'll be behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's other game, Oklahoma State coach Tom Holliday will  
start sophomore left-hander Matt Smith (9-5, 2.93 ERA) against the 
Owls. 
</P>
<P>
	``They play the game by the book,'' Holliday said. ``They bunt  
when they're supposed to. They hit and run when they're supposed 
to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys practiced minimally Saturday, holding a makeshift  
batting practice in shorts and T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	Right-hander Kenny Baugh (11-2, 2.25 ERA) will start for Rice as  
the Owls try to rebound from a tough loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a little psychologically impaired,'' Rice coach Wayne  
Graham said. ``We told our guys they're a four-game winning streak 
from a national title and they can't give in to any bad breaks.''

<HEADLINE> Knicks Search for Secrets to Spurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- The archive on ``How To Beat The Spurs''  
is not a voluminous one, which is what Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy 
learned when he started researching his next assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked our video coordinator: `Pull up all their losses. I  
want to see the teams that beat them in the last three months.' And 
he gives me this little stack of tapes,'' Van Gundy said. ``Baaaad 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking for a nugget. And what there was,'' he added,  
``were no nuggets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another daunting task awaited them Sunday as the New York Knicks  
had their first practice in preparation for for the NBA Finals, 
which begin Wednesday night at San Antonio's Alamodome. 
</P>
<P>
	How does a New York team missing two frontline starters, Patrick  
Ewing and Larry Johnson, stand a chance of beating a San Antonio 
team with two 7-footers, David Robinson and Tim Duncan, who have 
confounded even the healthiest of teams? 
</P>
<P>
	``Other guys are going to have to -- that old cliche -- step up.  
Do a little more in a lot of different areas. We still have enough 
guys to play,'' Van Gundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	But exactly how many guys they'll have, at least in Game 1,  
remained uncertain. Johnson, who sprained his knee in the clinching 
Game 6 against Indiana, said he plans to play sometime in the 
series even if he can't go in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not good,'' he said of his knee, which was bothering him so  
much at 6 a.m. Sunday that he called trainer Mike Saunders to 
request immediate treatment. ``Not good, But I'm going to be 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to get out there regardless,'' Johnson said.  
</P>
<P>
	In San Antonio, the Spurs had a day off from practice Sunday as  
the players further enjoyed the downtime they earned by disposing 
of the Portland Trail Blazers in a four-game sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio, which also swept the Los Angeles Lakers in the  
second round, hasn't lost since the second game of the first round 
against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teams that are inconsistent, or not as good, you can exploit  
because they have weaknesses,'' Van Gundy said of the Spurs. ``But 
this team really has no weaknesses, which is why they've won 10 
playoff games in a row, which is unheard of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Johnson can't play in Game 1, the Knicks would be expected to  
use a starting lineup of Chris Dudley at center, Kurt Thomas and 
Latrell Sprewell at forward and Allan Houston and Charlie Ward in 
the backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
	That would leave Marcus Camby and 41-year-old Herb Williams as  
the only big men coming off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	That size predicament had Van Gundy and his staff wondering  
whether to double-team Duncan and Robinson when they have the ball, 
as most teams do, or take their chances with single coverage on the 
Twin Towers and tight defense on the other three players. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what's going to be great to watch,'' Van Gundy said.  
``It's going to be a great, great decision for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs, meanwhile, are hoping rest doesn't lead to rust after  
their long layoff. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll also have to overcome the inclination of taking the  
Knicks lightly because of all their injury woes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it hurts them,'' forward Sean Elliott said. ``I think  
in spurts sometimes they're better without Patrick, but I couldn't 
see it for 48 minutes. They've played well, but I think against us 
they need some people who match up inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs and Knicks did not play each other during the regular  
season because of the lockout-shortened schedule, so there will be 
a greater degree of unfamiliarity in this series than there ever 
has been in an NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio swept the two-game season series in 1997-98, but  
those Knicks were nothing like the current squad -- an uptempo, 
athletic mix who were at their best playing like greyhounds against 
the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be tougher in transition against San Antonio  
because those guys run real well,'' said Camby, who provided the 
Knicks with a huge lift of the bench in the Indiana series. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Dudley: ``It definitely will be more difficult without  
Larry. He's been a huge part of our success and he's integral to 
our team, but we'll move forward if he can't play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At practice, Van Gundy showed the players a tape of the final  
seven minutes of Game 6 against Indiana and asked them to savor it 
for the rest of their lives -- but only after they forget about it 
for the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a special time, that's going to be a special memory,  
but hopefully there are more special memories to come,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Heaping praise on the Spurs, Van Gundy lauded them for  
recovering from their 6-8 start and for winning 42 of their last 48 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``They lost to Phoenix, Dallas, Sacramento in overtime and  
Minnesota. That's it since April 1,'' Van Gundy said. ``That's the 
stack. Four of 'em.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And with that, he headed back to his office, perhaps for another  
crack at deciphering the elusive secrets those four videos hold on 
how to beat the Spurs.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Want Bats To Perform Like Wood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- An NCAA panel on Saturday recommended that  
equipment manufacturers make college baseball's aluminum bats 
behave as much as possible like wooden bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Milton Gordon, chairman of the NCAA Baseball Research Panel and  
president of Cal State-Fullerton, cited player safety and the 
integrity of the game during a news conference between sessions of 
the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wooden bat risk levels should be the safety standard for all  
non-wooden bats,'' Gordon said. ``With regard to the issue of 
balance, the use of non-wooden bats has altered the nature of 
college baseball in recent years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel recommended delaying implementation of the wood-like  
standard until Jan. 1 so additional testing could be performed. The 
rules, if implemented, would be used next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's recommendations will be passed to the NCAA Baseball  
Rules Committee and the NCAA Executive Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of several baseball equipment manufacturers sat  
in on the announcement in the Rosenblatt Stadium press room and 
peppered Gordon and other panelists with questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Darby of Easton Sports expressed concern that manufacturers  
wouldn't be able to produce the new bats in time for next season if 
the NCAA keeps pushing back an Aug. 1 deadline for adopting new 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our biggest problem is how long is this going to take,'' Darby  
said. ``We were told last year this was going to be set up by now. 
If it's not ready, how can we make bats for next season?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Darby also objected to the panel's designation of a Baum Hitting  
Machine at the University of Massachusetts as the only device used 
to determine testing on the metal bats. Baum is one of Easton's 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel wants college bats to simulate the velocity of a  
batted ball using a ``major league baseball-quality, 34-inch, 
solid-wood bat.'' Darby questioned how the NCAA would determine 
which manufacturer's bat would establish the standard. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also recommended:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Testing speeds for baseballs and bat swings be increased from  
70 mph to 80 mph to better approximate game conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Additional testing to determine if a standard should be  
developed on how tight a regulation NCAA baseball should be wound. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Testing to gather data on the concept of ``work-hardening,''  
or whether a bat begins to perform better the more it is used. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of changes approved last year by the NCAA, many  
college baseball teams played this season with smaller bats that 
performed more like wood than the aluminum bats of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A record 62 home runs were hit in last year's College World  
Series and the tournament ended with Southern Cal's 21-14 victory 
over Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, six of the eight coaches in this year's CWS said  
they liked the way the reduced bats had performed this spring. Most 
said they wouldn't like the trend to continue toward wood-like 
bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford coach Mark Marquess, interviewed before the start of  
the Cardinal's game against Cal State-Fullerton, said he doesn't 
support additional changes at a time when record crowds are 
attending the College World Series and the NCAA's expanded 64-team 
bracket sent regionals to new areas of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who are we pleasing?'' Marquess asked. ``I hope we're pleasing  
our fans.''

<HEADLINE> Starr To Continue Clinton Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- He has been in office through three election  
seasons and is heading into a fourth. So where will Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr be in the year 2000? 
</P>
<P>
	He's not sure, Starr says of his nearly five-year investigation,  
declaring he still has work to do. 
</P>
<P>
	The next critical step is the trial of Webster Hubbell for  
allegedly concealing his own and Hillary Rodham Clinton's legal 
work on a fraudulent Arkansas land deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking forward to a trial this summer; that's what  
we're preparing for right now,'' Starr said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The work that Hubbell and Mrs. Clinton did on the 1,050-acre  
project called Castle Grande -- which was owned by Whitewater 
partner Jim McDougal and Hubbell's father-in-law -- was not revealed 
until the first lady's billing records turned up in the White House 
family residence in 1996 under still-unexplained circumstances. 
Prosecutors had been looking for the documents since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Mrs. Clinton's possible Senate bid from New York  
was affecting his office's decision-making, Starr said: ``We strive 
mightily while providing public information, public education, to 
divorce our decisions from politics whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr declined to give a time frame for completing his job,  
saying ``we recognize that we need to move forward promptly,'' but 
``certain things are not entirely under my control; in fact, some 
things are entirely out of my control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He cited less-than-complete cooperation as prolonging the probe.  
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell and other witnesses have not provided Starr with answers  
to key questions he is investigating, such as the role of Mrs. 
Clinton. Also, the White House has gone to court to challenge Starr 
on many aspects of his investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said he ultimately will file a final report on his  
investigation, as mandated by the independent counsel statute 
expiring this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made no decisions with respect to the specific  
contents of the report,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's TV appearance coincided with publication of excerpts  
from a new book that says in the days before President Clinton was 
questioned in Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit, Clinton's 
lawyer thought his client's ``Achilles' heel'' was not Monica 
Lewinsky but rather an Arkansas woman. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman had met Clinton four times in less than three months  
between his 1992 election and 1993 inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
	The book, by Bob Woodward of The Washington Post, says attorney  
Robert Bennett told Clinton in preparation for his testimony on 
Jan. 17, 1998, that ``your political enemies will eat you alive if 
there's anything in that deposition that isn't truthful. ... You 
are dead. You are dead!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I hear you,'' Clinton is said to have replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Woodward's book, ``Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of  
Watergate,'' says that in another conversation concerning the 
testimony, Bennett told Clinton: ``If you're caught ... in the 
White House, I'm not good enough to help you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a prison,'' the president is said to have replied. ``I  
purposefully have no drapes on the windows.'' As for women, ``I'm 
retired, I'm retired,'' he told Bennett, according to the book. 
Clinton was later impeached but survived the attempt to remove him 
from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett did not return a telephone call Sunday and the White  
House declined comment.

<HEADLINE> SeaWorld Whale Tries To Bite Trainer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A killer whale tried to bite a trainer during a  
show before hundreds of spectators at SeaWorld, but the trainer 
escaped injury by quickly jumping out of the water. 
</P>
<P>
	The show ended a few minutes earlier than usual Saturday after  
the 5,000-pound whale tried to ``nip'' the trainer, spokesman Bob 
Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Attack is definitely the wrong word,'' Tucker said. ``The  
trainer turned around and performed in the next show later that 
night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old female whale will be allowed to participate in  
shows, but trainers won't go in the water with her until officials 
determine what may have prompted the whale to try to bite the 
trainer. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're capable of doing tremendous damage,'' SeaWorld  
spokesman Mike Scarpuzzi said. ``But I think in this case, she (the 
whale) just basically said, `I need to communicate something here. 
Something's not right and I need to let you know.'''

<HEADLINE> NBA Finals May Give Spurs New Arena  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The Spurs have brought the NBA Finals to San  
Antonio, only to have the basketball championship series played in 
a football stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Home for the Spurs is the Alamodome.  
</P>
<P>
	At least for the moment.  
</P>
<P>
	It's a cavernous place where seats are plentiful and tickets are  
cheap by NBA standards. The Spurs would like to move into another 
more profitable facility as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning the NBA Finals over the New York Knicks could ultimately  
help the franchise -- the only major league sports team in town -- 
gain public support for a new taxpayer-funded arena. 
</P>
<P>
	That could prevent the Spurs from leaving town, something team  
owners insist they don't plan to do but a reality in the big-money 
world of sports that can't be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to stay in San Antonio,'' Spurs chairman Peter Holt  
said. ``We're going to do everything we can to make that happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardly a glamour team cheered on by celebrities, the San Antonio  
Spurs are an unconventional squad struggling to survive in a 
blue-collar city. They're a team searching for national identity 
and local respect. Nothing underscores that more than the Spurs' 
arena predicament. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing in the old HemisFair Arena, built in the late  
1960s, the Spurs of the former American Basketball Association 
moved into the new Alamodome in 1993 with the idea it would be a 
temporary arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving out hasn't been easy.  
</P>
<P>
	In the Alamodome, a giant indoor stadium that can seat up to  
65,000 for football, the basketball court is located at one end of 
the facility with a massive blue curtain blocking off the rest of 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 40,000 can be seated for a basketball game if all the  
dome's upper decks are open. Sometimes seats near the rafters are 
sold for $5 or $8. 
</P>
<P>
	Team executives have floated ideas for using tax money to help  
build a smaller arena built for basketball and equipped with 
lucrative luxury suites, something the Spurs contend they need to 
profit in the NBA and to pay the big contract second-year star Tim 
Duncan will soon require. 
</P>
<P>
	This past year the Spurs and private developers pushed an arena  
plan that would use tax-increment financing -- property taxes on new 
development in a specified zone -- to finance a new $157 million 
basketball facility in an abandoned limestone quarry. The Spurs 
pledged to chip in $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The North East School District, the taxing entity that would  
have had to come up with the bulk of the funding, balked, saying 
school children's money shouldn't be put toward a private sports 
business. The plan died. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, other cities with basketball arenas and no team, such  
as Nashville and New Orleans, eye the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week Holt was pressed by reporters about whether the  
franchise has talked to Baltimore about a move. Holt would not say 
he'd spoken with Baltimore officials but confirmed a number of 
cities remain interested. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving away could be financially tempting.  
</P>
<P>
	In San Antonio, the Spurs are in the No. 37 television market,  
the smallest in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	The franchise must depend on individuals and a few corporations  
for profits because of the dearth of major companies here. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs have always been careful with costs.  
</P>
<P>
	Even into the early 1990s, the team took commercial flights to  
keep its budget low. David Robinson, the 7-foot-1 star center who 
sometimes had to crouch into a coach seat, wrote a letter to the 
then-owner requesting that the Spurs spring for charters. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson gave the local newspaper a copy of the letter to  
publish. Charter flights soon commenced. 
</P>
<P>
	It's widely believed in San Antonio that a new arena plan will  
emerge after the NBA Finals. Holt and others connected with the 
team have indicated the Spurs need to get a proposition before the 
voters by January. 
</P>
<P>
	If the way the city is reacting to the NBA Finals is any  
indication, support for the Spurs that once was confined to diehard 
sports fans now is infecting the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	The players feel the enthusiasm. Now that the Spurs know they'll  
face New York, no less, an almost giddy attitude prevails. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that there are going to be stars and people in the  
stands. We know it's Madison Square Garden,'' Spurs forward Sean 
Elliott said of the road games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys are getting excited with all the hype,'' added guard  
Mario Elie, a New York native. ``Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, Puff 
Daddy, everybody's going to be at the games. So it's going to be 
nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those sentiments seems to reflect that of the entire city, where  
Spurs souvenir stands are popping up on street corners and 
motorists are decorating their car windows with Spurs logos using 
white shoe polish. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a chance to do something special for San Antonio,''  
Elie said. ``This is a great situation.''

<HEADLINE> Exercise Helps Women Quit Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Women who exercise vigorously while trying to  
quit smoking are twice as likely to kick the habit than wannabe 
ex-smokers who don't work out regularly, a new study finds. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also offers good news to female smokers who fear that  
giving up tobacco and nicotine will lead to weight gain. 
Researchers found that women who worked out as they tried to quit 
gained only about half the weight of those who did not exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say that definitively this will help all people, but  
given all of the other health benefits associated with regular 
exercise I would certainly encourage people trying to quit smoking 
to talk to their physicians about starting a program,'' said Bess 
Marcus, an associate professor of psychiatry and human behavior at 
Brown University and the study's lead author. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings appear in Monday's Archives of Internal Medicine.  
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at The Miriam Hospital in Providence, R.I., followed  
281 healthy but sedentary female smokers who attended a 12-week 
program to stop smoking. About half of the women participated in 
supervised workouts three times a week during the program while the 
others did not. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 134 women in the group who exercised regularly, 19.4  
percent kicked the habit for at least two months after their 
program ended while 10.2 percent of the 147 non-exercisers did the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months later, the comparison of those still smoke-free was  
16.4 percent to 8.2 percent, respectively, and 11.9 percent vs. 5.4 
percent a year later. The women ranged between ages 18 and 65 and 
had smoked routinely for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There seems to be a new drug every day to help you quit  
smoking,'' Marcus said in a telephone interview Sunday. ``But this 
study suggests that there's a drug-free alternative to quitting 
smoking if that's what you prefer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the researchers at Miriam Hospital studied only women  
smokers, men who want to quit should expect similar results, said 
Dr. Michael Roizen, head of anesthesiology and critical care at the 
University of Chicago's Pritzker School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it (gender) makes any difference,'' said Roizen,  
a health and lifestyle modification enthusiast who was not involved 
in the study. ``I think you almost have to do some sort of exercise 
to be successful at quitting.''

<HEADLINE> Stanford's Wayne Takes On Fla. St. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Florida State's Matt Diaz and Marshall  
McDougall are the kind of sluggers who might concern opposing 
pitchers. Stanford's Justin Wayne is worried about the Seminoles' 
whole lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne throws for sixth-seeded Stanford (49-13) against the  
second-seeded Seminoles (54-12) on Monday at the College World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	In an elimination game, Texas A&AMP;M (52-17) plays Cal  
State-Fullerton (49-13). 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne (9-1, 4.92 ERA) is another in a string of standout  
pitchers from Stanford like Jack McDowell, Mike Mussina and Jeff 
Austin, last year's top draft pick by the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	In his two years, Wayne has a 15-1 record for the best winning  
percentage in school history. The sophomore right-hander from 
Honolulu has 131 strikeouts in 20 starts this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne said Sunday he's ready for McDougall, who hit six home  
runs in one game last month at Maryland, and Diaz, who hit two in 
Florida State's 7-3 defeat of the Aggies in the CWS opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are some big bats coming at us,'' Wayne said. ``But I  
watched their game against Texas A&AMP;M and it's not just those two. 
It's definitely one through nine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford coach Mark Marquess said it's not smart to focus on any  
hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with the postseason is you can shut down the  
so-called main guys and someone else can come back and hurt you,'' 
Marquess said. ``Wayne's got all the pitches and has good control. 
We're just going to try to not give up anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles counter with one of the top pitching staffs in the  
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Starter Jon McDonald (9-2, 3.24), a right-hander, struck out 113  
this season. Reliever Chris Chavez (7-5) struck out six over the 
final five innings of Florida State's win over Texas A&AMP;M. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Seminoles certainly have no monopoly on power hitters.  
Joe Borchard, Josh Hochgesang and Edmund Muth all homered to help 
Stanford beat Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late game, Texas A&AMP;M coach Mark Johnson is hoping the  
Aggies can find their power game. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Texas A&AMP;M hit 127 home runs to break the previous  
school record of 88. Daylan Holt led the nation with 34 homers but 
went 1-for-3 in the loss to Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was one of our fears coming in,'' Johnson said. ``Good  
pitching is going to beat us. We've hit a lot of home runs against 
good pitching this year, but we have not found our stroke yet in 
Omaha.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he would start either left-hander Matt Ward (8-0,  
3.52) or first-round draft pick Chance Caple (8-5, 4.26), a righty 
who was chosen 30th overall by the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Left-hander Jon Smith (7-0, 2.71) will throw for Fullerton. The  
Titans killed themselves with five errors in losing to Stanford, 
including three throwing errors by reliever Marco Hanlon. Still, 
Smith expressed faith in his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can't do the job, I do feel like we've got a good enough  
bullpen to take care of it,'' Smith said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Slightly Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar shot up against the yen Monday  
morning as Japan's central bank snapped up dollars to curb a rise 
in the Japanese currency. Tokyo stock prices rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 119.82 yen at late morning, up 1.16 yen  
from its level of 118.66 from late Friday in Tokyo, and also above 
its late New York level of 118.08 yen, also Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice finance minister for  
international affairs, confirmed that the Bank of Japan had stepped 
into foreign exchange markets to stem a rising yen. Asked if the 
BOJ had intervened Monday, Sakakibara said, ``Yes. We took 
appropriate steps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Sakakibara declined to say at what level and in what  
amount the BOJ intervened, dealers said the bank may have bought as 
much as dlrs 3 billion Monday morning, and total buying could top 
dlrs 5 billion before the Asian session was through. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakakibara, known as ``Mr. Yen'' for his influence on currency  
markets, said Japan is strongly resolved to prevent an excessively 
fast strengthening of the yen to ensure economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market shouldn't underestimate our firm intention,''  
Sakakibara said. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen is a threat to the exporters that power Japan's  
economy because it makes their goods more expensive overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen has been rising against the dollar since the government  
announced last week that Japan's gross domestic product grew a 
robust 1.9 percent in the first quarter of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	In stock trading, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average  
gained 107.00 points, or 0.62 percent, to finish the morning 
session at 17,305.55. On Friday, the average finished up 95.93 
points, or 0.56 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 10.27 points, or 0.74 percent, to 1,389.95. The 
TOPIX rose 13.07 points, or 0.96 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices were boosted by the lower yen and strong foreign  
buying following the release of much better-than-expected 
first-quarter gross domestic product data last week.

<HEADLINE> Robertson Reportedly Gave to Org. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson  
donated $1 million of his own money last year to help the religious 
organization through its financial crisis, Newsweek reported 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine, quoting unidentified sources, said Robertson  
recently has taken a more hands-on approach to the organization he 
formed in 1989 as it struggles with a drop in membership, faltering 
revenues and a losing battle with the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Christian Coalition is in the midst of a major  
reorganization after deciding not to contest an IRS conclusion that 
certain of its activities were too partisan for the group to enjoy 
tax-exempt status. 
</P>
<P>
	The group, which distributes voter guides at churches around the  
country, has been identified with conservative Republican 
candidates for office. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Coalition officials estimate the organization will owe  
the IRS between $300,000 and $400,000 in back taxes. Newsweek 
estimated that the organization has debts of $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment Sunday from the Christian  
Coalition.

<HEADLINE> Father of Ecology May Be Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARABOO, Wis. (AP) -- Aldo Leopold earned his reputation as the  
father of modern ecology while working with his family to return a 
piece of abused land to its natural beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	A half-century later, within two miles of his family farm in  
southwestern Wisconsin, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposes 
an 8,400-acre refuge in his name. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency wants to restore wetlands that once covered much of  
the area proposed for the Aldo Leopold National Wildlife Refuge. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is a fitting memorial to Leopold, it has to be a place  
where people can learn,'' said Nina Leopold Bradley, daughter of 
the famed naturalist. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1930s and '40s, the Leopold family trekked each weekend  
to a worn-out farm once owned by a bootlegger, planting 3,000 
native pines each year. A chicken coop became the family's living 
quarters, dubbed the Leopold ``shack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They bought the land after the bootlegger abandoned it. In one  
of Leopold's books, he wrote that ``the bootlegger, who hated this 
farm, skinned it of residual fertility, burned its farmhouse, threw 
it back into the lap of the county (with delinquent taxes to 
boot).'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the family worked, they studied the landscape and took notes,  
recorded weather patterns, bird migrations, animal tracks and 
events on the land. His best-known book, ``Sand County Almanac,'' 
was inspired by his experiences on the Baraboo farm. 
</P>
<P>
	Leopold's landmark 1933 book, ``Game Management,'' defined the  
fundamental skills for managing and restoring wildlife populations 
and led him to serve as a conservation adviser to the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after the book's publication, he was appointed chairman of  
the University of Wisconsin's new Department of Game Management, a 
position he held until his death in 1948 from a heart attack while 
helping his neighbors fight a grass fire. He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
	Land for the proposed refuge, between Baraboo and Wisconsin  
Dells, would cost $12 million to acquire and would be in addition 
to about 10,000 nearby acres already protected by landowners. The 
Leopold shack has been preserved. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're talking about a much more valuable place for protecting  
wildlife,'' said Charlie Luthin, executive director of the 
Wisconsin Wetlands Association, a statewide organization dedicated 
to wetland protection and conservation. 
</P>
<P>
	The refuge would be located at the convergence of Leech Creek  
and the Baraboo River. Some areas would be open to sporting 
enthusiasts since restoring the creek could increase the habitat 
for trout. 
</P>
<P>
	Wildlife officials also hope the restoration would attract more  
deer, ducks, geese, muskrats and wading birds, including herons and 
egrets. The refuge could include a visitor's center, overlook sites 
for bird watchers, hiking trails and hunting areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan faces some opposition, mostly from neighboring farmers  
reluctant to sell their land. They say the area isn't needed 
because there are other nearby refuges. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Gumz owns 1,500 acres in the core of the proposed refuge  
area, where he grows corn, mint, potatoes and soybeans. He said a 
wildlife refuge may be needed in other areas of the state, but not 
near his farm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got so many geese it's unbelievable,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sauk County's Board of Supervisors voted in April against the  
refuge, but the Fish and Wildlife Service isn't bound by local 
government's opposition. Other county boards have not yet voted. 
</P>
<P>
	The wildlife service can't purchase more property until after an  
environmental assessment is completed this spring. So far, the 
government owns just under 10 percent of the refuge area. 
</P>
<P>
	Water once covered much of the proposed refuge area. In 1918,  
farmers began digging ditches with a steam-powered engine and 
channeled the creek. Since then, farmers have depended on the 
drainage system that crisscrosses the land to keep it from being 
overrun with water. 
</P>
<P>
	Luthin, former executive director of the Aldo Leopold  
Foundation, said he hopes farmers would come to recognize the 
potential benefits for them that come from wetland restoration. 
Restoring wetlands would help prevent the flooding of farm fields, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The creek can only hold so much water,'' Luthin said. ``The  
restored lands could work as a sponge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Lenz, project manager for the wildlife service, said  
farmers who don't want to sell their land won't be affected by 
wetland restoration nearby. The service can restore wetlands 
without flooding neighboring property that remains in private 
hands, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who lives on the farm where her father once worked,  
said the plan would only be successful if it's a community project 
involving farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a quote from Dad,'' said Bradley, 82, a plant  
ecologist. ``'There are two things that interest me -- the 
relationship of people to each other, and the relationship of 
people to land.' 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's imposed on them, it will be a disaster,'' she said.  
``My father worked very hard to help farmers value the natural 
system as well as make a living.''

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Mulls Stock Float </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG has retained two U.S.  
investment banks to advise on a potential stock market float of its 
aerospace arm, The Sunday Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's objective would be to establish a market value for  
DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG, paving the way for future alliances 
or mergers with other aerospace groups, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler representatives were not immediately available  
for comment on the report. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler and the investment banks, Goldman Sachs and  
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, are thought to be considering floating 
a stake of 20 percent to 30 percent in the aerospace arm, probably 
early next year, The Sunday Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new issue would value the subsidiary at about $9.6 billion  
and the shares would be listed in New York and Frankfurt, it said. 
A New York listing could make it easier for the aerospace arm to 
link with a U.S. group. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunday Times said Manfred Bischoff, DaimlerChrysler  
Aerospace's chairman, is known to be holding talks with U.S. giant 
Lockheed Martin Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper said Bischoff flew to the United States this weekend,  
having canceled a press conference due to be held in conjunction 
with the Paris Air Show. 
</P>
<P>
	British Aerospace PLC, which jilted DaimlerChrysler Aerospace  
early this year when it chose to buy General Electric Co. PLC's 
Marconi electronics business, remains eager to link with the 
aerospace company, The Sunday Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler Aerospace and Spain's state-owned Construcciones  
Aeronauticas SA on Friday unveiled an agreement to merge under the 
umbrella of a new company in the DaimlerChrysler group. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain's Casa is a small but significant player in Europe's  
aerospace industry, with minority interests in both Airbus 
Industrie and the Eurofighter strike jet consortium, two key 
pan-European programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunday Times added that the appointment of Goldman Sachs and  
Morgan Stanley as prospective global coordinators of the 
DaimlerChrysler Aerospace issue would be a blow to Deutsche Bank 
AG, which is historically Daimler's financial adviser.

<HEADLINE> Ricky Martin Lets True Feelings Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Forget machismo. Latino pop star Ricky Martin  
lets his true feelings show. 
</P>
<P>
	In a new book, ``Ricky Martin: Red-Hot and on the Rise,'' the  
Puerto Rican singing sensation recaps his career, which began with 
the teen group Menudo, and describes his openness about shedding 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, the Menudo rule was that you had to leave the  
band once you reached 17,'' Martin says in an excerpt published 
Sunday in the New York Post. ``My last concert was in Puerto Rico, 
my hometown. I am a man who cries, and I cried a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old born Enrique Martin Morales had a similar  
reaction after the 1991 release of his debut solo album. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time I heard my song on the radio, I cried,'' he  
said. ``Men do cry. It's a very healthy habit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After dominated Spanish-language song charts internationally,  
Martin made his first English-language album, which has become a 
top seller in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Tear Gas Fired As Vietnamese Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Riot police fired tear gas Sunday to quell  
clashes between Vietnamese at a refugee camp where one building was 
set on fire by a homemade bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	At least eight people were injured in the clashes. Police said  
it was not immediately known how many people were involved in the 
violence at the Pillar Point camp, which houses more than 1,000 
Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio Hong Kong said a gasoline bomb thrown during the fighting  
set ablaze one building in the camp. The fire was quickly 
extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
	A police spokeswoman said that police fired three chemical smoke  
grenades to halt the clashes and that the situation was under 
control. The injured were hospitalized, she said. Their condition 
was not known. 
</P>
<P>
	Police surrounded the camp after the violence and stopped people  
from entering. Pillar Point is an open camp that allows the 
Vietnamese to work outside. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately known what triggered the clash, but there  
is a long history of ethnic tensions between south and north 
Vietnamese in Hong Kong centers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, 24 Vietnamese were burned to death in the Shek Kong  
camp in fighting between south and north Vietnamese. The camp was 
later shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	Since communist North Vietnam defeated the U.S.-backed South in  
1975, ending the Vietnam War, nearly 223,000 Vietnamese have passed 
through Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Hong Kong government abolished its 23-year-old  
policy of offering temporary asylum to the Vietnamese and shut down 
government-run detention centers for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Vietnamese who arrive illegally now are housed in detention  
centers run by charitable organization until arrangements can be 
made to send them back. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong still harbors more than 2,000 Vietnamese asylum  
seekers. About 1,500 have been granted refugee status and are 
awaiting resettlement overseas. The rest are waiting to be deported 
back home.

<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Johnny Torres and Edwin Gorter each scored  
in the final six minutes of regulation to lead the New England 
Revolution to a 4-3 shootout victory over the Miami Fusion on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	New England tied the game 2-2 on Torres' goal in the 85th  
minute. Miami's Diego Serna scored two minutes later to make it 
3-2, but Gorter scored with 1:51 remaining to send the match into a 
shootout before a crowd of 19,069 at Foxboro Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The Revolution (6-6) won their third straight and extended  
Miami's winless streak on the road to 11 matches, including eight 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	In the shootout, Torres, John Harkes and Gorter scored on New  
England's first, second and fourth attempts against Miami 
goalkeeper Jeff Cassar. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Gutierrez's first attempt for Miami (4-10) bounced off the  
left goalpost. Maurizio Rocha's shot was stopped by New England 
goalkeeper Jeff Causey and a shot by Jeremy Aldrich sailed wide 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams matched first-half goals. Torres put New England ahead  
in the 20th minute, converting a long kick from goalkeeper Walter 
Zenga. Miami countered in the 24th minute when Gutierrez placed a 
23-yard direct kick from the right side over Zenga's right 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami outshot New England 14-12 and had a 14-9 edge in corner  
kicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyrone Marshall put Miami ahead 2-1 in the 64th minute of the  
match, beating a New England defender for possession of the ball 
inside the penalty box. 
</P>
<P>
	Torres tied the match for New England on a penalty kick after  
Miami defender Arley Palacios took down Revolution forward Jamar 
Beasley with a tackle from behind in the low left corner of the 
penalty box. 
</P>
<P>
	Serna regained the lead for Miami when Gutierrez intercepted  
Zenga's low clearing kick and knocked the ball back into the 
penalty box, where Welton slid the ball left to the Fusion's 
leading scorer.
