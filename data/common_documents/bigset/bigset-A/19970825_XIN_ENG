<HEADLINE> Pakistan Encourages Foreign Investment in Hydel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government will
announce some lucrative incentives soon to attract foreign
investment in the country's hydel power sector instead of thermal
sector, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The government had recently directed the Board of Investment to
discourage further foreign investment in the thermal sector and
refrain from signing any new thermal power generation pact, said
the sources in the Ministry of Investment.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the government wanted to alleviate the
import bill of fuel, which is consumed in bulk by the thermal
power projects, and the only way to do this is to discourage
further investment in this sector.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country's northern areas are good for developing
hydel power projects, where small dams can be built easily to
generate cheaper energy, they said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Wilson Kipketer of Denmark beat his
own world record in the men's 800 meters when he posted a time of
one minute, 41.11 seconds at the Cologne Grand Prix meet Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan-born Dane knocked out 0.13 seconds from the previous

weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Paced by Kenyan David Kiptoo in the first lap, Kipketer burst

he first equaled it earlier this summer and then finally broke it
in Zurich, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Donovan Bailey of Canada, the Olympic champion, surged ahead
shortly after the start and powered past three American sprinters
to win the 100-meter dash.
</P>

American in the race, Vincent Henderson, was fourth in 10.24.

fastest woman over the distance in Brussels two days ago with a
time of 10.76, clocked 21.93 over the 200m Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Merlene Ottey, the Jamaican veteran who was bronze medalist in
Athens, was second in 22.17, while Juliet Cuthbert, another
Jamaican, was third in 22.49.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 400-meter hurdles, Athens bronze medalist Bryan
Bronson of the United States posted a time of 47.94 seconds to

</P>
<P>
The women's 400-meter hurdles also saw the defeat of the
reigning world champion, Nezha Bidouane of Morocco. Deon Hemmings
of Jamaica, the Olympic champion and silver medalist in Athens,
won the race in 53.54 seconds. Bidouane, trailing badly with two

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Reiterates Position on Deployment of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will deploy the Russian
S-300 surface-to-air missiles as planned, as long as Turkey
continues to occupy part of the island and poses a threat to the
island's survival, Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides has
reiterated.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Greek Cypriot daily Agon (Struggle),
published here today, Kasoulides said "various western countries,
including the U.S., are disgruntled with the purchase of the
Russian missiles, but the S-300 system will be deployed unless the
reasons for which we were obliged to order them no longer exist."
</P>
<P>
These reasons, he explained, will cease to exist when people in
Cyprus feel their security is not endangered to a degree that the
missiles are needed.
</P>
<P>
The missiles, which the Cypriot government purchased from
Russia early this year to protect its military bases, are
expected to be deployed sometime in the summer of 1998. Turkey
has threatened it will launch preemptive strike against Cyprus
if they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides also disclosed that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash has turned down a proposal from President Glafcos
Clerides, during the latest round of U.N.-sponsored talks earlier
this month, to discuss reduction of military forces and
equipment and the demilitarization of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
On future effort toward an overall settlement on Cyprus issue,
Kasoulides said it's a process to be affected by many factors,
like the Turkey-European Union relations and Greece-Turkey
relations. But these factors are "all part and parcel of a wide
spectrum of moves due to take place" in the process, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey and Denktash have to choose between a return to the
negotiating table or implementation of their threats for partial
integration of northern Cyprus with Turkey," Kasoulides said.
</P>
<P>
They cannot have both, he underlined, noting that a move to
integrate the occupied part of Cyprus would result in Greece's
blocking of Turkey's proposed accession to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Denktash threatened at the end of the talks with Clerides that
he would not return to the negotiating table until the EU either
postpones or reverts its decision to start accession talks with
Cyprus scheduled for early 1998.
</P>
<P>
Turkey on the other hand has also threatened to integrate the
northern part of Cyprus if Europe goes ahead with membership talks
with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> At Least 20 Bangladeshis Injured in General Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- At least 20 persons were injured
here, two of them including a photo journalist critically, in
today's Dawn-to-Dusk general strike called by Bangladesh's
opposition parties in protest against the fuel price hike, said
informed sources.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said the major incidents took place in front of
the National Press Club this afternoon while police lobbed several
rounds of teargas shells to disperse the opposition activists.
</P>
<P>
The largest opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and
the Jamaat-e-Islami enforced the nationwide strike as the
government, which on August 18 raised the prices of all petroleum
products, rejected their call to rescind its decision on the price
hike.
</P>
<P>
The sudden price increase sparked off street protests by
opposition groups and transport unions. In today's strike hours,
at least eight BNP leaders and workers were arrested in Dhaka when
they were allegedly breaking vehicles and harassing passengers.
</P>
<P>
Pro-strike elements also halted trains by creating barricades
in different places including Joypurhat, Dinajpur, Kushtia,
chittagong and Comilla districts.
</P>
<P>
In most parts of Bangladesh, today's strike, however, was
peacefully only with disruption of normal life. Most of the shops,
business establishments and educational institutions remained
closed while government offices functioned with less attendance.
</P>
<P>
In the second-largest city of Chittagong, no untoward incident
was reported from any parts of the area, said Ashraful Huda, the
head of the local police department.

<HEADLINE> UAE Embarks on Ambitious Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) has embarked on its long-awaited privatization program,
inviting independent power operators to pre-qualify for the
construction of a new power plant in Abu Dhabi.
</P>
<P>
The Privatization Committee for the Water and Electricity
Sector (PCWES) of Abu Dhabi, a government body set up last year
to oversee privatization of public utilities, invited the bids
in today's newspaper and radio advertisements.
</P>
<P>
"The PCWES of the government of Abu Dhabi formally announced
the commencement of a competitive process to select an
experienced developer or consortium to develop, own and operate
the Taweelah A2 power and desalination plant," the advertisements
said.
</P>
<P>
The developer would own 40 percent of the company that would
be set up to develop, own and operate the project. The remaining
equity will be held by the Abu Dhabi government and local
investors.
</P>
<P>
The successful bidder would undertake to build a power
generation and desalination facility at the Taweelah site,
northeast of Abu Dhabi city.
</P>
<P>
The project will have a 480 to 580 megawatts of electricity
generating capacity and 50 million gallons of water production
capacity a day. The power station must be completed by the year
2001, the advertisements said.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dhabi set up the PCWES last year to oversee the
privatization of its water and electricity services, one of the
heavily-subsidized sectors which have consumed a large portions of
the government's investments.
</P>
<P>
Like other Gulf Arab states, the UAE is trying to reduce
reliance on the dominant public sector and give private
investors a bigger role.

<HEADLINE> Oman's GDP to Remain Growth Despite Lower Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Oman's gross domestic product
(GDP) is set to grow 4 percent in 1997 despite an expected
decline in the oil sector because of lower crude prices, an
official report said today.
</P>
<P>
"The Omani economy is expected to record a real growth of at
least 4 percent (in GDP) this year compared with 6.5 percent in
1996. Inflation will remain below one percent," the report by the
Abu Dhabi-based Arab Monetary Fund (AMF) said.
</P>
<P>
The 4 percent growth this year was considered high because
of an expected decline in the oil sector in Oman and neighboring
Gulf states whose economies are seriously reliant on oil exports.
</P>
<P>
Oil analysts said the decline in the oil sector is due to a
forecast drop in crude prices, which will likely average 17 to 19
U.S. dollars a barrel this year compared with over 20 dollars a
barrel in 1996. They noted that oil production in Oman and other
Gulf states will remain unchanged this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the AMF report said that the predicted GDP growth this
year is to be achieved because the government has carried out
economic reforms to diversify its income resources in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
The reforms include privatization, improvement of investment
and taxation laws, and fresh financial incentives for industrial
and other productive projects.
</P>
<P>
The report said the reforms have started to pay off, with the
non-oil sector surging by more than 5 percent annually over
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
"The oil sector is giving ground to the non-oil sector as a
result of economic diversification plans and other reform
programs," the AMF report said.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a decline in the oil sector this year, but all
other sectors will grow. This will positively affect the overall
GDP," said the report.
</P>
<P>
According to figures of the AMF, an affiliate of the Arab
League, Oman achieved a surplus of some 60 million dollars in
the first quarter of this year, with revenues standing at 1.2
billion dollars and spending at around 1.14 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The surplus compares to a projected deficit of 683.3 million
dollars for the whole of 1997," the report said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President: Colonial Structure Still </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe still has the daunting
task of transforming entrenched colonial structures 17 years
after independence from British rule, President Robert Mugabe
said today.
</P>
<P>
"We possess political power and do now fly a new national flag
and sing our own national anthem," said Mugabe during the burial
of national hero and veteran nationalist, George Marange at the
national shrine in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe who has been in power since independence in 1980,
observed that while a few blacks had made it in the business
world, the majority in this southern African nation of about 12.4
million people, remained poor.
</P>
<P>
The poor were subsisting on scanty agricultural incomes and
poor wages, he said.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that not much had been done to redress ownership
and distribution of national assets, he said, "even the current
national efforts at wealth creation continue to unfold in the
context of inherited colonial property relations largely woven
around race."
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said recent nationwide demonstrations by ex-freedom
fighters who accused the government and ruling Zanu (PF)
leadership of neglecting, were manifestations of failure to
create "greater" wealth for the people.
</P>
<P>
"They want food, dress, homes, good health, good education,
skills and jobs and above all, economic empowerment," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "this gift of precious peace and stability we
cannot afford to lose and accordingly, we should never deviate
from the charted path of unity on which it is founded."

The Chinese eleven, the first one to book a berth in the

The two teams fought to a 0-0 tie in the first half and neither

Dmytro Nazarov opened the scoring for the Ukrainian team at the

AMMAN, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Some Jordanian opposition parties
still stick to their stance of boycotting the parliamentary

The third meeting for dialogue between the government and the

CATANIA, Sicily, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Hosts Italy powered into the
semi-finals of the Universiade soccer tournament after scoring a 4-0
victory over the Netherlands at Borsellino on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Italians, who got the signal of advance only at the last minute
of the group competitions, played much better today.
</P>
<P>
Yet they could not find a quick way of scoring and had to wait
until the 44th minute of the first half.
</P>
<P>
Alessandro Ambrosi finally opened the scoring gate for the Italians
with a thundering shot which beat the Dutch goal-keeper.
</P>
<P>
The second half became merely a scoring practice for the Italians
as Ambrosi completed his hat-trick by scoring two more goals at the
60th and 76th minutes respectively.
</P>
<P>
Edoardo Gorini completed the 4-0 victory for the host team with a
goal at the 85th minute.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus: Human Rights Are A Must to Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides today reiterated that human rights and
fundamental freedoms must be guaranteed in any proposed solution
to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a public rally in the eastern town of Paralimni,
Kasoulides said "we shall not bargain our human rights," Cypriot
TV stations reported.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has accused Turkey of violating human rights by invading
the northern part of the island in 1974 under the excuse of
protecting the Turkish Cypriots on the island in the wake of a
pro-Athens coup by Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The island is now divided by a Green Line patrolled by
U.N. peace keepers.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Greek Cypriot refugees who fled Turkish invasion
from Famagusta, a town next to Paralimni, 23 years ago held a
rally just a few kilometers south of their hometown on the Greek
Cypriot side to demand an early home trip.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides also warned against any attempted practice of double
standards in human rights in solving the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the international community for the "absence of
substantive and practical response" on the human rights issue,
which "has encouraged Turkish intransigence and provocative
behavior and impeded efforts for a speedy resolution" of the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides pointed out that displaying tolerance in cases of
human rights violations "supports injustice."
</P>
<P>
He said unless human rights and fundamental freedoms are
safeguarded in practice as part of a negotiated settlement, "any
solution will have a short expiry date."
</P>
<P>
"We are not interested in a short-term arrangement, we are
only interested in a lasting and functional settlement," the
minister stressed.

<HEADLINE> US Spacecraft Launch Delayed by Shrimp Boats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The scheduled launch of a
science spacecraft of the United States space agency NASA was
delayed today by two shrimp boats strayed into the launch danger
area offshore.
</P>
<P>
NASA has to reschedule to launch the Delta II rocket carrying
the spacecraft of the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The delay will likely cost NASA hundreds of thousands of
dollars, according to NASA officials.
</P>
<P>
A helicopter from the U.S. Coast Guard was sent to tell the
boats out of the area east of Cape Canaveral, where the spacecraft
will be launched.
</P>
<P>
But the helicopter was unable to contact one of the boats
before the rocket's 25-minute launch window closed.
</P>
<P>
The spacecraft had been scheduled for blastoff from Cape
Canaveral Air Station atop a Boeing Delta II rocket at 10:41 a.m.
EDT today.
</P>
<P>
The spacecraft will be positioned 1.6 million km above the
Earth. It will provide a 30 to 60 minute warning before a
potentially dangerous solar storm strikes the Earth.
</P>
<P>
Eruptions on the surface of the sun can disrupt the Earth's
magnetic field, knocking out electrical power and endangering
spacewalking astronauts in orbit.
</P>
<P>
The ACE spacecraft's primary purpose is to sample the high
energy matter from the sun, the space between stars and from the
Milky Way that comes close to the Earth.

<TEXT>
<P>
CATANIA, Sicily, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Empty-handed Japan suddenly
got full-handed with five gold medals through their gymnasts on the
last day of the Universiade gymnastics tournament on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Risa Sugawara, who finished third in Friday's women's individual
all-around final, won the titles of the floor exercise and balance
beam.
</P>
<P>
Her compatriots Yoshihiro Saito took the men's horizontal bar title
while Kenichi Fujita and Naoya Tsukahara added one each to Japan's
gold tally by winning the men's pommel horse and vault events
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Before today's apparatus finals, Japan had only one silver and two
bronze medals to their credit. But now they are second in the gold
medal table only after leaders Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday morning, Elena Vitrichenko of Ukraine won three more gold
medals in the rhythmic gymnastics, becoming the first multi gold
medalist of the Universiade.
</P>
<P>
In the evening's men's individual epee final, Alexander Gorbachuk
edged Cuban Ivan Trevejo 16-15 to give Ukraine their sixth gold medal
at the games.
</P>
<P>
The victory in fencing promoted Ukraine to top of the medal table

parallel bars while Zheng Zhi took the gold of the women's uneven
bars.
</P>

Ukraine 2-0 in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in two months that China's youth eleven
failed to achieve good results in important international tournament.
</P>
<P>
In the world youth championships held in Malaysia in June, the same
Chinese team had two draws against one loss in group competitions and
failed to enter the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Hosts Italy proved that they are the favorities for the soccer
title after beating the Netherlands 4-0.
</P>
<P>
The United States also scored a big victory, beating their Irish
opponents 5-0 to enter the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>

of gymnastics taken by their Hero Juri Chechi.
</P>
<P>
Chechi, Olympic champion of the event, didn't take part in the

the women's vault.
</P>
<P>

in the apparatus finals. The sole gold she won at the games is the
women's individual all-around.
</P>
<P>
The diving tournament of the games will open tomorrow at Messina,
one of the three cities playing host to the games.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Inflation in Western Germany to Top 2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The inflation rate in the western
half of Germany is expected to jump to a 28-month high of 2
percent in August, up from 1.7 percent in July, the German federal
statistics office said today.
</P>
<P>
The Wiesbaden-based office, which based its projection on
preliminary data from four western German states, said rising fuel
prices due to the stronger U.S. dollar were to be blamed for the
latest increase in German inflation.
</P>
<P>
The larger-than-expected inflation rate is likely to reinforce
market speculations that the German central bank, the Bundesbank,
would be forced to raise interest rates which could curb price
hikes.
</P>
<P>
But many observers in the German financial capital of Frankfurt
did expect the Bundesbank to take such a move at its Tuesday
meeting when it is due to conduct its weekly review of a key
benchmark rate, the securities repurchase rate.
</P>
<P>
Given the recent weakness of the dollar, the central bankers
would take some time to examine the price-related factors exactly,
an economist with the German Commerzbank said.

In the process he severely beat his brother to death, the RSS
said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Machinery Industry More Capable of Equipping Nat'l Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China's machine-building
industry has geared up its operation to the market economy and
thus become more powerful to support the national economic
development, according to a top official in charge of the industry.
</P>
<P>
Bao Xuding, minister of the machine-building industry, recently
told Xinhua that the Chinese government has designated the
machine-building and automobile industries as two of the economic
pillars in the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
"China's huge market demand provides a good opportunity to the
development of the machine-building industry," Bao said.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the Ministry of Machine-building
Industry (MMI), 70 percent of the investment in China's auto
industry, and half of the total poured in its electronic industry
and thermal power plants construction in the Ninth Five-Year Plan
period will be used to purchase machinery products.
</P>
<P>
Of the huge capitals to be used by the Three Gorges Project,
China's largest ever hydro-power project, some 35 percent will go
to the procurement of machinery products.
</P>
<P>
To meet the market demand, the industry in the past five years
has tried every effort to build up an operation system catering to
the market economy.
</P>
<P>
Bao said that since 1992 China has developed over 600 new
products, of which 200 could match the international level.
</P>
<P>
China now is capable of producing over 160 large complete plant
equipment, including 300mw and 600mw thermal power generating
units, 500kv power transmission and tranforming equipment and
drillers for digging 6000-meter deep oil wells in desert.

The output of certain machinery products, such as power
generating equipment and machine tools have been among the
world's biggest.
</P>
<P>
Its auto production has topped 1.49 million units in 1996,
doubled that the figure in 1991.
</P>
<P>
As for the central tasks in the coming years, the ministry
plans to develop 1,000 famous brand-names, 500 quality-prestigeous
enterprises and a complete quality-warranty system.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the ministry hoped to optimize its industrial
structure by fostering 100 large enterprises and a contingent of
professional parts and components suppliers "competitive in the
marketplace," according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises are urged to put greater efforts on research and
development as well as sales and marketing besides enhancing their
processing capabilities, Bao added.
</P>
<P>
Bao emphasized the importance of the research and development
efforts. "The ministry plans to establish development centers in
300 key enterprises and develop 1000 competitive and patent
products in the years ahead," Bao said.
</P>
<P>
The industry witnessed a rapid growth in the past five years by
registering an annual growth of 22.4 percent, "becoming one of the
fastest-growing industries in China," according to Bao.
</P>
<P>
The output value of the industry last year hit 1,398.7 billion
yuan, or 25 percent of the country's total, up four percentage
points than that in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The industry earned an aggregated tax and profits of 391.2
billion yuan in the past five years, up 102 percent
compared than that registered between 1986 and 1990.

During the period, the ministry attracted the contractual
overseas investment totaling 20 billion US dollars, rising
tenfold than the amount combined before 1991.

attempting to separate the motherland under the guise of a

They claimed that the introduction of a referendum into the
constitution is a very significant task in political reform in the
"face of the transfer of power in Hong Kong in 1997"; and is
closely "related to major policies of any state, as well as the
future of Taiwan." However, the article notes that people will
firmly oppose any move to accelerate the pace of separating the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
The article points out that "pro-independence forces in Taiwan"
have for years attempted to change the island's status as part of
China and establish the "Republic of Taiwan" by means of
"referendum."
</P>
<P>
In October 1991, the DPP adopted party guidelines based on the
idea that "The people of Taiwan should decide by referendum
whether to establish a self-determined sovereign state, the
Republic of Taiwan, and formulate new constitution," it says.
</P>
<P>
In March 1994, the DPP tabled a "draft of the referendum law,"
which included "major policies of the state, the theme on changes
in major administrative demarcations, major political topics for
discussion, and constitutional amendments adopted at a national
development conference."
</P>
<P>
According to the article, the "introduction of a referendum
into constitution" proposed by the DPP in May is actually nothing
more than a continuation of the "Taiwan independence" theme in the
name of "referendum."

The article stresses that Taiwan has been part of China's
sacred territory since ancient times. All Chinese people,
including Taiwan compatriots, launched staunch struggles against
Dutch, Spanish and Japanese occupation during colonial history in
order to safeguard China's state sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan was restored to the jurisdiction of China according to
the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation following the
victory in World War II, said the article, adding that the fact
that Taiwan is an integral part of China is widely recognized by
the World community.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in
October 1949, according to the article, all countries establishing
diplomatic ties with the government of the PRC hold that there is
only one China, and that Taiwan is part of China, and that the PRC
is the sole legal government representing China.
</P>
<P>
Although the two sides of the Taiwan Straits have not been
reunited yet, the status of Taiwan as part of China has never
changed, the articles stresses.
</P>
<P>
It notes that the future of Taiwan is totally dependent on
reunification with the Chinese mainland and there are absolutely
no other alternative.
</P>
<P>
The article also reiterates the policy of realizing peaceful
reunification through cross-straits talks, and points out that any
move by splittist forces on the island to split the motherland or
to separate Taiwan from the Chinese territory by means of
"referendum" will be totally rejected by the Chinese people as a
whole.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Universities Raise Tuition Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Most Canadian university students
face significant increases in tuition when they return to class
this fall, Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
Fees for undergraduate arts students for the 1997/98 academic
year have increased in every province except Quebec, the federal
statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
The sharpest tuition rise occurred in Newfoundland and Ontario,
where students will pay on average 18.0 and 10.1 percent more
respectively than the past academic year.
</P>
<P>
In other provinces, fee increases ranged between 1.7 percent in
British Columbia to 8.3 percent in Alberta.
</P>
<P>
On average, tuition fees rose almost 9 percent across the
country, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
At Quebec universities, fees for Quebec residents will remain
at 1,700 Canadian dollars (1,224 U.S. dollars) for the 1997/98
academic year. These fees are the lowest in Canada.
</P>
<P>
In the rest of the country, the fees paid by Canadian
university students enrolled in undergraduate arts programs in
1997/98 range from 2,400 dollars (1,728 U.S. dollars) in
Saskatchewan to a high of 3,700 dollars (2,664 U.S. dollars) in
Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
Most Canadian universities charge twice as much fees for
medicine, dentistry, engineering and architecture programs.
</P>
<P>
And foreign students pay much higher tuition fees than
Canadians at most institutions.
</P>
<P>
In 1997/98, the average tuition fee for foreign undergraduate
students enrolled in arts programs is 8,000 dollars (5,760
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Canadian students enrolled in the same programs
will pay on average 3,000 dollars (2,176 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, tuition fees have soared in every Canadian
province, far outpacing the inflation rate. Between 1985/86 and
1995/96, tuition fees in arts programs have more than doubled,
while the inflation rate rose by 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 15 years, tuition fees have become an
increasingly important part of university revenue.
</P>
<P>
In 1981/82, tuition fees accounted for only 8 percent of total
operating revenue of Canadian universities. Fifteen years later,
it had almost doubled to 14.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan "Referendum" Attempt Refuted (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attempts by "Taiwan Independence" forces to change Taiwan's
status as a part of the Chinese territory through a so-called
"referendum" are ridiculous when judged from a legal perspective,
the article says.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, it adds, today's world features three kinds
of referenda concerning major political issues, including changing
a country's territory or the title of a state.
</P>
<P>
The first type of referendum applies to regions whose actual
sovereignty remains controversial. People living in related
regions vote to decide which country they wish to join.
</P>
<P>
The second form of referendum usually applies to regions which
were formerly a colony of another country; a territory practicing
self-government; or to a region which was historically an
independent ethnic country, and later became part of another
country, but still maintained distinct ethnic and cultural
differences from other parts of the latter.
</P>
<P>
A referendum provided people in such regions with an
opportunity to decide whether to abandon their suzerain and
declare independence.
</P>
<P>
The third type of referendum is based on the principle of
sovereignty belonging to the whole people. In this case, a
referendum can only result in a change in a country's title, but
not to the founding of a new country.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the article says, the only way to guarantee
the legitimacy of the form of referendum is to ensure to total
participation of all citizens.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Referendum Attempts Refuted (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past several years, the Taiwan authorities have run
counter to the "one China" principle by vigorously publicizing
statements that "the two sides of the Taiwan Straits should be
split and ruled separately", and that "the Republic of China in
Taiwan is a country with independent sovereignty", the article
says, adding that this was particularly true during the "National
Conference on Development" held last December, The Kuomingtang and
the DPP reached an agreement on "the rights of people to exercise
initiative and referendum". The agreement, it says, provided a
breach for the DPP to include referendum in the Constitution, and
thereby created a true source for disaster. Taiwan authorities
must set the nation's interests above all else, return to "One
China" stand by taking real action instead of simply churning out
words, and must oppose and prohibit splittist activities under the
guise of referendum, the article stresses.
</P>
<P>
According to provisions the DPP drafted to include referendum
in the Constitution, the act is approved if votes in favor exceed
half the total ballots. In addition, the ballet to decide whether
Taiwan will be independent is valid if two-fifths of the total
voters on the island cast votes. What else will the act mean, if
it does not mean to seriously misguide and cheat the people on
Taiwan? the article asks. Obviously, it says, the goal of Taiwan
independence forces is to agitate, coerce and even force Taiwan
compatriots to follow a splittist road. There is no doubt that
Taiwan independence forces have created related acts to
deceitfully sway Taiwan public opinion, it says.

<P>
The world as a whole recognizes that Taiwan is an integral part
of China and Taiwan compatriots are unalienable members of the
Chinese family, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the three types of referendum mentioned above fail
to apply to Taiwan," it says.
</P>
<P>
The first type fails to apply because Taiwan is indisputably a
part of China and therefore is not a region with controversial
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the second type, Taiwan is neither a colony, nor a
self-governing territory. Historically speaking, Taiwan has never
been an independent ethnic country and thus has no right to talk
about independence.
</P>
<P>
The third type fails to apply because Taiwan is only one of
China's many provinces. Therefore, voting in one province can in
no way be regarded as a referendum, and Taiwan has never had the
power to decide a change of national title or territory.
</P>
<P>
"The sovereignty of China, including Taiwan and surrounding
areas, belongs to the entire Chinese people, including Taiwan
compatriots," according to the article.
</P>
<P>
It notes that splittist forces in Taiwan have no power to to
change Taiwan's status as a part of the Chinese territory by any
means, and that they will never succeed in their splittist
attempts.

<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- High temperatures continue in
Beijing these days after a rarely-seen hot Summer over the past
few decades.
</P>
<P>
The summit temperatures in the urban area of Beijing have reached
33 degrees or over, centigrade, in the past three days, after the
Beginning of Autumn (13th solar term) happened about 20 days ago.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing is sleepless because of the hot weather this Autumn,
and we are hoping that it will go quickly," a local resident
complains.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has always been well known for its cool autumn,
however, this fall is a surprise for local residents.
</P>
<P>
All the paging service sations have been repeating the same
news about the hot weather, and warning millions of their
subscribers not to catch sunstroke.
</P>
<P>
The city now is absolutely under control of subtropical high
pressure, and it seems that hot and wet temperatures will go on
for several days, according to weather forecast.
</P>
<P>
What makes this autumn more unbearable is the increasing air
humidity, which hit 90 percent at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
But it turns out to be a good season for air conditioner
sellers, who have seen a continued brisk sale of air conditioners
after the hot summer. Some departments stores have sold out their
stocks for next year.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Rejects Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
flatly rejected repeated calls for a cabinet reshuffle by Finance
Minister Theo Waigel on his first day back to work from a
four-week vacation.
</P>
<P>
"I do not plan to reshuffle the cabinet. There is absolutely no
reason to do so," Kohl told the mass circulation newspaper Bild in
an interview to be published on Tuesday, copies of which were made
available in advance to reporters.
</P>
<P>
Kohl said he was "very angry" over Waigel's public request for
cabinet changes, adding that under the German constitution a
decision to reshuffle the cabinet was the responsibility of the
chancellor.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he praised Waigel for doing "a first class
job."
</P>
<P>
Waigel has been Kohl's finance minister for nine years. He has
bore the brunt of voter complaints over Bonn's budget austerity,
entitlement cuts and post-unification tax hikes.
</P>
<P>
A week ago, he called for a new team in Kohl's center-right
coalition and said he would not continue his current job after
next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
Bonn has been denying any reshuffle plan over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Some members of Kohl's party and many press reports believe
that a cabinet reshuffle could help the ruling coalition by
offering new faces in the September 21 regional election in
Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls showed that the main opposition Social Democrats
(SPD) were widening their lead over the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine spoke on the
coalition turmoil at a news conference: "This is about Helmut Kohl
and his policies. It is an admission of failed economic and
finance policy when the finance minister wants to quit his post 13
months before (general) elections."
</P>
<P>
"I have the feeling that (Kohl) has lost control," he said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Chinese Folk Dance Graces Egyptian Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISMALIA, Egypt, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Beating waist drums and
chanting rustic tunes, Chinese young folk dancers in traditional
costumes swirled into the summer heat of the Suez Canal for a cool
night of art and cultural cocktail.
</P>
<P>
To the standing ovation of about 10,000 spectators, the
33-member Chinese Folk Dance Troupe performed the adapted versions
of "Huang Tu Huang" (The Yellow Loess) and "Dongbei Yangge"
(Traditional Dance in Northeast China) at a grand parade show that
heralded the 8th Ismalia International Folk Art Festival Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
The high-pitched sound of Chinese drums and cymbals contrasted
sharply with the rollicking lilt of Scotish pipes, while the
flowery poplin skirts of Estonian country girls flutter to
outshine the shagreened outfits of Syrian shepherds.
</P>
<P>
Each of the 33 countries taking part in the festival was given
a slot of no more than five minutes for a tip-of-the-iceberg show
of their music and dance traditions, before making their
full-fledged presentation at a floodlit open-air stage later that
night.
</P>
<P>
Dancing to the strong beat on the broad boulevard, the Chinese
dancers raised stormy applause and bravos from spectators.
</P>
<P>
The boys and girls, native to China's northern countryside, are
all top-notch students of Beijing Dance Academy, the cradle of
elite dancers in China.
</P>
<P>
Most of them are in their late teens, but their artistic
aptitude has raised them to the stages of the United States,
Canada, the Philippines and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
A glimpse of the program reveals an amazing variety of folk
dances of Chinese nationalities. The hectic "Shanbei Waist Drum"
from Han nationality, the breath-taking "Tibetan Reba Drum" and
the Mongolian blues "Long Song, Long Love", are among their best
fares.
</P>
<P>
"The dances are all originated in local countryside," said Xing
Zhiwen, head of the Chinese troupe. "Those from northern China are
full of pride, passion and enthusiasm, and that from the south are
dexterous, humorous and sensitive."
</P>
<P>
"Through them you can see Chinese people's outlook on love,
life and history, and their aesthetic perception," said Xing, a
senior member of the Chinese Dancers' Association.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese boys and girls also performed an "Egyptian Stick
Dance" to see the host pleasantly surprised.
</P>
<P>
The week-long folk art extravaganza runs till the end of the
month, with performances simultaneously staged in Ismalia, Suez
and Port Sayed, the quiet cities under the shelter of olive and
palm dates trees in Suez Canal's cool breeze.
</P>
<P>
About 1,200 folk artists from 40 famous musical and dance
ensembles of 33 countries are participating the festival, which is
classified among the world's largest.
</P>
<P>
Eleven Arab, European and North American countries appeared in
the festival for the first time. But organizers regretted that
there would have been more "authentic flavor" if they hadn't have
to turn down request from other 21 countries seeking to be
represented at the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Hassan, deputy president of the festival, told Xinhua
that the purpose of the event is to promote world peace and
friendship and to facilitate the communications and understanding
among the world youth through the channel of folk art.
</P>
<P>
This year's festival is the largest since Ismalia began to act
host to the annual event in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Former East German Leader Convicted of Manslaughter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Egon Krenz, the last leader of the
former East Germany, was sentenced today by a Berlin court to six
and a half years in prison in connection with killings along the
Berlin Wall during the Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
Krenz, 60, was convicted of manslaughter related to the death
of people shot by East German border guards when trying to flee
East Germany through the former border areas along the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
He was placed under arrest and brought to the Moabit remand
prison in Berlin immediately after the trial.
</P>
<P>
But during the 20-month trial in Berlin, Krenz accused the
German judicial system of being biased against former East German
leaders, and said that he had never been given a fair hearing.
</P>
<P>
Krenz had made clear earlier that he would appeal to the
European human rights court in case of a conviction. "I'll not
submit," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin court today also sentenced two other members of the
former East German Politburo, Guenter Schabowski, 68, and Guenther
Kleiber, 65, to three years in jail on similar charges.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Plans to Help Cambodia Prepare Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas today reaffirmed the ASEAN's readiness to help Cambodia
prepare its general election in next May and urged the Cambodian
parliament to draw up election regulations soon.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) realizes that
the implementation of a general election needs elaborate
preparations. Thus, election regulations are very important," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said ASEAN will discuss the plan on helping Cambodia prepare
its general election, in New York next month when ministers of the
grouping attend the United Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps I will meet with (Cambodian newly-appointed First
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister) Ung Huot and discuss the
issue with him (in New York)," Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
On Cambodia's election, Alatas said ASEAN supports Cambodian
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen's commitment to organize a free and
constitutional election.
</P>
<P>
"We should support his commitment to hold that kind of
election," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Cambodia's chance to become a full member of
ASEAN would depend much on the country's internal situation and
security.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN foreign ministers in July decided to postpone Cambodia's
entry into the grouping because of the political crisis in the
country but maintain its observer status.
</P>
<P>
Alatas also called on Cambodia's disputing parties to halt
immediately all military actions to avoid being trapped in armed
conflict.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Large Number of AIDS Patients Registered in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- AIDS patients reached 78,000
last year in Cameroon's North West Province with a population of
1.19 million, a provincial health official has revealed.
</P>
<P>
Amida Ghogomu, the provincial delegate of public health, made
the revelation in the province's capital Bamenda recently while
opening a two-day AIDS education workshop for youths and student
leaders from the seven divisions of the North West Province,
local paper "Cameroon Tribune" reported today.
</P>
<P>
AIDS cases have increased geometrically from the prevalence of
0.02 percent in 1985 to that of seven percent in 1996, that is
about 78,000 persons infected, with youths accounting for 60
percent of that figure, the report said.
</P>
<P>
This rate is higher than the average prevalence of 5.5 percent
throughout the whole territory.
</P>
<P>
Ghogomu pointed out that the objective of the workshop is to
give the youths necessary information, guidance and skills that
will reduce the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STD),
unwanted pregnancies and consequent drop-out from school among
students.
</P>
<P>
He assured that the workshop participants will be assisted
financially to succeed in their individual sensitization programs
in their respective villages and communities, adding that
follow-up teams will visit various youths and student
associations soon.

<HEADLINE> Jordan: US Peace Role Should Be More Committed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Fayez
Tarawneh said today the United States should play up its role to
reactive the stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian-Israeli peace process needs a third party to
help push forward negotiations, and the U.S. should play its part
in this respect," Tarawneh said in an interview with the
Cairo-based Voice of Arabs radio.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh said Egyptian and Jordanian leaders have been
coordinating in a drive to support the Palestinian people and
revive the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the U.S. is in a more effective position
to stage major initiatives to solve the current peace impasse that
began in March with the construction of a new Jewish settlement in
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"As regards launching initiatives, the American side is the
most capable party in this respect," he said. He expressed the
hope that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will deliver
the visit to the region and that negotiations will be resumed
"without concentrating only on the security side."
</P>
<P>
Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security officials have been
meeting under a framework set up earlier this month by U.S. Middle
East peace envoy Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
Israel demanded that Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat crack down on extremists before resuming talks and
lifting economic sanctions imposed after the July 30 bombing
attacks.
</P>
<P>
The suicide bombing attacks in Jewish west Jerusalem killed 16
people and wounded 170 others. Immediately after the attacks,
Israel imposed economic sanctions against the Palestinian
territory and canceled the planned resumption of peace talks
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian foreign minister attributed the present impasse
in the Palestinian-Israeli peace process to the lack of
confidence between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He also rejected a Jerusalem newspaper report that Jordan backs
an Israeli plan to build a dam on the Syrian part of the Yarmouk
River that edges northwestern Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The proposed dam would be built on the Syrian land. Israel has
occupied a short stretch of the Yarmouk since its forces captured
the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that Israeli
National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon had decided to
build a Yarmouk River dam on the Syrian stretch rather than at a
non-controversial site chosen by the previous Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
But Jordan said Saturday it planned to build a dam on its own
in the village of Adassiyah, 150 kilometers northeast of Amman, to
divert its share of the Yarmouk river to another Jordanian
dam.

<HEADLINE> WHO to Set Framework for World Tobacco Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization is
working on an international framework convention to promote
tobacco control among the member countries, said WHO
general-director Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima today.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that with the support of all the member countries, the
international convention can be put for ratification just after
the year 2000," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the on-going 10th World Conference on Tobacco or
Health, Dr. Nakajima said that the framework convention is
intended to establish a world control on tobacco smuggling,
tobacco pricing and taxation, testing and reporting of toxic
constituents in tobacco and other tobacco-related affairs.
</P>
<P>
About six percent of the cigarettes, produced each year in the
world, are smuggled form one country to another, causing an annual
loss of 16 billion US dollars in taxation, he explained. So
international community should take common measures to control the
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
It will be easier to control the use of tobacco if all the
countries and regions set the similar high prices for tobacco
products, and the smugglers will find it impossible to profit.
</P>
<P>
In addition, improved and more effective international
standards for the testing and reporting of toxic constituents in
tobacco products and tobacco smoke would benefit the monitoring of
hazard degrees in tobacco products, he said.
</P>
<P>
The framework convention will also include regulations on
tobacco advertising, duty-free sales of tobacco, reporting of
production, sales, imports and exports of tobacco products and
sharing of policy and program information on tobacco control.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Nakajima said that about 35 million people in the world die
from smoking each year. The number of the deaths from tobacco may
rise to 100 million by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
He called on all the countries in the world to join their
efforts to reduce the harm brought by the use of tobacco.

</P>
<P>
However, the country's limited financial ability prevents it
from simultaneously focusing extensive efforts on all areas,
according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the country should accelerate basic scientific
research from a comprehensive standpoint based on order of
importance and urgency. Related efforts should be carried out in
accordance with needs of long-term social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang added that the country must reform its scientific and
technological system and adopt favorable policies to support and
encourage enterprises to engage in scientific research,
development and technological transformations.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Singaporean PMs Satisfied with Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li
Peng and Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong reviewed here
today the development of the Sino-Singapore relations in recent
years and expressed their satisfaction with the fruitful
cooperation between the two countries in all fields.
</P>
<P>
During their discussion, held in the Presidential Palace
Istana, Li Peng noted that in the seven years since the
establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries,
bilateral ties have developed rapidly, featuring frequent exchange
of visits by top-level leaders and increased bilateral trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between China and Singapore is now witnessing new
development in telecommunication, civil aviation and other hi-tech
areas, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He also appreciated the mutual understanding and support
between China and Singapore over many important international and
regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with Li Peng, Prime Minister Goh said that the two
countries are enjoying very good relations. Given the fact that
there is no pending issues between the two countries, Goh said
that Singapore and China should further expand their cooperation,
especially in the construction of the Singapore-Suzhou Industrial
Park, the flagship project in Singapore's economic regionalization
drive.
</P>
<P>
Goh said that since this is a long-term project, the two
countries should continue to make joint efforts to make this
important project successful.
</P>
<P>
The two Prime Ministers agreed that it is necessary for leaders
of the two countries to continue to keep in contact and dialogue
so as to push bilateral cooperation into the fields of health,
culture and education, and tourism.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also stressed that the two nations will
continue to maintain constant consultation and coordination
between them and work together to make contribution to promoting
regional peace, stability and development.
</P>
<P>
On the economic and trade cooperation between China and
Singapore, Li Peng said that currently, the subject the two
countries should study is how to make full use of their respective
advantage and expand the area of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting that China is speeding up its adjustment of
industrial structure and trying to raise its technological
standards, Li said that Singapore can surely play a more active
role in China's economic development, given its advantage in the
fields such as information technology, management and finance.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that China's market is stable and that making
investment in China will not only bring about high returns for the
Singapore investors, but also benefit both sides.
</P>
<P>
Goh Chok Tong agreed with Li Peng and said that enterprises and
companies of the two countries should be encouraged to invest in
each other's country or join their hands to invest in third
countries.
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed his Singaporean counterpart on the state of
affairs of Hong Kong after its return to China last month. He said
that Hong Kong and the Southeast Asian region are closely linked.
It is to the benefit of Southeast Asian countries that prosperity
and stability in Hong Kong are maintained.
</P>
<P>
Goh said that Singapore has always been supportive to Hong
Kong's return to China. He said he was glad to see that everything
goes well in Hong Kong after its return.
</P>
<P>
Singapore has invested heavily in Hong Kong and will continue
to do so in the future, he said, adding that Singapore is fully
confident in Hong Kong's continued prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
On the relations between China and the Association of South
East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the two Prime Ministers believed that
the integration of the Southeast Asian region is in conformity
with the world trend of multi-polarization, and is conducive to
long-term peace and stability in the Asia Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
They held that the bilateral relations between China and ASEAN
are very important and the two sides should further strengthen
their cooperation in every field.
</P>
<P>
Noting that towards the end of this year, leaders from the
ASEAN, China, Japan and South Korea will meet in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, Goh hoped that the meeting will be successful through
their joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also exchanged views on regional and
international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng arrived here on Sunday and will wind up his visit here
on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Dialogues on Parliamentary Elections Continues in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government
continued its dialogues today with political parties on the
Parliamentary elections scheduled for November 4 this year in an
effort to ease the uproar of six opposition parties to boycott
them.
</P>
<P>
The government is ready to talk with all the political groups
and to listen to any point of view, Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdul Salam Majali said after meeting a delegation representing
the National Constitutional Party (NCP).
</P>
<P>
Majali exchanged views and ideas about the upcoming elections
as well as means to make them successful with the members of the
pro-government NCP delegation headed by its secretary-general
Abdul Haji Majali, the prime minister's brother.
</P>
<P>
Six opposition parties declared to boycott the elections last
month, citing the Press and Publication Law, the one-person-
one-vote election system, the normalization of ties with Israel
and the government`s measures to marginalize political parties
as the main reasons for their boycott.
</P>
<P>
After the government agreed to hold elections in a fair and
free way and held two rounds of dialogue with the six opposition
parties, they have still stuck to their position.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties have 23 seats in the 80-member Lower House
of Parliament, including 16 deputies from the Islamic Action
Front (IAF).
</P>
<P>
Multi-party system was revived in Jordan in 1989 as part of

<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Smoking may cause serious harm
to the health of the 200 million women smokers in the world,
according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
WHO released a report at the ongoing 10th World Conference on
Tobacco or Health here today, saying that one-tenth of the women
in developed countries smoke while in developing countries, the
figure is seven percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of women smokers in developing countries is

official.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of women in the world, who die
from tobacco each year, has already surpassed 500,000, or
one-sixth of the total deaths from smoking.
</P>
<P>
In developed countries, which have more women smokers, the
women's mortality of lung cancer had increased by three times in
1990s, compared with that in 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the women's mortality of smoking-related diseases is
rising almost in all the countries in the world, which may finally
resulted in a death number of one million among women smokers by
the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
Surveys show that smoking can not only cause the similar
hazard on women as on men, but also lead to other diseases,
including the premature menopause and impaired fertility, and a
higher risk of cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Mackay said that the maternal smoking is associated with
a higher risk of miscarriage, lower birth-weight of babies and
inhibited child development.
</P>
<P>
Parental smoking is also a factor in sudden infant death, she
added, and is related to the higher rates of respiratory
illnesses, including bronchitis, colds and pneumonia in children.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is that women should drop the habit
of smoking for their own health," she noted.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco More Deadly Than Any Single Disease: WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Tobacco has become a greater
cause of death and disability than any single disease, the World
Health Organization warned here today.
</P>
<P>
"Tobacco use has reached the proportion of a global epidemic,"
since it causes three million deaths annually around the world,
WHO announced in a press conference of the ongoing 10th World
Conference on Tobacco or Health.
</P>
<P>
The mortality will rise to ten millions each year 20 years
later, including seven millions in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco is known or probable cause of about 25 diseases, such
as lung cancer that is believed to mainly caused by smoking, and
cancers at other sites, heart disease, stroke, emphysema and other
chronic lung diseases, according to a WHO report.
</P>
<P>
"On average, lifetime smokers have a 50 percent chance of dying
from tobacco. And half of these will die in middle age, before age
seventy, losing 22 years of normal life expectancy," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
In 28 countries and regions of WHO's Western Pacific Region,
about as many people die each year from smoking as from alcohol,
murder, suicide, drug abuse, drowning, traffic accidents,
industrial accidents and AIDS combined, another report said.
</P>
<P>
China in this region, the biggest tobacco producer and consumer
in the world, has overtaken the United States as the country with
the largest number of deaths from smoking, it quoted Prof. Richard
Peto from WHO Collaborating Center for Chronic Disease Control
as saying.
</P>
<P>
China's Health Minister Chen Minzhang told today's press
conference that the country with 320 million smokers has reported
750,000 deaths from smoking each year. Such figure will be two
millions annually by the year 2025.
</P>
<P>
Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, WHO Director-General, termed the
growing tobacco epidemic "a fire in the global village", and
called upon "all neighbors" to combat this "avoidable public
health disaster".

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong, Global Economic Player: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong would continue to be
not only a Pacific powerhouse, but also a global economic player
after it became a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China on
July 1 this year, a SAR high-ranking official told Australian
business community today during his trip to the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon in Sydney organized by the local chamber
of commerce, Donald Tsang, Financial Secretary of the HKSAR,
said: "I see Hong Kong continuing to develop its role as the
premier service center in the Asia-Pacific region. I am equally
certain that Hong Kong will remain one of the most open, free,
exciting and cosmopolitan cities on earth."
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Government Information Service today released the
full text of Tsang's speech, entitled "Hong Kong: Looking Towards
the Future".
</P>
<P>
Tsang told Australian businessmen that under the unique concept
of "one country, two systems", business has been as usual in Hong
Kong after the handover.
</P>
<P>
"The Basic Law lays the foundations for the continued
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. It is our road map for the
future," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Basic Law embodies all the four pillars of
Hong Kong's success -- free flow of information, a level playing
field, rule of law and prudent fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
The financial secretary listed a number of reasons that Hong
Kong was well placed to become a Pacific powerhouse -- its close
ties with the Chinese inland areas, its surging services
industries, its good financial shape and its 6.4 million people
who time and again demonstrated a "can-do" spirit and an
entrepreneurial flair.

<HEADLINE> EU Commissioner Deplores Failure of Talks on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Commissioner
responsible for relations with Cyprus and Turkey has deplored the
failure of the talks on the eventual reunification of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
In a press release today, Hans van den Broek said that he was
"deeply concerned about the disappointing outcome of the direct
talks between Cypriot President Glavkos Klerides and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash."
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-brokered talks, which took place last week in Glion,
Switzerland, ended in deadlock after the Turkish Cypriot leader
refused to drop objections to the possible entry of the
Mediterranean island into the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Denktash insisted that the talks could not proceed while the
European Union remained committed to opening accession
negotiations with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner described the preconditions set by Denktash in
the talks as "unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
The commissioner urges both sides to reach an early agreement
on the continuation of the direct talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot controlled South
and a Turkish-occupied north since 1974 when Turkey occupied the
northern third of the island in the wake of an abortive coup by
supporters of union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Substantial Progress in State Enterprise Reform (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In line with the arrangement of the CPC Central Committee,
China has spread the experimental reforms to wider areas, making
substantial progress in some important aspects, the commentary
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Except for one being disintegrated and another one merged, 98
of the 100 enterprises selected by the State Council to establish
a modern enterprise system on a trial basis have been transformed
into companies of different types in accordance with the needs of
a modern enterprise system, it said.
</P>
<P>
The work to establish a modern enterprise system in 2,500
enterprises selected by the local governments has also gone into
full swing, with nearly half already transformed into joint-stock
companies or limited liability companies, it added.
</P>
<P>
The experiment to optimize the capital structure has expanded
to 110 from 18 cities, and 120 enterprises have been selected to
form large enterprise groups, according to the commentary.
</P>
<P>
Since last year the pace to develop and strengthen large
enterprises groups has been accelerated markedly, it said.
</P>
<P>
The 300 large enterprises that enjoy priority treatment from
the State government account for 0.44 percent of all state-owned
industrial enterprises. However, their sales income and profits
last year accounted for 43.73 percent and 65.85 percent of the
total, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that a good match-up of internal reforms
with reform in other sectors is a major reason for the success of
the state enterprise reforms, adding that another factor is
improved management.
</P>
<P>
Though progress has been made in the state enterprise reforms,
the remaining tasks are very arduous, the commentary pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"However, the difficulties are temporary and transformation is
sure to happen," it said. "The more difficult and critical it is,
the more confident we should be about resolving the difficulties
and tiding over the difficult time."

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Seeks More Business Ties With Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu met his Japanese counterpart Ryutaro Hashimoto today,
seeking for more investment and help on water development projects.
</P>
<P>
During his two-hour meeting with Hashimoto, Netanyahu conveyed
a joint appeal from Israel and Jordan's King Hussein for Japanese
support for a water purification project.
</P>
<P>
But a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Hashimoto linked
progress in Japanese-Israeli relations with progress in the
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Hashimoto urged Netanyahu to lift the
blockades that Israel had imposed on the West Bank, the Gaza Strip
and Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Israel would lift the sanctions only if the
Palestinian Authority took tough measures against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
On July 30, a double suicide bombing in a Jerusalem marketplace
killed 16 people and led to a breakdown of the peace negotiations
between Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Israel has prevented about 100,000 Palestinians
from going to work by closing them inside the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also asked for Japan's diplomatic efforts in gaining
Palestinian Authority's cooperation in fighting terrorism, the
spokesman said. Japan is one of the largest donors to the
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who arrived in Tokyo on Sunday night, was
accompanied by his finance minister and about 20 Israeli
businessmen.

<HEADLINE> No-Smoking Among Youth Vital to China's Smoking Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China's Health Minister Chen
Minzhang said reducing teenager smoking is vital to the control of
the growing tobacco epidemic in the country, home to 320 million
smokers and a giant tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
"In order to prevent young people from joining the army of
smokers, we have to take preventive measures more effectively to
control smoking among the youth," he told a press conference of
the on-going 10th World Conference on Tobacco or Health here today.
</P>
<P>
The average age when the Chinese puff the first cigarette is
20, three years earlier than 1984's figure, Chen quoted results of
a national survey of smoking behaviors as saying.
</P>
<P>
Smoking rate among the people aged 15-25 increased more quickly
than people of other age groups, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, China's health and educational departments have
asked schools to be smoking-free. Soong Ching Ling Foundation
launched a massive anti-smoking drive among Chinese children in
1994.
</P>
<P>
The foundation called upon the children not to smoke, buy or
sell cigarettes, and encouraged them to persuade their family
members to quit smoking and to stop people's puffing at places
with "No-Smoking" signs.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide drive not only got the backing from more than
one million children, but also directly affected the children's
parents and teachers who smoke, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The foundation was awarded the 1997 World Health Organization
"Tobacco or Health" medal at the opening ceremony of the
conference Sunday in Beijing, for its remarkable achievements in
this field.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, China still faces a very serious situation, Chen
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Of the 300 million males now aged 0-29, about 200 million will
become smokers if current rates of new smokers persist," he warned.
</P>
<P>
"If they continue to smoke throughout their lives, 100 million
will eventually be killed by tobacco and half of these deaths will
occur before age 70," he said.
</P>
<P>
China reports 750,000 deaths from smoking each year now. Such
figure will be two millions annually by the year 2025.

STOCKHOLM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Several opinion polls about
the question of bidding the 2004 Olympic Games shows that more
Stockholmers are in favour of the Games to be held in the city.
</P>
<P>
The survey, sporsored by Swedish Institute of Public Opinion
Research (SIFO), indicates that 53 percent of Stockholmers,
compared with 49 percent in May, are in favour of the Games being
held in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
Those who are against have inclined from 40 percent in May to
34 percent.

<P>
For the whole country the figures are as follows: 50 percent
in favour while 49 percent in May, and 33 percent against, compared
with 41 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
The result of another poll is different. It shows that almost
60 percent of Stockholmers are in favour of the capital to host
the Games. Supporters in this poll believe that Sweden will not
suffer any negative economic effects from staging the Games.
</P>
<P>
But a bomb exploded in a western city of Gothenburg early
Monday has made Stockholm in danger in its Olympic bidding. The
blast with no one injured at the Ullevi stadium was the latest in
a series of explosions against Sweden's Olympic bid.
</P>
<P>
Stockholm is one of the five cities entered the final
round. The decision on the host city will be taken on September 5
in Lausanne, Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Won Drops to Record Low Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korean currency dropped to a
record low of 904.6 won against the U.S. dollar on the Seoul
foreign exchange market Monday.
</P>
<P>
The dollar began to sell at 899.60 won and closed at 904.60
won, exceeding the 900-won level for the first time since the
introduction of the present foreign exchange system in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The dollar's base rate for Tuesday will be 903.40 won, 4.10 won
higher than Monday's.
</P>
<P>
A market analyst attributed the drop of won to the heavy demand
for dollars in trade settlements early in the week and the
wide-spread rumors that the government would tolerate the dollar's
rise until it reaches 905 won.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the central bank intervened in the morning
session, selling dollars in the forward market at 923 won for
six-month maturities and at 944 won for one-year maturities.
</P>
<P>
"However, the strength of the intervention was weaker than
expected," a dealer at a Seoul bank said, adding that the central
bank may allow the won to remain below 900 won against dollar.

<HEADLINE> Goh: Li Peng's Visit Pushes Bilateral Ties to New High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng's
ongoing visit will lift Singapore-China relations to greater
heights, Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a banquet he hosted in Li's honor, Goh described Li
as his old friend and China the friend of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since the diplomatic ties were established seven
years ago, the bilateral ties "have blossomed", with the bilateral
trade in 1996 reaching some 7.3 billion U.S. dollars and
Singapore's contractual investment in China by the third quarter
of 1996 amounting to 22 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"But bilateral relations are more than just facts and figures,
or trade and investment," Goh said, adding "They are about human
relationship, warmth and abiding ties. Frequent face-to-face
meetings between leaders help to foster a healthy relationship
between countries."
</P>
<P>
He noted that China's economy is booming and in the past
decade, the economy has grown at an average of 10 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
If the current rates of growth are sustained, he went on,
China's GNP will be the largest in the world within 20 to 30
years.
</P>
<P>
China's international influence will grow along with its
economic strength when it contributes to global peace, stability
and prosperity, the Singaporean prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the smooth return of Hong Kong to the motherland
was testimony to how patience, sensitivity and creative diplomacy
ensured the peaceful resolution of a difficult problem left behind
by history.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that as a special administrative region of
China, Hong Kong will continue to prosper and serve as an engine
of growth for China and the region," stressed Goh.
</P>
<P>
On the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Goh said
another development important to the region is ASEAN's expansion
to nine, and eventually 10 members.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the ASEAN has fostered regional economic
cooperation and enhanced regional peace, and through forums like
the ASEAN Forum, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and Asia-Europe
meeting, the major powers, including China, are constructively
engaged with the ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
"Sino-ASEAN relations have developed rapidly over the last few
years. China is now a full ASEAN Dialogue partner. As ASEAN
progresses, we look forward to a friendly and beneficial
relationship with China," Goh added.

<HEADLINE> Substantial Progress in China's Enterprise Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China has recorded substantial
progress in the state-owned enterprise reform since the 14th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1992,
according to a commentary jointly issued by the Xinhua News Agency
and the People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
It was pointed out at the 14th CPC national congress that
transforming the operational mechanisms of state-owned
enterprises, while at the same time encouraging entry into the
marketplace and increasing vitality, represented the keys to
consolidating the socialist system and bringing the superiority of
socialism.
</P>
<P>
"Several years of arduous probing has enable the Party to reach
a consensus of the orientation, policies, objectives, correct path
and major issues concerning the reform of the state-owned
enterprises," according to the article.
</P>
<P>
It added that whether or not state enterprises can be
rejuvenated is no longer the focus of public discussion.
 "Over years of practice, we have come to realize that it is
unrealistics to revitalize all of the hundreds of thousands of
state enterprises," according to the commentary.
</P>
<P>
The nature of the shift in understanding lies in establishing
competitive enterprise operational mechanisms, allowing
enterprises unlikely to rebound to declare bankruptcy, and allow
profitable enterprises to take over loss-making enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The commentary pointed out that a total of 1,099 enterprises in
58 selected cities had completed bankruptcy procedures and an
additional 1,192 enterprises had been merged by the end of last
year.
</P>
<P>
"This has not only improved the enterprise structure, but also
transformed the understanding of officials and employees
concerning enterprise mergers and bankruptcies," said the
commentary.

<HEADLINE> Moi Meets IMF Team for Resumption of Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today held talks with a team from the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) at the State House in the port city of Mombasa,
the Kenya News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
President Moi said that he had useful discussions with the IMF
team and expressed the hope that following the talks a solution would
be found regarding the recent suspension of the Enhanced
Structural Adjustment facility to the country.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that another round of talks would be held
before the team departs the East African country.
</P>
<P>
Present at the talks were Kenyan Finance Minister Musalia
Mudavadi, Central Bank Governor Micah Cheserem and other treasury
officials.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team was made up of its Deputy Director Goddal Gondwe
and Reimer Carstens, resident representative of the world body in
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
This is the first meeting between Kenya and IMF after IMF
decided to suspend a three-year 215 million U.S. Dollars loans to
Kenya on July 31.
</P>
<P>
The IMF had cited high-level corruption in the government
departments of Kenya for halting the loan package agreed last
year between Kenya and IMF.
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said in Washington last
Thursday that he was sending a team to Kenya for talks after a
personal request by President Moi.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism that once negotiations started they
would end in agreement.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspension decision had driven the Kenyan currency of
Shilling down by about 20 percent against the U.S. Dollar at the
local foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Shilling strengthened against the U.S. Dollar to
about 65 last Friday when the IMF decided to send a team to Kenya
and the Shilling made further gains today, opening at 64.74
against the U.S. Dollar.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Trade Surges by 16.4: Report (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China has maintained a quick growth in the import of materials
badly needed by China's domestic economic development, resource
materials, high- and new-technology and complete plants over the
past five years, alleviating shortages of relevant materials at
domestic markets and advancing the development of industrial and
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The report also disclosed that overseas-funded enterprises are
playing an increasingly big role in China's national economy and
foreign trade. By 1996, about 47.3 percent of China's foreign
trade had been done by overseas-funded enterprises, but in 1991,
the proportion stood at only 21.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Up to the year of 1996, China had trade ties with 222 countries
and regions in the world, a rise of 23 countries and regions over
1991 level. Among them, the number of countries whose imports from
China each exceeds 100 million U.S. dollars has increased from 35
in 1991 to 60 in 1996, while the number of countries whose exports
to China each exceeds 100 million U.S. dollars has also increased
to 48 in 1996 from 40 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Japan is China's biggest trade partner, but the Republic of
Korea, as well as Taiwan region have become two markets featuring
the fastest growth over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
From 1992 to 1996, China's favorable balance of trade has made
its foreign exchange reserves surge from 21.71 billion
U.S. dollars in 1991 to 105.03 billion U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, China had earned 343.07 billion
U.S. dollars from exports, greatly enhancing China's ability to
pay back foreign debts and improving the overall national strength
of China.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that over the past five years, overseas
investors have moved a great number of labor-intensive businesses
to coastal areas of China, making processing trade one of
China's most important trading ways with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
During the period of the past five years, China's import and
export volume by way of processing trade topped 535 billion
U.S. dollars, with the annual average growth standing at 20.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
The development of China's export processing trade dominated by
labor-intensive enterprises has helped increase employment. Over
the past years, China's exports of manufactured industrial
commodities have offered about 40 million job opportunities, while
imported capital goods in 1996 provided jobs to more than 20
million people.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Sugar Industry Urged to Overturn Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Finance Minister
Sartaj Aziz today urged the sugar industry to improve its
performance and asked experts to investigate the gradual decline
in sugar production in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"There must be a progress in the sugar production by maximizing
the output and minimizing the cost," said Aziz while addressing an
annual convention of the Pakistan Society of Sugar Technologists
(PSST) held in Rawalpindi, a twin city of Pakistani capital
Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that Pakistan's sugar production had decreased
gradually after fiscal year 1994-95 despite the increase in the
number of sugar mills from 66 in 1994-95 to 74 in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's sugar production declined from 2.98 million tons in
1994-95 to 2.38 million tons in 1996-97, according to PSST
President Muhammad Saeed, who also gave a speech at the
convention.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Aziz said, the sugar industry was facing
difficulties and this year the government had to spend 227 million
U.S. dollars on the import of sugar to meet the domestic demands.
</P>
<P>
"The sugar industry has a crushing capacity of 300,000 tons per
day, but during the last season only two-third of the capacity was
utilized", Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
He agreed to a proposal about setting up an institution for
sugarcane and sugar research.
</P>
<P>
He also underlined the need of biological control of sugarcane
diseases as against the use of chemicals.

<HEADLINE> Late Birds May Not Benefit From New Calculation: EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Those countries that have to
wait until the second wave to join the economic and monetary union
(EMU) may not benefit from the new calculation scheme, the
European Union said today.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the new calculation scheme to be in force in
April 1999 will benefit the countries that cannot meet the
criteria now, a union spokesman said that no one will know whether
the new scheme is to work out figures upward or downward.
</P>
<P>
The new scheme will not have a clear-cut influence upon
calculation of gross domestic product (GDP), he added.
</P>
<P>
Countries aspiring to be in the first wave of joining EMU have
to meet the requirements of cutting their budget deficit to 3
percent or less of their GDP and their debt to 60 percent or less
of their GDP.
</P>
<P>
Now only Luxembourg has met both criteria. Ireland, Denmark and
the Netherlands are close to meeting the criteria.
</P>
<P>
The single currency, euro, will be launched in January 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 25 (Xinhua) -- "China has become a major
player in international political and economic arena due to her
rapidly increasing overall national strength," said Iftikhar Ahmed
Khan, Vice President of All Pakistan-China Friendship Association.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua, the former Pakistani attache
to China spoke highly of the spectacular achievements in the
economic and diplomatic fields that China has made over the past
two decades.
</P>
<P>
Talking about China's diplomatic achievements, Iftikhar said,
"China has consistently pursued an independent foreign policy of
peace and continually strengthened economic cooperation with all
nations throughout the world on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit."
</P>
<P>
"China has also kept opposing imperialism, hegemonism and
expansionism and advocating resolution of regional disputes
through peaceful means," he said.
</P>
<P>
When dealing with the state-to-state relations, he said, China
strictly adheres to the Five Principles of mutual respect for
sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression,
non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and
mutual benefit, and peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
"It is because of her such principled diplomatic stand, China
has won the respect of the majority of the world countries,
particularly the developing countries in the international
affairs," Iftikhar said.
</P>
<P>
"With her increasing overall national strength, China will play
a more important role in international affairs, especially in
establishing a new international order of justice and equality,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
During the two decades since China put into practice the policy
of reform and opening to the outside world in 1978, Iftikhar said,
tremendous changes have taken place in China's political, economic
and social fields.
</P>
<P>
"With a stable political situation and a record economic growth
rate, China is now marching towards an economic power," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the forthcoming 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China, Iftikhar said, "It is a major event in
the political and economic lives of Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
"During the meeting, Chinese leaders will make very important
decisions to ensure a sustained development of the country's
economy," he said. "The meeting will exert an important impact on
China's political and economic life as well as on the world as a
whole."

BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing met here
today with visitors from Hong Kong Shue Yan College, including the
college chancellor, Barrister Henry Hu Hung-lick, and its
president, Dr. Chung Kei-wing and her husband.
</P>
<P>
Shue Yan College was set up by Henry Hu and the Chungs 26 years
ago. As the founders have persisted in loving the motherland and
Hong Kong, and constantly improved the teaching quality, the
college has trained a large number of professionals for the
prosperity and development of Hong Kong, and contributed a great
deal to Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The college is also one of the earliest institutions of higher
learning in Hong Kong in forging exchange and cooperative ties
with universities in inland areas, such as Beijing University,
Qinghua University and the People's University of China.
</P>
<P>
Li Lanqing congratulated the college on the achievements it

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking official of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said here
today that the deputies to the 15th National Party Congress are
highly representative, and are key members and model workers from
all fields.
</P>
<P>
The election of the deputies began in last November in 36
costituencies throughout the country, including departments of the
CPC Central Committee and central government, the All-China
Federation of Taiwan Compatriots, the People's Liberation Army and
members of the armed police, as well as in 31 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The 36 constituencies across the nation had elected 2,049
deputies to the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) by the end of June. Later, one elected deputy faced
deprivation of his deputy qualifications for seriously violating
the Party discipline.
</P>
<P>
1,554 leading officials at various levels were elected,
accounting for 75.9 percent of the total number of deputies. 494
deputies of model workers, advanced workers, outstanding experts,
and heroes from all walks of life, account for 24.1 percent, up
2.1 percent over the number for the 14th National Party
Congress. The long list includes outstanding Party members such as
Xu Hu, Xu Honggang, Li Suli and Li Guo'an.

are from ethnic minority groups, accounting for 10.7 percent, up
0.8 percent from the previous congress.
</P>
<P>
The composition of deputies to the 15th National Party Congress
indicates that the education level of the Party members has
improved greatly along with rationalization of the age structure.
</P>
<P>
1,709 of the 2,048 deputies have received college education,
accounting for 83.5 percent of the total, up 12.7 percent over the
14th National Party Congress; 318 or 15.5 of the total have high

<P>
The 1,933 deputies who joined the Party after the founding of
new China in 1949 account for 94.4 percent of the total, up 11.5
percent on the 14th National Party Congress. 756 of them joined
the Party before May, 1966; 606 joined the Party between May 1966
and October 1976; and 571 joined the Party after November 1976.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee invited 60 elderly Party members to
serve as special deputies to the 15th National Party Congress. All
of them joined the Party before 1927 and once held important
leading posts. These senior comrades enjoy high prestige and
command universal respect.

Special deputies enjoy the same rights as formally elected
deputies.

<HEADLINE> US to Grant 100 Million Dollars in Aid to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 25 (Xinhua) - A senior Jordanian official
affirmed here today that the U.S. government will give Jordan an
additional 100 million U.S. dollars in economic aid this year.
</P>
<P>
Radio Jordan reported that Deputy Prime Minister for
Development Affairs and Minister of State for Prime Ministry
Affairs Jawad Anani said the sum will come from U.S. financial aid
to Egypt and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Anani said the additional aid came as a result of the efforts
made by King Hussein to push forward the peace process and his
continued contact with the U.S. administration.
</P>
<P>
Because it was not easy to increase the volume of its 1997
budget for foreign aid, Washington will cut 50 million dollars
from its aid to Egypt and Israel each and then grant it to Jordan,
Anani added.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of Planning Rima Khalaf will sign here
Tuesday two agreements in this regard with U.S. Ambassador to
Jordan, Wesley W. Egan and Director of the U.S. Agency for
International Development in Jordan, Lewis Lucke.
</P>
<P>
The grant will be made available through the Peace and
Stability Fund, which U.S. President Bill Clinton unveiled in
June this year during Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan's visit to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The fund was established in appreciation of the constructive
role Jordan has been playing in building peace and stability in
the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
Jordan mediated the Hebron accord between Israel and the
Palestinians in January this year, under which Israel promised
to evacuate most areas of the city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
In addition to economic aid, the Clinton Administration had
earlier decided to provide 300 million dollars in military aid to
Jordan in 1997. Part of that has been realized and both sides have
carried out two military exercises within this year.

<HEADLINE> Gulf States to Invest More to Develop Oil, Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Gulf Arab states need to
spend nearly 100 billion U.S. dollars in the next few years to
develop their oil and gas industry to meet growing domestic and
foreign demand.
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Emirates' (UAE) Wam news agency reported today
that the fund is part of a total investment of between 200 billion
dollars and 250 billion dollars in energy and communications until
the year 2010 in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
</P>
<P>
It quoted a study by the Gulf Investment Corporation (GIC) as
saying "The oil and gas sector alone needs an investment of around
100 billion dollars while nearly 35 billion dollars are needed
for petrochemical projects."
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said that most GCC countries have embarked
on projects to boost their oil production capacity and tap their
mammoth gas resources.
</P>
<P>
They said the six GCC members which include Saudi Arabia, the
UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar have pumped more than 30
billion dollars since 1990 on maintenance and development of
their oilfields.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is the world's dominant oil power with a current
crude output capacity of 9.5 million barrels per day (bpd). It
plans to expand the capacity later to more than 10 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has also embarked on projects to boost capacity to
3 million bpd in the year 2000 from current 2.3 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has already raised its production potential to nearly
2.5 million bpd from 2 million bpd. It plans to increase its
production capacity to 3 million bpd in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The three Gulf countries control more than 45 percent of the
world's total recoverable crude wealth and produce around 17
percent of the global oil supplies.

<HEADLINE> Chinese NPC Standing Committee Meeting Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The 27th Meeting of the Standing
Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), China's
top legislature, opened here today, as lawmakers began to examine
draft laws on flood control, price, prevention and alleviation of
disasters caused by earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
The today's meeting was presided over by Qiao Shi, chairman of
the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi said this is the second time the draft law on flood
control is presented for discussion, and is expected to be adopted
by the NPC Standing Committee at this meeting.
</P>
<P>
When explaining the draft law on price entrusted by the State
Council, Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning
Commission, told the lawmakers that the law aims at meeting the
demands of China's socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
"It helps establish and improve a mechanism of price formed by
the market under the macro-economic control," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to define the experience and practice of the
price reform over the past 18 years in order to deepen the price
reform, standardize price actions, give full play of price in a
reasonable resource disposition, stablize the overall price level,
and ensure a healthy development of a socialist market economy,
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhangli, director of the State Seismological Bureau, made
an explanation on the draft law on prevention and alleviation of
seismological disasters at today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
The director said that China is a country frequently hit by
earthquakes, which often cause heavy losses. It should be noted
that the country has now entered a peak stage of the 5th active
earthquake period of the 20th century, he said, warning that it
possible that disastrous earthquakes measuring over 7 might occur.
</P>
<P>
"Prevention and alleviation of disasters caused by earthquakes
is a systematic project that affects all aspects of life and need
to be solved in a legal way," the director said.
</P>
<P>
At the today's meeting, lawmakers also heard reports on
international conventions and treaties on border disarmament, and
on judicial assistance between China and its peripheral countries.
</P>
<P>
During the five-day meeting, lawmakers will also review reports
on the implementation of the national economic and social development
plan since the beginning of this year and on the country's
meteorological work.
</P>
<P>
They will hear a report on the inspection of law enforcement of
product quality, and other relevant reports.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Construction Firms Praised in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Public Works and Housing
Minister Jonathan Ng'eno today praised Chinese construction firms
in Kenya for their high construction quality and very competitive
bidding prices.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Kenyan cooperation in this field should be deepened
through joint efforts in the future, Ng'eno said when meeting
with visiting Chinese Minister of Communications Huang Zhendong.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Road &AMP; Bridge Corporation, a leading company under
China's Ministry of Communications, has built roads with
first-level quality for the eastern African country, he
especially noted.
</P>
<P>
The corporation so far has constructed 198 kilometers of
roads, earning 2.3 billion Shillings (46 million U.S. Dollars
then) in total since it set up office here in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Ng'eno also spoke highly of China's long-term economic
assistance to Kenya, including the construction of a modern
stadium, a hospital and part of roads in the western areas.
</P>
<P>
The friendly relations between the two countries have been
greatly enhanced by the exchanges of visits of their top leaders,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
In response, Huang said Chinese construction firms in Kenya
will continue to focus themselves on the expansion of two-way
cooperation on the basis of being low-profitable, instead of
pursuing high profits.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Kenya are developing countries and should
develop their ties in the context of South-South cooperation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese firms play an active role in guaranteeing reasonable
bidding prices, creating jobs for local people, training local
skilled workers and engineers on Kenya's construction market,
Huang said.

<HEADLINE> Price Law Submitted to Legislative Examination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China has completed drafting the
first law on price and the draft was submitted to the country's
top legislature for deliberation here today.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the draft to the 27th meeting of the Standing
Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress, minister in
charge of the State Planning Commission Chen Jinhua said China
needs a law on price to create a sound environment for the
formation of pricing system under a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Such a law is indispensable for maintaining a good market order
and protecting the interests of both manufacturers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
He noted price reforms in recent decade have brought about
fundamental changes to China's price management system, with
prices for some 95 percent commodities and services now being
determined by market forces.
</P>
<P>
"Lifting price control does not mean not to regulate it
at all though the market economy requires government
administration through appropriate means," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The draft law has seven chapters and 43 articles, covering such
aspects as pricing by traders, government-guided pricing, overall
price level regulating and price supervising and checking.
</P>
<P>
The draft law stipulates that government should take temporary
interfering measures or impose any emergency rules on prices in
case of drastic price swings or rises.
</P>
<P>
Chen stressed that the law is expected to improve government's
macro economic regulation which will in turn anchor the national
economy on a sustainable, steady and healthy development track.

<HEADLINE> S. African Teenagers on Mission to Spread AIDS: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Some AIDS-stricken
teenagers in South Africa are deliberately infecting others so as
not to have to suffer and die alone, local daily "The Citizen"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the results of a study conducted by the Biological and
Medical Anthropology at the University of Durban-Westville, the
report said some teenage males in Kwazulu/Natal Province are even
resorting to rape to spread the disease.
</P>
<P>
"You know you'll be rejected, you know you're going to die.
All you can do is go off and spread (AIDS). It's your only hope,
knowing you won't die alone," one youth told researchers.
</P>
<P>
Kwazulu/Natal has more than two-thirds of the estimated 1.8
million HIV-AIDS cases in South Africa, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The organizer of the study, lecturer Suzanne Leclerc-Madlala,
said her team of researchers had come across attitudes and
behaviors "quite opposite to what AIDS educators would hope for".
</P>
<P>
Many of those polled during the research said they were
convinced they were carrying HIV virus but did not want to go for
tests as it "didn't really matter".
</P>
<P>
According to the report, one doctor working in rural areas
told researchers she no longer told patients if they tested HIV
positive unless they specifically asked, which they never did.
</P>
<P>
"They just go out and spread it anyway," the doctor said,
adding "even if they say they're not, they're lying."
</P>
<P>
Women described to the researchers how they had been raped by
laughing teenagers who told them to relax and not to cry because
"everyone has AIDS now".

<HEADLINE> Australian Sues for Millions of Dollars in Valve Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The family of a Sydney man who
died after his artificial heart valve fractured is suing a U.S.
multinational corporation for more than 10 million Australian
dollars (7.4 million U.S. dollars), in a world-first court
hearing, the Australian Associated Press reported today.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address in the Federal Court today, Brian
Donovan, the family's barrister, said the valve, which was never
permitted to be marketed in the United States, was not adequately
designed, tested or manufactured.
</P>
<P>
He said in the months before the Sydney man received the value,
the "chief expert" on the device had strongly warned the U.S.
corporation not to use the valve any more because of a number of
fractures of the valves in his patients.
</P>
<P>
The three children and wife of the man, whose name is
suppressed, are suing the U.S. manufacturer Shiley Inc. and its
parent company Pfizer Inc., over the "70 degrees" Bjork-Shiley
convexco/concave valve.
</P>
<P>
The valve was implanted in the Sydney man, an accountant and
property owner, in July 1982 and he died at the age of 38, in
1990.
</P>
<P>
About 500 claims have been brought and settled in the United
States involving 60 degrees valves, but the Federal Court case was
the first involving a death after a fractured valve to go to
trial.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 valves had fractured with about 1,000 people dying
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The 70 degrees valves were recalled and withdrawn in 1983, AAP
said.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald, published last Saturday, quoted
statements by former employers of the U.S. manufacturer that none
of the workers in the company took their jobs seriously, with some
smoking dope or snorting cocaine on the job.
</P>
<P>
Many skilled staff had walked out during an industrial dispute,
some workers were replaced by illegal immigrants hired straight
off the streets, and many of them did not speak English, according
to Larry Hamilton, who was the company's quality control manager
in 1980-1984.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Bans Civil Servants From Accepting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Provisional Ruling Council of
Nigeria has endorsed an order that bans serving ministers and
other civil servants from accepting traditional titles in any
form.
</P>
<P>
A Nigerian newspaper This Day reported today that the ban is
recommended by the special committee set up last May by the
Provisional Ruling Council, Nigeria's supreme legislative body.
</P>
<P>
Although the government gave no reason for the ban, the report
quoted sources as saying that it may arise from the "questionable
influence of such titles on both the person taking and those
giving them".
</P>
<P>
While implying that serious corruption exists in such cases,
the report also pointed out that "quite a large number of serving
ministers have amassed traditional titles irrespective of their
meanings for usefulness".
</P>
<P>
Instead of traditional titles, the committee recommended that
merit awards should be instituted for long-serving and
outstanding civil servants.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Activities Close to Halt for Lack of Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The non-payment of contributions
by members of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) has almost halted the implementation of the body's
programs in the past year, said the ECOWAS Executive Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of ECOWAS Council of Ministers, Chief Ayo Ogunlade,
said last Saturday that member countries now owe the secretariat
more than 42 million U.S. Dollars as arrears.
</P>
<P>
The debt, including arrears of between three to 17 years as
well as contributions for 1997, has "virtually halted" the
execution of the community programs, said ECOWAS Executive
Secretary Edward Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
He described 1997 as a "particularly difficult year for the
community institutions and especially for the Executive
Secretariat" because of the non-payment.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin made the remarks in his message to the three-day
session of the ECOWAS Council of Ministers which began in the
Nigerian capital of Abuja last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The session is part of a series of meetings of ECOWAS
functionaries held to make preparations for the ECOWAS summit
coming on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It will be followed by a meeting of foreign ministers of the
member countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Benjamin, the impressive programs which the
16-member community adopted as a result of its interaction with
other regional groupings include the harmonization of national
macro-economic policies, establishment of a single monetary zone,
and trade liberalization scheme.
</P>
<P>
Other major programs cover the regional infrastructure
networks, regional gas line project, inter-connection of national
electric grids, regional environmental protection and regional
food security.
</P>
<P>
Ogunlade, who is also Nigeria's Minister of National Planning,
blamed the fund crisis of the secretariat for the failure to
implement a community levy.
</P>
<P>
The member countries agreed at last year's ECOWAS summit that
a 0.05 percent levy be imposed on all imports into the sub-region
from third countries.
</P>
<P>
However, a protocol on this adopted last year has not been
ratified by member states although it was expected to come into
effect on January 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian minister urged his colleagues to take bold steps
to make the scheme effective by coming up with concrete proposals
for the summit on how it could be operational from January 1 next
year.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the member countries to take immediate steps to
ratify all the protocols so far adopted to ensure the smooth
operation of the 22-year-old community.

<HEADLINE> Australia Offers Aid To Help PNG War-torn Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia had offered a 74
million U.S. dollar "peace dividend" out of its aid budget to try
and help resolve Bougainville's long-running secessionist crisis
in neighboring Papua New Guinea (PNG), Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer announced today.
</P>
<P>
Following talks with senior PNG ministers today, the foreign
minister announced that 14.8 million U.S. dollars a year over the
next five years would be dedicated to reconstruction and
rehabilitation projects on the war-torn island.
</P>
<P>
PNG gained independence from Australia in 1975 following its
69-year rule.
</P>
<P>
The funds are being allocated out of the 128 million U.S.
dollars in foreign aid Australia already provides to PNG annually,
and are not additional.
</P>
<P>
Downer said the dedication of the aid money to restore services
such as schools and hospitals on the island showed that there was
a dividend if Bougainvilleans chose the path of the peace.
</P>
<P>
"That is what this 100 million Australian dollars (74 million
U.S. dollars) is about," Downer was quoted by the Australian
Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Downer also offered cautious support for the Burnham
Declaration reached by the warring Bougainville parties at a
meeting in New Zealand last month, which has reinvigorated hopes
for an end to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
PNG's newly-elected Prime Minister Bill Skate offered his
government's full support for the declaration at the weekend as he
announced two new rounds of peace talks set down for September and
October.
</P>
<P>
The declaration calls for a ceasefire, a lifting of the
military blockade, demilitarisation of the island and the
installation of a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
Downer also committed Australia to transporting representatives
to the next round of talks in New Zealand and helping with the
repatriation of Bougainville refugees once the island returns to
normal.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that Australia, PNG and New Zealand
had been talking for some time about a peacekeeping force on the
island, but added it was too early in negotiations to make any
decision.
</P>
<P>
PNG Foreign Minister Kilroy Genia said Australia had agreed to
provide rations, uniforms, boots and other necessities for the
cash-strapped Papua New Guinea Defense Force.

<HEADLINE> Huge Input Needed in Nigeria's Minerals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The mining experts and bankers of
Nigeria have drawn out an investment plan for the government to
substantially increase the production of solid minerals in the
oil- and gas-rich country.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian today quoted the experts and bankers as saying
that about 97.2 billion Naira (nearly 1.2 billion U.S. Dollars)
will be needed for raising the share of solid minerals from the
current 0.3 percent of gross domestic product to four percent in
the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The plan has been submitted to the Vision 2010 Committee, the
country's long-term planning body which is working on a blueprint
for socio-economic development toward the year 2010, according to
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government, aware of the danger of the country's
oil-centered economy, has decided to boost the development of
minerals other than oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
It established the Ministry of Solid Minerals in 1995 for this
purpose. Import of some minerals which have rich reserves in the
country has been banned to encourage domestic production.
</P>
<P>
To date, 51 varieties of minerals have been identified in
Nigeria, with the reserves of 33 proven.

Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), met
today with a Japanese delegation from the Executive Committee of
"Tour De China" cycling race in the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese delegation was led by Akira Okazaki.
</P>
<P>
Buhe expressed thanks to the Japanese visitors for sponsoring
the annual cycling race and congratulated them on the success of
this year's event.
</P>
<P>
He praised Akira for his contributions to promoting
friendship between China and Japan. He said that Akira has
inherited the fine spirit of his late father Kaheita Okazaki,
who initiated the idea of the cycling race.
</P>
<P>
Buhe expressed the hope that the race will be expanded in scale
in the coming years, so as to promote exchanges between youths of
the two countries and the cycling sport in Asia. This will be
conducive to the development of the good-neighborly friendship
between China and Japan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Akira Okazaki said that both Japanese and Chinese people regard
the cycling race not only as a sports event, but also as a
significant event in bilateral friendly exchanges. He expressed
the hope that the race will grow into an event that will match
the Tour De France rally.

<HEADLINE> 300 Ugandan Civilians Killed Since Mid-June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 300 Ugandan civilians
have been killed in West Uganda since mid-June, a local newspaper
''The Monitor'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
About half of them were killed by the rebels of the Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF) at their gardens in search for food,
security sources told the paper.
</P>
<P>
The invasion of ADF rebels into Bundibugyo district in
mid-June caused an exodus to the neighbor district of Kabarole,
but lack of food forced some of the 80,000 displaced to return to
their home.
</P>
<P>
The refugees have to sell their goats at a price of 1,200
Uganda Shillings (some 1.2 U.S. dollars) a kilogram to collect
money for food, while the normal price in Kampala is some 2,800
Shillings a kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Many schools are closed in the district and the teachers and
children have fled their schools.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government army has killed some 120 rebels,
lossing 25 their own soldiers in the fightings against the rebels
so far.
</P>
<P>
ADF is a rebel group acting in western Kasese district. It
sent a team of rebels into Bundibugyo to develop a food source in
mid-June.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Some 24.4 million Chinese
between the ages of 15 and 47 have become literate in the past
five years, bringing the illiteracy rate down four percent since
1992 in this age group.
</P>
<P>
The State Education Commission (SEC) announced today that the
illiteracy rate of people in this age group is now 6.1 percent. It
is estimated that in the first half of this century, illiterate
people in China made up 90 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
The SEC says that a six-year education program is now universal
among 92 percent of the Chinese population, and a nine-year
compulsory education program applies to 1,480 counties.
</P>
<P>
Ten province, municipalities and regions, as well as 2,000
counties and districts have basically wiped out illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
The country's goal is to make nine-year compulsory education
universal and to eradicate illiteracy among people aged 15 to 47
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Some four million more Chinese learned to read and write last
year.

<HEADLINE> China's Coastal Area More Involved in International Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- There are encouraging signs in
more developed coastal areas of east China becoming increasingly
involved in international economic relations, providing a strong
link to the world market.
</P>
<P>
The city of Shanghai, and Jiangsu, Shandong, Guangdong, Fujian,
and Zhejiang provinces account for about a quarter of the nation's
total area and population but export 76 percent of the goods and
their overseas investment make up more than 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Rapidly increasing exports last year amounted to nearly 115
billion US dollars, with Shanghai and Guangdong's exports
accounting for 36 percent and 80 percent of their GDP,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
As a pioneer of China's reform and opening-up drive, the area
has business contacts with nearly 200 countries and regions that
have put more than 100 billion US dollars into the area in
100,000-plus joint ventures. The area used 35.26 billion US
dollars in foreign investment in 1996, accounting for 82.7 of the
national total.
</P>
<P>
Multinationals like the US's Mobil Oil and General Motors,
Japan's Hitachi, Daewoo of the Republic of Korea, and Germany's
Mercedes Benz have businesses in the area.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector is another link to the world economy, with
156 overseas financial organizations having set up branches or
offices in more than 20 major Chinese cities, mainly in the
coastal area.

<P>
In Shenzhen, China's first special economic zone,
overseas-backed banking businesses have 5.3 billion US dollars
worth of capital assets and have made 15 billion US dollars worth
of loans. Last year, they held 2.45 billion US dollars in overseas
investment, half the city's total volume.
</P>
<P>
Some enterprises in China's coastal area have also tried their
luck abroad, opening more than 2,000 businesses in nearly 100
countries and regions. Jiangsu Province, for example, has spent
over 100 million US dollars in the non-trading sector, and Chinese
Panda Electronics Group has four companies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Chinese-backed enterprises abroad are playing a double role in
bringing technology and market information back, in addition to
exporting goods.
</P>
<P>
This has improved the industrial structure and quality of
products. Of some 16,000 overseas ventures in Shanghai, more than
4,000 are in the industrial sector, with a third of the city's
industrial output and pre-tax profits, and 56 percent of
Shanghai's exports.
</P>
<P>
Even farmers in the area are eyeing the international market.
In Shandong and Jiangsu, several thousand export-oriented
businesses that link rural families with the outside world have
emerged. Shandong, now known as an "international shopping
basket", sells several hundred million US dollars worth of
agricultural products in overseas markets.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Both sides of the Sino-Portuguese
Joint Liaison Group (JLG) have agreed to accelerate the handling
of the transitional issues in Macao in the remaining period before
the handover of power in 1999, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Han Zhaokang, chief representative of the Chinese side of the
JLG, told reporters after his first round of talks with his
Portuguese counterpart wrapped up today that the two sides reached
the consensus during their talks.
</P>
<P>
"We both agree that, as time left is limited, we should quicken
our working rhythm so that issues concerning Macao's transition
and the handover of power could be resolved on time and properly,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Having assumed office earlier this month, the new Chinese
ambassador also said that the two sides have agreed to work in an
"open, pragmatic and constructive spirit" in the coming two years
and four months.
</P>
<P>
Han and his Portuguese counterpart Antonio Santana Carlos
discussed almost every issue of concern and made a general review
of them during their first round of meetings.
</P>
<P>
Apart from legal issues, they talked about the localization of
civil service, the use of Chinese as an official language, the
nationality issue of some Macao citizens, the pension of retired
Macao civil servants, Macao's renewal of member status of some
international bodies, the establishment of a treasury reserve in
Macao, the transfer of archives, the transfer of government assets
and the establishment of a Portuguese-language school in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Carlos said that he hoped all these issues would be resolved
before the handover in 1999 in a constructive atmosphere of
"understanding and friendship."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the two sides agreed to hold a specialized meeting on
the transfer of archives Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the upcoming meeting is a major outcome of
the talks as the Chinese side has asked for the establishment of a
working panel on the transfer of archives for years.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Port Qasim Authority of
Pakistan will soon offer its 6,000 acres of land on competitive
basis through international bidding to develop it as an industrial
park.
</P>
<P>
Both domestic and foreign mega investors will be offered land
on either long-term lease or rental basis, according to Associated
Press of Pakistan (APP) today,
</P>
<P>
The investors are required to develop the land into four
special industrial zones measuring 1,500 acres each which are
located near Qasim port, the second largest port of Pakistan and
about 50 km southeast of the largest Karachi port.
</P>
<P>
The Port Qasim Authority (PQA) will provide the external
development around the park including connection to road and
railway network, beside provision of water and sewerage lines to
the industrial park.
</P>
<P>
The mega investor will be free to have his own state-of-the-art
planning for this special industrial zone according to the
requirement of potential investors or industrial plot holders, own
corporate management and provide civic amenities.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Communication has studied the proposal which
will be presented to the prime minister for final approval, APP
quoted PQA sources as saying.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Research by a group of Nigerian
scholars shows that 72 percent of Nigerians support General Sani
Abacha's running for a civilian president.
</P>
<P>
The Punch reported today that this is the result of the first
phase of a research sponsored by the National Mobilization and
Persuasion Committee for Abacha for president.
</P>
<P>
A total of 28 professors of different disciplines from the
University of Jos, the Federal University of Technology, Bayero
University and three other universities are involved in the
research, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Among those polled are people of different ages and
professions, including marketers and students, it said.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the committee, Godwin Adzuanah said that the aim
of the research is to find out the popularity and acceptability
of Abacha's alleged bid to run for president next year.
</P>
<P>
He explained: "We are not asking for the prolongation of
military administration, but we are asking General Abacha to put
off his uniform and come out as a civilian to contest for the
presidency."
</P>
<P>
The aim of his committee, Adzuanah said, is to ensure
continuity and cohesion in government and the unity of the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the committee now has 29 chapters in 29
states of Nigeria. It also has offices in London, Switzerland,
Washington dc and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
Taking over the power in late 1993, General Abacha promised in
his transition to civil rule program that his military government
will handover power to an elected civilian government in October
1998.
</P>
<P>
On the controversial issue of whether or not he will run for
the next presidency, Abacha said earlier that it will be decided
by his constinuency.

<P>
HONG KONG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Hospital
Authority is to conduct an urgent review of the local medical
system in the wake of the public outcry at medical blunders that
have led to the death of patients and serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
Today's local newspapers said the Hospital Authority will study
procedures in all Hong Kong public hospitals in response to public
concern over practices and professional accountability.
</P>
<P>
The review follows Saturday's revelation that a girl had part
of her reproductive system cut out because a surgeon thought it
was her appendix. In a similar case at the same hospital, a woman
had a fallopian tube severed during another appendectomy by two
surgeons.
</P>
<P>
In another case, a 20-year-old man hurt in a car crash two
weeks ago died after being given incompatible blood, and in July
an old woman died after a hospital gave her an overdose of an
antibiotic.
</P>
<P>
In a forum discussing hospital standards Sunday, medical
professionals blamed inadequate supervision and a heavy workload
for the blunders.
</P>
<P>
A Hospital Authority spokeswoman said training, supervision and
reporting systems in public hospitals would be monitored, along
with staffing levels, drug procedures, blood transfusion
guidelines, safety, security, complaints and medical-legal
systems.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka today launched a
nation-wide campaign to help its people understand the island
country's ethnic problem and seek a peaceful settlement of the
country's long-standing ethnic conflict.
The campaign was inaugurated by President Chandrika Kumaratunga
at Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka's cultural capital in North Central
Province, this morning.
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, entitled "Ranga Thavalama" (Understanding
the Fight), a cultural troupe will travel through the island
presenting street dramas to create awareness among the people
about the country's ethnic problem, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was sponsored by the "Sudu Nelum" (White Lotus)
movement, which advocates peace and supports the government's
solution to the country's ethnic problem, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the "Sudu Nelum" movement said the campaign
will help the majority Sinhalese people be aware of the country's
ethnic conflict and support the government's peace effort.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, to last for more than three months, will tell
people about the beginning, the development and the present
situation of the country's ethnic war through a photo and book
exhibition, video programs and other activities, the spokesman
said.
A monument symbolizing national unity was also unveiled by the
president today to coincide with the launch of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has long been plagued by the problems between the
Sinhalese and the Tamil -- the two major ethnic groups accounting
for 74 percent and 18 percent of the country's population
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam has been fighting a war
for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the island
country since 1983. More than 55,000 people have been killed in
the ethnic war.

<HEADLINE> SADC Prepares Position on Lome Convention Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 25 (Xinhua) --The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) states will hold Further
consultations later this week to put together a common position
on the review of the Lome Convention before a SADC summit meeting
next month.
</P>
<P>
SADC spokesman Kgosinkwe Moesi made the announcement in
Gaborone, capital of Botswana at the weekend, local media
reported today.
</P>
<P>
He said a meeting between businesses, governments and regional
stakeholders on Thursday will be followed by an SADC trade and
industry ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will have to agree on a final set of
recommendations to be tabled to the SADC summit in Blantyre,
Malawi early next month.
</P>
<P>
The Lome Convention, a trade and aid arrangement bringing
together the European Union (EU), 70 African Caribbean and
Pacific (ACP) countries, is due for renewal at the turn of the
century. Renewal talks are to start next year.
</P>
<P>
All SADC countries, except South Africa, belong to the
convention. Pretoria is poised to join the convention later this
year as a partial member.
</P>
<P>
If approved by the summit, the recommendations from the
ministers' meeting on Friday will become the SADC's contribution
to the African position, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
This will then form part of the ACP negotiating directives
when the talks begin with the EU next year, he added.
</P>
<P>
No official position exists within the SADC yet, but calls
have been made for the Lome Convention's trade concessions to be
restored in a post-1999 agreement with the EU, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
The convention, which is now into its fourth term, grants
non-reciprocal tariff and quota preferences to the ACPs in EU
markets. The ACPs also benefit from a range of special commodity
protocols on products such as bananas.
</P>
<P>
The 12-member SADC was formed five years ago to coordinate
efforts for a common market. The regional group has a total
population of 150 million and a combined gross domestic product
of 170 billion U.S. Dollars.

JOHANNESBURG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela will meet Sudanese People's Liberation Army leader
Johan Garang in Pretoria on Tuesday in a bid to kick off peace

</P>
<P>
The coming talks, the second of its kind since last December,

<HEADLINE> Chinese Spokesman Disputes US Congressman's Comments on Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Tang Guoqiang, responding to journalists' questions
about US Representative Frank R. Wolf's remarks about what he
allegedly saw and heard in Tibet, said that they were "lamentable".
</P>
<P>
Wolf recently claimed that there is no religious freedom for
Tibetans and that the Chinese Central Government has pursued a
"Cultural Genocide" policy in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Government's policy is to protect and develop the
culture and traditions of minority people," Tang said, noting that
Tibetans' freedom to practice religion is fully protected by the
Constitution and laws of China.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Chinese Government has set aside funds
specifically for repairing more than 1,700 monasteries and other
religious sites like the Potala, and has systematically surveyed,
collected, collated, studied, and published Tibetan cultural and
folk arts materials, and has provided for the study of the Tibetan
language and the use of Mandarin and Tibetan as a teaching medium,
Tang said.
</P>
<P>
"Tibetan culture is developing in an all-round way and does not
in any way face extinction," he said, and that this is a fact that
was widely recognized at an international seminar on Tibetan
studies recently in Beijing in which scholars from the United
States participated.
</P>
<P>
Anyone can see a world of difference between the Tibet of today
and the old Tibet, in which the vast number of serfs, who made up
over 90 percent of the population, suffered political oppression
and economic exploitation, Tang said, adding that the old Tibet
was one of the darkest and most backward regions in the world
where human rights were most seriously trampled upon.
</P>
<P>
"It was only after the Democratic Reform and the abolishment of
serfdom there that the Tibetan people truly gained their freedom
and enjoyed all the political rights that are guaranteed by the
Constitution and the Law on Regional National Autonomy of the
People's Republic of China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Representative Frank R. Wolf, wearing colored spectacles, has
wantonly slandered China, disregarding the enormous progress that
has been made in Tibet in various fields. This is something
lamentable and will fall through," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Taxes Prompt British Pensioners to Drop Private Medical Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- As many as 100,000 British
pensioners are estimated to have given up private health insurance
since the British government scrapped tax relief on premiums for
people over the age of 60 two months ago, a newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Up to half a million are expected to join the mass exodus from
private medical care, the Daily Telegraph said.
</P>
<P>
The cuts in tax relief, imposed by the Labor government's first
budget plan, effectively caused insurance premiums to rise by a
third, which might affect 1.2 million people's decision whose
policies are due to be renewed later this year.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Conservative Party has warned that the drift
from private treatment would increase the burden on the National
Health Service (NHS), and wipe out the 140 million pounds (228.2
million U.S. dollars) savings the Treasury intended to secure by
removing the tax relief.
</P>
<P>
On average, the NHS spends 1,300 pounds (2,119 U.S. dollars) a
year on every patient aged 65 and above. An extra 100,000
pensioners in the public health care system would cost the NHS 130
million pounds (212 million dollars) a year, almost totally
offsetting the forecast savings, critics said.
</P>
<P>
But Western Provident Association, one of the leading health
insurers in Britain, estimated that the NHS will have to spend at
least an extra 300 million pounds (480 million dollars) to look
after patients who no longer have private coverage.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Study Treatment of Snake Bites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists are
studying ways to develop a synthetic antidote to protect the lives
of cobra bite victims, said a latest report of Israel's Weizmann
Institute of Science.
</P>
<P>
The report said that poisonous snakes immobilize their prey
through hypnosis before killing them, and on the molecular level,
snake venom immobilizes a protein known as the acetylcholine
receptor which plays a crucial role in nerve-muscle communication.
</P>
<P>
Scientists in the Weizmann Institute have pinpointed the exact
spot at which cobra venom latches on to the acetylcholine
receptor.
</P>
<P>
A synthetic antidote could protect just that tiny spot,
preventing the venom from latching on to the receptor, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
It would be more effective and faster-acting than the current
method of treatment, which involves injecting the victim with
horse serum containing antibodies against the venom.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the synthetic molecule would eliminate the risk of
allergy associated with serum therapy, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In the study, Professor Sara Fuchs of the Immunology Department
and some other researchers zeroed in on a peptide (protein
fragment) that makes up a tiny fraction of the acetylcholine
receptor - a dozen amino acids out of some 2,000 - yet is crucial
for the binding between the receptor and a particular toxin in
the cobra venom.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal, the scientists searched through the
huge "library" of random peptides until they identified the one
peptide that had the strongest interaction with the toxin.
</P>
<P>
In a parallel study, Professor Jacob Anglister and Tali
Scherf of the Structural Biology Department used nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy to describe the structural
aspects of binding between the protein fragment and the snake
toxin.

<P>
KATHMANDU, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Encephalitis and meningitis
have claimed another 11 lives in Jhapa district of eastern Nepal,
the official RSS news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The victims, which included seven Bhutanese refugees and four
locals, were among the 44 patients hospitalized, the RSS said.
</P>
<P>
The latest death brought to 24 the number of victims to the
diseases in this district in August.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, eight have also succumbed to the diseases in the
Terai districts of mid- and far-western Nepal.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees have been staying in eight
UN-run camps in Jhapa and its neighboring Morang district after
being forced to flee Bhutan in 1989 and the early 1990s.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Makers Step up 64-Megabyte DRAM Chip Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korean semiconductor makers,
including Samsung, LG and Hyundai, are ready and poised to expand
production of 64-megabyte DRAM chips in bid to meet the
generational shifting from 16-megabyte chips.
</P>
<P>
According to the industry sources, Samsung produced 1 million
64-M DRAMs a month in the first quarter this year, and monthly
production expanded to 2 million during the second
quarter. Samsung plans to boost monthly output to 3 million by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
LG plans to expand its monthly production capacity to 3 million
by the end of this year from the current 500,000-700,000. To
attain the goal, LG will convert the 16-M DRAM production line
into a 64-m DRAM line depending on production conditions.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai will maintain its domestic 64-M DRAM production at
300,000 a month while mass-producing 64-M DRAMs at its overseas
plant in Oregon, the United States.
</P>
<P>
The move indicates their strategy to prepare for a price
bit-cross between 64-M DRAM and 16-M DRAM which is expected to
take place from the fourth quarter of this year, Hyundai Research
Institute said.
</P>
<P>
Bit-cross, a semiconductor industry jargon meaning the price of
four 16-M DRAMs is almost equal to one 64-M DRAM, will lead to a
generational shift of chips because the adoption of 64-M DRAM is
technically advantageous to buying four 16-M DRAMs.
</P>
<P>
The price of bit-cross was pushed up as demand for big-capacity
PCs utilizing 64-M DRAM chips has been on sharp rise following
Intel's price cut of its Pentium II while Japan's NEC Corp. and
other leading makers have been cutting the price of 64-M DRAM
chips in a bid to gain a marketing edge, sources said.

ISLAMABAD, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will launch a
campaign next month against vehicles which entered the country
illegally, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Customs in collaboration with provincial excise and

Most of such vehicles have got fake registration number plates
in connivance with the functionaries of provincial excise
departments, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Due to non-payment of duties by these vehicles, the federal
government has been suffering loss of billions of rupees.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Smart Card for Intra-ASEAN Travel Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 25 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN Secretary-General
Ajit Singh today proposed that smart cards be used for travel
within the nine- member regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
Such facility would not only represent ASEAN's leap into the
future but also perform the same functions as the passport, he
said in his welcoming remarks at the opening of a two-day meeting
of ASEAN immigration director-generals here today.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the current meeting could endorse
the idea of a smart card and establish a sub-committee to work out
the details.
</P>
<P>
He said the use of smart cards when crossing borders has
already become an accepted practice in some of the growth
triangles in ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
As such it should not be too difficult to extend it on an
ASEAN-wide basis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ajit Singh also said the meeting's most important agenda
concerned the abolition of visas for travel within ASEAN, hoping
it would help expedite the process even further so that visa-free
travel becomes a way of life in ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Tourists from ASEAN members -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Myanmar, Laos, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam --
presently enjoy visa-free entry for a month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malaysian Deputy Home Minister Tajol Rosli Ghazali,
who opened the meeting, called for the creation of ASEAN lanes at

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Welfare Party Strives for Survival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish pro-Islamic Welfare
Party (RP) is working intensely to defend itself in a closure suit
against the party, the newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said RP leader Necmettin Erbakan was discussing a
defense statement with his senior advisors in Turkey's western
town of Altinoluk, where he was on summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
The party is facing trial before the Constitutional Court on
charges of having been encouraging Islamic fundamentalism.
Turkey's Chief Prosecutor Vural Savas filed a closure case against
the RP in May this year and has been calling on the supreme
judicial body to outlaw the party.
</P>
<P>
The RP will have to submit its defense statement, which is
expected to consist of six parts with a total of 100 pages, to the
Constitutional Court on September 5, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The RP leader and former Turkish prime minister Erbakan would
personally make a verbal defense before the Court, it added.
</P>
<P>
The RP has asked for an additional 60 days to prepare for its
defense thoroughly, but the Constitutional Court has not yet
permitted.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan had threatened that he would apply to the European
Court of Human Rights if RP is closed on anti-secularism charges.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan and his party have long been criticized for their
reluctance to curb the growing Islamic fundamentalism in the
secular country.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military, supported by other secularists, forced
the Erbakan government to resign on June 18.

JOHANNESBURG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- South African Defense
Minister Joe Modise has held talks with Kuwaiti officials over
possible arms sale to the Gulf state, local press reported today.
</P>

al-Sabah, the acting Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh
Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah and Defense Minister Sheikh Salem Sabah
al-Salem al-Sabah.

<HEADLINE> PNA Pleas for International Pressure to End Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has appealed to the United States and Europe to
intervene to end Israel's closure on the Palestinian self-rule
territories, particular Bethlehem, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
PNA chief negotiator Saeb Erekat made the appeal Sunday in a
letter to U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross, European Union
representative Miguel Moratinos and other leaders complaining
about Israel's punitive actions against the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Erekat hoped that under the pressure from international
community Israel would end the closure of Bethlehem, stop
demolishing Palestinians' houses and cancel its plans to send hit
teams into Palestinian-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
"We urged them to interfere directly with the Israeli
government to put an end to such measures," he said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said the closure of Bethlehem by Israel
following the Mahane Yehuda bombing last month in Jerusalem
which killed 16 people and wounded 170 others, was killing
tourism, the city's main lifeblood.
</P>
<P>
"The economy is destroyed completely," said acting Mayor Hanna
Nasser, adding that "The city is losing a quarter of a million
dollars daily."
</P>
<P>
The closure of Bethlehem was highlighted Sunday when Israeli
troops blocked a dozen tour buses carrying 600 Italian Christian
pilgrims from entering the town.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrims then staged a prayer service at the road-block
until Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai granted the
group permission to enter the town via a different road.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, communications adviser to Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, contended that the closure of
Bethlehem is "not a sanction" and was based solely on the
recommendations of security officials.
</P>
<P>
He also termed Palestinian claims that Israel planned to send
troops into the autonomous areas as baseless "disinformation."
He said the claims are "obviously designed to divert attention
from the fact that the PNA has decided on a confrontation with
Israel, rather than a confrontation with the terrorist groups."
</P>
<P>
Bar-Illan added that Israel "reserves the right to apprehend
terrorists in areas controlled by regimes which do not act
against terrorism."

<HEADLINE> Qiao Shi Meets With German Federal Assembly Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee,
meeting today with Antje Vollmer, vice-president of the German
Federal Assembly, said that China is pleased with the good
momentum in Sino-German relations.
</P>
<P>
Qiao described current Sino-German ties as "very good" and said
that frequent contacts between the two countries' leaders have
enhanced bilateral cooperative relations.
</P>
<P>
Sino-German links in the economy, culture, science, technology,
and education have been very "active" and have scored steady
growth, he said, pointing out that this year is the 25th
anniversary of the establishment of Sino-German diplomatic
relations.
</P>
<P>
The history of bilateral ties over the past 25 years has proven
that the principle of mutual respect, seeking common ground while
reserving difference, none-interference in each other's internal
affairs, equality and mutual benefit should always be observed in
dealing with state-to-state relations, Qiao noted.
</P>
<P>
China holds that it is understandable that there are different
views on some issues between states because of different
societies, economies, histories, culture, and traditions, Qiao
said, but that these differences should be settled through dialogue
on an equal footing and the promotion of mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the various parties in the German
Federal Assembly will view Sino-German ties from a strategic
point of view and work together to establish a long-term, stable
Sino-German relationship for the next century.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the German visitors will be
able to see more places in China and exchange more views with the
Chinese to gain a better understanding of China.
</P>
<P>
Vollmer told Qiao she has witnessed great changes in China over
the past 10 years and that co-operative relations are growing
rapidly. She added that the German Federal Assembly hopes to
increase its contacts with the NPC to make contributions to the
friendly ties between the two countries and two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Vollmer emphasized that dialogue and co-operation between the
parliaments of the two countries are in the interests of the two
peoples. No matter which party comes to power in Germany, the
policy of developing friendship and co-operation with China will
remain unchanged, she said.
</P>
<P>
Vollmer and her party are here as guests of the NPC Standing
Committee. They will travel on to Xi'an, Chengdu and Tibet.

<HEADLINE> Honduras Insist on Hosting Central American Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Sports officials of Honduras
reiterated on Sunday that the sixth Central American Games will go
ahead under the schedule from December 5 to 14 in San Pedro Sula,
a major industrial city in north Honduras.
</P>
<P>
The Organizing Committee categorically denied the rumors that
the games will either be cancelled or shifted to another city.
</P>
<P>
"Some of our old rivals are conspiring to oppose Honduras'
organizing of the Central American sports event," the committee
said.
</P>
<P>
Melesio Rivera of Salvador, president of the Central American
Sports Organization (CASO), expressed concerns on the slow pace of
the construction work after CASO representatives inspected the
sports facilities there last week.
</P>
<P>
He accused Honduras of concealing problems for a long time and
failing to fulfil the 6.3 million U.S. dollars budget promised by
the government.
</P>
<P>
Rivera said he will meet with Honduras president Carlos Roberto
Reina to discuss whether Honduras will continue to play hosts to
the event.
</P>
<P>
Honduras organizers rejected such criticism, insisting that all
the sports facilities will be completed before the opening of the
Games at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala has reportedly expressed its willingness to host the
games in case the CASO gives up Honduras.

<P>
LUSAKA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- All Zambia's health boards have
been asked to account for the equipment the government has
provided for the control of cholera epidemics, local paper "Times
of Zambia" reported today.
</P>
<P>
At a one-day symposium held at the weekend in Ndola, northern
Zambia, on epidemic diarrhoea, cholera and dysentery, Zambian
Deputy Health Minister Nkandu Luo said that each year the
government buys new beds, gum boots, gloves, mouth covers and
dust coats without knowing where the items used during the
previous epidemic have been taken to.
</P>
<P>
The government will not buy any more equipment should there
be an outbreak of cholera this year, the minister warned.
</P>
<P>
She complained that once the epidemic is controlled, the
equipment disappears immediately. "Do these things have legs or
wings for them to go missing?" she asked.
</P>
<P>
"Should the disease break out this year, just know that the
materials that we have been purchasing in the last years would
have to be recovered and given to the workers by you so that they
can fight cholera," Luo said.

<P>
JERUSALEM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Israel has
risen to a three-year high of 7.6 percent in the second quarter
this year, according to a report published today by the Central
Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The number of jobless has risen by 29,000 to 168,000 on a
weekly average, thus lifting by 1.2 percentage points the rate
of jobless from 6.4 percent of the workforce a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
In all, the civilian workforce has totaled a weekly average of
2.197 million people, an increase of 2 percent over last year. Of
those, 61.1 percent are males aged 15 and older.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bank of Israel is expected to announce today
its decision concerning next month's short-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Governor Jocob Frenkel has recently said the unemployment
situation would play a role in the decision-making process.
Analysts expect the decision to be dominated by last two month's
relatively high inflation increases, 1.1 percent in June and 1
percent in July.
</P>
<P>
The bank's main concern is to stem the pace of price
acceleration, which currently stands at roughly 10.4 percent,
while the government's official annual target was set at 7 to 10
percent.

<HEADLINE> Belgium to Resume Air Show After Probe Into Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Belgium is to resume aerobatics
flights early next month after probes into a recent crash in an
air show in Ostend found that the responsibility rested with the
pilot.
</P>
<P>
An airshow will be held at Florenne on September 6 and 7, but
organizers have to hand in a full report about safety and security
of the show to the Belgian defense ministry beforehand.
</P>
<P>
Results of a preliminary investigation into the July 26 crash
at the northern seaside resort Ostend attributed the lethal
accident to errors committed by the Jordanian pilot, whose
maneuvers had violated safety requirements.
</P>
<P>
The German-made Falcon XT300 biplane of the Jordanian Royal
Falcon Squadron spun out of control while doing a dive and crashed
into a first-aid tent nearby, killing 10 people and injuring 55.
</P>
<P>
After analyzing video recordings of the flight, aviation
experts and designers and manufacturers of the acrobatics-oriented
plane concluded that the pilot, Captain Amr Hani Bilal, could not
pull up his plane under the great velocity after a series of loops
took him to only 10 to 15 meters above ground.
</P>
<P>
At one time during the show, the plane was flying overhead the
spectators, which was not allowed by air show regulations.
</P>
<P>
Belgian authorities had called off all air shows since the
accident, the first in Ostend where air shows had been popular and
attracted many tourists, saying they will not be resumed until
conclusive results of the investigation come out.

SANTIAGO, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Renowned British astrophysicist
Stephen Hawking today wound up his 11-day trip to Chile, which has
sparked a new wave of enthusiasm for scientific research in the
country's academic circle.
</P>
<P>
At a forum on black holes and the structure of the universe,
sponsored by the Santiago scientific research center, the
wheelchair-bound professor at Cambridge University gave a lecture
on the theory of black holes and universe, which secured him a
leading position in the field more than two decades ago.

Chilean President Eduardo Frei and several ministers were among
the 4,000 audience to the lecture, given through a speech
synthesizer which Hawking controlled by tapping two fingers of his
right hand on his wheelchair-based computer.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Hawking, 55, also flew to the Antarctic by a
cargo plane of the Chile's air force.
</P>

<HEADLINE> NPC Examines Border Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The State Council today
submitted a border security agreement signed by China and four of
the Commonwealth of Independent States to the Standing Committee
of the Eighth National People's Congress for approval.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on mutual reduction of military forces in border
areas between China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and
Tajikistan was signed by President Jiang Zemin and the heads of
state of the four countries during Jiang's visit to Moscow
four months ago.
</P>
<P>
A State Council motion signed by Premier Li Peng said the
accord is "fair, reasonable, and conforms to China's interests"
and that it "contributes to the maintenance of peace and stability
in border areas of China and the four CIS countries and further
promotes good-neighbor relations. It is also significant to the
maintenance of peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region and
the world as a whole."
</P>
<P>
The accord's aim is the reduction of military forces along the
Chinese border with the CIS to a defence level. In accordance with
the agreement, neither side will use force or use force as
threat or seek a unilateral military advantage.
</P>
<P>
The 16-article accord sets a limit on the maximum troop
strength in border areas and the amount of weapons, equipment, and
military technology. It also sets the time limit and methods for
force reductions and information exchanges on the military
deployment in border areas.
</P>
<P>
The accord will be effective until December 31, 2020, and can be
extended with mutual consent.
</P>
<P>
In related developments, the NPC Standing Committee will
examine an agreement on judicial assistance signed by China and
Tajikistan.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Visits Egypt Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat will arrive in Egypt today to hold
talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the deadlocked
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Cairo press quoted Arafat's advisor Nabil Abu Rodena as saying
that the two leaders' talks in Egypt's Mediterranean port city of
Alexandria will focus on the Israeli blockade imposed on
Palestinian lands and the efforts to salvage the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will convey to Mubarak appreciation and gratitude of the
Palestinian leadership and people for Egypt's supportive stances
to the Palestinians, Rodena added.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak issued a decree last week to transfer 10 million
U.S. dollars in aid to the PNA to relieve the Palestinians'
sufferings inflicted by the month-long Israeli sanctions. The
Israeli punitive clampdown following the July 30 Jerusalem suicide
bombings has deprived tens of thousands of Palestinians of work or
salary.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Ambassador here Zohdi el-Qadra was quoted by Cairo
press as saying that Arafat's visit comes within the framework of
constant coordination and consultation between the two leaders
with the aim of pushing forward the deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
They will discuss the "arbitrary Israeli policies" as the root
cause for the stagnation in the peace process and the risks this
now poses to the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Arafat reviewed the peace impasse and
Israeli sanctions with Egyptian Ambassador to the PNA, Mahmud
Karim.
</P>
<P>
Winding up his visit here Sunday, Chairman of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization Political Department Farouk Qaddomi said
he discussed with Mubarak's Political Advisor Osama el-Baz efforts
exerted for reviving the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He also regretted the repeated postponement of U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright's visit to the region, saying that
this demonstrates the "failure of promoting the Mideast peace
process."
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Taibi, advisor to Arafat told local newspaper Al Ahram
over the telephone that Albright's Mideast tour is necessary at
the present stage, as stability in the region is not only in the
interest of the region but also of the U.S..
</P>
<P>
He said that U.S. role in the peace process should be more
effective, influential and fair as regards implementing the
signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Describing Egypt's political, and national role as "honorable"
and referring to the 10-million-dollar aid, he disclosed that some
Arab countries did not agree under the present circumstances on
offering the PNA either long term loans or aid to surmount the
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's security men have been meeting Israeli and
U.S. security officials under a framework set up earlier this
month by U.S. envoy Dennis Ross during his shuttle diplomacy here.
</P>
<P>
Albright has said her prospective trip to region depends on
progress on security. Her mission will be to salvage peace talks
battered by Israel's settlement expansion and last month's suicide
bombing attack.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Banks Benefit From China's Opening Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Statistics show that overseas
banks in China made 183 million US dollars in post-tax profits
last year, up 31 percent from 1995,
</P>
<P>
This indicates that overseas banks have benefited from China's
financial open policy.
</P>
<P>
Most overseas banks are showing a profit after two years of
operation. Overseas banks had opened 540 representatives and 162
agencies in China by the end of July, according to official
figures.
</P>
<P>
Overseas banks in China had combined assets worth more than
32.9 billion US dollars at the end of July, up from 29.9 billion
US dollars at the end of last year. Their loans and deposits stand
at 23.08 billion US dollars and 3.99 billion US dollars,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Overseas banks account for 3.1 percent of the total assets and
14.2 percent of the total foreign-exchange assets of all Chinese
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The top three banks in amount of loans are Japanese, Hong Kong
and French. The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, the Hong Kong and
Shanghai Banking Corp., and Sanwa Bank have the largest amount of
outstanding loans.
</P>
<P>
Official figures also show that overseas insurance companies in
China had more than 1.32 billion US dollars in total assets at the
end of 1996, with premiums of 575 million yuan (about 69 million
US dollars), or 0.74 percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
China first allowed an overseas financial institution to set up
an operational agency in 1982. Today, 23 Chinese cities and the
island province of Hainan, which is also a special economic zone,
have permitted overseas financial institutions to set up
agencies.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Tackle Abuse of Filipino Domestic Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
committed itself to improving the situation of Filipino domestic
helpers working in Britain, a press release by the British Embassy
in Manila said today.
</P>
<P>
The release quoted British Immigration Minister Mike O'Brien as
saying that there have been cases of abuse of domestic helpers,
many of whom are Filipino, in Britain.
</P>
<P>
"Many of them are content but some of them have been subjected
to ill treatment. The British government intends to act to tackle
this situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The issue is likely to be discussed when British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook comes to Manila Friday to hold talks with his
counterpart, Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
The release added that the British government was considering a
number of solutions, including allowing foreign domestic workers
to change their employers and allowing them to have easy access to
an airline ticket home together with a sum of money provided by
the employers.
</P>
<P>
London is also examining ways of improving the conditions under
which the workers are employed, possibly by having a set of
minimum conditions, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Cook will be in Manila from Friday to Sunday. During his first
visit to the Philippines, he will hold talks with President Fidel
Ramos and Defense Secretary Renato de Villa in addition to Siazon.

<HEADLINE> Less Foreign Tourists Visit Israel in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Occupancy by foreign tourists
in Israeli hotels dropped by 10 percent in the first seven months
of 1997 compared with the same period of last year, the state-run
Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to figures published by Israeli Central Bureau of
Statistics (CBS), there had appeared a modest monthly upswing of
1.5 percent in hotel stays by foreign tourists, but this was
before the Jerusalem market bombing on July 30 in which 16 people
were killed and 170 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Avi Rosental, director of the Hotel Association, said that he
hoped that the bombing and the recent hostilities near the
northern border would not cause incoming tourism to drop.
</P>
<P>
However, he was not optimistic, saying that "there are already
signs of a drop in tourism."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both the CBS and the Hotel Association noted that
as the number of foreign tourists staying in Israeli hotels has
gone down, the number of Israelis staying in local hostelries has
increased.
</P>
<P>
There were 10 percent more Israeli bed-nights during the first
seven months of 1997 than a year ago, bringing the total number of
bed-nights by locals and foreigners to 9.2 million.
</P>
<P>
Yet the number was still one percent lower than last year's
figure.

DAR ES SALAAM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanians should not
regard poverty as part of their life and culture and should avoid
the notion that poverty must be with them for the rest of their
life, Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye has said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while launching a book on poverty
reduction in Dodoma last weekend, according to a news dispatch
received here today.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said, "each of us must refuse to harbor poverty and
start pursuing riches through hark work."
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is endowed with immense natural resources and it is
the responsibility of all Tanzanians to tap them to improve their
socio-economic status, said Sumaye.
</P>
<P>
He added that every able-bodied citizen has a chance of
becoming rich, provided they participate in gainful economic
activities instead of remaining mere spectators of development.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister noted that the country's sustainable
economic development relies squarely on Tanzanians and not
foreigners, therefore, it is necessary to educate Tanzanians to
stop thinking that only foreigners can become rich in the
country.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian
government and the guerrilla group "Colombian Revolutionary Armed
Forces" have begun a new round of dialogues in Mexico to prepare
for the upcoming peace negotiations, said Colombian Defense
Minister Gilberto Echeverry today.
</P>
<P>
Echeverry said the talks between government representatives and
guerrillas were just a beginning of a series of dialogues, which
aimed to make a time schedule for the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Colombian President Ernesto Samper Pizano
announced that his administration will open another non-military
zone to promote peace with the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The "Colombian Revolutionary Forces" has expressed willingness
for peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
Late last May, the Colombian government and the "Colombian
Revolutionary Forces" agreed to set up a non-military zone in the
southern part of the country, which resulted in the release of
dozens of government soldiers.
</P>
<P>
At the time, it was believed that the peace negotiations
between the government and the guerrillas could proceed with the
release. But it did not as expected.

STOCKHOLM, August 25 (Xinhua) - A bomb exploded in a western
city of Gothenburg early on Monday, putting Sweden in danger in
its bidding to host the 2004 Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> Consortia Win Three Gorges Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six other generators, worth 320 million U.S. dollars, will be
supplied by another consortium consisting of Voith Hydro GmbH, GE
Hydro and GE International Inc, and Siemens AG (VGS), according to
the company in charge of the project.
</P>
<P>
The two were chosen out of six manufacturers from nine
countries competing in international bidding, handled by the China
Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
China's Harbin Electric Machine Co Ltd and Norway's Kvaerner
ASA will be major subcontractors for the eight generators awarded
to the Anglo-French consortium, while Dongfang Electric Machine Co
Ltd will be the major subcontractor for the six other units
awarded to VGS. The latter account for 31 percent of the total
contract volume.
</P>
<P>
The consortia have provided export credits and 15- to 20-year
commercial loans and will supply technology transfers. The 14
generators and turbines will have a capacity of 700 megawatts each.
</P>
<P>
The generators will go on line between 2003 to 2006, and the
project will need another 12 generators and turbines, which would
be built in China.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges project -- the world's biggest of the kind --
is expected to cost about 30 billion U.S. dollars by its
completion in 2009.
</P>
<P>
It is intended to tame the Yangtze river, stopping seasonal
flooding by creating a huge reservoir in central Hubei province as
a catch basin. The 6,000-km (3,500-mile) river, China's longest,
and its tributaries have caused disastrous floods for centuries.
</P>
<P>
The project is forcing the relocation of an estimated 1.3
million people to make way for the reservoir and will submerge
22,000 hectares (54,000 acres) of farmland and 7,000 hectares
(17,000 acres) of forests.

<HEADLINE> Successful Housing Reform in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The collection of public funds
for home building, the selling of public housing and higher rents
in Beijing have fueled the reform of the local housing allocation
system, and together are expected to greatly ease the housing
shortage in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The city launched the reform five years ago and had raised more
than 2.3 billion yuan of public funds for housing construction by
June, 650 million yuan more than the sum gathered by the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
All governmental departments and non-profit institutions in
local urban areas and the majority of those in the suburbs have
begun collecting funds from their employees to support local
housing construction.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 2.2 million workers in the city have made
contributions.
</P>
<P>
The municipal department which manages the funds has committed
3.7 billion yuan-worth of loans to 60 home-building projects.
</P>
<P>
The city has now sold 24 million sq m of public housing,
one-fifth of the local total up for sale.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the reform of the housing system, rent per sq m of
public housing has now climbed to 1.3 yuan from 0.11 yuan five
years ago, helping the city add nearly 450 million yuan in annual
rent payment.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the city has added an average of more than six
million sq m of new public housing annually and hit a record eight
million sq m in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The city will place emphasis on the introduction of the public
funds collecting system in local overseas-funded businesses, some
big state enterprises, and businesses on the outskirts of the
city.

<HEADLINE> Labor Contract System For Private Sector In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guangzhou, August 25 (Xinhua) -- After the success of a labor
contract system in state and collectively-run enterprises and
joint ventures in Guangdong province, the system will be tried in
township businesses and in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The provincial labor department needs workers for township
enterprises, private firms, and household businesses, and is
getting them to sign contracts with their employers. The number of
contract workers in these businesses should be about 80 percent by
next June.
</P>
<P>
China's labor reforms are meant to end the guaranteed
employment system, but to protect the interest of both employers
and employees, it developed the labor contract system in the early
1990s. At present, 99 percent of workers in state and
collective-run enterprises and Sino-foreign ventures in Guangdong
work under a contract.
</P>
<P>
And the practice is spreading to township enterprises and the
private sector. By the end of June, 745,000 people working in
private firms, or 46 percent of the total, had contracts.
</P>
<P>
The figure is higher in the Pearl River Delta, where township
enterprises and private business dominate the local
economy.

</P>
<P>
Four victims were from Bara district of central Nepal, while
the rest came from Sarlahi district, about 60 kilometers east of
Bara.

quoted hospital sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
A total of 31 patients are still taking medicine as the disease
is spreading to other villages in Sarlahi district.
</P>
<P>
Due to lack of equipment and medicine, the patients have to be
sent outside for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Villagers said mosquitoes had been spreading because
anti-mosquito insecticides had not been sprayed from time to time,
leading to the outbreak of kalaazar.

<HEADLINE> Denmark-based Sabroe Plans to Help Indian Sick Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Denmark-based Sabroe
Refrigeration (Sabroe) has put in an investment proposal with
India's Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) to pick up 90
percent stake in Air Control Chemical Engineering LTD (ACCEL), a
sick company in the country, a government official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Sabroe will be picking up equity in ACCEL, through Best and
Crompton Engineering ltd., which holds 78.9 percent equity in
ACCEL. As a world leader in industrial refrigeration technology,
Sabroe plans to manufacture industrial refrigeration systems
including compressors in India.
</P>
<P>
Sabroe has offered to inject an equity of 115.2 million rupees
(3.25 million US dollars) of ACCEL, which has already accepted the
conditions stipulated by the Danish company in the existing
revival plan.
</P>
<P>
Sabroe will use ozone-friendly refrigerant R22 and ammonia. The
major advantage with ammonia is that it is produced in large
quantities and is available cheaply all over the world.
</P>
<P>
In India, the industrial refrigeration market still uses chloro
flouro carbon (CFC) and hydro chloro flouro carbon (HCFC)
extensively. Imports for these products are a drain on the foreign
exchequer.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the new non-CFC varieties of refrigerants are produced
under patent and prove to be expensive even in the United States
and Europe.

<HEADLINE> ADB to Study Ganges Barrage Feasibility in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
will send a mission to Bangladesh soon to study the feasibility of
a barrage over the Ganges, a project crucial for about 40 million
people facing the hazards of desertification, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The ADB, one of the major donors to this undeveloped South
Asian country, is also expected to provide some 400 million U.S.
dollars in assistance to Bangladesh for its various development
projects during the current 197-98 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
During the official talks between the ADB and Dhaka, ADB
President Mitsuo Sato, who arrived here last Saturday, agreed to
send the expert team for the Ganges barrage study from the bank's
Manila headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"We had a very satisfactory discussion," Finance Minister Shah
AMS Kibria, who led the Bangladeshi government delegation, was
quoted by the local newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said they had detailed discussions on poverty
alleviation, the government's commitment to education and
eradication of illiteracy, rural infrastructure development and
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kibria also said the ADB chief expressed his satisfaction over
the overall success of the Bangladesh economy, particularly the
economic stability, low level of inflation and economic growth
rate.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka is planning to build a barrage over the river Ganges for
the maximum use of the water of the common river flowing through
India and Bangladesh, following last year's long-term
water-sharing treaty with India.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of water of Ganges at Farakka barrage in India's
side has adversely affected the 40 million people and the ecology
in the northern and southeastern parts of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
It was informed that the arsenic problem in the regions
appeared to be a result of massive lifting of ground water. It
could be minimized by using surface water for which the barrage is
needed.
</P>
<P>
The ADB chief has assured Dhaka that they were ready to send a
mission for the feasibility study of the project, which will take
three to four years, costing 16-20 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Share-Holding System Enlivens Romanian Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 1,100 state-owned
enterprises in Romania adopted the share-holding system this year
in a bid to improve performance, said a Romanian news agency
report.
</P>
<P>
The listed enterprises, of which 85 percent are small ones and
the rest are of medium or large size, have generally improved
their economic performance, with profits going above the national
average level, the news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Romanian economists have viewed the share-holding system as an
important way for enterprises to get rid of their economic
difficulties. The government has also seen it as a key step in the
economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea announced in February that 3,600
state-run enterprises will adopt the share-holding system by the
end of this year, with small-sized firms being the focus of the
reform.
</P>
<P>
The general practice is that enterprises issue stocks in the
stock market or sell stocks directly to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian government welcomes foreign investors' entry into
the stock market, encouraging them to buy more than 50 percent of
the shares of a company.
</P>
<P>
A newly enacted foreign investment law grants foreigners
investing in the stock market more preferential treatment than
direct foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The government has recently closed 16 large factories with poor
performance and serious losses, and decided to find new owners for
them by auction.
</P>
<P>
Romania started to initiate the new economic system in 1992.
The normal practice at that time was that companies distributed 30
percent of the capital to employees in the form of securities and
sold the remaining 70 percent in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian government plans to apply the new system to all
enterprises in the country by the year of 2000.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar's Mining Industry Makes Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government has
invited foreign investments in recent years to develop the
nation's mining industry in a bid to fulfill local requirements
and increase exports.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is rich in mineral resources, such as gold, copper and
precious stones.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar mining authorities sponsored two rounds of
competitive bidding in 1994 and 1996, inviting foreign
entrepreneurs to conduct prospecting, exploration and feasibility
study of metallic minerals, especially gold and copper.
</P>
<P>
On the two occasions, a total of 23 block areas, each having
1,400 square kilometers, were granted to 11 foreign firms for
operation.
</P>
<P>
Invitation for the third round of bidding was announced in July
with designation of 12 more new blocks for foreign entrepreneurs
to operate.
</P>
<P>
A dozen joint ventures between Myanmar state mining enterprises
and foreign firms have been set up so far to undertake exploration
and production of metals, pearl and finished gemstone in Shan and
Kachin states and Mandalay division.
</P>
<P>
These foreign companies mostly come from Australia, Canada,
Japan, Singapore, Thailand and the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official statistics, foreign investment
in the mining sector amounted to 498 million U.S. dollars in 42
permitted projects at the end of July this year, standing fifth
sectorally after oil and gas, manufacturing, real estate and
hotels and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local private entrepreneurs were also encouraged to
engage in small-scale production, some also operating on a joint
venture basis with the state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60 Work blocks were allotted with local individuals,
firms and cooperative societies, covering areas such as
Thabeikkyin, Kalaw, Kyaikto, Muse, Kutkai, Shwekyin and Kanbauk,
and those along the Ayeyawaddy, Malikha and Maykha rivers.
</P>
<P>
Dealing with gems and jade mining, local entrepreneurs are
allowed for operation, transport and sale of their finished
gemstone and manufactured jewelry at home or abroad, according to
the new Myanmar Gemstone Law promulgated in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is also striving to increase its foreign exchange
earning by holding gems emporiums annually and a total of 250
million dollars have been realized through 34 emporiums and five
mid-year ones since 1964, drawing several hundred customers on
each occasion from over a dozen countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Mogok and Mogaung, three more new gems lands --
Namsa, Mongshu and Nawarat (Pyinlon) -- have also been discovered
in Myanmar since 1988.
</P>
<P>
According to the official statistics, Myanmar's gross domestic
product of mines increased 9.5 percent in the 1996-97 fiscal year
ending March over the previous year, and the export of minerals
and non-metallic products amounted to 195 million kyats (32.5
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The country's major export items consist of copper and tin
concentrates, and gems.

<HEADLINE> Thai Banks Predicted to See Growth Slide This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Thai commercial banks are likely
to record a negative growth of 15 to 20 percent this year as the
country's investment and consumption are tightening due to the
economic slowdown, a leading local research center said.
</P>
<P>
The 15 commercial banks in Thailand is likely to have a total
net profit between 1.11 and 1.48 billion baht based on the last
year's figure of 7.4 billion baht (246.7 million U.S. dollars)
provided by the Thai Farmers Research center.
</P>
<P>
The government's tight-belt policy enforced under its
commitment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and declining
levels of investment by the private sector due to the economic
slowdown, will put the banks under strong pressure in managing
their businesses.
</P>
<P>
Non-performing loans and the declining demand for bank services
are the two key factors that will negatively affect the banks'
performance this years, according to Pisarn Manoleehagul, head of
the research center.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers today said that due to capital outflow and the
baht fluctuation after the baht float, interest rates offered by
local commercial banks currently remains as high as 10 to 20
percent and their operating costs are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
The increase of value-added tax also hurt purchasing power in
the country and consumption lending, such as credit cards and
housing loans which represented nearly 13 percent of the total
lending last year, will significantly drop, the newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
As the manufacturing sector will slow down new investment,
bank's lending growth in the industrial sector, which represented
25.8 percent of the total lending last year, will also fall.
</P>
<P>
Banks' lending in other sectors, like real estate,
construction, and services, will drop as well.

<HEADLINE> Floods Suspend Transport Links to Southern Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 25 (Xinhua) -- All train and bus services to
destinations in southern Thailand's provinces beyond Chumphon
province were suspended Sunday as flash floods cut road and rail
links.
</P>
<P>
Both the State Railway of Thailand (SRT) and the transport
company offered refunds to passengers who could not make the
trips. They were instructed to check with the two agencies on a
daily basis to find out when services will resume.
</P>
<P>
SRT officials were quoted today by local press as saying that
ten train service routes to the south have been suspended.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at the transport company's southern region bus
division was quoted as saying that scores of travelers had phoned
to the office Sunday to ask if there were any bus services to the
southern routes. Many were disappointed to know that roads there
were impossible.
</P>
<P>
The flash floods reportedly resulted from a tropical storm
centered in Vietnam, which has brought heavy rains to southern and
northern regions of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The hardest-hit province was Chumphon, where over 5,000
families have been affected by floods.
</P>
<P>
According to the Meteorological Department, the tropical storm
in Vietnam has weakened and the depression is moving towards Laos,
with winds of 55 km at its center. The depression could still
bring heavy rain, resulting in flash floods and overflows on the
river banks in southern and northern provinces of Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Close Less Active Overseas Trade Offices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Commerce Ministry is
planning to close down its less active trade offices overseas due
to its budget problem, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The plan will be implemented in early October after the
government releases its budget-cut policy.
</P>
<P>
Those offices targeted include commercial affairs offices and
Thai trade centers, and at least three offices in Africa -- Kenya,
Ivory Coast and Senegal -- are likely to face shutdown this year.
</P>
<P>
Thai Commerce Ministry officials said that the ministry has to
invest no less than 333,000 U.S. dollars in each office or center.
If the export value does not merit further operations, the offices
will be closed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry is also planning to open new offices in
those countries to which Thai exports sees sharp increases, such
as Peru, as part of its efforts to restructure the operations of
the country's overseas trade offices.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring will concentrate on regional trade rather
than individual countries, including combining commercial affairs
offices and Thai trade centers into those outstanding offices in
some countries to oversee regional trade affairs.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's commercial affairs offices are responsible for
support trade and the Thai trade centers mainly handle export
promotions. The two agencies usually operate separately with less
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Under the restructuring plan, the ministry considers Asia,
especially neighboring countries, as an important focus for trade
promotion, believing Thailand is a gateway for trade to the
region.

MANILA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- An International Monetary Fund

Philippines' economic and financial performance for the first
semester of the year and the impact of the peso's devaluation on
the economy.
</P>

Informed sources disclosed that the review would center on

liquidity tightening measures recently taken by the Philippine
Central Bank to prevent the peso from devaluating further.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Philippine monetary authorities would discuss
with the IMF team the proposed adjustments in base money limits as
a result of the changes in banks' reserve requirements announced
by the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
An indicator used by the IMF in determining whether the
prevailing liquidity in the financial system could lead to higher
prices of basic commodities, the base money limits comprise
currency issues, reserve balances of banks and reserve eligible
for government securities.
</P>
<P>
The IMF review assumes extra significance in the face of the
peso's devaluation, which would inevitably affect the performance
of the economy in the next five months as well as in the year to
come.
</P>
<P>
On the monetary sector, the government panel would also discuss
with the IMF team the changes in interest rates, reserve
requirements, open market operations, off-balance sheet activities
and banking sector development.
</P>
<P>
They would also discuss the projections of the balance of
payments, specifically the impact of the peso devaluation on the
trade balance, transfers and on the debt structure and debt
service projections for 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
The monetary and financial targets discussed by the government
and the IMF team are crucial for the Philippines' exit from
conditional financing programs of the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines and the IMF have agreed to postpone the
country's graduation until the end of the year due to the delay in
the passage of the comprehensive tax reform, the structural reform
considered a pre-requisite to exiting.
</P>
<P>
After the peso was drawn into the financial turmoil sweeping
the whole region, the IMF provided one billion U.S. dollars to
shore up the country's economy.

<HEADLINE> First Chinese Director for Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Nuclear safety expert Pu Jilong
was appointed to a position as director of the Daya Bay Nuclear
Power Plant in south China's Guangdong Province on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Pu became the first Chinese operations director at the
jointly-funded nuclear power plant, replacing French station
manager Pierre Decaix who recently completed his three year
contract.
</P>
<P>
Liu Damin, another Chinese nuclear specialist, was appointed as
deputy director at the nuclear power plant. The assignments prove
that China has made progress in localizing the management of its
nuclear power industry.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment in 1985, the Guangdong Nuclear Power
Joint Operations Co. Ltd., which is responsible for operating Daya
Bay, has always attached great importance to training professional
nuclear power workers.
</P>
<P>
The number of qualified Chinese nuclear power workers has grown
rapidly, with highly talented people serving as key force in
operations at Daya Bay since the plant commenced commercial
operations in the early 1990s. The plant has reduced its foreign
work force from 60 to 14.
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong Nuclear Power Joint Operations Co. Ltd. has
listed 1997 as a "year of training" and formed a group which has
drafted plans to implement on-the-job training for workers at the
nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
Despite reducing the number of foreign personnel working as
consultants, the plant will continue to maintain close contacts
with foreign nuclear power companies, and will continue to study
advanced management expertise and technology used by the
international nuclear power community.

<HEADLINE> Shengli Oilfield Strives to Improve Efficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Shengli Oilfield in east
China's Shandong Province plans to increase investment in the
construction of more petrochemical and fine chemical projects in
order to improve the technological contents and lift the added
value of oil and gas commodities.
</P>
<P>
Shengli has grown into China's second largest oilfield since
producing its first barrel of oil in 1964. The field had produced
620 million tons of crude oil and 30 billion cu.m. of gas by the
end of June this year.
</P>
<P>
Wide application of advanced technology has enabled Shengli to
achieve a stable oil output for both onshore and offshore oil
wells over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
It has also fabricated China's most advanced movable offshore
oil-drilling platforms and has laid three undersea oil
pipelines. The oilfield has now constructed a group of seven
offshore well drilling platforms, 18 oil drilling platforms and
more than 30 ships and tankers. Shengli produced 1.5 million tons
of offshore oil and gas in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In addition to establishing cooperative ties with dozens of
domestic oil fields, Shengli has prepared 16 tracts of land with
oil reserves for cooperation with oil companies from countries
including Canada, Peru and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, more than 1,000 petroleum experts have visited
the Yellow River Delta, the home of Shengli, in hopes of
attracting investment and cooperation opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Officials in charge of the oilfield expressed hope in gaining a
greater share on the international market by the turn of this
century, and increasing annual sales of oil products to between
3-5 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Inmates Doing Fine In Chinese Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A British man (the name is not
disclosed) in his forties who was sentenced to a term to serve in
Chinese prison for drug-related crimes has spent most of his time
making picture posters against drugs.
</P>
<P>
He was given a 15-year sentence in a prison in Qingpu county in
Shanghai, in August 1991, and is one of the twelve foreign
prisoners there.
</P>
<P>
His works were displayed at this year's International Drug
Abuse and Trafficking Day and this was reported by the British
media. He's now preparing for a second exhibition to be held next
year by the prison. He also likes to write for the prison's radio
station and newspaper, the Hope Guide, and prepares humorous stage
pieces to perform at parties with other inmates.
</P>
<P>
His day behind bars begins at six o'clock when he is woken up
by an electronic bell. Prisoners have thirty minutes to wash
themselves and make their beds. From 6:30 to 7:00, he usually does
some exercise with a set of dumbbells he made himself.
</P>
<P>
He is also in charge of checking up after the foreigners have
finished cleaning their living space, and records it every
day. They can watch English programs on TV during free time at
noon and in the evening, and the prison has two English-language
papers for them, China Daily and Shanghai Star. They can also
receive newspapers from their countries' consulates, if the papers
pass the prison security check. Lights-out is at nine o'clock
after roll call.
</P>
<P>
The foreign prisoners say they're satisfied with the food,
which is planned by a nutritionist. The amount of money spent on
foreign prisoners' food is 20 percent more than that for Chinese
prisoners. The prison prepares special food for vegetarians and
Moslems out of respect for their customs and religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
They are also given special food on traditional Chinese
festivals, like mooncakes for the Mid-autumn Festival, and on
Christmas and their birthdays they can have cakes.
</P>
<P>
Foreign prisoners have more time for themselves each week than
do Chinese inmates, except for two days of physical labor and
another day for studying the Criminal Law and Prison Law.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign prisoners are interested in learning Chinese, and
the prison authority provides them with tapes and books for
study. Writing brushes and inkstones can also be provided for
those who want to study calligraphy.
</P>
<P>
They can write two letters each month and can send as many
greeting cards to relatives and friends at Christmas as they like.
</P>
<P>
In his most recent letter to his son, the Enlishman says he
fully understands the harmfulness of drugs, and hopes his son
doesn't follow in his footsteps.

<HEADLINE> Nine More Prisoners Killed in Inmate Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Nine more prisoners were killed
and seven seriously injured Saturday in Jamaican inmate clashes in
the capital of Kingston, pushing the death toll in recent prison
riots to 16, it is reported.
</P>
<P>
Twenty inmates have been injured in clashes since Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The clashes began Wednesday at the General Penitentiary in
Kingston and the St. Catherine District Prison in Spanish Town,
after the country's corrections commissioner said guards and
prisoners should be issued condoms.
</P>
<P>
Remarks of the commissioner, John Prescod, triggered a strike
of the security guards, who said Prescod's proposal implied that
they were having homosexual relations with the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Prisoners took advantage of the strike and began to attack
fellow inmates. Inmates believed to be homosexuals were stabbed
and beaten to death or seriously injured, police said.
</P>
<P>
Prison guards returned to work and restored order with the help
of police and the military Saturday. Prescod had withdrawn his
proposal and said what he meant was only to prevent the spread of
AIDS.

<HEADLINE> De Bruin Upset, Popov Completes Four Crowns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Alexander Popov of Russia
snatched his fourth gold while triple Olympic champion Ireland's
Michelle de Bruin was blocked from a feat of five titles at the
final day of European Swimming Championships in Seville, Spain on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Popov anchored Russia to win the men's 4x100-meters medley
relay, bringing his Seville tally to four gold medals including
50m and 100m freestyle and 4x100m freestyle.
</P>
<P>
His medley relays' title put his European championship titles
to 15 since his debut at the 1991 championships in Athens.
</P>
<P>
De Bruin, who collected three golds and a bronze at the Atlanta
Olympics under her maiden name of Michelle Smith, was blocked from
achieving her dream of five titles and had to settle with two
golds and two silvers in Seville.
</P>
<P>
Spain's Maria Pelaez stole the women's 200m butterfly crown
from Du Bruin as she colcked two minutes 10.25 seconds for a
margin of 0.53 seconds ahead of the Irish woman.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Italian Brembilla broke the 15-minute barrier
for the first time for his personal best with a championship
record of 14:58.65.
</P>
<P>
Marcel Wouda of the Netherland added a 200m individual medley
crown after he won the 400m on Wednesday with a time of 2:00.77,
edging Xavier Marchand of France to second in 2:01.08 and
defending champion Jani Sievinen of Finland the third in 2:02.12.
</P>
<P>
Natalia Meshcheryakova of Russia claimed the victory in the
women's 50 freestyle in 25.31, 0.12 seconds ahead of German
Olympic bronze medallist Sandra Voelker.
</P>
<P>
Cathleen Rund and Antje Buschschulte gave Germany a one-two
finish in the women's 200 backstroke in 2:11.46 and 2:12.05.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Foreign Debt Reaches 42.6 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' foreign debt
stood at 42.6 billion U.S. dollars at the end of March this year,
up 1.6 percent from the end-1996 level, the Manila Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
But financial analysts said the country's external debt
situation had been further aggravated by the Philippine currency
of peso whose value has plummeted by 14 percent since early July.
</P>
<P>
The debt was borrowed and must be paid in U.S. dollars which
were still strong against the local currency. The exchange rate
between the peso and the dollar once soared to a record high of
30.07 pesos to one dollar last week.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a latest report released by the country's
Central Bank as saying that borrowings by private business
enterprises and financial institutions fueled the continued
expansion in the external debt.
</P>
<P>
The private sector now accounts for 39 percent of the country's
total foreign loans, while the external debt contracted by the
public sector and the Central Bank declined, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper added, the bulk of the foreign debt is long
and mid-term loans and need not to be paid in a short period.

<HEADLINE> More Tourists Visit Croatia in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Tourism has steadily begun to
recover in Croatia, with nearly a quarter increase in overnight
stays in July over the same period last year, according to the
Croatian Tourism Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports quoted officials of the ministry as saying
that there were 7.5 million overnight stays in Croatia during
July, which is about 23 percent more than in July of 1996.
However, the number of overnight stays is still 54 percent of the
pre-war 1990 level.
</P>
<P>
Split is the country with fastest recovery in tourism, as the
number of overnight stays in July is estimated to amount to 80
percent of the pre-war period.
</P>
<P>
Gorgana Borojevic, an assistant minister of the Tourism
Ministry, was quoted as saying that similar developments have been
noticed in August as well and if weather conditions continue to be
favorable, one could expect 9 to 9.5 million overnight stays for
this month.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is one of the mainstay industries of Croatia. The
Croatian government has predicted a 20 percent increase in the
number of overnight stays for the whole year although it means a
recovery only to little above half of the 1990 level.
