<HEADLINE> Reno Rejected by Elian Kin  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX VEIGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno took an
extraordinary step to resolve the Elian Gonzalez case Wednesday but
failed to persuade his relatives to end the wrenching 4{-month
custody struggle.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Reno for 2{ hours, the boy's great-uncle
Lazaro Gonzalez was defiant and said they won't turn over the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The moment has come for the final decision and I want you all
to know and for the whole world to see that they are preparing to
storm a family home,'' Gonzalez said. ''Our position is that we
will not turn the child over. We will not turn the child over at
Opa-locka or any 'locka.'''
</P>
<P>
   Opa-locka was a reference to the government's suggestion that
Elian be handed over at the airport in the city outside Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Reno met with Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's cousin Marisleysis and
other relatives at the Miami Beach home of Sister Jeanne
O'Laughlin, the nun who was host of a January meeting between Elian
and his grandmothers from Cuba. Elian attended the meeting, moving
from lap to lap at the table.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Diaz, an attorney for the family, said Reno and
Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner
heard ample evidence during the meeting that Elian does not want to
go back to Cuba but refused to take that into account.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Meissner called a midnight news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''She wants to do anything possible to resolve this,'' Justice
Department spokesman Myron Marlin said before the meeting. ''She
realizes it's a tall order but believes she may be the one who can
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin said that in the meeting, no deadline was issued and
no letter was delivered detailing handover plans. However, she said
there was talk of a meeting Thursday in Washington involving the
Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was very respectful and they were very honest,''
O'Laughlin said. ''The pain of this family and their understanding
of the pain of Juan Miguel was very evident. They have expressed
over and over again their ... desire to be a loving family, whole
again.''
</P>
<P>
   One option Reno had planned to propose was for Elian and some of
his Miami relatives to come back to Washington, perhaps even on her
plane, to arrange a meeting with the boy's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, and the eventual transfer of custody, according to a
government official, who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Elian left the meeting only when the subject matter with Reno
was too sensitive. ''He was precious with her,'' O'Laughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his relatives had left their politically charged
Little Havana neighborhood for O'Laughlin's gated home earlier in
the day. She said Elian would stay there Wednesday night.

Reno Rejected by Elian Kin

   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno on Wednesday failed to
persuade Elian Gonzalez's relatives to end the wrenching 4{-month custody
struggle surrounding the 6-year-old shipwreck survivor. After meeting with Reno
for 2{ hours, Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez was defiant and said they

S.C. Moves To Remove Flag
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- South Carolina state senators on Wednesday endorsed a
bill to remove the Confederate flag from atop the Statehouse dome. Opponents say
the banner is racist but supporters insist it's a symbol of Southern heritage.
The bill would remove the banner from the dome and place a similar battle flag
behind an existing monument honoring Confederate soldiers on Statehouse grounds.
The flag would fly on the north side of the Statehouse from a pole no taller
than 20 feet. That element was added to satisfy black lawmakers and other flag
opponents who did not want the flag in a prominent position to passers-by.

Jury Rejects Sheppard Son's Claim
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- A jury on Wednesday unanimously rejected the claim of Dr.
Sam Sheppard's son that his father was wrongfully imprisoned for his mother's
1954 slaying, ending another chapter in the sensational case that inspired ''The
Fugitive'' television series. The eight-member jury in Cuyahoga County Common
Pleas Court did not find Dr. Sheppard guilty of murder -- that wasn't the
question before it. Rather, the decision means the couple's son, Sam Reese
Sheppard, failed to meet the burden of proof in his wrongful imprisonment civil
lawsuit against the state of Ohio. To win, Sheppard needed to convince jurors
the majority of evidence showed his father, who died in 1970, was innocent.

   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- An overloaded wooden ferry boat capsized,
killing at least 56 people, officials said Thursday. More than 100 others were
missing and feared dead. Abdu Sakur, the governor of southern Sulu province,
said the ferry Arlahada capsized shortly after leaving the capital of the
province, Jolo, Wednesday night. The ferry was headed for the Philippine
province of Tawi Tawi and then to Saba in Malaysia, he said. Nineteen people
were rescued, he said. There were no immediate reports of whether foreigners
were on board.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Seventeen members of a Senegalese dance troupe walked
off the stage and disappeared in the San Francisco Bay area, forcing organizers
to cancel the remainder of their U.S. tour. By Wednesday, none had filed for
political asylum from Senegal -- which ended 40 years of socialist rule this
month. They were in this country under temporary work permits that allowed them
only to work as dancers for their company.

Unilever Devouring Ben &AMP; Jerry's

   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Ben &AMP; Jerry's, the counterculture-capitalist ice
cream maker, is selling out to the corporate suits. Unilever, the multinational
conglomerate that makes such products as Wisk detergent, Q-tips and Popsicles,
is paying $326 million for the company started by two ex-hippies in an old gas
station in 1978. The Ben &AMP; Jerry's deal announced Wednesday was an outcome
neither Ben Cohen nor Jerry Greenfield favored. But the two founders were under
pressure from shareholders to sell to Unilever, which offered $43.60 per share,
or nearly 25 percent over Ben Jerry's closing price Tuesday of $34.93}.

   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Jalen Rose scored 24 points and Austin Croshere had 15
and led a fourth-quarter comeback as the Indiana Pacers beat the Raptors 77-73
Wednesday night, preventing Toronto from clinching the franchise's first playoff
berth. The victory, combined with Miami's loss to Detroit, gave the Pacers a

<HEADLINE> Jazz 102, Clippers 93  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone's 27 points and seven rebounds
led Utah to a 102-93 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on
Wednesday night, moving the Jazz closer to the Midwest Division
title.
</P>
<P>
   Utah leads defending NBA champion San Antonio by three games in
the standings with four games left for each in the regular season.
Utah plays at San Antonio on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Malone passed 2,000 points for the season, the 12th time in his
14-year career he has reached the milestone -- more than any player
in NBA history. The Mailman received a standing ovation from the
19,911 at the Delta Center when the record was announced late in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers (14-64) were without their top two scorers, guard
Derek Anderson and forward Maurice Taylor, who combine to average
over 33 points. Anderson missed his second game with back spasms,
while Taylor was out with a sore left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Piatkowski's career-high 35 points helped the Clippers stay
close.
</P>
<P>
   Utah completed a four-game season sweep of the Clippers. Los
Angeles also dropped its 18th straight at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz appeared to be in control with a 19-4 run late in the
first quarter, building a 29-18 lead. The advantage never slipped
below eight until the fourth quarter when Los Angeles cut what had
been a 21-point lead to one point. But Malone and John Stockton
returned to the lineup to stifle the visitors' comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers fell apart in the second quarter, shooting 9
percent (2-for-22) from the field. Utah's reserves played virtually
the entire second period and pushed the lead to 50-33 by
intermission.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ten of the 12 players on the Jazz roster scored, including
Olden Polynice with a season-high 13 points. ... Tyrone Nesby
scored 23 points for the Clippers. ... The Jazz now leave on a
three-game road trip before ending the season at home against
Sacramento on April 19. ... The Clippers meet Phoenix in Arizona on
Friday night.

<HEADLINE> 56 Die As Philippine Boat Capsizes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- An overloaded wooden Philippine
ferry boat headed for Malaysia capsized, killing at least 56
people, officials said Thursday. More than 100 others were missing
and feared dead.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen people had been rescued as of Thursday morning, said
Abdusakur Tan, governor of southern Sulu province.
</P>
<P>
   Many passengers were crowded on one side of the boat Arlahada,
causing it to tip and then capsize shortly after leaving Jolo, the
provincial capital, on Wednesday night, Tan said.
</P>
<P>
   The boat was only authorized to carry cargo, not passengers,
said Coast guard district commander Capt. Heliberto Pascual. It had
only nine crew members and 11 cargo agents on board when it
departed Jolo, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ship then picked up scores of passengers at sea from small
boats, he said. They apparently boarded from the same side, causing
the ship to tilt.
</P>
<P>
   Many passengers were trapped inside the ship's cabin after it
capsized, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are still searching for the more than 100 passengers who
are still missing,'' Tan said. ''We don't know if they are alive or
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   About 100 fishermen in the area were helping in the search.
There were no immediate reports of whether foreigners were on
board.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry was headed for the Philippine province of Tawi-Tawi
and then for Saba in Malaysia, he said. Jolo is at the southern tip
of the Philippines and is close to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Ferries are the main form of transportation among the
Philippines' more than 7,000 islands, but overcrowding and
accidents are common. In the world's worst peacetime shipping
disaster, the Dona Paz ferry collided with a tanker on Dec. 20,
1987, killing 4,341.

<HEADLINE> Increase in payments for doctors seeing Medicaid patients favored  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State legislators negotiating the new
2000-01 state budget have reached an agreement to give physicians a
financial incentive to see Medicaid-covered patients.
</P>
<P>
   The current $7-per-visit fee paid to primary care providers
would go up to $30 a visit under a recommendation made Wednesday by
a legislative conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative conference committees are working to conclude
outstanding issues in the budget for the state fiscal year which
began April 1. Legislative leaders say they hope to have their
chambers adopt a new $78 billion spending plan by next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The state Medical Society and other medical groups have long
complained that their members have lost all incentive to see
Medicaid patients because of low reimbursement rates by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being welcome in private doctors' office, many
Medicaid patients have been forced to seek treatment at hospital
emergency rooms or clinics. The health committee chairmen in the
Senate and Assembly, Sen. Kemp Hannon and Assemblyman Richard
Gottfried respectively, said it can cost $100 or more per Medicaid
patient visit to a clinic or emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing reimbursement rates for physicians will not cost the
state any more money because there will be corresponding savings
through fewer Medicaid recipients seeking care at more expensive
medical facilities, Hannon and Gottfried said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislators said they have also agreed to a $2 million
allocation to increase the reimbursement rates for health
specialists treating Medicaid recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Gov. George Pataki and legislative leaders said
they will spend $250 million on new clean-fuel buses and
retrofitting existing diesel buses servicing the New York City
area.
</P>
<P>
   The Clean Fuel Bus program would provide for the purchase of 550
new clean-fuel buses for use by the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority and require all existing diesel buses be converted to
conform with ''clean'' technology.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is part of a revised MTA Capital Plan agreed to
by Pataki, state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno and state
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.
</P>
<P>
   ''This historic plan will ensure that the MTA has the cleanest
bus fleet, not only in the nation, but in the world,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 550 clean-fuel buses that will be purchased, 300 will be
fueled by compressed natural gas (CNG) and 250 will run on
hybrid-electric power. MTA currently owns 350 CNG-fueled and 140
hybrid-electric buses.
</P>
<P>
   Older diesel buses will be retrofitted to include continuously
regenerative traps -- a device that captures and burns pollutants
before emission -- and to use ultra-low sulfur fuel. The plan calls
for the entire MTA bus fleet to be retrofitted within three years.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA currently has 4,300 buses in service.
</P>
<P>
   MTA also promised to phase out its two-stroke diesel buses,
which have higher emissions, by December 31, 2003. It also agreed
to work with the state Department of Environmental Conservation to
develop new emissions performance standards for MTA buses.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other budget matters under discussion Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   --Hannon and Gottfried said they were close to an agreement to
extend the Medicaid managed care program, set to expire in June, to
the end of 2003. Changes will be made to increase participation and
quality of care, the lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   --Whether to include $7.9 million in the budget for AIDS-related
spending through the state's AIDS Institute.
</P>
<P>
   --The governor's proposal to spend $75 million on a new secure
juvenile detention facility to replace the Harlem Valley Secure
Center. A proposal from Pataki calls for a new facility for violent
youths to be built near the Greenhaven state prison about 50 miles
north of New York City. The conference committee discussing social
services issues said it could not agree on Pataki's proposal, with
senators in favor and Assembly members opposed.
</P>
<P>
   --Whether to include $15 million in the 2000-01 budget to support
construction of a new 22,000-seat stadium in Rochester for the
Rhinos professional soccer team.

<HEADLINE> State guidelines on shift-swapping promised after audit uncoversscam  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State prison workers face new rules on shift
swapping after auditors found 10 Adirondack Correctional Facility
officers worked abbreviated schedules and paid colleagues
under-the-table for exchanging shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Comptroller H. Carl McCall's office on Wednesday released an
audit on what it called the ''no-show'' scheme and called on the
state Department of Correctional Services to crack down on
shift-swapping policies. Corrections Commissioner Glenn Goord
quickly responded that he was ''reluctantly ordering the
development'' of a statewide policy.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the officers allegedly involved in the scheme will face
criminal penalties has been left up to the state Inspector
General's office.
</P>
<P>
   Each prison now maintains its own shift-swapping policies,
agreed upon with local union officials. Under the rules at the
Adirondack prison, in Raybrook, correction officers could trade
shifts with other workers as long as they worked shifts in return
on another date.
</P>
<P>
   But McCall's office said a review of payroll records for certain
officers from 1995 to 1999 showed that the officers maintained
their benefits while giving away many of their shifts and did not
work others' scheduled hours in exchange. Additionally, McCall's
office said that officers giving away their shifts likely paid
others to take on the extra work -- about $100 per 8-hour shift.
</P>
<P>
   One officer is accused of working only 6 percent of scheduled
time while eight officers swapped out more than 200 shifts. One
officer allegedly owed more than 800 shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ''These corrections officers would have to work up to four years
of extra shifts, along with their regular work days just to pay
back the time they owe,'' McCall said in a statement. ''At best
this is a gross abuse of the system and more likely it is a
violation of state law.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall's office would not release the identities or ranks of the
officers involved.
</P>
<P>
   While no officer admitted paying or taking payments for the
swaps, McCall's report stated -- and state prison officials conceded
-- that it was unlikely officers were working for others ''for free
as a gracious gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall's audit pointed out that officers that worked the shifts
avoided paying taxes on the additional income.
</P>
<P>
   McCall was critical of the Department of Correctional Services
and the Adirondack Correctional Facility leadership for not keeping
a closer eye on the shift exchanges. The comptroller, a Democrat,
also lambasted the Corrections Department's Inspector General's
office in the Republican Pataki administration for looking into
similar complaints in 1997 and failing ''to uncover these blatant
abuses of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The Adirondack prison, which houses up to 713 inmates and
employs 192 officers, changed its swapping policy in October 1999
so that officers with large numbers of unworked swapped shifts were
not allowed to participate in swapping, prison officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Goord said he would change the statewide policy ''reluctantly
because I know the vast majority of our employees realize that no
one should be allowed an open-ended opportunity to swap shifts.''
The department said those changes would include limited time
periods for the repayments of swaps and ban ''two for one'' shift
swaps.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisor of the Adirondack prison, Gale McGuane, who has
been in charge of the facility since April 1999, would not comment
on the charges.
</P>
<P>
   McCall recommended disciplinary action and forwarded the audit
to the state Inspector General's office to possibly pursue charges
against the officers. The Inspector General's office could not be
reached.
</P>
<P>
   The Correctional Services department said it would not allow the
officers to swap away more shifts until they pay back the old ones,
but did not promise any further penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Two officers resigned after the audit began, though it could not
be determined whether those who resigned knew about the audit or
resigned because of it, McCall's office said. As for penalties
against those two officers who resigned, spokesman James Flateau
said, ''That's something we'll explore.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall staff said the investigation began after they received a
complaint about the swapping practices.

<HEADLINE> Budget likely to include increase in crime victims' funding  </HEADLINE>
By L. ANNE NEWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The yet-to-be-finalized state budget could
cost convicted criminals $2.9 million in fees that would go toward
helping their victims recover, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The money would be raised by increasing the two fees offenders
in New York are mandated to pay upon their convictions, said Joseph
Conway, a spokesman for the state's Budget Division.
</P>
<P>
   The state's main assessments on convictions, currently $25 to
$150 depending on the severity of the crime, would rise to between
$30 and $200 and the state's Crime Victims' Assistance Fee would
rise from $5 to $10.
</P>
<P>
   The fees -- charged on both misdemeanors, such as loitering and
littering; and felonies, such as assault and murder -- currently
raise about $12 million annually for the Crime Victims Board,
Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the past, many people who have been assaulted had to deal
with this on their own,'' said Joe Maltese, a spokesman for Sen.
Dale Volker, an Erie County Republican. ''Money must be invested to
help these individuals move on with their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Volker and Assemblyman Joseph Lentol are co-chairs of a
bipartisan state Legislature conference committee discussing the
public safety portion of the 2000-01 state budget. That committee
approved the fee increases Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Since the increases were proposed initially by Gov. George
Pataki, acceptance by the committee virtually assures the higher
fees will be in the budget eventually approved by state
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200 programs received a total of $21 million in funds
from the Crime Victims Board and the federal government last year
to support services like counseling and helping victims get
restitution.
</P>
<P>
   That figure is roughly triple the funding the 33-year-old board
dispensed five years ago, according to Caroline Quartararo, a
spokeswoman for the state Division of Criminal Justice Services.
</P>
<P>
   ''More and more victims are becoming aware that this service
exists,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lentol, a Democrat from Brooklyn, said he would like to see
some of the revenues used to help support a proposal to increase
pay for the lawyers assigned by courts to represent indigent
defendants in New York courts. Currently ranging between $25 and
$40 an hour, chief state Judge Judith Kaye has proposed increasing
the fee scheduled to between $60 and $75 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Distributing some of the new money to support the ''assigned
counsels'' would ''help prevent a collapse of the justice system,
where people aren't getting adequate counsel,'' Lentol said.
</P>
<P>
   Lentol said he agrees more money needs to be allocated to the
victims' compensation board.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just hope that with the increase we find we have more money
than we need and can start to do both,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki affirmed Tuesday that the money would go to crime
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators are trying to make a deal on a state budget worth
about $78 billion for the fiscal year that began April 1. Their
leaders want to have the spending plan adopted by the start of
Passover, on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   The increased fees would take effect with the acceptance of a
finalized budget.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani's Yankee decision adds to questions about his campaign  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's decision to scrap
Senate campaign visits to Rochester and Buffalo in favor of
attending the New York Yankees home opener has raised new questions
about whether he has the drive needed to beat Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big question remains how psychically committed he is to
the race,'' New York Post columnist John Podhoretz, a Giuliani
admirer, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Passionate supporters of his are getting nervous,'' Podhoretz
said.
</P>
<P>
   GOP strategist and television commentator Jay Severin said the
mayor's decision is particularly surprising in light of polls
showing Clinton running strongly against Giuliani in traditionally
more conservative upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   The region is a key battleground and represents about 45 percent
of voting in statewide elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems to me the mayor would spend his time better north of
Yankee Stadium,'' Severin said. ''Any day the mayor does not run
like he's behind is a wasted day.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did her best to remind upstate voters about Giuliani's
decision. While she had originally planned to campaign Wednesday
only in Buffalo, a Rochester area stop was laid on at the last
minute. It was her fourth day upstate in the past six.
</P>
<P>
   Until last month, Giuliani had been leading the first lady in
statewide polls. The advantage vanished in the wake of the fatal
shooting of Patrick Dorismond, an unarmed black man, by New York
City police. Instead of condolences to the family, Giuliani made
public Dorismond's prior criminal record, including the dead man's
sealed juvenile record.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times/CBS News poll out earlier this month had
Clinton leading Giuliani, 49 percent to 41 percent, and running
even with him in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   There was slightly better polling news for Giuliani on
Wednesday. Zogby International's latest survey had the race
statistically even with Giuliani at 45 percent and Clinton at 44
percent with the mayor leading upstate, 55 percent to 34 percent. A
Zogby poll conducted in late March had the first lady at 45 percent
and the mayor at 42 percent, also a statistical tie.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby's latest telephone poll of 705 likely voters was conducted
April 5-7 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about the Giuliani campaign have been bubbling for
months. Upstate party leaders have openly complained they are not
seeing him enough.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter last week to the Giuliani campaign, Rockland County
GOP Chairman Vincent Reda said he and others ''feel we are victims
of unrequited passion ... If our attentions are unwanted, please
simply advise us to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island has warned party leaders
they are in danger of ''blowing'' the Senate race if they stick
with Giuliani. The congressman has offered himself as an
alternative candidate, if party leaders want him.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani began the Senate race with some inherent problems. In
1994, he angered many die-hard Republicans by crossing party lines
to endorse incumbent Democrat Mario Cuomo in the governor's race
won by George Pataki. Also, there is a traditional bias against New
York City among upstate voters, generally the core region for
Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there has been speculation throughout that Giuliani
really doesn't want to be a senator and would prefer to be
governor, U.S. attorney general or, most likely, stay on as mayor.
Term limits are forcing him out of that job at the end of next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the mayor announced he would attend the Yankees game
rather than campaign upstate, Podhoretz was in the Post with a
column Tuesday saying ''there is one activity about which he has
shown, and continues to show, a certain ambivalence: His candidacy
for Senate. He's not campaigning very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The truth, I think, is that Giuliani loves his current job so
much he hasn't reconciled himself to the fact that he will soon be
asking the people of the state of New York to elevate him out of
it,'' Podhoretz wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign manager Bruce Teitelbaum said such criticism
is overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ''By every objective criteria, this campaign is functioning very
well,'' he said, noting the mayor leads in fund raising ($19
million to $12 million), is running about even in the polls and has
a good statewide organization.
</P>
<P>
   Vowing the mayor will step up his campaign activity as the
election draws nearer, Teitelbaum echoed a familiar Giuliani
refrain -- the mayor has a full-time job.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all due respect, Mrs. Clinton doesn't have a job,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Podhoretz said he has heard the arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes strategies are reflective of what people want, not
what's best for them,'' the columnist said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm looking at his behavior and I'm listening to the music ...
He gets a real charge from being mayor and he knows that ends when
he goes into the Senate,'' Podhoretz added.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton adds last-minute stop to upstate campaign swing  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHILI, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton made an extra stop
during a campaign trip upstate -- at a diner near where Rudolph
Giuliani was to have appeared before scrapping the trip to watch
the Yankees play ball.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton was doing her best to highlight her rival's
absence Wednesday, Giuliani the Senate candidate was taking a back
seat to Giuliani the fan at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a human being. I love baseball. I love the Yankees,'' said
the mayor, outfitted in a Yankees jacket and cap. ''Opening day is
something of real great significance to me.''
</P>
<P>
   A city emergency would have taken priority, he said, ''but if
we're just talking about raising money, you can raise money
anytime. The Yankees don't open every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani had been scheduled to meet with women voters in
Rochester and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has spent much of the past week crisscrossing upstate,
where 45 percent of potential Senate votes lie. She used
Wednesday's stops at an elementary school, senior center and diner
to talk up her plans for the federal budget deficit, Medicare and
health care.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Clinton said she would fight for a voluntary
prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients, a $3,000 tax
credit for people providing long-term care for relatives, and to
re-import American-made drugs from Canada, where they sell more
cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   The latter, she said, would eliminate the need for senior
citizens and others to cross the border to buy affordable medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Like her husband, Clinton favors using the federal budget
surplus to keep safety-net programs like Medicare and Social
Security in the black for another generation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began the day reading to students at the Frederick Law
Olmsted School in Buffalo, where she advocated federal funding for
100,000 teachers.
</P>
<P>
   After a stop at the Town of Amherst Senior Center she dropped by
a restaurant in Chili, a Rochester suburb, and chatted with diners
while sipping an iced tea.
</P>
<P>
   A brouhaha in February over her failure to leave a tip at a
restaurant in Albion, 30 miles west of Rochester, must have been on
her mind: After ordering two tuna sandwiches to go, Mrs. Clinton
gave waitress Karen Ciriello a $20 gratuity.
</P>
<P>
   Until last month, Giuliani has been leading the first lady in
statewide polls but he lost ground in the wake of the fatal
shooting of an unarmed black man by New York City police.
</P>
<P>
   A Zogby International poll released Wednesday had the race
statistically even with Giuliani at 45 percent and Clinton at 44
percent, with the mayor leading upstate, 55 percent to 34 percent.

<HEADLINE> 28 Electrocuted in Eastern India  </HEADLINE>
By NEELESH MISRA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- An 11,000-volt electric cable snapped
and fell on a crowd of singing and dancing Hindu devotees,
electrocuting 28 people Thursday during a midnight chariot
procession, police said.
</P>
<P>
   At least eight others were injured, and four had serious burns.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,000 people were marching through Daltongunj city
behind a large colorful chariot with a glittering statue of Lord
Rama, one of the most revered Hindu gods whose birthday is
celebrated Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One devotee had a thick bamboo flag staff carrying a saffron
Hindu flag that snapped the high tension wire at the town's main
square, police official Sardev Rai said by phone. The thick wire
fell on the crowd, causing a stampede.
</P>
<P>
   ''The chariot started burning, and people were running all
over,'' Rai said, citing witnesses. ''There were bodies on the
road, and people were shouting and crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of grieving relatives rushed to the scene and the
bodies of most of the dead had been handed over to their families,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Daltongunj, 500 miles southeast of the capital of New Delhi, is
located in the eastern state of Bihar, India's poorest and most
lawless.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Target Predatory Lending  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic lawmakers are pushing a measure
aimed at curbing a growing practice by some mortgage and
home-equity loan companies of seeking low-income borrowers and
charging them what are considered unfairly high fees and interest.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration expressed support Wednesday for the
proposal aimed at so-called predatory lending, but Republicans so
far have not signed on.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers called the bill ''an
important step ... to combat abusive lending practices.''
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development, meanwhile,
released a study showing that minority and low-income home buyers
increasingly have become dependent on lenders that make
higher-interest loans to people with damaged credit histories.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are concerned that a growing number of these families may
be exposed to unregulated predatory practices that financially
burden them with high interest rates (and) excessive fees,'' HUD
Secretary Andrew Cuomo said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The moves came three weeks after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan criticized predatory lending, saying in a speech that it
can hurt poorer neighborhoods by forcing homeowners into
unaffordable mortgage payments, loss of their equity and even
foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, consumer finance companies have taken advantage
of people with low incomes or inferior credit histories, many of
them minorities or elderly, who cannot get conventional loans and
are desperate to become homeowners or raise cash by borrowing
against their homes. Government regulators and consumer groups say
that aggressive sales tactics and excessively high interest rates
are increasing.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John LaFalce of New York, the House Banking Committee's
senior Democrat, cited the case of Florence McKnight, an
84-year-old widow from Rochester, N.Y., who was persuaded by
salesmen to buy more than $20,000 in new windows. Under the loan,
she would have to pay more than $72,000 over 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The financing deal, secured by a mortgage on her $50,000 home,
was signed at the hospital where she was medicated and recovering
from a stroke and breast cancer. Her home is in foreclosure,
LaFalce said at a news conference on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation to curb predatory lending has been proposed in
California, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The practice ''has reached near-epidemic proportions in recent
years, robbing millions of American households of the equity in
their homes and undermining the economic vitality of our
neighborhoods,'' LaFalce said.
</P>
<P>
   LaFalce and Sen. Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, senior Democrat on
the Senate Banking Committee, are the chief sponsors of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   They were joined by representatives of consumer groups, the
American Association of Retired Persons and the Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would extend consumer protections under current
law to cover more high-cost mortgage refinancings, home equity
loans and home repair loans. Under current law, such high-cost
loans are not prohibited but lenders are subject to special
restrictions and disclosure requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The law now defines high-cost loans as those with interest rates
that are 10 or more percentage points above the yield on Treasury
securities with the same term. High fees are defined as those
exceeding 8 percent of the loan amount.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation would lower those ''triggers'' to 6 or
more percentage points and 5 percent of the loan, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would:
</P>
<P>
   --Prohibit up-front collection and financing of any credit
insurance or similar product on high-cost loans.
</P>
<P>
   --Limit prepayment penalties to 3 percent of the loan amount.
</P>
<P>
   --Prohibit lenders from demanding payment in full of the loan
balance under ''call'' provisions of mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   --Require companies making high-cost loans to determine that the
borrower is able to repay the loan based on federal criteria.
</P>
<P>
   --Require lenders to warn consumers in writing about the higher
risks of such loans and the need for credit counseling, and to
provide a list of local certified credit counselors.
</P>
<P>
   Banking industry officials maintain that finance companies
provide a valuable service to consumers whose low incomes and poor
credit records prevent them from qualifying for normal loans. They
say new regulations could dry up credit in many of the areas that
need it.

<HEADLINE> European Interest Rate Hike Imminent  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Even as the European Central Bank
reported of marked improvement in the continent's economy, revised
economic forecasts for higher inflation put new pressure on the
bank to raise interest rates and slow the snowballing economy.
</P>
<P>
   The ECB, which began managing monetary policy in the 11
countries using Europe's common currency, the euro, in January
1999, gave a positive overview of the bank's first year in the
report released Wednesday. It said the members have successfully
stuck with guidelines for reducing national deficits and
introducing market-oriented reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ECB president Wim Duisenberg even praised the performance of the
euro. Despite losing roughly 17 percent of its worth against the
dollar since being launched at $1.16 on Jan. 1, 1999, the euro has
recently stabilized in a range of 95 cents to 97 cents.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news and economists largely expect the bank's
17-member governing board to keep rates steady at Thursday's
regular meeting -- especially after just boosting it a quarter-point
to 3.5 percent a month ago. But they say another rate hike is
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The distance from the last step is still too short, but the
ECB still has the intention to raise rates. That is clear. Perhaps
later this month or in early May,'' said Petra Koehler, an
economist with Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   At the central bank's last meeting March 30, Duisenberg warned
the board was prepared to step in and raise rates if inflation in
the region creeps closer to the 2 percent ceiling set under ECB
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Eyebrows were raised Tuesday when the European Union Commission
-- the EU's regulatory body -- upped its 2000 inflation forecast for
the euro countries to 1.8 percent, from an earlier prediction of
1.5 percent in November. The ECB keeps its own economic forecasts
private and closely watches those made by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   The figures were tempered, however, by several factors helping
keep prices level.
</P>
<P>
   High oil prices, which fan inflation, are already falling after
last month's agreement by leading the world's oil producers to
raise output. And the foundering euro, which makes imports more
expensive, has bounced back and stabilized against the dollar after
hitting a low of 93.90 cents in late February.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate labor contracts signed recently in Germany have also
mitigated fears that runaway wages in Europe's biggest economy
would spill over into other areas of the economy and push up
consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
   Still, economists say another hike will be needed soon to check
Europe's brisk economic recovery. The European Commission on
Tuesday boosted its forecast for the region's economic growth to
3.4 percent, up from its prediction of 2.9 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
   An overheating economy can spur inflation, and raising interest
rates tends to cool things off by making it more expensive to
borrow money.

<HEADLINE> Kansas Player Receives Probation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- Dion Rayford, the former Kansas football
player accused of damaging the drive-through window at a Taco Bell,
pleaded guilty Wednesday to criminal property damage.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3, 260-pound defensive end was sentenced to one year
of probation. Douglas County District Judge Paula Martin also
ordered Rayford to pay court costs and restitution for damage to
the drive-through window.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the guilty plea, prosecutors dropped charges of
disorderly conduct and having an open container of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant employees said Rayford tried to crawl through the
window Nov. 17 because he thought servers failed to include a
chalupa in his takeout order.
</P>
<P>
   The widely publicized incident resulted in Rayford's suspension
for the final game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Rayford, 25, Los Gatos, Calif., transferred to Kansas before the
1998 season from West Valley Junior College in Saratoga, Calif. He
started 10 of 11 games in 1998 and all but the season finale
against Iowa State last season.
</P>
<P>
   Rayford led the team in tackles for losses, nine for 66 yards,
and was second in quarterback sacks with four.

<HEADLINE> Padres 4, Diamondbacks 2  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Ed Sprague delivered for the second straight
game, getting a pinch-hit, two-run bloop single in the seventh
inning that gave the San Diego Padres a 4-2 win over the Arizona
Diamondbacks on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague's single, which landed between left fielder Luis
Gonzalez and shortstop Tony Womack, was just the second hit of the
three-run inning.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Sprague hit a tying solo homer in the ninth
inning, then homered again leading off the 13th to give the Padres
a 3-2 win. An All-Star third baseman with Pittsburgh last year,
Sprague was signed as a minor league free agent in the offseason to
give the Padres insurance at first and third base.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague batted for right-hander Brian Meadows (2-0), who was
making his home debut.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres loaded the bases with none out in the seventh on Bret
Boone's single, David Newhan's walk and Ben Davis' bunt. Boone beat
pitcher Armando Reynoso's throw to third on the bunt.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gomez hit a bouncer to third baseman Lenny Harris, whose
throw home was wide of catcher Kelly Stinnett for an error,
allowing Boone to score. Newhan tried to score from second but was
easily thrown out by Stinnett.
</P>
<P>
   That brought up Sprague, who singled off Darren Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Hoffman pitched the ninth for his first save.
</P>
<P>
   Harris had tripled in Steve Finley with the go-ahead run with
one out in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The teams had traded solo home runs up to that point. Arizona's
Travis Lee homered into the seats in right-center leading off the
second.
</P>
<P>
   Al Martin hit his first homer for the Padres, a 439-foot shot
off the permanent wall in straightaway center field leading off the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Until Martin's homer, the Padres had gotten just three infield
singles off Reynoso (0-2), including a bunt and a broken-bat hit by
Eric Owens.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows, acquired in an offseason trade with Florida, allowed
six hits and two runs in seven innings. Reynoso gave up four runs,
three earned, on five hits in 6 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Padres were still minus two starting outfielders. RF
Tony Gwynn missed his second straight start after having his
troublesome left knee drained after Monday's home opener and CF
Ruben Rivera (ankle, wrist) missed his third straight start. ...
Diamondbacks reliever Matt Mantei, on the disabled list with biceps
tendinitis, threw well again on the side and will head to Triple-A
Tucson for a rehab assignment. He's scheduled to pitch on Friday
and Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Advanced Micro Devices Soars  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL LIEDTKE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Just when investors feared the personal
computer market had weakened, Advanced Micro Devices provided
evidence that the industry may still have plenty of bounce left in
its step.
</P>
<P>
   AMD, the No. 2 chipmaker after Intel, blew past forecasts with a
$189 million profit for the quarter ended April 2. The quarter --
the best in AMD's history -- may help calm the market jitters about
PC demand, industry analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's possible that this could help turn the tale of the
(ticker) tape,'' said Daniel Myers, who follows chip makers for
Robertson Stephens in San Francisco. His comments came as the
tech-laden Nasdaq composite index suffered its biggest one-day
point decline. Wednesday's selloff was triggered by a Goldman
Sach's analyst's decision to cut his revenue estimate for
Microsoft's fiscal third quarter, citing slumping personal computer
sales.
</P>
<P>
   AMD said a 73 percent jump in revenues helped produce a
first-quarter profit of $189 million, or $1.15 per share, nearly
double what most industry analysts expected.
</P>
<P>
   And in a conference call following the report, AMD officials
predicted even stronger results for the current quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The encouraging news seemed to contradict the market-rattling
comments issued earlier in the day by a top analyst who said
Microsoft's sales are being hurt by weaker demand for personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-laden Nasdaq market, already plagued by worries
about corporate profits, plunged 7 percent on Wednesday amid news
that Rick Sherlund at Goldman Sachs had lowered his revenue
estimates for the software maker.
</P>
<P>
   But after the close of regular stock trading, AMD reported that
it sold 1.2 million of its speedy Athlon microprocessors in the
quarter, a 50 percent increase from last year, as the company
grabbed a larger share of the market for PCs costing less than
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think the PC market is strong and it's getting stronger,''
CEO Jerry Sanders told analysts during the conference call.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Joseph, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney in San
Francisco, said Sanders' comments should carry great weight with
investors after AMD's impressive first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   AMD's results for the first three months of 2000 compared with a
loss of $128 million, or 88 cents per share, in first quarter of
1999. The jump in Athlon sales accounted for the bulk of a record
revenue tally of $1.09 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The once-struggling company's improving fortunes have been
fueled by rising demand for lower-priced PCs, which have emerged as
the fastest growing part of the computer market as households buy
their first and second machines.

<HEADLINE> United, Pilots Seek Mediation  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- United Airlines and its pilots union are taking
their negotiations to federal mediation, officials for both sides
said after a key deadline passed without agreement on a new
contract.
</P>
<P>
   United passengers are not affected by the impasse. The pilots,
who are part-owners of the world's largest airline, said Wednesday
there are no plans for a strike or other work action.
</P>
<P>
   The motivation to settle the long-stalled talks comes from the
expiration of United's 1994 employee stock-option plan at midnight
Tuesday night. While the contract remains in effect until a new one
is signed, pilots' compensation was automatically rolled back to
the level of six years ago -- raising pilots' pay by 6.7 percent but
no longer providing any stock.
</P>
<P>
   United's pilots, machinists and many of its white-collar
employees own a combined 55 percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Dubinsky, head of the Air Line Pilots Association, and
United chairman James Goodwin plan to fly to Washington on Friday
to submit the standoff to the National Mediation Board, the pilots
and the airline said.

   United, based in Elk Grove, Ill., has acknowledged it needs to
raise pilots' salaries substantially to keep pace with other
airlines. The negotiations will determine if the stock ownership
plan is renewed.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Herb Hunter, spokesman for the United Airlines unit of the
ALPA, said the fact Dubinsky and Goodwin are flying together to
Washington is a positive sign, although it doesn't necessarily mean
a settlement is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tone of the negotiations has changed in the past few days,
but the substance really hasn't,'' he said, adding ''We're miles
behind all of our competition.''

<P>
   According to Aviation Information Resources, a United junior
captain with 10 years' experience earns $10,677 a month, while he
or she would make $12,715 a month at Delta Air Lines, for example.

<P>
   United spokesman Joe Hopkins said mediation is ''just part of
the process.'' He declined to comment on the status of contract
talks but emphasized that there will be no disruption in service
for United passengers.

<P>
   United also faces the expiration of a contract with its
machinists July 12.

<HEADLINE> SuperSonics 110, Timberwolves 83  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle SuperSonics shook up their starting
lineup by benching Vin Baker and two other regulars Wednesday
night, and ended a three-game slide with a 110-83 win over the
Minnesota Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton scored 29 points to lead the Sonics, who had dropped
nine of 11 games to fall to the eighth playoff seed in the Western
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle coach Paul Westphal, upset over his team's recent
struggles, replaced Baker, Brent Barry and Ruben Patterson,
regulars all season, with Rashard Lewis, Shammond Williams and
Cuban forward Lazaro Borrell.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Garnett paced the Timberwolves, who had a four-game
winning streak broken, with 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis had 18 points, Borrell 10 and Williams eight for the
Sonics, who also got 20 points from Vernon Maxwell and 12 rebounds
from Horace Grant.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics put Minnesota away early in the final quarter. Ahead
74-63, the Sonics got a 3-pointer from Maxwell, a two-handed dunk
by Lewis on a pinpoint pass from Borrell, and a fast-break layup
from Jelani McCoy to grab an 81-63 edge with 1:28 gone in the
period.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' starting five of Grant, Payton, Borrell, Williams
and Lewis caught the Timberwolves off-guard, taking a lead of 17-12
before Westphal brought in Baker and Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle jumped on top 15-6 in the first 5:33 as Payton sank a
pair of 3-pointers and an 18-footer. The Sonics took the lead for
good on Payton's first 3-pointer, with 1:22 gone in the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, the Sonics built their lead to 17 points
at 54-37 on two free throws by Payton with 37 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Baker picked up three personal fouls in the third quarter when
Minnesota pulled to within 11 points three times.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Szczerbiak had 14 points for Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Sonics and the Timberwolves split four games this
season, with each team winning twice on its home court. ...
Williams' start was the first of his career, Borrell's his second
and Lewis' his 11th. ... Payton's 29 points gave him 13,383 for his
career, tying Rudy Tomjanovich, the Houston Rockets' coach, for
118th place on the NBA's scoring list. ... Williams had a
career-high 28 points in Monday night's overtime loss to the Lakers
in Los Angeles. The smallish guard delighted the crowd with a
two-handed dunk on a fast break with 1:37 left before making a
3-pointer and drawing another ovation. ... Sam Mitchell of
Minnesota was ejected with 8.5 seconds left after getting into a
heated argument with a Sonics fan near the Seattle bench.

<HEADLINE> Pacers 77, Raptors 73  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Toronto faltered in the fourth quarter
against the Indiana Pacers, and produced their lowest scoring ouput
of the season. The Raptors can celebrate their first playoff berth
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose had 10 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter and
Austin Croshere had five of his 15 in the period as the Pacers beat
the Raptors 77-73 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But Toronto, which joined the NBA five years ago, was assured of
participating in the postseason for the first time because the
Orlando Magic lost at Boston on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto (43-35) is sixth in the Eastern conference standings,
four games ahead of eighth-place Orlando (39-39) and Milwaukee
(39-39) with four games left for each team.
</P>
<P>
   But because the Magic and Bucks play each other -- Monday at
Orlando -- Toronto is assured of finishing no worse than eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's 73 points were its lowest production this season and
also represented the fewest against Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, combined with Miami's loss to Detroit, gave the
Pacers a two-game advantage over the Heat in their battle for
home-court advantage throughout the Eastern Conference playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana plays at Miami on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Carter had 28 points for Toronto, which led 67-61 with
7:21 to play. Tracy McGrady added 19.
</P>
<P>
   ''They made big shots at the end and we didn't. A couple of them
we missed, and the rest is history,'' said Carter, who missed two
shots in the final seconds. ''We've got to go back to the drawing
board and prepare for New York (Friday) and get the win we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose, whose streak of 43 consecutive games in double figures was
snapped when he scored only nine in New York on Monday, ignited an
11-2 run with two consecutive baskets.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just trying to be aggressive and not tentative. ... The
guys got me the ball in position to make plays,'' said Rose, who
covered Carter most of the night. ''Every time I play Vince Carter,
I'm the underdog, so I have nothing to lose. When I play somebody
like that I've got to bring my 'A' game.''
</P>
<P>
   Croshere's basket and a 3-pointer by Reggie Miller with 4:24
remaining put Indiana ahead to stay 70-69.
</P>
<P>
   Two Rose free throws made it 72-69, and a dunk by Carter with
3:18 left made it 72-71. The Raptors, who never have won in nine
visits to Indianapolis, then missed their final seven shots from
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Davis, who contributed 12 points and 14 rebounds to the
victory, threw in a short jumper as the 24-second clock was running
down to make it 74-71 with 2:51 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew the shot clock was running down. I saw the opportunity
to take it. I got a fake and spin and I got it to go down,'' said
Davis, who was 6-of-8 from the field. ''The main thing in this ball
game was our aggressiveness and improvement in the second half. We
did a better job of screening, blocking out and helping.''
</P>
<P>
   In the remaining time, Charles Oakley missed a jumper, Dee Brown
missed a 3-point attempt, Carter missed two shots and Oakley missed
a 3-point try. Antonio Davis, who had 11 points and 13 rebounds,
scored the Raptors' only points in the final minutes when he made
two free throws with 21.8 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   Croshere hit two free throws with 17.5 left and then made one of
two attempts to close the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been fighting ourselves for the past two-and-a-half
weeks,'' said Antonio Davis, who spent six seasons with the Pacers
before being traded to Toronto in August. ''They played better than
we did tonight. We have nothing to put our heads down about.''
</P>
<P>
   The game had nine lead changes and nine ties. Indiana's biggest
edge was eight points in the first half; Toronto's biggest was
seven points.
</P>
<P>
   There were four lead changes and eight ties in the first half,
which ended with the Raptors leading 43-40 after Carter scored
their final nine points in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors trailed 19-16 after one quarter when they shot 26
percent from the field (6-of-23). Indiana shot 50 percent in the
period (8-of-16) with Rik Smits and Rose each scoring six points.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Indiana has sold out all 40 of its games at Conseco
Fieldhouse. ... Doug Christie was not in uniform for the Raptors
due to a bruised right ankle. ... Muggsy Bogues made his fourth
straight start for Toronto. Bogues, who had the league's best
assist-to-turnover ratio of 4.92 going into the game, had two
assists without a turnover. ... Both teams had poor shooting
nights. Toronto shot 33 percent (27-of-81), Indiana 38 percent
(29-of-76). ... Oakley missed his final eight shots and was 1-of-10
from the field. ... Indiana helped itself by hitting 15 of 18 free
throws, while Toronto was 13-of-20 at the line.

<HEADLINE> Reno Rejected by Elian's Family  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX VEIGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno ordered
Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives to bring the boy to a Miami-area
airport Thursday afternoon after she failed to persuade them to end
the wrenching 4{-month custody struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Reno took the extraordinary step of coming to Miami to meet for
2{ hours with the six-year-old boy's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez,
who later defiantly said he would not relinquish custody of the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not turn this child over, not in Opa-locka, not in any
'locka,''' he said, referring to the government's demand that Elian
be brought to the airport in Opa-locka, outside Miami. ''They will
have to take this child from me by force.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno told the family to bring Elian to the airport Thursday at 2
p.m. She said a plane would take the boy, and whatever relatives
wanted to come, to Washington for a retreat at a neutral site with
the boy's Cuban father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. No Cuban diplomats
would be present.
</P>
<P>
   She said if the family did not show, ''We will enforce the
order,'' but she did not elaborate. ''It would respectful, firm,
fair and prompt,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''An agreement among the family is the best solution,'' Reno
said. ''An agreement is still possible, but it remains elusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno met with Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's cousin, Marisleysis
Gonzalez, and other relatives at the Miami Beach home of Sister
Jeanne O'Laughlin, the nun who was host of a January meeting
between Elian and his grandmothers from Cuba. Elian attended the
meeting, moving from lap to lap at the table.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Diaz, an attorney for the family, said Reno and
Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner
heard ample evidence during the meeting that Elian does not want to
go back to Cuba but refused to take that into account.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would seek a federal court injunction to block the
government from instructing the family how to hand Elian over.
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin described the meeting as cordial and said Elian left
the room only when the subject matter was too sensitive. ''He was
precious with her,'' O'Laughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was very respectful and they were very honest,''
O'Laughlin said. ''The pain of this family and their understanding
of the pain of Juan Miguel was very evident. They have expressed
over and over again their ... desire to be a loving family, whole
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his relatives had left their politically charged
Little Havana neighborhood for O'Laughlin's gated home earlier in
the day, but headed back home early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, clinging to an inner tube, was rescued by two fishermen
on Thanksgiving after his mother and 10 other Cubans drowned when
their boat sank.
</P>
<P>
   His Miami relatives have been caring for him ever since and have
been fighting in court for him to have an asylum hearing. But the
Clinton administration has ordered Elian back to his father in
Cuba, saying only he can speak for the boy on immigration matters.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge affirmed that decision, but the family has
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, who met with Reno after coming to America last
week, remained in Bethesda, Md. He indicated Wednesday -- the day
after a meeting in Washington with the Miami relatives was
scheduled and abruptly canceled -- that he was through negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his wife and their infant son were
guests of honor at a reception at the Cuban diplomatic mission in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, Ricardo Alarcon, the senior Cuban official who has
advised the father, criticized the Miami relatives for delaying the
transfer, saying they were showing ''a total lack of respect for
American society,'' and ''making fun of the U.S. government.''
</P>
<P>
   When O'Laughlin first got involved, she said she had no opinion
about whether the boy should be returned. But after the
grandmothers' visit, she said Elian should stay in the United
States -- drawing bitter criticism from the Cuban government and the
grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   If Elian's relatives were hoping for a quieter setting in Miami
Beach, they only partially succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   While Reno met with the family, dozens of police and federal
agents kept watch over about 200 demonstrators. Several waved a
Cuban flag bigger than a king-sized bedsheet.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Elian arrived at the house, a crowd chanted ''Elian!
Elian!'' in anticipation. The demonstrators were forced to keep a
greater distance than on Lazaro Gonzalez's narrow street. Police
kept them across a four-lane road, behind a median and a barricade.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reno, coward, Miami has had enough!'' some shouted. Reno left
in a motorcade that included 12 police motorcycles and a dozen
cruisers.
</P>
<P>
   At Lazaro Gonzalez's house, protesters were starting to
acknowledge that Elian may be heading back to Cuba. But the
attorney general's visit to Miami gave some a ray of hope.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now she's not the Cuban-Americans' best friend, but that
could change between today and tomorrow,'' said Rolando Millet, 39.
He held a sign: ''America get ready for a miracle.''

S.C. Moves To Remove Flag
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- South Carolina state senators on Wednesday endorsed a
bill to remove the Confederate flag from atop the Statehouse dome. Opponents say
the banner is racist but supporters insist it's a symbol of Southern heritage.
The bill would remove the banner from the dome and place a similar battle flag
behind an existing monument honoring Confederate soldiers on Statehouse grounds.
The flag would fly on the north side of the Statehouse from a pole no taller
than 20 feet. That element was added to satisfy black lawmakers and other flag
opponents who did not want the flag in a prominent position to passers-by.

Jury Rejects Sheppard Son's Claim

   CLEVELAND (AP) -- A jury on Wednesday unanimously rejected the claim of Dr.
Sam Sheppard's son that his father was wrongfully imprisoned for his mother's
1954 slaying, ending another chapter in the sensational case that inspired ''The
Fugitive'' television series. The eight-member jury in Cuyahoga County Common
Pleas Court did not find Dr. Sheppard guilty of murder -- that wasn't the
question before it. Rather, the decision means the couple's son, Sam Reese
Sheppard, failed to meet the burden of proof in his wrongful imprisonment civil
lawsuit against the state of Ohio. To win, Sheppard needed to convince jurors
the majority of evidence showed his father, who died in 1970, was innocent.

<HEADLINE> Suns 122, Grizzlies 116, OT  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Penny Hardaway, in foul trouble and ineffective
most of the night, scored eight of his 17 points in overtime
Wednesday as the Phoenix Suns pulled out a 122-116 win over the
lowly Vancouver Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver had lost 10 in a row on the road and 10 in a row to
Phoenix, but led the Suns 107-97 with 3:51 to play in the fourth
quarter. Phoenix outscored the Grizzlies 12-2 the rest of
regulation to force overtime.
</P>
<P>
   A loss would have been disastrous to the Suns' hopes for
home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs. With its
shaky 51st victory, Phoenix pulled one game ahead of idle San
Antonio for the No. 4 spot in the Western Conference with four
games to play.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Robinson had 36 points and 10 rebounds before fouling out
on an offensive foul with the Suns leading 116-114 with 1:48 to
play. The Grizzlies couldn't score, and Hardaway sank a
high-arching shot on a drive to the basket to put Phoenix ahead
118-114 with 1:24 to play. Hardaway's two free throws with 24.4
seconds to go clinched the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Livingston had a career-high 23 points, seven assists and
seven rebounds for the Suns, who were without Kevin Johnson.
Johnson -- who came out of retirement when starting point guard
Jason Kidd broke an ankle -- aggravated a groin strain in Phoenix's
victory Tuesday over the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Rogers added 14 points, including two crucial three-point
plays, one late in the fourth quarter and one in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver's Michael Dickerson had 35 points but didn't score
after the 5:39 mark of the fourth quarter. Othella Harrington added
20 points and 12 rebounds, Mike Bibby had 18 points and 11 assists,
and Sharif Abdur-Rahim scored 18.
</P>
<P>
   Doug West's inside basket with 7:50 to go triggered a 13-2 run
that put the Grizzlies up 107-97 on Abdur-Rahim's two free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' three-point play started an 8-0 charge that cut
Vancouver's lead to 107-105 when Penny Hardaway made one of two
free throws with 1:33 left. Harrington sank two free throws to make
it 109-105, then Todd Day made a 3-pointer, his first basket in six
attempts, with 1:03 remaining to cut the lead to 109-108.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Scott fouled Day on a 3-point attempt with 19.9 seconds
to go, but Day could make just the last of the three free throws to
tie it at 109-109. Dickerson was called for traveling on a drive
down the lane, but Rogers couldn't get a shot off and the game went
into overtime.
</P>
<P>
@Notes: Suns coach Scott Skiles drew a technical foul in the third
quarter for complaining about the fourth foul call against
Hardaway. Hardaway and Harrington also drew technicals on the play.
.... Even though centers Luc Longley and Corie Blount each had five
fouls early in the fourth quarter, Skiles kept Oliver Miller on the
bench, another sign that the rotund center is in the doghouse. ...
Of their remaining four games, the Suns play only one team with a
winning record -- Utah, which visits Phoenix on Sunday. ... Phoenix
is 31-7 at home, fourth-best in the NBA.

   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Brad Fullmer triggered a four-run eighth
inning with a tiebreaking, two-out double and Tony Batista added a
two-run homer as the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Anaheim Angels 6-2
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Mark Petkovsek (0-1) hit Homer Bush with a pitch with
one out and Raul Mondesi singled for his first three-hit game for
the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   After Carlos Delgado struck out, Fullmer lined the next pitch
off the low fence in the right-field corner for a 4-2 lead. Batista
greeted Lou Pote with his fifth homer.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Borbon (1-0) got one out for his first AL victory.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson hit an RBI single in the first and the Angels
added a run in the fifth on doubles by Darin Erstad and Adam
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays tied the score at 2 in the sixth on consecutive
RBI singles by Mondesi and Carlos Delgado.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado made a couple of nice plays at first base. He caught a
line drive and made a tag for a game-ending double play.

Mike Scioscia is trying to become only the third manager in the
Angels' 40-year history to lead the team to a winning record in his
first full season as manager -- without having taken over during the
previous year. The only ones who fall into that category are Doug
Rader (91-71 in 1989) and Terry Collins (84-78 in 1997). ... Blue
Jays manager Jim Fregosi, who recently was selected as the
shortstop on the Angels' all-time team, was honored with a video
presentation of his career highlights during a pregame ceremony. He
also was presented with a piece of crystal at home plate by Angels
closer Troy Percival -- who struck out the side in the ninth Tuesday
night to preserve Anaheim's 5-4 victory. ... Delgado, whose 82 home
runs over the previous two seasons are a Blue Jays' record, is
still looking for his first homer after 36 at-bats.

<HEADLINE> Activity May Stave Off Huntington's  </HEADLINE>
By MALCOLM RITTER, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   People who carry the defective gene that causes Huntington's
disease might be able to delay the onset of symptoms by keeping
busy in a stimulating environment, researchers suggested today in a
study of mice.
</P>
<P>
   The rodents took longer to show symptoms if they lived in cages
with plenty of objects to play with and explore.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists were cautious about applying that result to people
but said it is worth studying. For one thing, no one knows what
part of the mouse experience made the difference -- overall physical
activity, mental stimulation or something else.
</P>
<P>
   Huntington's is a degenerative brain disorder that slowly
diminishes a person's ability to walk, talk and think. No cure or
effective treatment is known.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms generally begin between ages 30 and 45, though people
who have inherited the defective gene can be identified much
earlier through a blood test. About 30,000 Americans have the
disease, but many more may carry the gene.
</P>
<P>
   The study of 16 mice was reported in today's issue of the
journal Nature by Dr. Anton van Dellen and Anthony Hannan of Oxford
University, with colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the mice lived in a standard cage, with all the food and
water they could drink and a soft material for bedding. The other
half lived in an ''enriched'' environment that included tunnels,
boxes, tubes and other objects of cardboard, paper and plastic.
</P>
<P>
   New objects were switched for old ones every couple of days. The
mice explored them, crawled under and over them and tore off pieces
of cardboard and paper.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers tested the animals for movement abnormalities that
appear in the rodent version of Huntington's. One abnormality --
difficulty in turning around on a narrow rod -- appeared in only one
of seven mice from the enriched cage but in all nine from the
standard cage by the time testing concluded at 22 weeks of age.
Another abnormality, clasping of hind paws when held aloft by the
tail, appeared in half of the ''enriched'' animals by that time vs.
all of the other mice.
</P>
<P>
   The results suggest that mental or physical activity might help
stave off Huntington's in people, but more research is needed,
Hannan said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christopher Ross, a professor of psychiatry and neuroscience
at Johns Hopkins University, said it would be premature to change
behavior substantially because of a single mouse study. The idea
would be worth testing in people if further animal study bears it
out, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Any effect on the appearance of symptoms would probably be
modest, but even that would be helpful because nothing is known to
affect the progression of the disease, he said.

<HEADLINE> Fox Closes Book on TV Marriage  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Fox had concluded that there was little it could
have done to prevent the public relations fiasco that followed
''Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Burned by the revelation that wealthy groom Rick Rockwell had a
restraining order issued against him in 1991 by a former fiancee,
the TV network hired a law firm to probe whether it could have done
anything more to check into his background.
</P>
<P>
   The law firm found that the show's producer, Next Entertainment,
hired a private investigator and search firm to check Rockwell's
record before the show aired, Fox spokesman Jeff DeRome said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act prohibited the
disclosure of embarrassing events that had occurred more than seven
years earlier, except for criminal convictions, DeRome said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the law, producers and Fox depended on Rockwell to
let them know if there was anything in his background they should
know -- and the restraining order didn't come up, he said. Rockwell
has said he considered the event ''ancient history'' and ''somewhat
of a nonevent when it occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   No one at Fox will lose their jobs or be punished for their role
in setting up the special, DeRome said.
</P>
<P>
   The February wedding drew tremendous ratings, but launched an
immediate debate on the propriety of a TV network brokering a
marriage between two strangers. Rockwell and his bride, Darva
Conger, quickly ended the marriage and Fox has vowed never to do
anything like it again.
</P>
<P>
   ''Case closed,'' DeRome said. ''It is clear to us now how it
happened and why it happened. I guess everyone involved has learned
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading into a ratings ''sweeps'' month in May, Fox has clearly
toned down. It has scheduled specials on ghosts, UFOs, the
paranormal and funny game show outtakes. As promised, Fox has
steered clear of police chases and marauding animals.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is also planning a live special where an ancient Egyptian
tomb is opened. For that, it hired one of the most noncontroversial
hosts it could find: genial former ''20/20'' anchor Hugh Downs.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors: Dr. Led Double Life  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN FINUCANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLESLEY, Mass. (AP) -- Last Halloween, a well-respected
allergist took a morning stroll with his wife in the pine-needled
woods near their home. Only the doctor came out of the woods alive.
</P>
<P>
   Mabel Greineder, 58, was bludgeoned with a hammer and stabbed
with a knife.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband of 31 years, Dr. Dirk Greineder, 59, has been
charged with her murder. Authorities say he may have killed his
wife after she learned he led a secret life to indulge his desire
for pornography and prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   State officials called Greineder a threat to public health and
safety in suspending his medical license. Still, the couple's three
grown children are steadfastly supporting their father, a
distinguished doctor and resident of one of the wealthiest towns in
Massachusetts who has said he is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know him extremely well. And we know he's innocent,'' said
Britt Greineder, 27, on Wednesday. ''He would never be capable of
harming my Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Greineder appeared to be living a life of success and serenity.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Germany but raised in Lebanon, Greineder speaks at least
four languages. He was educated at Yale and received his doctorate
from Case Western Reserve University. By 1998, he had risen to
director of clinical allergy at Brigham and Women's Hospital, one
of the best-known hospitals in Boston and one of the nation's top
research facilities.
</P>
<P>
   He and his family lived for 25 years in Wellesley, which
residents describe as peaceful neighborhood and an unlikely scene
for a crime.
</P>
<P>
   But say the doctor had a second identity -- using the pseudonym
Thomas Young, the name of a former Yale classmate. He arranged
hotel trysts with prostitutes, sent nude pictures of himself over
the Internet and prescribed himself Viagra, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   During the weekend prior to the murder, prosecutors allege,
Greineder stayed in a New Jersey hotel with a prostitute -- and he
called the same woman for sex the day after his wife was slain. He
allegedly told one prostitute his wife was ''older and soft.''
</P>
<P>
   Greineder led a life ''dedicated to prostitutes and pornography
that was unknown to all those closest to him,'' prosecutor Rick
Grundy said.
</P>
<P>
   Greineder told police he found his wife's body after the couple
became separated during their walk in the town park at Morses Pond,
only a half-mile from their four-bedroom home.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was not arrested for four months, authorities say they
suspected the doctor from the beginning: When police first arrived
at the park, Greineder had blood on his jacket, eyeglasses and
sleeves, but not on his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors believe they've found the gloves that Greineder
wore. And they say DNA tests run on a knife and hammer found in the
park strongly tie Greineder to the crime. He's being held without
bail.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent court hearing, his two daughters and son sat
shoulder to shoulder in an otherwise empty row in the gallery.
Greineder smiled at them as he walked by in handcuffs and leg
manacles.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's really quite remarkable. ... He's an amazing father. He's
always been there for us,'' Ms. Greineder.
</P>
<P>
   Greineder's attorney has railed against prosecutors for
assailing the doctor's character and sharing too much publicly
about the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect to try this case in court and not in the news media,
and we expect that at the end of the process, Dr. Greineder will be
completely vindicated,'' attorney Martin Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Greineder said she and her siblings are looking forward to
the day their father goes to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''We eagerly await the day in court. ... We stand 100 percent
behind him. We are utterly convinced of his innocence,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Smoking Moms-Kids' Behavior Linked  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Women who smoke while pregnant are far more
likely to have children who develop behavior problems as toddlers,
researchers reported today in the Archives of Pediatrics &AMP;
Adolescent Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The findings add to a growing body of research indicating that
smoking by mothers-to-be can harm children.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all 2-year-olds exhibit some rebelliousness, risk-taking
and impulsiveness. But such behavior was four times more likely in
toddlers whose mothers smoked during pregnancy, according to the
study.
</P>
<P>
   The findings suggest a chemical root for the problem behavior,
since the researchers took into account sociological factors that
might have affected the children, such as a mother's stress,
personality and income level.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan Leshner of the National Institute of Drug Abuse, which
funded the study of the 99 toddlers and their mothers, said smoking
might alter children's behavior by exposing the fetus to nicotine,
which could reduce the amount of oxygen that gets to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, led by Judith Brook of Mount Sinai School of
Medicine in New York, also suggest, as others have, that problem
behavior linked to maternal smoking is likely to continue into
adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking during pregnancy has been linked to low birthweight,
retardation and even criminal behavior in adulthood. Previous
research also has linked it with behavioral problems in children.
Leshner, however, said the current study stands out because the
authors adequately took into account other factors that could
explain misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of pregnant American women smoke. They give
birth to about 800,000 babies each year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The message is an important one -- that people need to take the
risks of smoking during pregnancy far more seriously,'' Leshner
said.

<HEADLINE> Aerial Gunners Target Coyotes  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH HOFFNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- A North Dakota predator control program is
using gunners in airplanes to kill coyotes, a practice meant to
help farmers and ranchers that has recently drawn fire from
environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Agriculture Department's Wildlife Services agents
killed 2,071 coyotes in North Dakota under the program last year,
but their goal is not to exterminate animals, said Phil
Mastrangelo, state director of wildlife services.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't just go all over the state shooting everything we
see,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The program has an annual budget of about $810,000, which is
funded by USDA and the state Agriculture and Game and Fish
departments. The program also uses booming cannons to scare away
birds and traps that capture beavers and muskrats.
</P>
<P>
   Mastrangelo said his agency was able to document $126,000 in
livestock damage caused by predators last year. He said the field
agents currently are busy because of the threat coyotes pose during
calving season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good tool to use this time of year. Coyotes are
establishing their territories, and we can get into these areas and
remove those coyotes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aerial coyote hunts drew fire this week from a Colorado
environmental group that said the missions have caused 33 crashes
nationwide, resulting in 17 deaths and 31 injuries since 1983. A
pilot and gunner escaped injury last month in north-central South
Dakota when their plane crashed during a coyote hunt for the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they allow a bunch of federal cowboys to fly over the
country blasting wild animals indiscriminately, that's wrong,''
said Wendy Keefover-Ring of the Boulder-based Sinapu, which has
joined about 20 environmental organizations in campaigning against
aerial gunning on public lands.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Coolahan, director of Wildlife Services, said he believes
the practice does comply with federal law because the hunts are
specific to animals that have caused problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of aerial hunting is done on snow prior to the sheep
arriving,'' he said. ''There was a study in Utah, indicating that's
cost-effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Yardley of the Colorado Woolgrowers Association, said that
''aerial gunning is about the only tool we have left in an industry
that's already over-stressed by a whole lot of factors as more and
more people are being forced out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   In North Dakota, the agency has two pilots who fly gunners,
Mastrangelo said. The pilots often are former crop sprayers who are
experienced in flying low to the ground. Shotguns are used to kill
predators from the single-engine planes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It certainly could be hazardous,'' Mastrangelo said. ''There's
not much maneuvering room if there's an equipment failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife Services workers also shoot coyotes on the ground and
assists farmers in buying guard animals that are added to livestock
herds. Mastrangelo said farmers can get reimbursed for up to 50
percent of the cost of special dogs, donkeys and llamas that are
bred to scare away predators.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their bloodline and their hereditary traits are intentionally
bred for that,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Baltic Leaders Discuss Russia  </HEADLINE>
By JAN M. OLSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOLDING, Denmark (AP) -- Ministers from the Baltic Sea region
stressed cooperation with the largest member, Russia, as they
tiptoed around the sensitive issues of Chechnya and EU expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russia is a very complementary and important partner to the
Baltic Sea region and to Europe,'' Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup
Rasmussen said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But widespread international condemnation of Russia's offensive
in the breakaway republic of Chechnya was also echoed at the summit
in Kolding, 145 miles west of Denmark's capital, Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   One of the conditions of normalization between Europe and Russia
''should be that the Chechnya question is solved in an acceptable
manner,'' Nyrup Rasmussen said.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day conference, which ends today, was aimed at
strengthening regional cooperation among the Council of the Baltic
Sea States by bringing together ministers from the 11 member
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers, including German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and
other leaders, planned to tackle issues ranging from the
environment and crime to attempts by Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia to join the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, the four EU
candidates, which all border Russia, have made joining the
15-member bloc a top foreign policy priority in the hopes of
tapping into lucrative markets and enhance national security.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has voiced opposition to the EU's eastward expansion but
says it would like more regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Latvia's ambassador to Denmark, Aivars Baumanis, said their
participation in the Baltic conference was a good start.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we are able to cooperate in this regional structure, it
shows that we can cooperate in the large structure of the EU,''
Baumanis said.
</P>
<P>
   Poland has said the EU enlargement process was moving too slowly
because of the large number of candidate countries. Nyrup
Rasmussen, whose country was playing host to the summit, promised
the complaint would be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Romano Prodi, president of the European Union's executive
Commission, reassured them that expansion was a priority but said
it would take time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want the enlargement as soon as possible,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Welcomes Chinese President  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Cementing ties forged in secret nearly two
decades ago, Chinese President Jiang Zemin is touring Israel on a
historic visit overshadowed only by U.S. pressure to cancel a
lucrative Israeli-Chinese arms deal.
</P>
<P>
   The high-profile recognition of Israel by one of the world's
major powers has Israel caught between its strongest ally and a
powerful new friend.
</P>
<P>
   Israel Prime Minister Ehud Barak welcomed Jiang on Wednesday,
less than 24 hours after meeting President Clinton at the White
House. Clinton urged the Israeli leader to cancel the planned sale
of a sophisticated airborne surveillance system to China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expressed deep displeasure and warned that the deal,
potentially worth $2 billion, could undermine Israel's standing in
the United States, said an Israeli official who attended Tuesday's
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   However, Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said
Israel was committed to selling at least one surveillance plane to
China, which reportedly has the option to order three to seven
more. Israeli officials have suggested that after the first plane
is delivered, the deal could be frozen indefinitely to appease the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sneh scoffed at U.S. complaints that the sale could upset the
military balance in Asia and pose a threat to Taiwan, a U.S. ally.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's arms sales to China date back to secret deals in the
early 1980s, well before the two countries established diplomatic
relations in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang, who is on a six-day trip, is the first Chinese president
to visit Israel.
</P>
<P>
   At a reception hosted by Israeli President Ezer Weizman, Jiang
said it was important to ''strengthen the historical friendship
between us ... and to promote friendly and mutually beneficial
cooperation in various fields between the two countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Jiang is particularly interested in Israeli agricultural
technology and will tour farms in southern Israel. He was to visit
Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial and parliament and meet
Barak later today.
</P>
<P>
   A planned visit to Israel Aircraft Industries, which is
outfitting a Soviet transport plane with the new surveillance
system, has reportedly been canceled to avoid drawing more
attention to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Barak faces a difficult dilemma over the sale.
</P>
<P>
   He needs Clinton's goodwill at a critical stage in the peace
talks with the Palestinians and for a planned Israeli withdrawal
from Lebanon, due by July.
</P>
<P>
   But with unemployment at a high, Barak also has to protect
Israel's defense industry, and China has emerged as a major client.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang said Wednesday that with the end of the Cold War,
superpowers no longer controlled world affairs -- a veiled
admonishment to the United States to stay out of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has become increasingly difficult,'' he said, ''for the
very few big powers or blocs of big powers to monopolize
international affairs and control the fate of other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said the dispute with the
United States was ''not a real crisis'' and would be resolved.

<HEADLINE> O'Neill Autopsy Results Published  </HEADLINE>
By JANET McCONNAUGHEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   The great dramatist Eugene O'Neill was as brilliant as ever
during the last decade of his life, but he couldn't write: Brain
cells controlling voluntary movement had withered away.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill had feared it was Parkinson's disease, but it was
instead a rare and little-understood brain illness. In today's New
England Journal of Medicine, scientists offer a detailed cellular
look at the damage and diagrams showing just where the brain
decayed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is by far a more detailed account than has been published
before,'' said Murray Biggs, a professor of English and theater
studies at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce Price, chief of neurology at Harvard-affiliated McLean
Hospital in Belmont, Mass., wrote the article with Dr. E.P.
Richardson Jr., who supervised O'Neill's autopsy in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright suffered from ''a very rare degenerative disease
of the cerebellum. Which luckily was not passed on. No other
O'Neill family member has this disease,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is called idiopathic cerebellar-cortical atrophy,
which means only a wasting of the brain of unknown cause.
</P>
<P>
   The true nature of O'Neill's disorder was first described by
Arthur and Barbara Gelb in their 1962 biography of the playwright.
</P>
<P>
   Gelb said he and his wife, who are revising and expanding the
biography from one volume to three, were given a copy of the
15-page autopsy report in 1960 by O'Neill's widow, Carlotta
O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were the only ones she gave that to. She handed it to me
personally,'' Gelb said. ''She said, 'I want you to have this for
your book, because you can't understand the tragedy of this man
unless you have the autopsy report.'''
</P>
<P>
   The report is also part of a 185-box O'Neill collection at Yale,
but was among papers kept private for 25 years at Mrs. O'Neill's
request. There have been no restrictions on their use since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Those papers are a big reason the Gelbs are rewriting their
biography. The first new volume is due out next month.
</P>
<P>
   Another biography, ''Eugene O'Neill: Beyond Mourning and
Tragedy,'' was published in November and also describes the
neurological disorder in some detail.
</P>
<P>
   Author Stephen Black of Simon Fraser University said he used the
typewritten autopsy report, interviews with medical experts and a
letter in which Mrs. O'Neill's psychiatrist explained the autopsy
report to her.
</P>
<P>
   Price said medical tradition requires doctors to keep an autopsy
report confidential unless the family agrees to publication, which
he got through actress Geraldine Chaplin, O'Neill's granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   That also meant he could use slides of O'Neill's brain tissue,
which are still at Massachusetts General Hospital, and reports of
neurological examinations during the last years of O'Neill's life.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill's doctors had told him he had Parkinson's disease, but
that diagnosis was refuted by the autopsy report.
</P>
<P>
   Price said he does not know what caused the disease. ''It was
apparently a random and very tragic mutation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the great advances in medicine since 1953, there
probably still would be no cure.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill ultimately died of pneumonia, probably brought on by
breathing in bits of food that he was unable to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could have prolonged his life. With good antibiotics and
pulmonary care, we probably could have been able to treat his
pneumonia,'' Price said. ''He might have had a little better
quality of life, a little more quantity, but ultimately he would
have died from it.''

<HEADLINE> Race May Affect Use of Clot-Busters  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Doctors are more likely to give clot-busting drugs to
whites
than to blacks who have heart attacks, according to a study in
today's New England Journal of Medicine.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The reasons are not clear but could include racial differences
in heart attack symptoms, researchers at the University of Alabama
at Birmingham said.
</P>
<P>
   They found that women are as likely as men of the same race to
get the drugs, which can clear blocked arteries quickly enough to
prevent damage to the heart.
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at the records of 26,575 Medicare patients who
met strict standards for getting the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 57 percent of the patients got clot-busters. They were
given to 59 percent of the white men, 56 percent of the white
women, 50 percent of the black men and 44 percent of the black
women. The differences between men and women of the same race
disappeared once doctors took into consideration patients' age,
medical history and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors' decisions ''as a result of clinical ambiguity, lack of
adequate training, insufficient knowledge, or physicians' own
preferences or biases'' may have contributed to that difference,
said Dr. John G. Canto, who led the study.
</P>
<P>
   But, he noted, other studies have found that blacks are less
likely than whites to have chest pain during heart attacks -- and
lack of chest pain is a major reason not to give clot-busters.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are racial differences in electrocardiograms,
which are used to confirm that a heart attack has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is considered abnormal in whites can often be within the
normal EKG reading range for blacks. Confirming that a heart attack
has occurred may be more difficult in blacks than whites because it
is harder to interpret the EKG findings,'' said Dr. Lynn Smaha,
president of the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   Smaha said heart attack symptoms also are different in women and
diabetics.
</P>
<P>
   ''The study highlights the importance of targeting our
diagnostic tests to specific patient populations so that we are not
missing opportunities to use these life-saving drugs,'' he said.
This may mean that we need to find better tests for diagnosing
heart disease, he said.

<HEADLINE> Stage Set for Run-Off Vote in Peru  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori fell just shy of
the majority needed to avoid a runoff for an unprecedented third
term, election officials said Wednesday, setting the stage for a
showdown with international economist Alejandro Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that after counting 97.68 percent of Sunday's
ballots, Fujimori had 49.84 percent compared to 40.31 percent for
Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Portillo, head of the office in charge of the count, said
the most Fujimori could be expected to win at this point was 49.89
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   A runoff election will be scheduled for late May or early June.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement set off large street celebrations by Toledo's
supporters in Peru's major cities.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Toledo's followers who were gathered in the Plaza
de San Martin in downtown Lima broke into wild cheers when they
heard the news. Toledo came out onto the balcony of a hotel
overlooking the square, waving a red and white Peruvian flag,
sending the crowd into a swell of excitement.
</P>
<P>
   As his followers chanted victory, Toledo's Belgian-born wife and
their 17-year-old daughter joined him on the hotel balcony to
acknowledge the crowd's cheers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you want a new president?'' a beaming Toledo shouted. The
crowd boomed back, ''Yes!''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the campaign and Sunday's vote, international
election monitors had sharply criticized Fujimori's government for
using dirty tricks and intimidation to ensure another five years in
power.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference later, Toledo urged Fujimori to run a
clean runoff election.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the second round we demand substantially different
conditions to compete than in the first round. The international
community is watching. The nation is watching,'' Toledo said,
flanked by his wife and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Clinton administration and Congress had
warned the 61-year-old leader that the United States would question
the legitimacy of the ballot if Fujimori won in a first round and
that Peru could face political and economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   As election officials announced the results Wednesday, Francisco
Tudela, Fujimori's vice presidential candidate and a former foreign
minister, complained bitterly about U.S. interference in the
election.
</P>
<P>
   He said he rejected in the ''most energetic terms the fact that
a foreign government would emit a judgment value about elections in
another country before the official count is in.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori is seeking a third five-year term, something that no
other Peruvian president has accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, opposition candidates accused Fujimori's
military intelligence service of using rock-throwing thugs to
disrupt political rallies, sponsoring lurid tabloid newspaper
attacks and blocking access to state-controlled television and
radio.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sunday's election, there have been increasing reports of
voting irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been innumerable accusations ... the most general
being the distribution of copies of pre-marked ballots,'' the
National Ombudsman Office said in a statement on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   European governments also put pressure on Fujimori to hold a
run-off.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have a lot of confidence in the voting process
either. It is clear that there has been a lot of irregularities
during the campaign and during the day of the vote,'' British
Ambassador Roger Hart said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although popular among Peru's poor for his social programs,
Fujimori's heavy-handed tactics have placed him at odds with many
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1992, Fujimori staged a ''self-coup'' in which he
shut down Congress and the courts, charging that they were
interfering with his efforts to fight leftist insurgencies and
implement free-market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the Fujimori-dominated Congress that was later
elected passed a law that tried to circumvent the constitution's
prohibition against a president seeking a third straight term. When
three members of a constitutional tribunal ruled the law was
unconstitutional, Fujimori had Congress fire them.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 3, Giants 2, Suspended, 5{  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The swirling winds may have been left
behind at Candlestick Park, but there's no stopping the rain.
</P>
<P>
   The first night game at Pacific Bell Park was interrupted by a
downpour Wednesday night, and it was suspended in the sixth inning
with the Los Angeles Dodgers leading the San Francisco Giants 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The teams will complete the game from the point it was stopped
on Thursday at 5:05 p.m. PDT. The Dodgers and Giants are scheduled
to play Thursday night at 7:35 p.m., or 30 minutes following the
completion of the suspended game.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Beltre's sacrifice fly in the top of the sixth put the
Dodgers ahead 3-2. The Giants were coming to bat in the bottom half
when it began to rain heavily, sending the sellout crowd
scrambling.
</P>
<P>
   Play was halted and a tarp was rolled out to cover the infield,
heralding the first weather delay at Pac Bell Park a day after its
grand opening Tuesday when the Dodgers beat the Giants 6-5. It was
suspended after a delay of one hour, 38 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had the bases loaded with none out in the second
after Shawn Green led off with a single and Eric Karros and Todd
Hundley walked, but Beltre hit into a double play, scoring one run.
Kevin Elster, greeted with boos in his first at bat after Tuesday's
three-homer effort, struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles went ahead 2-0 on Green's third inning sacrifice fly
before San Francisco evened the score, getting a home run from Rich
Aurilia leading off the third and scoring without benefit of a hit
in the fourth when Bill Mueller came around from second on first
baseman Karros' fielding error.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Dodgers pitcher Kevin Brown was placed on the 15-day
disabled list with a broken right pinkie finger and left-hander
Carlos Perez was recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque to fill his
roster spot. Perez is scheduled to start Thursday night's series
finale against the Giants in Pac Bell Park. ... Gary Sheffield
singled in the third inning to extend his hitting streak to eight
games. He also had a hit in each of the last six games of the 1999
season. ... Giants first baseman J.T. Snow was recognized for his
defensive excellence before the game, when he was presented with a
fifth straight Rawlings Gold Glove award. ... Left-hander Shawn
Estes, who began the season on the disabled list because of a sore
pitching shoulder, had a rehabilitation start for the Giants' Class
A affiliate in San Jose. He pitched seven innings against
Bakersfield on Wednesday night, allowing two hits and no runs while
striking out 11. The Giants could activate him later this week.

<HEADLINE> Senate passes treasurer reform bill  </HEADLINE>
By STRAT DOUTHAT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Faced with a veto threat from Gov. John
G. Rowland, the state Senate today unanimously approved an amended
reform measure designed to create more oversight of the tarnished
state treasurer's office.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, passed in the early hours of the morning, was changed
to give the state Ethics Commission a voice in determining who can
collect finder's fees for dealing with the treasurer and brokering
investments of state pension funds. It now goes back to the House,
which last week passed a controversial version opponents said was
so flawed it would not correct the problems that led to indictment
of former Treasurer Paul Silvester on corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   The governor had said he would veto the bill if it were not
corrected.
</P>
<P>
   The amended version contains provisions to create the position
of investment specialist in the treasurer's office and strengthen
oversight safeguards by the Investment Advisory Council.
</P>
<P>
   The bill outlaws the payment of finder's fees to anybody except
qualified financial counselors so designated by the treasurer in
consultation with ethics officials. It provides penalties for
anybody who violates the finder's fee provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bill addresses our concerns,'' said Alan Plofsky,
executive director of the state Ethics Commission. He had attacked
the House version, which would have permitted ''investment
professions'' to do business with the treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   Plofsky said the earlier bill was virtually worthless because
anybody could call himself an ''investment professional.'' The
amended bill is a great improvement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   State Treasurer Denise Nappier said she strongly supports the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''I encourage the governor to sign the bill,'' she said. ''It
puts the force of law behind administrative action I've already
taken, and strengthens oversight of the office.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, among other things, replaces the deputy treasurer with
a chief investment officer and prohibits the state treasurer, any
candidate for state treasurer or any member of the Investment
Advisory Council, from seeking campaign contributions from persons
connected to an investment company.
</P>
<P>
   The reform measure stems from last year's scandal surrounding
Silvester, a Rowland appointee who pleaded guilty in September to
charges of racketeering and money laundering related to
fund-raising in his failed 1998 campaign. He admitted accepting
kickbacks in the form of campaign donations from companies with
which he invested state pension money, and raising money for the
campaigns of others including the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, who has denied any knowledge of the fund-raising
illegalities, appointed Silvester after the former treasurer
resigned to go to work for an investment company that had done
business with the state.
</P>
<P>
   The reform bill requires the treasurer to wait at least one year
from the date a contract is negotiated before going to work for the
company, if the contract amounts to at least $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also restricts the governor's power to appoint someone
to fill a vacancy in the Treasurer's Office when the General
Assembly is not in session.

<HEADLINE> Prescient Canadian General Retires  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- There were the nightmares and flashbacks, visions
of mutilated, decaying corpses brought on by a smell or glance or
just the dark of night. More than once, Lt. Gen. Romeo Dallaire
contemplated suicide.
</P>
<P>
   For the commander of the U.N. Rwanda mission that became one of
the world body's biggest failures, the post-traumatic stress
syndrome he has suffered for more than two years finally became too
much.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Dallaire announced he was taking early retirement
next week, more than a year before he reaches the mandatory
retirement age of 55 for senior officers.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with Canadian media, the trim 53-year-old man said
psychological wounds from viewing the slaughter of 500,000 Rwandans
without being able to stop it forced him to give up a 35-year
military career.
</P>
<P>
   Now he hopes to conclude therapy and then teach, lecture and
write about his experiences. That includes telling his side of the
Rwanda story, something he has been unable to do because of
military restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I need to get that out,'' he said. ''Simply as part, I think,
of reasonable therapy. I think a lot of that will be useful to
people who command in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallaire went to Rwanda in 1993 as head of the more than
2,000-member peacekeeping force comprising some Canadian and
Belgian troops, along with African soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long to figure out the dynamics of a country
known for cycles of ethnic slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 11, 1994, he cabled his New York superiors a warning
that Hutu extremists were preparing plans to slaughter minority
Tutsis. According to an independent report on the U.N. role in
Rwanda, Dallaire's cable was never shown to the Security Council
and failed to receive the necessary attention.
</P>
<P>
   His request for more troops to try to stop the extremists from
arming their supporters were denied. When the plane carrying
Rwanda's Hutu president was shot down April 6, 1994, the planned
attacks on Tutsis and moderate Hutus began and Dallaire lacked the
manpower, firepower and mandate to try to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   He told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. on Wednesday of hearing
friends scream for help as he spoke to them by telephone. The
nightmares and flashbacks continue, he said, though he is working
in therapy on what triggers them.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's a certain smell or something that catches his
eye, he said. Asked if he ever contemplated suicide, he said yes,
''a couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Long after the genocide, the Belgian Senate accused him of
negligence in the death of 10 Belgian soldiers under his command
who were massacred on April 7 after he assigned them to guard the
Rwandan prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Dallaire said the true blame lay with some of the powerful
countries in the United Nations that were unwilling to face the
political price of losing troops to try to stop the Rwandan
carnage. He refused to name countries.
</P>
<P>
   Dallaire has been on medical leave since 1998. He had been
serving as an associate defense minister in charge of military
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   He has championed the cause of soldiers suffering psychological
effects from service abroad. He said Wednesday that soldiers
exposed to combat must be watched for years after they come home
because reactions can be delayed or repressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my case, I finally broke four years after the event,'' he
said. ''I couldn't take it any more.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what he thinks of himself, others consider him a
Canadian hero.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Art Eggleton said Dallaire left an indelible
''mark of dedication and duty to this country and the Canadian
Forces.'' He added: ''Rwanda has left a mark on him and on his
life.''

<HEADLINE> Inventors' Fair Shows Bright Ideas  </HEADLINE>
By NAOMI KOPPEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- It's those everyday domestic annoyances that
really get the imagination working.
</P>
<P>
   How do you remove spiders from the house without killing them?
How do you roll pastry without it getting stuck to the rolling pin?
What if the baby keeps dropping the bottle?
</P>
<P>
   Never fear. Nearly 700 inventors from 44 countries are in Geneva
to show off creations aiming to solve these problems and hundreds
like them.
</P>
<P>
   The International Exhibition of Inventions, New Techniques and
Products of Geneva mixes serious business inventions in areas such
as architecture, furniture, engineering and computer science with a
stunning number of new developments in areas such as toothbrush
design.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular exhibits was created by Irishman Tony
Allen, who was tired of climbing all over the furniture to remove
spiders in the bedroom of his 12-year-old son, Robert, who is
scared of spiders.
</P>
<P>
   Allen got to work in his tool shed and came up with a mechanical
brush on a long handle that captures spiders between the bristles
without hurting them. His invention has been so successful that he
is now marketing it full-time. For $19 buyers also get a plastic
practice spider.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got great public interest because people don't want to kill
spiders. And it means Robert can pick up his own spiders now,''
said Allen, who added that he had not managed to get anybody quite
so interested in his latest invention -- the ''scoopabag'' for
removing dog mess.
</P>
<P>
   For babies who only drink when it suits them, try the ''Flying
Bottle'' -- suspended above the crib so it is always available but
doesn't drip. And don't forget to dress the baby in a paper diaper,
put it in a stroller that goes up and down stairs and put it to
sleep with the aid of a motorized rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated at the way the pastry kept sticking to her rolling
pin, Yvonne Bekker from South Africa came up with a perforated
rolling pin that lets out a constant trickle of flour.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's often women who come up with things like this. We've just
patented it and we'll see how it goes,'' said Bekker, who is also
displaying a double-sided cleaning glove.
</P>
<P>
   From the evergreen forests of Norway comes a novel device that
its inventor says is already a hit on a test run even though it
only gets used once a year.
</P>
<P>
   Alf Aarthun invented the ''Super Grip'' -- a spring-loaded
Christmas tree stand that sells for $35.
</P>
<P>
   ''We took 2,000 of them to a small town in Norway and we were
sold out in a week. And over 100 million Christmas trees are sold
in Europe every year,'' Aarthun said.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which runs until Sunday, is expected to attract about
65,000 visitors. The prize for the best invention will be awarded
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The event is also about marketing opportunities. Last year,
licenses were negotiated worldwide for more than $35 million during
the event.
</P>
<P>
   But though many inventors have their ideas picked up and put
into production, some find that what they think is a brilliant idea
has little commercial appeal.
</P>
<P>
   German Helmut Buchmann was showing off his non-slip toothbrush
glass, which has slots to hold the brush in place while the
toothpaste is added.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's interesting for old people and for young
children, and even for those who have only one arm,'' Buchmann
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the big firms aren't interested because they have their
own laboratories, and they aren't interested in talking with a
private person.''

<HEADLINE> Expectation Shadows Gen. Powell  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Even while 20,000 feet in the air, Colin
Powell has his heels dug in deep on the questions he's been asked
about a million times.
</P>
<P>
   No, he's still not looking for any elected office.
</P>
<P>
   No, even if George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican
presidential nominee, got down on his hands and knees, he wouldn't
sign on as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   And no, he's not campaigning for a Cabinet post in a Bush
administration, although he would listen if such a job was offered.
</P>
<P>
   The former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff put it this way
Wednesday: ''I'm not looking for a job. I'm very happy with the
work I'm doing. But when a president or a president-elect asks you
about it, you have to think about it. And I have never excluded
going back into government.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Powell says, he is fulfilled leading the charge for
the nation's youth while heading up America's Promise: The Alliance
for Youth. It is an organization that for nearly three years has
been encouraging volunteerism and mentoring.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been in the vineyards planting the vines and we now see
them bearing fruit,'' Powell said in an interview with The
Associated Press en route to a North Carolina event for America's
Promise.
</P>
<P>
   The plum of this trip was getting the signature of North
Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt on an agreement that commits Hunt's support
to America's Promise's goals.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement, signed during a rally at a Greensboro
shopping mall, Hunt issued an executive order giving state
employees paid time off to mentor children.
</P>
<P>
   For Powell, the goal is to get more than money from
corporations. The former Army general wants their souls.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's easy to write an oversized check and say, 'We've done our
part.' But we go to the company's chairman and president to get
them to invest in their own futures. It's more than volunteering.
What they do is in their self-interest,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   America's Promise is centered on five guiding principles --
pairing children with caring adults, providing safe haven for kids,
giving children proper nutrition, teaching marketable skills and
providing community service.
</P>
<P>
   At a roundtable of community and corporate leaders, Powell
drinks in the message from representatives from companies like
First Union Bank, the Pepsi Bottling Co. and General Electric -- a
pledge to give employees paid leave to volunteer time at local
schools and community facilities.
</P>
<P>
   At the mall, Powell tells a cheering crowd, ''The children of
today have enemies in their lives - drugs, crime, violence and
dispair. We have to step forward and be mentors.''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how many times Powell expresses his passion for
helping children or his aversion to the prospect of nonstop
political fund-raising and the other confines of seeking elected
office, the general knows another question about his nonexistent
political ambitions is just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ten years ago, I was a lieutenant general who was dragged into
the White House. Before I knew what happened, I was chairman'' of
the Joint Chiefs, Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you turned back the clock 12 years and gave me back the
anonymity I had, it wouldn't bother me in the least. At least I
could go to garage sales again.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell said that while he has no interest in either the
presidency or vice presidency, he believes American voters could
look beyond its racially divided past and unite behind a black
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the country is ready,'' he said. ''When I considered
running (for president) in 1995, I had to talk to America and I
concluded the country had changed to a point where it would be
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he added, ''the country has matured.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Is there anybody else the party would rather see there than
Colin Powell?'' gushed Mary Matalin, conservative television
commentator. ''The party would love him to grab the vice
presidential slot.''
</P>
<P>
   Matalin agreed with Powell that Americans wouldn't have a
problem for a presidential ticket that included a black man.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see any risk for the party. Ask people what they want
in leaders today as a backlash to what's been happening and they
say leadership, character, patriotism -- everything Colin Powell
embodies. It's not a color thing that would decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunt, a Democrat, concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a military man who has commanded troops, he now is
mobilizing people nationwide to give back to their communities. He
stands for all the right things,'' Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the adulation from both sides of the political
spectrum, Powell said his mind is made up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no interest in being vice president. I'm not being coy
or cute. ... I admire people who seek political office but you need
to have a certain type of passion for that.
</P>
<P>
   ''If any president or elected official asks you to serve, you've
got to listen to that request. I'm not ruling anything like that
out but I'm not ruling it in either.''

<HEADLINE> Mich. Co. Takes on Sugar Industry  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Behind closed doors on Capitol Hill, the
powerful sugar industry is waging a battle against a tiny
60-employee company that imports Canadian molasses syrup without
paying the tariffs that prop up U.S. sugar prices.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lobbying battle reminiscent of David and Goliath -- except
that the little guy has skipped the slingshot and armed himself
with some of the favorite weapons of the industry giants.
</P>
<P>
   Heartland By-Products of Taylor, Mich., has enlisted one of the
city's most influential lobbyists and also hired a public relations
firm with a partner who is working for Al Gore's presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The company already has scored one victory in court. Now the big
sugar companies are turning to Congress, where their six-figure
political donations have earned them plenty of friends.
</P>
<P>
   The multibillion-dollar industry says Heartland is jeopardizing
the price support system by bypassing the tariffs. The company,
which does just $35 million a year in business, counters it will be
forced to close if lawmakers act against it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's morally incorrect for Congress to pick on a single
company and pass a bill to put it out of business,'' declared
Heartland's president, Gregory Kozak.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether Heartland and its 60 employees can continue
to import a sugar/molasses syrup from Canada without paying the
higher duties levied against foreign sugars.
</P>
<P>
   The tariffs are part of a government-imposed import quota system
designed to prop up the price of U.S.-grown sugar.
</P>
<P>
   The industry and its allies in Congress -- many from
sugar-producing states -- have fought hard to rub out any threat to
the current system that might allow foreign sugar, which sells for
a third of the U.S. price, to gain a bigger foothold in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The industry struck first and lost. Now industry supporters are
trying to use legislation pending in Congress to promote free trade
with Africa and the Caribbean to win the battle.
</P>
<P>
   They want to insert a provision that overturns a ruling last
fall by the U.S. Court of International Trade that Heartland did
not have to pay sugar tariffs on the imported Canadian molasses.
</P>
<P>
   The company uses the syrup to produce a sugary product sold to
manufacturers of cereal, hard candy and dairy products such as ice
cream.
</P>
<P>
   The sugar provision isn't mentioned in either the House or
Senate version of the bill, but Sen. John Breaux, a Democrat who
represents the sugar-producing state of Louisiana, is seeking to
add it.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has plenty of friends on Capitol Hill -- it
contributed more than $1 million to congressional candidates and
the political parties last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, Heartland made just $300 in donations when Kozak
wrote a check to his local congressman, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The industry supporters say the battle isn't about donations,
but rather about preserving a quota system that keeps American
sugar growers profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Heartland is ''smuggling sugar into the country in the form of
molasses,'' Breaux said.
</P>
<P>
   Heartland has hired the high-powered firm of Mayer, Brown &AMP;
Platt to try to kill Breaux's proposal. The lobbying firm has
counted such major corporations as Boeing, General Electric and RJR
Nabisco among its clients.
</P>
<P>
   Heartland also has some public relations help from BSMG
Worldwide, whose partners include Carter Eskew, a key strategist to
Gore. Eskew has taken a leave of absence as partner but has
continued as a paid consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The company went to court after the U.S. Customs Service in
September revoked its 1995 decision that allowed Heartland to
import the sugar syrup without paying the higher tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   Customs acted after 26 senators -- including Breaux and both of
Michigan's senators, Democrat Carl Levin and Republican Spence
Abraham -- wrote a letter to Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly
urging the department to overturn its earlier ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was written in support of a petition filed by two
trade groups, including the U.S. Beet Sugar Association.
</P>
<P>
   The 26 senators who signed the letter received $528,332 in
contributions from the industry between 1995 and 2000, according to
the Center for Responsive Politics, which studies political
donations.

<HEADLINE> America's museums promise to step up search for Holocaust art  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It was a fine 16th century painting of the
Virgin Mary and Jesus that graced a wall in the Vienna home of
Philipp von Gomperz before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Nazis marched in and seized the work. A photograph of
it was taken for Adolph Hitler's review.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a half century later, ''Madonna and Child in a
Landscape'' by Lucas Cranach appeared on the Internet, as part of
the collection of the North Carolina Museum of Art. And on Feb. 3,
2000, after negotiations, the work was relinquished to two sisters
who are the sole heirs of the Gomperz family.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Wheeler, director of the North Carolina museum, was one
of four heads of major U.S. museums who testified Wednesday before
the Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets. The
commission acts as a national body examining what stolen war-era
assets exist in the United States and oversees the research to
identify them.
</P>
<P>
   Also testifying at the hearing of the commission's Committee on
Art and Cultural Property were directors Philippe de Montebello of
New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, Glenn Lowry of the Museum of
Modern Art in Manhattan and Malcolm Rogers of the Boston Museum of
Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   The four museums own many of the 20,000 European artworks in
America, some of which ''might be possibly suspect,'' said Wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   The directors pledged to the commission to step up their efforts
to solve an artistic Holocaust mystery: finding any Nazi-looted art
that might now be owned by American museums.
</P>
<P>
   ''The burden of research is absolutely enormous. But this is a
national priority,'' said Rogers,
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, his Boston museum posted seven European
paintings on its Web site, asking the public for help in tracing
their history.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a flashpoint when works of art become visible,'' said
MOMA's Lowry. ''And we intend to continue drilling away.''
</P>
<P>
   Montebello's Metropolitan Museum is now researching almost 400
of its pieces to make sure they are not on the Nazi-plundered trail
that stretches back a half century to art that once adorned pre-war
European homes.
</P>
<P>
   However, because there are often gaps in a piece's history,
Montebello added, ''there is a great deal of serendipity.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowry said he hoped the research would be done with the direct
help of claimants, rather than through lawsuits. In September, a
U.S. magistrate barred the return to Austria of an Egon Schiele
painting on loan to MOMA that may have been stolen by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, several works in U.S. museums have been proven
to belong to Holocaust heirs, though Lowry said he did not believe
the number of looted works in American collections was ''vast.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Stuart Eizenstat, a
commission member, said that in addition to art held by U.S.
museums, any research should take into account works owned or sold
by private dealers and auction houses. Christie's and Sotheby's
both have participated in identifying Nazi-linked art.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman William Singer presided over the hearing held
Wednesday at the headquarters of the New York Bar Association in
midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the presidential commission's role is to oversee
research on assets and organize a central database of artworks,
rather than to seek restitution.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the committee also focused on lesser-known art,
books and religious items that comprise Jewish cultural property
stolen during the wartime era.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Trust in Government Higher  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ask people how they feel about ''the federal
government'' and they're likely to give a cool response, but ask
how they feel about a specific agency and they probably will offer
a more favorable view.
</P>
<P>
   What people think of specific agencies also depends on who you
ask. Some who benefit from the agency's work may say government
workers are doing a great job, while others may see the agency's
duties in a less favorable light.
</P>
<P>
   An example is the Internal Revenue Service. While six of 10
professional tax preparers view the agency in a positive light,
taxpayers and business tax officers had generally negative views of
the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no way a lot of smiling, courteous IRS employees are
going to make tax collection popular,'' said Paul Light, an expert
on government reform and director of governmental studies at the
Brookings Institution. ''But there's actually good news in this
poll about the IRS. People think highly of the employees. They
think they're professional. They just don't happen to like the
product.''
</P>
<P>
   Most agencies are viewed differently by different sets of their
customers, according to the poll by the Pew Research Center for the
People &AMP; the Press.
</P>
<P>
   Four of five environmental advocates have a favorable view of
the Environmental Protection Agency, and two-thirds of the public
felt that way, but only half of the business regulatory officers
polled felt positively about the agency.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Social Security Administration, three-fourths of
recipients of benefits had a positive view of the agency compared
with just over half of the payroll taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Depending on your relationship with the agency, it can make a
difference in how you evaluate it,'' said Mary McIntosh, a
Princeton Survey Research Associates analyst who directed the
study. ''Favorable feelings about an agency vary according to how
much people support or oppose the mission of that agency. It really
does depend on who you ask.''
</P>
<P>
   McIntosh said the tendency is to assume that the generally
unfavorable feelings people have about government as a whole spill
over to individual agencies, but the poll indicates otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration was seen favorably by more than
four of five medical professionals, business regulatory officials,
advocates and the chronically ill.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration was viewed positively by
four of five frequent fliers and two-thirds of pilots, but only six
of 10 air traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
   A separate Pew poll taken in February showed that four of 10
people said they trusted the federal government just about always
or most of the time, compared with only about one-fourth of the
public who felt that way in November 1998, at the height of the
Monica Lewinsky scandal and impeachment drama.
</P>
<P>
   ''A person's overall trust in government is usually related to
how the economy is doing, how they feel about Bill Clinton, how
they feel about campaign corruption,'' Light said. ''They generally
are much more trusting of their mailman, more favorable toward the
person who answers the phone at Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Majorities of every group polled said employees of the five
agencies were courteous.
</P>
<P>
   The pollsters surveyed 3,147 people between mid-January and
mid-March with error margins ranging from plus or minus 4
percentage points for the 641 individual taxpayers to larger error
margins for smaller samples, such as those who receive Social
Security benefits.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Russian Tanker Had Iraqi Oil  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tests of oil samples taken from a Russian
tanker suspected of violating the U.N. embargo on Iraq show that it
was loaded with petroleum products derived from both Iranian and
Iraqi crude, two senior defense officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the oil was of Iranian origin, the officials said
Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the ship's cargo contained a mixture of Iranian
and Iraqi oil complicates the decision on what to do with the
Russian tanker, which has been detained in international waters but
has not been diverted.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian-flagged Akademik Pustovoit was detained by U.S.
naval forces in the Persian Gulf last Wednesday, prompting the
Russian government to demand that it be released. The oil giant
Royal Dutch-Shell Group has insisted that the Russian tanker was
carrying oil for Royal Dutch and that it came from Iran.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials so far have not offered any proof that the tanker
had loaded its oil at an Iraqi terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials charged that the tanker had been boarded and
searched only because it was Russian.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the U.S. navy intercepted another Russian tanker,
the Volga-Neft-147, in the Persian Gulf and concluded several days
later, after testing samples of the ship's oil, that it was
carrying Iraqi crude in violation of the U.N. embargo, which has
been in place since the Iraqi army invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   An international maritime force led by the U.S. Navy regularly
monitors the Gulf for illegal shipments of Iraqi crude.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Joe LaMarca, spokesman at U.S. Central Command headquarters
in Tampa, Fla., said Wednesday that analysis of the oil samples
from the Akademik Pustovoit was not yet complete. ''There still has
been no decision to divert the ship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One American official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that a British-flagged ship was boarded in the Persian Gulf the
same day the Akademik Pustovoit was searched. The British ship was
found to have petroleum products of Iraqi origin but was allowed to
proceed with nothing more than a warning.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon on Tuesday, spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley
told reporters that the U.S. government was confident it would be
proven correct in its suspicion that the Russian tanker was
carrying Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think the cargo tests ... will provide convincing evidence
of the petroleum products' origin,'' he said. Quigley said U.S.
Navy suspicions about the Russian tanker were based on more than
verbal exchanges with the ship's captain. He said there were
''other sources'' involved but he would not identify them.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen was asked about the situation on
Monday during a visit to Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates.
Cohen said Iraq has been smuggling increasing amounts of oil this
year as the international price has risen, and that Iran has helped
by allowing ships bearing Iraqi oil to enter its territorial waters
and offload the oil onto other ships -- a procedure that nets Iran
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ''So it's clear that this has been going on,'' Cohen said. ''I
indicated that Iran has been benefiting at least to the tune of
$500 million annually. (Iraq) may be accumulating as much as $1
billion annually through this illegal smuggling.''

<HEADLINE> FCC Considers Rules To Help Deaf  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four years ago, as his neighbors in
Greenville, N.C., took shelter from the howling winds of Hurricane
Fran, Kevin Earp slept quietly in his bed.
</P>
<P>
   He had no idea he was in danger. He's deaf, and the local
television stations didn't provide closed captioning for the
weather broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever an anchor would come on during the programs, he would
be talking, yet there would be no captions,'' Earp later wrote to
the Federal Communications Commission. ''I did not really know due
to not being able to comprehend what the TV station meteorologists
were talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   He survived, but Earp's town was part of the region later
declared a federal disaster area.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC is scheduled to vote today on rules that, if accepted,
would ensure emergency information is accessible to people like
Earp who have hearing disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rule, which is expected to pass, would require
broadcasters to deliver information to people with disabilities
that threatens life, health, safety and property. That can be
accomplished through real-time closed captioning, open captioning,
scrolling words or some other means.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will save lives. It's as simple as that,'' FCC Commissioner
William Kennard said in an interview Wednesday. ''We have many,
many stories of people who, for lack of this information, have
nearly lost there lives. Imagine if there's a flood, a fire, or an
earthquake, and everyone else is evacuating and you have no idea.
This is really a matter of life and death for millions of
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   FCC staff members said they were unaware of any deaths because
of a lack of closed captioning, although they didn't rule it out.
</P>
<P>
   Some broadcasters argued against live-captioning mandates,
saying some stations might shy away from comprehensive disaster
coverage if they were required to provide closed captioning for
everything.
</P>
<P>
   Although broadcasters will be allowed to deliver the information
in a variety of ways besides closed captioning, the FCC is expected
to require them to provide critical information like evacuation
routes and the location of shelters.
</P>
<P>
   If passed, the new rule would become effective in about 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Closed captioning is a form of technology like subtitles that
allows people who are deaf or hard of hearing to watch television.
But unlike subtitles, closed captioning is hidden as encoded data
transmitted in the television signal and provides information about
sound effects and background noise. A person who wants to see
closed captions must have a decoder.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the commission ordered TV broadcasters to provide the
service on 100 percent of new programs by the year 2006, with a few
exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the commission has instituted an incremental
transition period. Under the rules, 1,800 hours of new programming
must be closed captioned on each channel this year, 3,600 hours in
the year 2002, and 54,000 hours in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Also under the rules, 75 percent of the old programs -- those in
existence before 1998 -- must be closed captioned by 2008.

<HEADLINE> Serial Killing Jolts Pakistan  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) -- Clutching his splintered cricket bat,
9-year-old Zishan Khan stared fearfully at the simple wooden door
that opened to a house of horrors, where 100 children were lured to
their deaths with promises of food and a warm bed.
</P>
<P>
   While the neighborhood slept, Javed Iqbal led homeless children
by the hand to the dank, three-room cement home -- where he sexually
abused them, strangled them and dissolved their bodies in a vat of
acid.
</P>
<P>
   Looking down at his dirt-caked plastic sandals, Zishan tapped
the cracked cement laneway with his cricket bat. ''I never knew,''
he whispered. ''I didn't know what was going on inside there.''
</P>
<P>
   The revelation of Iqbal's horrific crimes, committed with two
teen-age accomplices, jolted human rights groups in Pakistan to the
plight of street children, estimated to number in the millions.
</P>
<P>
   It ''brought home with a bang how limited society's safeguards
for the children were and with what gruesome consequences,'' the
Human Rights Commission of Pakistan wrote in its annual report.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnapping and rape of children is one of the most common
crimes in Pakistan, involving an average of one young girl a day,
the commission reported.
</P>
<P>
   The details of Iqbal's killing spree first emerged in a letter
he wrote to the police late last year. That led authorities to his
house, where they found the remains of two bodies in a vat of acid,
a pile of children's clothes and the photographs of 100 children --
the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, Iqbal turned himself in. He was tried, convicted
and sentenced to die as his victims had -- strangled, his body cut
into 100 pieces and dissolved in acid.
</P>
<P>
   Area resident Abdul Jabbar said Iqbal did not target
neighborhood children who lived at home with their parents -- he
sought out the street children.
</P>
<P>
   Children like 9-year-old Adil Riaz.
</P>
<P>
   Adil, who has never gone to school, has been working in a
mechanic's shop for two years now. His mother is a widow who needs
the 50 cents a day he makes working 10 hours to help feed his five
brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he said, he sleeps on the street outside the shop,
not far from Iqbal's house. He smiled shyly when asked if he is
afraid at night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mostly I'm just tired. Every day I'm just tired,'' he said,
rubbing his oil-blackened hands. His tiny fingernails are jagged
and filled with built-up grease.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty is what drives many of the children from their homes.
And with no family nearby or homeless shelters available, they
become easy targets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because they are so poor, families, particularly those with
many children, have been unable to keep track of every child and
some need their children to support them,'' said Afrasiab Khattak,
chairman of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets, gangs thrive on them.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are certain mafias who take the children on the street
and exploit them,'' Khattak said. ''They are the mafias who run
begging rings, child prostitution rings.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sheikhupura, in Punjab province, a gang that kidnapped young
children would break their legs or arms and let the bones reset
crooked, then send them into the streets to beg.
</P>
<P>
   Another gang was traced to Multan, also in Punjab province, the
human rights report said. That group kidnapped boys between 10 and
14 years old, castrated them and then sold them to the circus and
for stage shows.
</P>
<P>
   Khattak said the heart of the problem is mixed-up priorities
that allocate nearly 70 percent of Pakistan's annual $14 billion
budget on defense and debt servicing and barely 4 percent on social
services.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the problem is an ill-equipped and inept police force
that rarely investigated reports of missing children.
</P>
<P>
   Iqbal's neighbor, Jabbar, said that before Iqbal wrote his
letter he went to the police station to report his crimes, but was
sent away. It took two weeks before police investigated Iqbal's
house after receiving information about the crimes committed there,
Jabbar said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police never took it seriously,'' he said. ''Police
thought it was a joke and that he was a mental patient. He told the
police 'I have killed these children,' and the police said, 'come
back in the morning.'''
</P>
<P>
   In late December, after the extent of Iqbal's crimes was known,
the Punjab police chief distributed a memo to officers throughout
the province saying ''reports of missing children should not now be
taken lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The government should open a center for children on the street
and find their parents,'' Jabbar said.
</P>
<P>
   Khattak said in some cities the social services department has
begun trying to document the street children, rather than simply
ignore them. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has begun a
survey to determine how many street children there are, the
problems they face and what they need.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the children in the neighborhood are still
having nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   Zishan, who lives in the same alleyway as Iqbal, now refuses to
walk to school alone.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the dark, I worry about bad spirits from there,'' he said.
''I am afraid they will come and eat me.''

Reno Orders Elian Transfer
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno ordered Elian
Gonzalez's Miami relatives to bring the 6-year-old boy to an airport Thursday
afternoon so he could be taken to a reunion with his father in Washington. Reno
delivered the ultimatum after taking the extraordinary step Wednesday of coming
to Miami to meet for 2{ hours with the Cuban boy's relatives. She failed to
persuade them to end the wrenching 4{-month custody struggle, and Elian's
great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, defiantly said late Wednesday he would not
relinquish custody of the boy.

S.C. Moves To Remove Flag
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- South Carolina state senators on Wednesday endorsed a
bill to remove the Confederate flag from atop the Statehouse dome. Opponents say
the banner is racist but supporters insist it's a symbol of Southern heritage.
The bill would remove the banner from the dome and place a similar battle flag
behind an existing monument honoring Confederate soldiers on Statehouse grounds.
The flag would fly on the north side of the Statehouse from a pole no taller
than 20 feet. That element was added to satisfy black lawmakers and other flag
opponents who did not want the flag in a prominent position to passers-by.

Jury Rejects Sheppard Son's Claim

<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- A jury on Wednesday unanimously rejected the claim of Dr.
Sam Sheppard's son that his father was wrongfully imprisoned for his mother's
1954 slaying, ending another chapter in the sensational case that inspired ''The
Fugitive'' television series. The eight-member jury in Cuyahoga County Common
Pleas Court did not find Dr. Sheppard guilty of murder -- that wasn't the
question before it. Rather, the decision means the couple's son, Sam Reese
Sheppard, failed to meet the burden of proof in his wrongful imprisonment civil
lawsuit against the state of Ohio. To win, Sheppard needed to convince jurors
the majority of evidence showed his father, who died in 1970, was innocent.

<HEADLINE> Judge orders financial adviser to the stars held without bail fortrial  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A financial adviser to young celebrities was
sent to prison to await trial when a judge concluded he was a
flight risk after he was found at an airport with an expired
passport, a bag of cash and $44,000 in airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney David Lewis called 37-year-old Dana
Giacchetto's behavior ''absolutely extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Giacchetto, 37, was arrested shortly before 2 a.m. Wednesday at
Newark International Airport in New Jersey, as he returned from Las
Vegas with federal agents closing in on him.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said the government had alerted the FBI in Honolulu, Las
Vegas and Los Angeles to track Giacchetto down after learning he
had purchased more than $16,000 in plane tickets Sunday to various
worldwide destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Giacchetto was tapping funds ordered frozen by a federal judge
after he was charged with swindling his clients out of millions of
dollars while managing their money and attending their swanky
parties, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate Judge James C. Francis said Giacchetto was a
''substantial risk of flight'' and revoked his $1 million bail,
ordering him held in prison until trial.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said Giacchetto, whose clients included Leonardo DiCaprio,
Ben Stiller and Courtney Cox Arquette, was arrested because he
violated bail conditions, failing to get approval to fly to Las
Vegas on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor said what federal investigators found on
Giacchetto was ''quite extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendant was carrying more than $4,000 in cash in small
bills, largely $5 and $10 bills, along with $44,000 in unused plane
tickets, most of them first class, to destinations around the
world, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giacchetto also carried a seven-coupon plane ticket he had
purchased Sunday to Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Honolulu,
Tokyo, Singapore and Frankfurt, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also had two tickets to Rome in his own and his girlfriend's
names, Lewis added.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also found a mutilated 1986 passport missing a
page, which would have shown it had expired, and with a bogus
expiration date added on another page, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As another argument for revoking bail, Lewis said the criminal
case ''is extremely strong that Mr. Giacchetto was engaged in a
wholesale looting of clients' accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Levander, Giacchetto's lawyer, said his client was not
trying to flee the country and was merely using the expired
passport as identification because he needed a picture
identification card to travel on a plane.
</P>
<P>
   He said the tickets to Rome had been bought so he could propose
to his girlfriend in a romantic setting.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, accusing prosecutors of overreacting, said his
client earlier this week ''was shocked to find out he was wanted
and immediately came back.''
</P>
<P>
   The government alleges Giacchetto stole as much as $5 million
from the band Phish and its members and a million dollars more from
others while misappropriating as much as $20 million entrusted to
him.
</P>
<P>
   He also was accused of issuing fake portfolio statements and
other false documents to clients who wanted proof of their
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Giacchetto is charged with securities fraud and with making
false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission. If
convicted, he could face a decade in prison and $12 million in
fines.
</P>
<P>
   He allegedly committed the crimes while serving celebrities
including Matt Damon, Cameron Diaz and singer Alanis Morrisette
through an investment business, The Cassandra Group, run from a
SoHo loft.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Energy Bill for Northeast  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Northeast would be able to create a 2
million barrel home heating oil reserve to help it avoid sharp
upswings in prices under energy legislation that has cleared the
House.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which passed 416-8 Wednesday, also gives the
government a way to keep small-scale oil drillers economically
afloat during periods when oil prices drop too low to make
production viable.
</P>
<P>
   The two provisions were part of a larger bill that renews the
president's authority, during an energy crisis, to withdraw oil
from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a 600 million barrel
stockpile in Texas and Louisiana set aside by law for emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has acted to restore that authority, which expired
when the House failed to act by March 31. The bill now goes back to
the Senate for final approval.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress earlier this year urged President
Clinton to tap the reserve to counter production cutbacks by the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that earlier in
the year sent oil prices soaring in this country. OPEC has since
increased production and administration officials have said they
have no intention of using the emergency oil to manipulate prices.
</P>
<P>
   The reserve was established in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo
to counter oil supply interruptions, but has been used only once,
by President Bush during the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The House also amended the legislation to give the energy
secretary the discretion to purchase oil at $15 a barrel from
small-scale stripper wells when world oil prices drop below that
level. Oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve must now be purchased
from foreign sources, and the average cost of oil in the reserve
today is $27 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, chairman of the House Commerce energy
subcommittee, said that if the provision had been in effect two
years ago, when low prices were driving many small drillers out of
business, the nation today might have up to 1 million barrels a day
more in production.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., who led efforts to create the
Northeast reserve, said it would ''give the president the
flexibility that he needs to release the heating oil from the
reserve in the event we have a repetition of the type of severe
price spikes or severe weather situations that we saw last
winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bernard Sanders, an independent from Vermont who also
pushed for the reserve, called it ''a major step forward in our
efforts to make sure that people are not forced to suffer through
large swings in heating oil prices during the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Another New England Democrat, Rep. Robert Weygand of Rhode
Island, said home heating oil in his state jumped from 99 cents to
$2.05 a gallon in a matter of weeks last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Home heating oil inventory in the Northeast went from 4 million
barrels in 1991 to 17 million barrels last year and then back to
4.5 million barrels this year, Weygand said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight Republicans voted against the bill -- John Duncan of
Tennessee, John Hostettler of Indiana, Ron Paul of Texas, Ed Royce
of California, Mark Sanford of South Carolina, James Sensenbrenner
of Wisconsin and Pat Toomey and Joseph Pitts of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>

   The bill number is H.R. 2884.

Hometown Exhibit on Elian   
By JAMES ANDERSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARDENAS, Cuba (AP) -- It began with the poems, letters and signs
deposited on the museum steps: Discarded tributes to Elian
Gonzalez. The donations kept coming -- and Elian's plight became a
national cause -- so the museum set up an exhibit for the child
hero.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, when it's all over, the exhibit will be stowed away,
its artifacts another chapter in Cuba's tumultuous history with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he returns, all this will be taken down and will go into
the Elian collection,'' said Raul Raventos, an aide at the Oscar
Maria de Rojas Museum in Elian's rural hometown of Cardenas, about
90 miles east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   A mandatory stop for visiting dignitaries and journalists as
well as Cardenas residents, the exhibit chronicles Juan Miguel
Gonzalez's fight to regain custody of his son. It also shows
mementos of a simple past that was shattered when Elian left Cuba
with his mother and others in an illegal attempt to reach Florida.
Eleven people, including his mother, were killed when their boat
sank.
</P>
<P>
   There are photos of the smiling child at the nearby resort of
Varadero Beach, images of Elian in Miami captured by newspaper
photographers and CNN, letters from classmates, signed tributes by
the Mothers and Grandmothers of Cardenas. There are children's
marbles games and photos of Fidel Castro surrounded by residents,
letters from Gonzalez demanding justice for his son.
</P>
<P>
   And then here's the pinata -- ''a symbolic pinata,'' Raventos
says -- bearing a portrait of Mickey Mouse, a not-so-oblique
reference to Elian's much-publicized visit to Walt Disney World and
Cubans' anger at what they call the 6-year-old boy's
commercialization.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the pinata, traditionally loaded with goodies
for children, is empty. ''We'll fill it when he comes,'' Raventos
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On a wall, local artists painted a mural depicting the Caribbean
island of Cuba as a brilliantly colored garden -- and a hand,
unmistakably Uncle Sam's, plucking a prized flower: Elian.
Schoolchildren's wooden desks occupy much of the room.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Raventos hopes, the exhibit will be dismantled -- perhaps
shrunken to lesser spaces in the colonial structure, one of Cuba's
first museums. It houses Chinese and French porcelain vases, oil
portraits of Spanish Queen Isabella II, Masonic Lodge medals,
exotic butterflies, firearms used by rebels fighting the Spanish
occupation in the 19th century, an elaborate horse-drawn funeral
hearse from times past.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the curious tour Elian's exhibit, inspecting each
photo, each poem. One, penned by sixth-grader Daneysis Leon Garcia
of the 13th of May School, reads:
</P>
<P>
   ''Elian, trust in your fatherland
</P>
<P>
   In those of us who are here
</P>
<P>
   Have faith in your comandante,
</P>
<P>
   Do not stay over there.''

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Have Rival Health Plans  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush's proposal to give $2,000 tax
credits to help poor families pay for health insurance received
mixed reviews, with private experts calling it a generous plan that
will assist millions and activists saying the ''tiny'' credits
won't help most families.
</P>
<P>
   The tax credits will help some 18 million low-income Americans
buy health insurance, including 4 million to 5 million who couldn't
afford it before, said John Goodman, president of the National
Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative research group.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Pollack, president of Families USA, which lobbies for
universal health care, countered that most uninsured families
couldn't afford coverage because the tax credits would cover too
little of their out-of-pocket expenses. He prefers Vice President
Al Gore's plan to include more low-income people in existing
government health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The debate underscores that health care -- and the problem of
getting insurance to the estimated 44 million Americans who don't
have any -- is a hot issue in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   But both candidate's plans would still leave substantial numbers
of poor people scrambling to afford health insurance, private
experts and activists say.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush's plan, poor families earning up to $30,000 would get
tax credits for buying private health insurance. The aim is to give
them the freedom to choose their own coverage and provide tax
relief to families that have already bought private insurance, said
Goodman, who has helped GOP lawmakers craft similar tax credit
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   He estimates that the $2,000 credit would cover about half of
what a family would spend to buy a basic health insurance policy
from a private insurer.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say coverage for a family costs at least $6,000 a year.
At that rate, families earning $30,000 would have to spend $4,000,
or more than 10 percent of their earnings, to buy insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund, says studies
show that people won't buy health insurance if their out-of-pocket
costs exceed 5 percent of their income.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is really not affordable for anyone below $40,000,'' said
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said those who don't buy insurance will be taken care of
by ''safety net'' providers such as public hospitals and free
health clinics. He said that Texas families who have no insurance
get about $4,000 of free care from these providers each year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet studies have shown that many safety net providers have
curtailed services and are under severe financial strain because of
budget cuts and the loss of paying patients to private hospitals
and clinics.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Bush proposed spending $3.6 billion to boost the
number of community health centers serving low-income areas as part
of his plan to strengthen safety net providers.
</P>
<P>
   To address high out-of-pocket health expenses, Bush would expand
tax-free medical savings accounts. Now limited by the government to
self-employed people and workers at small companies, MSAs would be
available to everyone under Bush's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and other Democrats contend that MSAs are ''tax shelters
for the wealthiest and healthiest Americans,'' and that Bush's plan
would drain them from the general insurance pool.
</P>
<P>
   ''By luring them out of the regular health insurance system he
would actually drive up health insurance costs for working
families,'' Gore told a meeting of newspaper editors Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under his $146 billion plan announced last year, Gore would
raise income limits on the Children's Health Insurance Program to
get more uninsured kids covered and allow their parents into the
program. Uninsured people would get a 25 percent refundable tax
credit toward the purchase of health policies. Gore estimates that
between 11 million and 15 million uninsured children and adults
would get coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack at Families USA praised Gore for targeting uninsured
children and families first. But he said the vice president's
proposal would not help millions of uninsured adults who don't have
children.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the next logical step,'' said Pollack.

<HEADLINE> Conservatives Pressure Bush on Gays  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Social conservatives were reserving
judgment on George W. Bush's meeting today with a select group of
gay Republicans, partly because his campaign has already assured
them he will stay true to his core conservative beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Others expressed some concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the meeting that's the problem, it's what he says
when he gets there,'' said Janet Parshall, a spokeswoman for the
Family Research Council in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Log Cabin Republicans, an organization for gays, has
pressured the presumed Republican presidential nominee to take a
stand on such issues as gay marriage. Bush has shunned the group
and was criticized for it during the presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Texas governor has been trying to moderate his
political image after his appeals to religious conservatives helped
him win South Carolina's primary in February.
</P>
<P>
   But that shift to the center is raising a new concern: that Bush
might alienate those same conservatives with any concession to
homosexuals, who traditionally don't vote for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Aides billed the sit-down at his campaign headquarters as a
discussion of common conservative ground, including overhauling the
education, health care and tax systems. Unlikely to be resolved are
differences over prickly issues on the activists' agenda, such as
gay marriage, which Bush opposes.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some disagreements on certain issues,'' said Bush
spokesman Scott McClellan. ''But this meeting is another example of
Governor Bush's inclusive record as a different kind of Republican,
one who reaches out to people from all walks of life and unites
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who planned to attend said the meeting was a good
first step.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to be talking about who we are and what it's like
to be gay and get a greater understanding of who we are and the
issues that we face,'' said Carl Schmid of the Human Rights
Campaign, a gay political organization in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Huch, a gay activist from northern Virginia who secured a
commitment from Bush for a meeting, said the get-together wouldn't
be a cheerleading session or love fest.
</P>
<P>
   ''But if we come out of that meeting at a minimum and have Bush
say, 'This is a good conversation ... I expect to learn more,'
considering where this party has been in the past on gay and
lesbian issues, I think that is a tremendous step in the right
direction,'' Huch said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was arranged by Charles Francis, a gay public
relations executive in Washington whose brother, James Francis Jr.,
is a prominent Bush fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Invitations went to a carefully chosen of gay activists and
public officeholders, including former Wisconsin Rep. Steve
Gunderson, Plattsburgh, N.Y., Mayor Dan Stewart, and David Catania
of Washington's city council. No Log Cabin Republicans were
invited.
</P>
<P>
   GOP moderates who supported Sen. John McCain for president over
Bush said the meeting could help reconcile the party's conservative
and moderate wings, and resonate with the many Democrats and
independents who backed the Arizona senator and whose support Bush
now seeks.
</P>
<P>
   McCain met with the Log Cabin Republicans despite their
differences on some issues.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the campaign of Democratic presidential rival Al Gore
advised the gay activists to pay more attention to Bush's actions
than to his words.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno ordered
Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives to bring the 6-year-old boy to an
airport Thursday afternoon so he could be taken to a reunion with
his father in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Reno delivered the ultimatum after taking the extraordinary step
Wednesday of coming to Miami to meet for 2{ hours with the Cuban
boy's relatives.
</P>
<P>
   She failed to persuade them to end the wrenching 4{-month
custody struggle, and Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez,
defiantly said late Wednesday he would not relinquish custody of
the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not turn this child over, not in Opa-locka, not in any
'locka,''' he said, referring to the government's demand that Elian
be brought to the airport in Opa-locka, outside Miami. ''They will
have to take this child from me by force.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno told the family to bring Elian to the airport Thursday at 2
p.m. She said a plane would take the boy, and whatever relatives
wanted to come, to Washington for a retreat at a neutral site with
the boy's Cuban father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. No Cuban diplomats
would be present.
</P>
<P>
   She said if the family did not show, ''We will enforce the
order,'' but she did not elaborate. Government sources have said
the Justice Department was prepared to send U.S. marshals and
immigration agents into the great-uncle's house to remove the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Diaz, an attorney for the family, said he would seek a
federal court injunction to block the government from instituting
the order.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she regretted Lazaro Gonzalez's statement that his
family would not hand Elian over.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since his arrival in the U.S. they have acted as loving
caregivers,'' Reno said. ''It is now up to them to ensure that
Elian's transition from their care to that of his father happens in
the best and least traumatic way.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno met with Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's cousin, Marisleysis
Gonzalez, and other relatives at the Miami Beach home of Sister
Jeanne O'Laughlin, the nun who was host of a January meeting
between Elian and his grandmothers from Cuba. Elian attended the
meeting, moving from lap to lap at the table.
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin described the meeting as cordial and said Elian left
the room only when the subject matter was too sensitive. ''He was
precious with her,'' O'Laughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz, the attorney, said Reno and Immigration and Naturalization
Service Commissioner Doris Meissner heard ample evidence during the
meeting that Elian does not want to go back to Cuba but refused to
take that into account.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she took everything she heard into consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was very respectful and they were very honest,''
O'Laughlin said. ''The pain of this family and their understanding
of the pain of Juan Miguel was very evident. They have expressed
over and over again their ... desire to be a loving family, whole
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the Miami relatives indicated that Marisleysis, who
considers herself a mother figure to Elian and has been
hospitalized several times for stress and exhaustion, could not
travel by plane. They presented alternatives such as inviting Juan
Miguel to a reunion at O'Laughlin's house.
</P>
<P>
   But ''Everyone involved has felt that it would be dangerous for
Juan Miguel to come to South Florida at this time,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his relatives had left their politically charged
Little Havana neighborhood to spend the day at O'Laughlin's gated
home. They headed back home early Thursday, and 200 demonstrators
gathered outside.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez held his hands up to the cheers of the crowd,
and said of the meeting, ''They didn't want to listen to us.''
Someone shouted, ''We are with you 'til death!''
</P>
<P>
   Elian, clinging to an inner tube, was rescued by two fishermen
on Thanksgiving after his mother and 10 other Cubans drowned when
their boat sank.
</P>
<P>
   His Miami relatives have been caring for him ever since and have
been fighting in court for him to have an asylum hearing. But the
Clinton administration has ordered Elian back to his father in
Cuba, saying only he can speak for the boy on immigration matters.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge affirmed that decision, but the family has
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, who met with Reno after coming to America last
week, remained in Bethesda, Md. He indicated Wednesday -- the day
after a meeting in Washington with the Miami relatives was
scheduled and abruptly canceled -- that he was through negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his wife and their infant son were
guests of honor at a reception at the Cuban diplomatic mission in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, Ricardo Alarcon, the senior Cuban official who has
advised the father, criticized the Miami relatives for delaying the
transfer, saying they were showing ''a total lack of respect for
American society,'' and ''making fun of the U.S. government.''
</P>
<P>
   If Elian's relatives were hoping for a quieter setting in Miami
Beach, they only partially succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   While Reno met with the family, dozens of police and federal
agents kept watch over about 200 demonstrators. Several waved a
Cuban flag bigger than a king-sized bedsheet.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Elian arrived at the house, a crowd chanted ''Elian!
Elian!'' in anticipation. The demonstrators were forced to keep a
greater distance than on Lazaro Gonzalez's narrow street. Police
kept them across a four-lane road, behind a median and a barricade.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reno, coward, Miami has had enough!'' some shouted. Reno left
in a motorcade that included 12 police motorcycles and a dozen
cruisers.

<HEADLINE> Gore Holds Midnight Rendezvous  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore didn't arrive here
until after midnight, but that wasn't going to stop him from
keeping an appointment with a local teacher who was serving as host
for the night.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, on his third all-day trip to a school in two weeks, has
made a point of sleeping over the night before at the home of a
teacher from the chosen school. This time, it was Laurel Warfield's
turn to play host.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very excited,'' she said. ''We've been really
anticipating this big day -- or evening, or whatever it is.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, precisely, six or so hours when most people are sleeping
and with Gore due to depart for Marie Davis Middle School at about
6:45 a.m., it wasn't clear how much conversation there would be.
</P>
<P>
   Warfield knew she wasn't getting prime time with Gore. When told
that his late-night visit was already running an hour late, she
said, ''Oh my lord.''
</P>
<P>
   But Warfield and her family were waiting up, checking out the
local TV crews and swarming Secret Service agents as she prepared
to tuck the vice president into her son's corner room.
</P>
<P>
   ''Normally I would be tired but I'm not tonight,'' she said. ''I
figure I can be tired and worry about it another day.''
</P>
<P>
   Warfield is a 6th grade language arts teacher at the middle
school, a magnet program that offers advanced courses with a
special focus on foreign languages and communications.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Warfield and Gore were both awake enough to talk about
education, she hoped to chat about the importance of getting
everyone involved in schools -- not just teachers, but parents and
students, too.
</P>
<P>
   Warfield suspects she was chosen because of her students' high
test scores, but she's also the sort of voter Gore will need in
November. Generally a Republican, she crossed over to vote for
democratic Gov. James Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't decided who to vote for in the presidential contest.
''I'm still waiting on some of the issues,'' she said Wednesday
night as she was still waiting for the vice president.

<HEADLINE> S.C. Senate Votes To Remove Flag  </HEADLINE>
By LEIGH STROPE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- State lawmakers have taken a key step
toward removing the Confederate flag from the Statehouse dome and
perhaps ending a racially tinged controversy that led to a
punishing tourism boycott and new scrutiny of Southern heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate approved a compromise bill on Wednesday,
exactly 139 years after the Civil War began when Confederate troops
fired on Fort Sumter, the federal installation in Charleston
harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 36-7. All opponents were Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one more hurdle that has been overcome,'' said
Democratic Gov. Jim Hodges, who supports flag removal.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would remove the banner from the dome and place a
similar battle flag behind an existing monument honoring
Confederate soldiers on Statehouse grounds. The flag would fly from
a pole no taller than 20 feet, an element added to satisfy black
lawmakers and others who did not want the flag in a prominent
position to passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would remove Confederate flags hanging in the
House and Senate chambers, and protect monuments, memorials and
buildings erected or named in honor of the Confederacy or civil
rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   A final vote -- usually a procedural matter -- was expected in the
Democrat-controlled Senate today. The bill still needs approval by
the Republican-controlled House, which has twice refused to pass
such a measure in the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some lawmakers appeared optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have fought this thing and we have fought this thing, and
the olive branch is now out on both sides,'' said Republican Sen.
Glenn McConnell, who owns a Confederate memorabilia shop in
Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is the only state that flies the Confederate flag
above its Statehouse. Opponents say it is a racist symbol, while
supporters say it represents Southern heritage and honors
Confederate war dead. Only the Legislature can take down the flag,
which has flown since 1962.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is not a new one. In 1994, the House adjourned
without considering a Senate-approved plan to remove the flag and
in 1997 shot down Republican Gov. David Beasley's attempt to get
the flag moved. Beasley lost to Hodges a year later.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate just last week couldn't decide whether to discuss,
let alone agree on, the flag's removal. But key senators reached a
compromise they thought would satisfy flag supporters and
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Not all senators were on board.
</P>
<P>
   ''Race relations will not be the same in this state in my
lifetime if you take that flag down,'' said Republican Sen. Harvey
Peeler. He said ''the rebels would yell'' if the flag was removed
because they do not want to be told what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of supporters with Confederate flags decorating hats,
shirts, belts and jewelry lined up to get inside the Senate gallery
to watch Wednesday's debate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a nonpartisan, binding referendum,'' Steven Roark
said. ''The people who lost their lives for that flag didn't know
anything about politics. They just knew they had to pick up the
squirrel gun and fight for the farm.''
</P>
<P>
   As the debate continued, tennis player Serena Williams, who is
black, withdrew from the Family Circle Cup next week in Hilton Head
Island, the biggest sports name to back a tourism boycott by the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   NAACP officials, who said the boycott would stay in place until
the flag is removed, did not return several messages Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The boycott, which took effect Jan. 1, has also been honored by
the New York Knicks basketball team and the American Bar
Association. Industry officials in February estimated that South
Carolina had lost almost $7 million in cancellations of conventions
and meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has even been discussed by presidential candidates.
Both Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain refused
to take a position on the flag, calling it a local issue.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and his then-challenger, former New
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, both said the flag should come down.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. led hundreds of
supporters on a five-day, 120-mile march to Columbia to ask
lawmakers to remove the flag.

<HEADLINE> Peru Election Head for Runoff  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori will have to wait
for a runoff election for another chance to beat his upstart rival,
Alejandro Toledo, after falling short of a majority vote.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time, Toledo says the playing field will be different
as they seek a clean campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the second round, we demand substantially different
conditions to compete,'' Toledo said Wednesday night after final
results were released. ''The international community is watching.
The nation is watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, 61, made no immediate public statement. He has kept a
low profile since Sunday's vote -- the culmination of an election
campaign so riddled with accusations of government abuses and
irregularities that the international community all but insisted on
a second round.
</P>
<P>
   ''The accumulation of fraud allegations from Sunday are so
numerous that the president's image is irreparably damaged,'' said
political scientist Julio Carrion. ''I seriously doubt that
Fujimori, if he is declared president, will still be president at
year's end.''
</P>
<P>
   A runoff election will be scheduled for late May or early June.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Toledo's followers who for hours had waited for the
deciding result in downtown Lima broke into wild cheers when they
heard the news.
</P>
<P>
   For three days Toledo's supporters had demonstrated by the tens
of thousands in Peru's main cities. The former World Bank official
had warned that the mostly peaceful marches and rallies could turn
violent if Fujimori claimed an unprecedented third five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people went to the streets and shook up Fujimori's
government,'' said Teresa Casallo, a 45-year-old primary school
teacher. ''This time it will be difficult to pull off a fraud
because if it happens, the people will take to the streets again.''
</P>
<P>
   After tallying 97.68 percent of the ballots, Fujimori had 49.84
percent compared to 40.31 percent for his challenger. Various other
candidates split the rest. Election officials said the remaining
ballots could not change the tally enough to give Fujimori a win.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, exit polls and unofficial tallies by independent
monitors had indicated Fujimori would not reach the 50 percent plus
one vote needed to win.
</P>
<P>
   But after an unexplained 12-hour delay, the first official
returns showed Fujimori on track to claim a first-round victory,
prompting suspicions of fraud. Then on Tuesday, officials said
Fujimori had 49.96 percent of the vote with 90.8 percent of the
ballots counted.
</P>
<P>
   Before the deciding results were released Wednesday, U.S. State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the United States would
have ''serious, serious questions'' if there was not a second
round.
</P>
<P>
   European governments intensified the heat on Fujimori as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have a lot of confidence in the voting process
either,'' British Ambassador Roger Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   As election officials announced the deciding results, Francisco
Tudela, Fujimori's vice presidential candidate and a former foreign
minister, complained bitterly about U.S. interference in the
election.
</P>
<P>
   He said he rejected in the ''most energetic terms the fact that
a foreign government would emit a judgment value about elections in
another country before the official count is in.''
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, opposition candidates accused Fujimori's
military intelligence service of using rock-throwing thugs to
disrupt political rallies, sponsoring lurid tabloid newspaper
attacks and blocking access to largely state-controlled television
and radio.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to Sunday's vote, Toledo, 54, was the
target of a smear campaign that accused him of everything from
shunning an illegitimate daughter to being an architect of a
financial pyramid scheme that impoverished thousands of Peruvians
in the early 1990s. He has denied the charges.	   Analysts expected more of the
same in the runoff campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're probably going to see personal attacks directed at
Toledo and his family all over again. We're probably going to see
government funds used heavily to favor the president,'' said
political analyst Fernando Rospigliosi. ''That's the image that is
going to stay with Fujimori.''

<HEADLINE> Bucs Hope Johnson Is Final Piece  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Keyshawn Johnson won't have to demand the
ball from his new team.
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay Buccaneers made the two-time Pro Bowl selection
the highest-paid receiver in the NFL on Wednesday, and intend to
give him plenty of opportunities to make a difference in their
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ''I welcome that because in this day and age, we all know that
you have to throw the football,'' Johnson said after signing an
eight-year, $56 million contract to complete a trade that sent a
pair of first-round draft picks to the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the organization knows that. That's why they went out
and gave up two first-round picks to try to get somebody they can
rely on to deliver that for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson received a club-record $13 million signing bonus and
immediately became the highest-profile offensive player in team
history. He had two years remaining on the six-year contract he
signed as the first pick in the 1996 draft, and unsuccessfully
sought to renegotiate the deal with the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing a holdout next season, New York opted to trade Johnson,
receiving the 13th and 27th picks in this weekend's draft. The
Jets, who have an unprecedented four selections in the opening
round, already owned the 16th and 18th picks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Money was an issue, yes it was. But it wasn't the only
issue,'' Johnson said of leaving New York. ''It never got to the
point of talking to the Jets. They never asked what do you want or
what could possibly satisfy you.''
</P>
<P>
   To make room under the salary cap for Johnson, the Bucs released
receiver Bert Emanuel, who was scheduled to earn $4.2 million next
season. One of the reasons the team was in the market to acquire an
impact player was Emanuel was a major disappointment after signing
as a free agent two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're getting one of the best receivers in the game,
and his play week-in and week-out exhibits that,'' said NFL
defensive player of the year Warren Sapp.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing you have to do is turn the film on. We have a
saying: 'The eye in the sky never lies.' He's been performing in
this league for four years and we expect him to do the same thing
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay failed to score an offensive touchdown five times,
including the NFC title game, and ranked 30th among 31 teams in
passing and 28th overall while averaging just over 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Bucs had their best season in franchise
history because of a defense that was so dominant the team won two
of the five games the offense couldn't get into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody knows the Tampa Bay Bucs have an extraordinary
defense that put them in the NFC championship game last year,''
Johnson said. ''I hear all the time, all they need is 17. Well,
we're definitely going to try to give them that 17.''
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old receiver is the third Pro Bowl player to be
added to the Bucs offense since the team failed to score a
touchdown in an 11-6 loss to the St. Louis Rams in the NFC title
game, joining center Jeff Christy and guard Randall McDaniel.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Mike Shula was fired as offensive coordinator and
replaced by Les Steckel, who is installing the offense the
Tennessee Titans used to make it to the Super Bowl last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're making it easy for me right now. I'm excited,'' said
second-year quarterback Shaun King, who doesn't see the trade for
Johnson changing the Bucs' commitment to getting the ball to
running back Warrick Dunn and Pro Bowl fullback Mike Alstott.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the defense we have, the additions we've made on the
offensive line and two running backs we have, I still think our
main focus will be to run the ball. But when we do decide to throw
it, he gives us another weapon, another threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who had been scheduled to earn $2.4 million with the
Jets in 2000, gives the Bucs the big, physical playmaker they've
yearned for years. His receiving yardage for last season alone
(1,170 yards on 89 receptions) surpassed the career numbers for all
but one of Tampa Bay's other young wideouts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we've turned a weakness into a strength,'' Sapp said.
''Now we've got to just put it all together and go out and win some
ball games.''

<HEADLINE> Will Jets Go for No. 1 Pick?  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Word out of New York, for the moment, is that
the Jets won't offer their four first-round draft picks to the
Cleveland Browns for the No. 1 selection in the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   This from the same team that once said it wouldn't trade
Keyshawn Johnson, either.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Johnson is gone to Tampa Bay and by Saturday those draft
picks could belong to Cleveland, too.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Clark, the Browns' director football operations, said
last week that if a team approached him with four picks ''and they
were positioned correctly, we would have to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jets coach Al Groh left open the possibility of a Jets-Browns
trade when he said the additional first rounders picked up from the
Buccaneers for Johnson ''creates many more opportunities, including
more maneuvering.''
</P>
<P>
   Might that maneuvering include Jets director of football
operations Bill Parcells calling Browns coach Chris Palmer, his
good friend and former assistant?
</P>
<P>
   At this point, no one, including the Browns, can forecast what
might happen.
</P>
<P>
   For Cleveland, the second time around with the No. 1 overall
pick hasn't been any easier. They've got one pick and two players
they'd like to use it on.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, this is a much tougher decision,'' said Clark, who in
'99 was choosing between quarterbacks Tim Couch and Akili Smith.
''We truly haven't made up our minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Browns got their quarterback. This time, they
want a guy who can get the QB.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland has narrowed its top choice to either defensive end
Courtney Brown or linebacker LaVar Arrington, Penn State's terrific
tandem of All-Americans. The pair has been measured, timed,
interviewed and scrutinized ad nauseam the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm agonizing over those two,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the Browns wanted Peter Warrick, Florida State's
elusive wide receiver as a weapon for Couch, their top pick a year
ago. But Warrick's stock has been falling like the NASDAQ following
a disappointing 40-yard dash time in his predraft workout.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not that Peter has dropped off,'' Clark said, ''but the
other guys are very special.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the consensus around the league, and it's why the Browns
can't lose by selecting either player. So Cleveland's decision --
they're now reportedly leaning toward Brown -- could come down to
intangibles like leadership or personality. Or perhaps the ability
to sign the top pick.
</P>
<P>
   Lal Heneghan, the Browns' chief contract negotiator, has had
preliminary talks with Arrington's agents, Kevin and Carl Poston,
as well as Brown's representative, Marvin Demoff.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the team insisted upon having Couch signed on draft
day to avoid a long holdout. But team president Carmen Policy said
last week the Browns would not be as adamant about that this year,
and isn't worried about the Postons' reputation as being tough
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns think the 6-foot-3, 250-pound Arrington, could be the
impact player they need to build their defense around.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's Lawrence Taylor,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington is big, fast and reminds some of Taylor or Jevon
Kearse, who as a rookie last season single-handedly improved
Tennessee's defense and took the Titans to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   However, Arrington's stormy relationship with Penn State coach
Joe Paterno -- the two butted heads for three years -- could persuade
the Browns to favor Brown, the more quiet and humble of the Nittany
Lions.
</P>
<P>
   But during his visit with the Browns last week, Arrington got a
chance to explain his past problems with Paterno, and said he and
the coach have patched things up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love his demeanor and the way he plays mind games with
players,'' Clark said. ''But criticizing the head coach is not good
and not acceptable, and you just can't do it in this atmosphere.
But I'm sure if LaVar did that, he may have had a reason and we'll
try not to give him a reason.''

<HEADLINE> Julie Krone Eases Into Retirement  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD ROSENBLATT, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Julie Krone is feeling more comfortable about
life now that it's been nearly a year since she retired as
thoroughbred racing's top female jockey.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now I'm less apt to leap off curbs when I'm rollerblading and
I will actually leave my home on time so I don't have to drive
fast,'' said Krone, whose stellar 19-year career was plagued by
injuries. ''I'm a little more balanced and basic. My friends would
say I'm more grown up.''
</P>
<P>
   At 36, Krone has packed up her tack and moved to Los Angeles,
where she works for TV Game Network's racing show and also has a
budding career doing voiceovers for Nickelodeon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having a squeaky voice is paying off,'' said Krone, whose
high-pitched voice kept her from ever getting lost in a crowd even
though she stands 4-foot-10{ and weighs 98 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Krone feels so good these days she says she'd love to get back
on a thoroughbred again.
</P>
<P>
   ''But only in the morning,'' she said. ''I'd like to gallop 'em
because that's what I miss the most. But I will never race ride
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Krone, who won most of her 3,545 races at East Coast tracks, was
back in New York on Wednesday to participate in a roundtable
discussion, sponsored by Pfizer Inc., on post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), which she suffered from in her final years as a
jockey.
</P>
<P>
   Post-traumatic stress disorder affects as many as 13 million
Americans, or 10 percent of the general population, according to
Dr. Jonathan Davidson, a professor of psychiatry at Duke who also
was part of the round table. PTSD affects twice as many women as
men and can be triggered by trauma such as violent crime, war,
death of a loved one, or, as in Krone's case, horrific injury.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after she became the first female rider to win a
Triple Crown race by capturing the 1993 Belmont Stakes aboard
Colonial Affair, Krone was seriously injured in a terrifying spill
at Saratoga. She shattered her right ankle, bruised her heart and
punctured an elbow. The ankle injury required two steel plates and
14 screws to repair.
</P>
<P>
   Although Krone said she did not experience mental stress after
that injury, it was a spill just 13 days after returning to racing
that unleashed a torrent of debilitating symptoms. The fall came on
Jan. 13, 1995, at Gulfstream, when Krone broke both hands when
thrown from her mount at the top of the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was lying there on the ground, I knew my life was going
to change,'' Krone said. ''And as I was getting ready to come back
I had trepidation. I had nightmares about falling. I used to get
lost on streets I'd been driving on for years. I wondered, 'What is
wrong with me?' My daily plan was how to kill myself that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Jockeys have to be fearless in order to compete, and can never
back down from any challenge. It's the way the business works. As
Krone says, you always have to be ready to ''give up body parts for
a winner.'' But for her, the fearlessness was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ''My subconscious ability to communicate with horses was
diminished,'' said Krone. ''It was like someone going through the
motions of being a jockey.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when she looked for help, finally realizing her so-called
shield of invincibility, which seems to be built into most athletes
these days, was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Krone went to a psychiatrist, Dr. Tom Qualtere, in Saratoga
Springs. He diagnosed her with post-traumatic stress disorder, and
by late 1997 she began taking Zoloft, an anti-depressant approved
by the U.S. Federal Drug Administration for treatment of PTSD.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Krone refused to take any medication, but a seven-day
suspension from riding gave her a window of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was thinking about all the people who bet on me when I was
suffering from PTSD, and I'd be riding in the back thinking,
'Please don't let me die,''' Krone said. ''When I started taking
Zoloft things got better. All the things I lost came back and I got
to be myself again.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a turning point in my career and life.''
</P>
<P>
   Krone, who was nominated earlier this year for Thoroughbred
Racing's Hall of Fame, continued to ride and finished as the
winningest female jockey and with $81 million in purses earned --
16th on racing's career list.
</P>
<P>
   Krone is feeling a lot better about herself, and would like
nothing more than to stick around to watch Saturday's Wood
Memorial, featuring Kentucky Derby favorite Fusaichi Pegasus.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw him in California,'' Krone said. ''I like him a lot.
Plus, I have him in my fantasy stable for the Derby.''

<HEADLINE> Michigan Gymnast Has Routine Down  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Sarah Cain of Michigan offers a textbook
example of how to hit the routine nearly every time -- whether she's
on the vault, the floor exercise or in the interview room.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolverines have a strong chance of winning the NCAA women's
gymnastics title because Cain's 9.927 vault average leads the
nation. She's the highest-rated all-around athlete with a 39.387
average.
</P>
<P>
   Cain also ranks third in the floor and fourth on the bars,
demonstrating her ability to perform well anywhere. Yet mention her
individual prospects, and Cain showed she can say the right things,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just looking to go out Thursday and Friday and hit my
routines,'' she said. ''I'm not here to win the all-around. It's a
team focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Team semifinals are today, and the top three schools from two
pairings advance to Friday's team finals. Today's events also
involve the all-around meet, and UCLA coach Valorie Kondos said
Cain is the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's very good, very clean and absolutely lovely to watch,''
Kondos said. ''You're not going to get any deductions out of her
form. It's only going to come from a wobble or a fall.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are expected to duel Michigan for the team
championship. But if either falters, there are plenty of
traditional powers ready to emerge from the 12-team field.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama has the No. 1 ranking, stemming from a national-best
score (197.3) at regionals. There's two-time defending champ
Georgia, 10-time titlist Utah and BYU, Nebraska, Oregon State, Iowa
State, Penn State, LSU and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is apparent UCLA is the most talented team,'' Alabama coach
Sarah Patterson said. ''I also know we've won three national
championships when we didn't have the most talented team. You can't
miss on an event and still win.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA set school records this season on bars, floor exercise and
vault, but fell three times on the beam at the regional meet two
weeks ago. Kondos made a point of discussing those mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told the team we could pretend it doesn't exist or we could
throw it out there and talk about it,'' she said. ''I said, 'You
can perform like you practice or you can think about it too much
and get anxious.'''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's talented team includes Heidi Moneymaker, who twice hit
10s on the vault this season, and Mohini Bhardwaj, ranked No. 2
nationally behind Cain in the all-around and the nation's top
performer on the bars.
</P>
<P>
   ''UCLA was outstanding this year,'' Utah coach Greg Marsden
said. ''It's their meet to win or lose. If they don't fall, they're
going to be very competitive, very hard to beat.''

<HEADLINE> USOC Boss: Slash 'Low Value' Sports  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE WILSTEIN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- No gold, silver or bronze means no green in the
bottom-line world of new U.S. Olympic Committee boss Norm Blake.
</P>
<P>
   Blake plans to push through a radical and long overdue change
this weekend that would slash the budgets of some 20 sports while
enriching traditional medal-winning powerhouses like swimming.
</P>
<P>
   Other big winners in Blake's plan are expected to be gymnastics,
figure skating, ice hockey, track and field, and boxing. The losers
would be sports like team handball, biathlon, field hockey,
weightlifting and table tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel we are accountable to making America proud, and that
comes down to the medal count,'' Blake said before presenting his
plan to the 19-member USOC executive committee on Friday. ''So we
are consciously allocating resources to that end, which means we
are taking from some to give more to others.''
</P>
<P>
   By eliminating or sharply cutting what Blake called, in the
business jargon he frequently employs, ''low value-added
programs,'' the USOC hopes to speed up the development of athletes,
improve coaching, and boost the overall haul of medals.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 45 national governing bodies of the sports the USOC
funds, including 39 Olympic NGB's, about half are going to feel
cuts, Blake said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've employed sort of a portfolio management discipline where
we've attempted to evaluate the medal potential that each sport has
and then to critically assess the capability of that sport to
achieve the winning of those medals,'' Blake said.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC, which budgeted $160 million for grants to the NGB's
from 1997 through 2000, should not waste money on sports with a
small following in the United States and little hope of medals,
Blake said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are certain sports that are not indigenous to the United
States, so the available feedstock of potential athletes is
limited, the amount of support available in the U.S. from a
fundraising standpoint is limited, and we are therefore
disadvantaged,'' he said. ''We have to very seriously look at what
level of support we give those particular sports.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are sports that, for all practical purposes, are not
really a concern to the American public, and the level of athletic
involvement at the grassroots level is relatively nominal. Do we
want to throw money at a sport that, frankly, would not have the
means to ever medal or to make America proud? And how much money is
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his plan would most punish the weakest sports and
essentially give up on them, Blake replied:
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel an obligation as part of the Sports Act that we need
to have a basic readiness to serve or a minimal capacity to
represent even a minor sport,'' he said. ''We feel an obligation to
make sure that that sport remains viable at some minimal level.
Very frankly, minimal level means to support a nominal amount of
overhead costs, and enough of an organization to advocate the
interests of that sport. Not much more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Each NGB will be evaluated on its own merits, he said, and some
will suffer deeper cuts than others during the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Blake knows he will hear a lot of howling from the sports that
will lose out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are we trying to make everybody happy and make sure everybody
has enough money, and field less than our best team at the games?
Because it has to come from somewhere. We're dealing with finite
resources,'' he said. ''There has to be some give-up. But the
give-up doesn't necessarily mean you close down some sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake, a 58-year-old former hotel and insurance executive with a
history of resurrecting struggling companies, became chief
executive officer and secretary general of the USOC in February
with a mandate to revitalize it. He described the new approach to
funding the national governing bodies of sports as similar to a
franchise relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC will negotiate agreements with the NGB's and provide
such things as coaching support, marketing programs, operational
assistance and bookkeeping.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the NGB will be accountable for running an efficient
operation, maintaining quality staff and training facilities,
fundraising for the sport, and making sure money gets to the
athletes and the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Each NGB also will be obligated to work with a new national
governing body, which would represent the interests of all disabled
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in the past when the NGB's pretty much ran their own
show, Blake said, ''there will be strings attached'' to every
dollar the USOC gives to a sport.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to be convinced that it is a wise investment on behalf
of our sponsors and the public at large, that we are spending money
wisely to better serve the interests of our athletes and to enhance
their overall competitive performance,'' Blake said.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the USOC also will be acting like a venture
capitalist firm with the various sports, giving them seed money for
development if Blake thinks it's worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not always going to bat 1.000, but I'm willing to make
that investment,'' Blake said. ''But there has to be a partner
that's willing to change and look at things differently.''

<HEADLINE> Dysfunctional Flyers Face Sabres  </HEADLINE>
By KEN BERGER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- John Vanbiesbrouck pondered a question about
how strange things have been for the Philadelphia Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Did you ever see the movie 'Young Frankenstein?'''
Vanbiesbrouck asked, before comparing his chaotic team to a
character in that wacky flick.
</P>
<P>
   ''Abby Normal,'' Vanbiesbrouck said. ''That's who we are, Abby
Normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing is, it doesn't seem like a strange thing to hear in
this locker room. In this locker room, you never know what will
happen next.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers, who begin their first-round playoff series against
the Buffalo Sabres tonight, might as well have been taping episodes
of an afternoon talk show in the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here they are, hockey's First Family of Dysfunction, sitting
nicely with the top seed in the Eastern Conference, getting ready
for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs. Remember those?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's playoff time,'' new captain Eric Desjardins said. ''Any
questions about the playoffs or Buffalo?''
</P>
<P>
   No, thanks. Not even the most important games of the year could
match the twists and turns of South Philly's longest running drama.
</P>
<P>
   This is a rematch of a 1998 series won by Buffalo in five games,
and Desjardins says the Flyers are still stewing over that loss.
It's hard to imagine how they have time to concentrate on such
things.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Sabres have problems of their own. Doug Gilmour, their
star forward, has lost 10 pounds with a stomach virus and said
Wednesday he's not sure if he'll be ready for Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a weird virus, something I've never been through in my
life,'' Gilmour said.
</P>
<P>
   But a tummy ache? There's no way that can match the Flyers'
litany of distractions, ego trips, illnesses and infighting.
</P>
<P>
   Where to begin?
</P>
<P>
   -- The Flyers are without captain -- er, former captain -- Eric
Lindros, who is not close to coming back from his fourth concussion
in two years. Even if the Flyers get past Buffalo and Lindros is
back some time in the second round, his tenure with the team he was
expected to lead to a Stanley Cup appears over.
</P>
<P>
   -- Coach Roger Neilson heroically returned from cancer treatments
ahead of schedule, but showed up at practice Tuesday to find out he
couldn't have his job back. Interim coach Craig Ramsay will run the
team for the Buffalo series.
</P>
<P>
   -- Lindros lost his captaincy to Desjardins after accusing the
club's medical staff of failing to diagnose his concussion, which
he believes occurred after a hit from Hal Gill on March 4 at
Boston. General manager Bob Clarke returned the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't want the controversy,'' Clarke said Tuesday. ''We
didn't start it.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one teammate, Jody Hull, urged Lindros to apologize.
Others took a pass when given a chance to defend their former
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros rejoined the team Tuesday and stood by his comments
without apologizing. More important, Lindros still is experiencing
post-concussion headaches five weeks after the injury. He cannot
return to the ice until they go away.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe, without Eric Lindros, the other players can prove
that they can play even without him,'' goalie Dominik Hasek said.
</P>
<P>
   But have all the distractions made the Flyers vulnerable?
</P>
<P>
   ''They say there's turmoil coming out of Philly,'' Sabres coach
Lindy Ruff said. ''It doesn't look to me like it's affected their
hockey club.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Flyers finished the season 16-8-1 under Ramsay and
passed the slumping New Jersey Devils for the top playoff seed.
Somehow, the Flyers have managed to concentrate on playing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think people really understand who we are as a team
and what this organization is all about,'' said Ramsay, an
assistant and interim coach of the Sabres from 1984-87. ''These
guys have a wonderful ability to block it out and realize they have
a job to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres also have some business at hand. They're still mad
about last year's loss to Dallas in the Stanley Cup Finals on Brett
Hull's disputed goal with his foot in the crease. With Hasek
regaining his dominating form after missing 40 games with a groin
injury, the Sabres are a dangerous eighth seed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't really care,'' Hasek said. ''This is the playoffs.
You have to win four games. It doesn't matter if you finish seventh
or eighth or first. All we have to think about is the Philadelphia
Flyers and to beat them four times.''

<HEADLINE> Sabres' Gilmour Feeling Better  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- No one had to remind Doug Gilmour of how
pale and weary he looked.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo Sabres veteran, whose status remains in question for
tonight's playoff opener at Philadelphia because of a stomach
virus, was well aware of his appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been better looking corpses, I tell you,'' said
Gilmour, who has lost 10 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   He skated briefly during the team's practice Wednesday, the
first time he has been on the ice since Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Skating, however, is a lot different than playing and Gilmour
said his decision to play in Game 1 against the Flyers will depend
upon how he feels leading up to the opening faceoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted to go out for a light skate today to see how my
body and my head felt,'' said Gilmour, clutching two large bottles
of nutrient drinks. ''I feel a lot better than what I did feel
like. Obviously, it's going to take some time. The next 24 hours is
very big to us.''
</P>
<P>
   His doctors have told him the virus has passed although some of
the infection lingers in his stomach. At its worst, Gilmour said
his stomach was so swollen that he had difficulty bending over.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmour, who recorded 17 points in 11 games since he was
acquired by Buffalo in a deal with Chicago, has missed the Sabres'
last two games.
</P>
<P>
   After being fed fluids intravenously for four days, Gilmour said
he's managed to eat full meals -- toast and pasta -- the last two
days.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a weird virus, something I've never been through in my
life before,'' he said. ''I'd try to eat and as soon as I ate, I'd
throw up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmour stressed his decision to play will be based on whether
he can go a full game, and not be limited to spot action.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got to be responsible. You don't want to be a fault on
the ice where you're going to cause your team any kind of harm,''
he said. ''If I feel like I'm going to play, I'm going to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabres coach Lindy Ruff referred to Gilmour's skate as a hopeful
sign. But he's not inserting Gilmour's name in the lineup just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really going to depend on how he feels,'' Ruff said. ''If
we feel we can get something out of him, and he feels like he's got
enough energy in a limited role, that's a possibility, yes.''

<HEADLINE> Budget Deal Offers Farm Bailout  </HEADLINE>

Budget Deal Offers Farm Bailout   
By PHILIP BRASHER
AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers are in a line to get their third big
bailout from Congress in as many years, with most of the money
arriving in the thick of this fall's political campaigns, under a
budget agreement between House and Senate negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   The deal reached Wednesday provides $5.5 billion that would be
paid to farmers by Oct. 1, with an additional $1.64 billion to go
out later.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important to understand that there's a crisis in rural
America, even while the rest of the economy's been growing,'' said
Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. ''Depressed markets have left our
farmers with the lowest prices in 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The money is included in a $1.8 trillion spending plan that will
frame government spending for the 2001 budget year.
</P>
<P>
   None of the farm payments can be made until Congress passes
legislation necessary to release the money.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers still must decide exactly how the aid is to be spent
but $5.5 billion is likely to be used for direct payments to
farmers who grow grain and cotton and have ''market-transition''
contracts with the government, with the remaining money going to
producers of other commodities, congressional aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has provided $15 billion in special assistance to
farmers over the past two years, including $8.7 billion in 1999, to
compensate them for low commodity prices as well as weather-related
crop failures.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the continuing slump in commodity prices, the
Agriculture Department predicts net farm income this year would
drop $7.6 billion, or 16 percent, without another aid package from
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has proposed $4.2 billion in farm
income assistance, with most of the money going to a new subsidy
program that Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman wants to create.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the bailout money, the congressional budget
agreement authorizes an additional $8.2 billion in spending over
five years to expand the federally subsidized crop insurance system
and cut the premiums that farmers pay.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate were expected to vote on the budget
agreement as early as today.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said the $7.1 billion agreed to
Wednesday isn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very clear that we're going to have to get another
disaster bill of the magnitude of what we had last year to avert
some very, very serious farm losses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is likely to provide additional assistance for farmers
who lose crops to drought or flooding this year, but it is too soon
to know how much will be needed, said Pat Wolff, a spokeswoman for
the American Farm Bureau Federation.
</P>
<P>
   A drought has been developing over a section of the Midwest
stretching from Nebraska to Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators split the difference between what the Senate and
House had put in their versions of the budget plan for farmers. The
Senate had approved $8.5 billion, while the House wanted $6
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're certainly pleased that Congress recognizes that there's
a need to provide additional assistance to troubled farmers and
ranchers,'' Wolff said.
</P>
<P>
   It is virtually certain that Congress won't make any changes in
the 1996 farm law, as Democrats have proposed.

<HEADLINE> Museums Step Up Holocaust Art Search  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The heads of some of America's top museums
pledged Wednesday to escalate their efforts to solve a Holocaust
mystery by inspecting thousands of artworks and identifying those
that are suspected of being looted by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ''The burden of research is absolutely enormous. But this is a
national priority,'' said Malcolm Rogers, director of Boston's
Museum of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   He and other museum directors testified Wednesday before the
Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets, which acts as
a national body examining what Holocaust assets exist in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's our responsibility to make recommendations to the
president about how to achieve a measure of justice for Holocaust
victims and their families, whose assets may have come into the
United States,'' committee chairman William Singer said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Wheeler of the North Carolina Museum of Art said some
of the 20,000 European artworks in America ''might be possibly
suspect.'' The museum agreed in February to return the painting
''Madonna and Child in a Landscape'' by Lucas Cranach to heirs of a
Holocaust victim, from whom the work was plundered.
</P>
<P>
   The museum directors told the commission that their institutions
are posting any questionable holdings on the Internet so their
provenance can be traced.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a flashpoint when works of art become visible,'' said
Glenn Lowry of New York's Museum of Modern Art. ''And we intend to
continue drilling away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Museum of Art is researching almost 400 of its
pieces -- including paintings by Matisse, Gauguin and Manet -- to
make sure they were not plundered by Nazis, director Philippe de
Montebello said.

<HEADLINE> Doctors say Cuban boy will benefit from family's love  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The psychological impact of going from the
relative deprivation of life in Cuba to Toys R Us and back again is
impossible to predict, but perhaps minimal in an otherwise normal
six-year-old like Elian Gonzalez, say two doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important thing is the love of his family. These
things are a distraction,'' Dr. Lourdes Rigual-Lynch, a Montefiore
Medical Center psychologist and pediatrics professor at Albert
Einstein College of Medicine, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think that he will know this story, but it will not be an
essential part of his being,'' added Dr. Paulina F. Kernberg, a
professor of psychiatry at Cornell University Medical College.
</P>
<P>
   The two New York experts and Dr. Jerry Wiener, professor
emeritus of psychiatry and pediatrics at George Washington
University, were hand-picked by Attorney General Janet Reno to
offer guidance on how to end the four-month crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Rigual-Lynch and Kernberg met with Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, in Washington and joined Wiener in a Miami meeting with
Lazaro Gonzalez, the father's uncle, who has had custody of Elian
since he was rescued from an inner tube in the Florida Straits last
November.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives and many others in the Cuban exile community
contend that Elian would have a better life in the United States
than under President Fidel Castro's rigid communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   All three doctors supported the Clinton administration's view,
that Elian should go home to Cuba with his father.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint interview, Rigual-Lynch and Kernberg said they found
Elian to have two ''loving families'' -- his father and stepmother
in Havana, and the extended family of paternal uncles and cousins
in the United States, and predicted that he would remain close to
both even after returning to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Rigual-Lynch and Kernberg agreed that Elian should be able to
adjust amid familiar surroundings and people in Cuba, without
pining away for his more comfortable life in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is really impressive to us, and what we did not expect to
find, was such a commitment and fondness and longing of this father
for his son,'' said Kernberg.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a father and a family that deeply cares for Elian,''
added Rigual-Lynch. ''This gives us a sense of confidence that if
he has to go back with the father, he will be able to work on
everything that has happened, and he will have a good atmosphere
for that.''
</P>
<P>
   ''By returning to a more settled life in Cuba he will be able to
grieve for his mother. So far there have been too many
distractions,'' Kernberg said.
</P>
<P>
   However, both doctors had kind words for the Miami relatives,
especially Lazaro Gonzalez's 21-year-old daughter Marisleysis, who
was thrust into the role of surrogate mother to the boy cousin she
had never met, and has been hospitalized for stress. ''She has been
put in the limelight and trying to do her best, but I think too
much was expected of her,'' Kernberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is understandable that he (Elian) has attached himself to
her, because she has nurtured him'' said Rigual-Lynch. ''It has
been a difficult time and I think that is something he will
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   They agreed that Elian is old enough that he would remember his
mother's death at sea, his rescue by fishermen, and even some of
the subsequent turmoil over his fate, as militant anti-Castro
members of Miami's Cuban community campaigned to prevent the U.S.
government from sending him back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors said some of Elian's expatriate relatives had made
return visits to Cuba since leaving there in 1983, and it was his
great-uncle Manolo who taught Elian a prayer that he used to
sustain himself while drifting at sea.
</P>
<P>
   In a Washington interview, Wiener said Elian's Miami relatives
may believe their actions are in the boy's best interests, even
though that judgment is ''now being dominated by ideological and
political issues.''
</P>
<P>
   While relying on Chilean-born Kernberg's Spanish in the
interview with Lazaro Gonzalez, Wiener said he judged the uncle, by
his ''non-verbal'' responses, to be ''somewhat angry and
volatile.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro, he said, was adamant that the two families could not
meet except on his terms, did not seem to understand that Elian's
return to Cuba was all but assured, and raised questions about his
nephew's fitness as a father, despite there being ''nothing that
seemed to substantiate that.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said it was ''foolishness'' to suggest, as some have,
that Elian could be ''irreparably harmed by a family that raised
him.''

Reno Orders Elian Transfer

<P>
	   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno ordered Elian
Gonzalez's Miami relatives to bring the 6-year-old boy to an airport Thursday
afternoon so he could be taken to a reunion with his father in Washington. Reno
delivered the ultimatum after taking the extraordinary step Wednesday of coming
to Miami to meet for 2 1/2 hours with the Cuban boy's relatives. She failed to
persuade them to end the wrenching 4 1/2-month custody struggle, and Elian's
great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, defiantly said late Wednesday he would not

S.C. Moves To Remove Flag

	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- South Carolina state senators on Wednesday endorsed a
bill to remove the Confederate flag from atop the Statehouse dome. Opponents say
the banner is racist but supporters insist it's a symbol of Southern heritage.
The bill would remove the banner from the dome and place a similar battle flag
behind an existing monument honoring Confederate soldiers on Statehouse grounds.
The flag would fly on the north side of the Statehouse from a pole no taller
than 20 feet. That element was added to satisfy black lawmakers and other flag
opponents who did not want the flag in a prominent position to passers-by.

Fugitive" television series. The eight-member jury in Cuyahoga County Common
Pleas Court did not find Dr. Sheppard guilty of murder -- that wasn't the

Sheppard, failed to meet the burden of proof in his wrongful imprisonment civil
lawsuit against the state of Ohio. To win, Sheppard needed to convince jurors
the majority of evidence showed his father, who died in 1970, was innocent.

<HEADLINE> Report: Medical Boards Overworked  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even though federal regulators have taken
small steps to increase safety, the local medical boards primarily
responsible for protecting thousands of people enrolled in medical
research remain overworked and undertrained, says a new inspector
general report.
</P>
<P>
   ''Minimal progress has been made'' since a 1998 warning that the
protection system for Americans enrolled in clinical trials was in
jeopardy, the inspector general of the Department of Health and
Human Services said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest gaps: Once regulators agree to let a medical
experiment start, there is little independent monitoring of how
patients fare day-to-day, meaning early warning signs of risk may
be missed.
</P>
<P>
   The government has taken some steps to improve -- indeed, the
National Institutes of Health's Office of Protection from Research
Risks last year began more aggressively enforcing patient
protections. And the recent public outcry over the death of an
Arizona teen-ager in a gene therapy study should serve as a
catalyst for yet stronger protections, the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Among the improvements the report cites:
</P>
<P>
   --Between April 1997 and May 1998, the OPRR had conducted an
on-site investigation of only one medical center, but between June
1998 and last month that number rose to 10. OPRR last year began
more aggressively enforcing safety regulations, and suspended
federally funded research at seven medical centers that broke such
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are compelled to keep people who are in experiments out of
harm's way. Concern for the interests of the subject must always
prevail over the interests of science and society,'' OPRR chief Dr.
Gary Ellis said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   --The Food and Drug Administration has increased its on-site
safety investigations, from 213 in 1997 to 336 last year. The FDA
also now better informs medical oversight boards when it catches
scientists involved in misconduct, information those boards need to
judge the researchers' ongoing work.
</P>
<P>
   But federal regulators rely on local help in making sure that
people are properly informed of the risks of clinical trials and
that side effects are caught early. Institutional review boards at
hospitals are supposed to do that job -- but that safety net
continues to be shaky, Wednesday's report says.
</P>
<P>
   Some review boards are asked to approve 2,000 clinical trial
designs every year, in addition to overseeing whether ongoing
studies harm people. Board members are so overworked that some have
acknowledged they don't even question the safety of an ongoing
study unless someone dies.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the inspector general recommended in 1998 that
many experiments be given an independent monitoring board to
oversee ongoing studies. Wednesday's report concluded that hasn't
happened.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in the nation's most high-profile clinical trial
tragedy -- the death of Jesse Gelsinger, 18, from a gene therapy
experiment -- the FDA found University of Pennsylvania researchers
failed to properly report side effects and had no outside monitors
to sound the warning, either.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has now ordered that all gene therapy studies have
independent monitors. The new report urged extending that rule to
other medical experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The government also needs to better educate board members about
federal safety rules, and find ways to insulate these boards from
conflicts of interest -- a growing concern as more and more research
at hospitals and academic medical centers is funded by industry.

<HEADLINE> House Panel OKs Federal Spending  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House lawmakers sought to fix one of the most
costly -- and emotional -- issues schools face with a $2 billion a
year guarantee to help disabled children.
</P>
<P>
   Since special education laws enacted 35 years ago, schools
nationwide have complained the federal government requires them to
educate children with disabilities without sending enough money to
pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   The House Education and Workforce Committee voted on a plan
Wednesday to boost the federal share of the $60 billion spent
annually on special education from 12.6 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress made a promise to children and families with special
education needs,'' said Rep. Bill Goodling, R- Pa., committee
chairman. ''If we had kept our promise, school districts would have
the funds necessary to build new schools, hire new teachers, reduce
class size and buy new computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodling said the 1975 Individual With Disabilities Act called
for a 40 percent contribution as part of its requirement that
schools educate disabled youngsters. Often, such children -- whose
disabilities range from the physical to specific problems on
learning -- were sent to institutions or remained at homes, where
they didn't get quality instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 6 million children receive special education instruction
and services.
</P>
<P>
   Schools have felt burdened by the mission. Last year, the
Supreme Court ruled that a Cedar Rapids, Iowa, school district
would have to pay the $30,000 bill for the nursing care of
paralyzed high school student on a ventilator. The National School
Boards Association estimates that 17,000 children nationwide have
such high-cost needs.
</P>
<P>
   The House panel's act, agreed to by all members by a voice vote,
may be largely symbolic. Last week, Senate lawmakers haggling over
the budget rejected a similar plan -- some feared locking the
federal government into spending that could take away flexibility
from the overall budget to pay for tax cuts. There are no immediate
plans to offer another special education spending proposal, Senate
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   But over four years, the Republican-led Congress has increased
what it spends on special education, said Joseph Karpinski,
spokesman for Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., chairman of the Senate
Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is broad support,'' he said. ''When educators come to
Washington, this is one of major issues they talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   The House panel today continues its work on a slate of school
safety programs included in federal spending on elementary and
secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats say President Clinton will reject this latest
round of education lawmaking because it dilutes his priorities such
as after-school centers. Under this bill, schools could take money
marked for such programs and shift it to the school-safety programs
they prefer. For example, class-size reduction grants could be used
for character education instead.

<HEADLINE> One dead following store shooting with cop  </HEADLINE>
By MELANIE CARROLL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An off-duty police officer working security in a
Brooklyn clothing store fatally shot a teen-ager and wounded
another person after a confrontation, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred at 5:48 p.m. Wednesday at the Jimmy Jazz
clothing store at Hanover Place and Fulton Street. The store's
alarm sounded when the two suspects entered the store, causing the
officer to respond, thinking it may have been a possible
shoplifting incident, said Assistant Chief Joseph Esposito, a
police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Nimrod Ollivierre, 29, confronted the suspects,
words were exchanged, and a fight ensued. At least one of the
suspects produced a weapon and gunfire was exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Ollivierre apparently shot one suspect in the chest, police
said. The suspect -- identified as Malcolm Burno, 17, of Brooklyn --
was pronounced dead at Brooklyn Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The other suspect, Claude Muller, 28, of Brooklyn, was shot in
the leg and fled in a dark-colored car, apparently after picking up
the dead suspect's gun. He was later apprehended at Bellevue
Hospital, where he had checked himself in, Esposito said.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen or more shots were fired, but it was not known how many
were fired by Ollivierre or who had fired first, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A store employee, standing in back of the store, was shot in the
leg and taken to St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan, where he was
in stable condition. It was not immediately clear who shot him.
</P>
<P>
   Ollivierre, who was given permission from department officials
to work at the store, sustained several facial injuries, Esposito
said. Ollivierre is assigned to the 71st Precinct in Flatbush,
Brooklyn. He has a clean record and had not been involved in any
previous shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The officer and both suspects in Wednesday's shooting are black.
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking police source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said police were investigating whether the suspects were
part of a gang that sets off alarms upon entering stores. The scam
works like this, the source said: when the alarm goes off, store
employees see that the suspects have no merchandise. After
shoplifting, the suspects leave the store, setting off the alarm
again, but the store employees, believing the alarm is sounding
erroneously, allow the suspects to leave.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, a man opened fire outside the Jimmy Jazz store,
wounding eight people.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's incident was the latest shooting involving a police
officer. The shootings have sparked a public outcry in the city and
led to intense scrutiny of police practices. The U.S. Civil Rights
Commission is considering whether to recommend an independent
federal monitor to oversee the NYPD.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, four white undercover officers shot unarmed West
African immigrant Amadou Diallo on his Bronx doorstep, prompting a
month of daily protests outside police headquarters in which more
than 1,200 people were arrested, including elected officials and
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   The acquittal of those officers in February by an Albany jury
angered many who said it sent the wrong message to police. Shortly
after that verdict, another unarmed black man, Patrick Dorismond,
was fatally shot in a botched drug sting in midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Many criticized Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's statements in the wake
of the Dorismond shooting. He did not express sympathy to
Dorismond's family and he and Police Commissioner Howard Safir
released the dead man's criminal record -- including a sealed
juvenile record -- as they defended the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Those actions appeared to have an impact on Giuliani's public
support, giving his U.S. Senate opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, a
boost in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Anger bubbled over into violence between civilians and officers
outside Dorismond's funeral.

By The Associated Press	   This year's tax filing deadline for most of America

<P>
   People in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire,
Rhode Island, Vermont and most of New York outside of the New York

IRS service centers in either Andover, Mass., -- where Patriot's Day
is a legal holiday -- or Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> Report: Hopkins Becomes U.S. Citizen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Academy Award-winning actor Anthony Hopkins has
shed his British passport and become a U.S. citizen, the Evening
Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins, 62, renounced his British citizenship during a small,
private ceremony Wednesday in Los Angeles, with director Steven
Spielberg among the show-business friends serving as his witnesses,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard said he arrived at Los Angeles' Federal Building
with his mother and his girlfriend, Francine Kay, for the
after-hours ceremony before Judge Margaret Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins, who won the best actor Oscar for ''Silence of the
Lambs,'' was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1993, giving him the
right to use ''Sir'' before his name.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard said that he was required during the citizenship
ceremony to recite the words: ''I further renounce the title of
nobility to which I have heretofore belonged.''
</P>
<P>
   British Consulate officials in Los Angeles said Hopkins could
continue to use his title in Britain and would still be recognized
as a British national, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   His spokeswoman, Catherine Olim, had no comment on the
knighthood, but said Anthony is happy about the citizenship. ''I
know he has been here a long time and it seems like the right thing
to do,'' Olim said.
</P>
<P>
   As with any other candidate, Hopkins had to undergo an FBI
background check, interview with immigration officials and pass a
test on his knowledge of the United States, the Standard said.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is up 15 points
in today's early going. Advancing issues on the New York Stock
Exchange hold an 8-7 lead over decliners.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is ahead 70 points and the Standard &AMP;

</P>
<P>
   In the tech sector, chip maker Advanced Micro Devices not only
blew out the estimates for the past quarter, but also believes the
current quarter will be even stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Better-than-expected results are also out from General Motors

<HEADLINE> Prozac Licensing Deal Approved  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission has approved
Eli Lilly and Co.'s deal to license a new and improved version of
the popular antidepressant Prozac, the company said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly spokesman Ed West said the agency determined its licensing
agreement with Sepracor Inc. can go forward despite concerns raised
by a competitor hoping to introduce a generic version of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The new version of the drug is still in the development, and is
not expected to be introduced until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Lilly paid $90 million plus sales royalties to
Marlborough, Mass.-based Sepracor for the right to sell a modified
form of Prozac promising a more effective treatment for depression,
with fewer side effects such as sexual dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   If eventually approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the
new version of Prozac might allow Lilly to retain its franchise on
the nation's most popular antidepressant even if generic versions
hit the market when the drug's main patent expires in 2003. Lilly
could move doctors to prescribing the new Prozac, while cheaper
generic versions could be seen as inferior.
</P>
<P>
   Prozac last year had $2.6 billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce L. Downey, president of Barr Laboratories, a Pomona, N.Y.,
generic-drug maker that has challenged Prozac's patent in court,
said he had asked the FTC to investigate the Lilly-Sepracor deal.
</P>
<P>
   Downey charged that the deal is an attempt by Lilly to undercut
the coming U.S. market for cheaper, generic versions of Prozac that
already are sold in some foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Sepracor specializes in developing improved forms of widely
prescribed drugs. Its Prozac molecule has U.S. patent protection
until 2015.

<HEADLINE> State guidelines on shift-swapping promised after audit uncoversscam  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State prison workers face new rules on shift
swapping after auditors found 10 Adirondack Correctional Facility
officers worked abbreviated schedules and paid colleagues
under-the-table for exchanging shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Comptroller H. Carl McCall's office on Wednesday released an
audit on what it called the ''no-show'' scheme and called on the
state Department of Correctional Services to crack down on
shift-swapping policies. Corrections Commissioner Glenn Goord
quickly responded that he was ''reluctantly ordering the
development'' of a statewide policy.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the officers allegedly involved in the scheme will face
criminal penalties has been left up to the state Inspector
General's office.
</P>
<P>
   Each prison now maintains its own shift-swapping policies,
agreed upon with local union officials. Under the rules at the
Adirondack prison, in Raybrook, correction officers could trade
shifts with other workers as long as they worked shifts in return
on another date.
</P>
<P>
   But McCall's office said a review of payroll records for certain
officers from 1995 to 1999 showed that the officers maintained
their benefits while giving away many of their shifts and did not
work others' scheduled hours in exchange. Additionally, McCall's
office said that officers giving away their shifts likely paid
others to take on the extra work -- about $100 per 8-hour shift.
</P>
<P>
   One officer is accused of working only 6 percent of scheduled
time while eight officers swapped out more than 200 shifts. One
officer allegedly owed more than 800 shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ''These corrections officers would have to work up to four years
of extra shifts, along with their regular work days just to pay
back the time they owe,'' McCall said in a statement. ''At best
this is a gross abuse of the system and more likely it is a
violation of state law.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall's office would not release the identities or ranks of the
officers involved.
</P>
<P>
   While no officer admitted paying or taking payments for the
swaps, McCall's report stated -- and state prison officials conceded
-- that it was unlikely officers were working for others ''for free
as a gracious gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall's audit pointed out that officers that worked the shifts
avoided paying taxes on the additional income.
</P>
<P>
   McCall was critical of the Department of Correctional Services
and the Adirondack Correctional Facility leadership for not keeping
a closer eye on the shift exchanges. The comptroller, a Democrat,
also lambasted the Corrections Department's Inspector General's
office in the Republican Pataki administration for looking into
similar complaints in 1997 and failing ''to uncover these blatant
abuses of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The Adirondack prison, which houses up to 713 inmates and
employs 192 officers, changed its swapping policy in October 1999
so that officers with large numbers of unworked swapped shifts were
not allowed to participate in swapping, prison officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Goord said he would change the statewide policy ''reluctantly
because I know the vast majority of our employees realize that no
one should be allowed an open-ended opportunity to swap shifts.''
The department said those changes would include limited time
periods for the repayments of swaps and ban ''two for one'' shift
swaps.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisor of the Adirondack prison, Gale McGuane, who has
been in charge of the facility since April 1999, would not comment
on the charges.
</P>
<P>
   McCall recommended disciplinary action and forwarded the audit
to the state Inspector General's office to possibly pursue charges
against the officers. The Inspector General's office said they are
investigating.
</P>
<P>
   The Correctional Services department said it would not allow the
officers to swap away more shifts until they pay back the old ones,
but did not promise any further penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Two officers resigned after the audit began, though it could not
be determined whether those who resigned knew about the audit or
resigned because of it, McCall's office said. As for penalties
against those two officers who resigned, spokesman James Flateau
said, ''That's something we'll explore.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall staff said the investigation began after they received a
complaint about the swapping practices.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 31.98; Dow Down 26.06  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were narrowly mixed at the start of
trading today as technology investors remained cautious after
Tuesday's steep selloff, and the Dow Jones industrials slipped due
to weakness in financial shares.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq
composite index was up 31.98 at 3,801.61, having recovered from an
initial loss of more than 50 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 26.06 at 11,099.07.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was down 7.15 at 1,460.02.
</P>
<P>
   In a nervous market, even some good news on technology
companies' earnings failed to enliven the sector. Advanced Micro
Devices, a leading computer chip maker, said late Wednesday it
earned $1.15 a share in the first quarter, nearly twice analysts'
forecasts of 58 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro got a powerful lift, rising 7 1/16 to 75 1/16.
But the broader semiconductor sector was mixed, with LSI Logic up 2
to 63 and Applied Materials down 5/16 at 97\.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are reeling from a long, steep slide in the Nasdaq
composite, which last year posted the sharpest annual gains of any
stock market index in history. The Nasdaq has fallen 26 percent
from its peak on March 10, tumbling well into what some Wall Street
professionals consider a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the most fundamental reason for the drop is a
growing sense that investors pushed technology stocks too far last
year, awarding many young, unproven companies valuations they did
not yet deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks kept the Dow lower. J.P. Morgan, which rose
Wednesday after reporting strong profit growth, fell 1 1/16 to 135|
today.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 148.01 million
shares, ahead of Wednesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.43 to 491.01.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.5 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.2 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.02 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 0.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Several Options for Tax Payments  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For millions of last-minute taxpayers who
suddenly realize they owe money to Uncle Sam but don't have the
cash on hand, it could be time to whip out the credit cards or make
an installment payment deal with the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Accountants say there are ways to avoid such an unpleasant
surprise next year, and even people who get refunds should consider
changes to avoid giving the government use of their money for
months each year.
</P>
<P>
   This year's income tax filing deadline is midnight Monday,
except for much of New England and New York. There, it's a day
later because a major IRS filing center is located in Andover,
Mass., where Patriot's Day is a state holiday.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, the Internal Revenue Service had received about
70 million of the 127 million individual returns expected this year
-- meaning millions of people, as usual, are waiting until the last
possible minute.
</P>
<P>
   Charging tax bills via credit is becoming an increasingly
popular choice. As of March 31, about 16,700 people had charged
payments averaging $1,362 this year by calling a toll-free number --
1-888-2PAYTAX-- and putting their taxes on their MasterCard,
American Express or Discover cards. Visa isn't taking part in the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than 53,000 federal tax payments were made with
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're doing is adding an option for people to pay their
taxes and manage their resources on their own terms,'' said Bruce
Zanca, senior vice president at Official Payments Corp., a publicly
traded company contracted by the IRS to run the service.
</P>
<P>
   IRS officials hasten to add that they don't collect or keep
credit card numbers and do not collect any fees for use of credit
cards. An average fee of 2.5 percent is charged by Official
Payments, which keeps part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Another payment option is an installment agreement with the IRS,
which now will approve virtually any arrangement as long as the
amount owed is less than $25,000 and the bill can be paid within
five years.
</P>
<P>
   There is a one-time $43 fee for an installment deal, and the IRS
charges a late payment penalty that drops to a quarter-percent per
month as long as the tax return itself was filed on time. This
year's IRS installment interest rate is 9 percent, which might be
higher than a taxpayer could get by taking out a loan to pay off
the tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS has a calculator on its Internet web site that helps
taxpayers figure out their monthly payment amount, and they can
print out an installment agreement form to file with the agency.
</P>
<P>
   After the tax return is filed, financial advisers say it's smart
to see if changes would improve the picture next year. That
includes people who get big refunds, who are essentially giving the
government the use of their money interest-free for several months
each year -- money that could be invested, put in a savings account,
or used for a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers should examine and adjust the amount of taxes that are
withheld from their paychecks if either their refund or payment was
too large.
</P>
<P>
   ''Keep your withholding down to a legal minimum,'' say advisers
at H&AMP;R Block, the nation's biggest tax preparation firm. ''The
point is for you to get the use and enjoyment of your money when
you earn it, rather than making an unintentional interest-free loan
to the government.''
</P>
<P>
   From the RIA Group consulting firm, here are some other tips on
reducing taxes next year:
</P>
<P>
   --If a balance was owed on the 1040 form, consider increasing tax
withholding and making estimated tax payments to avoid an
underpayment penalty. Most people can avoid that penalty by
ensuring that withholding or estimated payments equal the lesser of
90 percent of the 2000 tax bill or 100 percent of the 1999 tax
bill.
</P>
<P>
   --For a married couple filing jointly with adjusted gross income
over $150,000, estimated tax payments equal to the lesser of 108.6
percent of the 1999 tax or 90 percent of the 2000 tax must be made.
</P>
<P>
   --Married couples who have a child in 2000 can count on a $2,800
dependency exemption, a $500 credit if gross income isn't above
$110,000 and possibly a child care credit of $480 or more.
</P>
<P>
   --Taxpayers can get a home equity loan for major purchases,
projects or other needs. Interest on up to $100,000 of home equity
debt is generally tax deductible, but interest on regular bank
loans or credit cards isn't.
</P>
<P>
   --People should increase contributions to 401(k) plans, IRAs or
other retirement plans that defer taxes.

<HEADLINE> FCC Considers Rules To Help Deaf  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four years ago, as his neighbors in
Greenville, N.C., took shelter from the howling winds of Hurricane
Fran, Kevin Earp slept quietly in his bed.
</P>
<P>
   He had no idea he was in danger. He's deaf, and the local
television stations didn't provide closed captioning for the
weather broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever an anchor would come on during the programs, he would
be talking, yet there would be no captions,'' Earp later wrote to
the Federal Communications Commission. ''I did not really know due
to not being able to comprehend what the TV station meteorologists
were talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   He survived, but Earp's town was part of the region later
declared a federal disaster area.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the FCC acted to ensure that hearing-disabled people such
as Earp have access to emergency information.
</P>
<P>
   The commission unanimously approved a rule requiring
broadcasters to deliver information to people with disabilities
that threaten life, health, safety and property. That can be
accomplished through real-time closed captioning, open captioning,
scrolling words or some other means.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will save lives. It's as simple as that,'' FCC Commissioner
William Kennard said in an interview Wednesday. ''We have many,
many stories of people who, for lack of this information, have
nearly lost there lives. Imagine if there's a flood, a fire, or an
earthquake, and everyone else is evacuating and you have no idea.
This is really a matter of life and death for millions of
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   FCC staff members said they were unaware of any deaths because
of a lack of closed captioning, although they didn't rule it out.
</P>
<P>
   Some broadcasters argued against live-captioning mandates,
saying some stations might shy away from comprehensive disaster
coverage if they were required to provide closed captioning for
everything.
</P>
<P>
   Although broadcasters will be allowed to deliver the information
in a variety of ways besides closed captioning, the FCC is expected
to require them to provide critical information like evacuation
routes and the location of shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The new rule is expected to become effective in about 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Closed captioning is a form of technology like subtitles that
allows people who are deaf or hard of hearing to watch television.
But unlike subtitles, closed captioning is hidden as encoded data
transmitted in the television signal and provides information about
sound effects and background noise. A person who wants to see
closed captions must have a decoder.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the commission ordered TV broadcasters to provide the
service on 100 percent of new programs by the year 2006, with a few
exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the commission has instituted an incremental
transition period. Under the rules, 1,800 hours of new programming
must be closed captioned on each channel this year, 3,600 hours in
the year 2002, and 54,000 hours in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Also under the rules, 75 percent of the old programs -- those in
existence before 1998 -- must be closed captioned by 2008.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Houghton To Seek 8th Term  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under intense pressure from fellow Republicans
in the House intent on holding their slim majority, Rep. Amo
Houghton said today he will seek an eighth term.
</P>
<P>
   The 74-year-old Houghton said in a telephone interview this
morning that he had planned to retire, but was concerned if he did
that his district in southwestern New York might be eliminated when
congressional lines are redrawn after this year's census. New York
is expected to lose two House seats.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a difficult decision because when you get to be my age
you have to wonder whether you should continue in this job or let
other people do it,'' Houghton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the final analysis though there are some advantages to old
age ... people know who you are and what you believe in,'' he said.
''And I've got to work to keep this district together.''
</P>
<P>
   Houghton announced his plans today in his hometown of Corning,
where his family founded the Fortune 500 Company Corning Inc.
</P>
<P>
   A self-described moderate, Houghton was one of two New York
Republicans to vote against impeaching President Clinton. He pushed
instead for a strongly worded censure. He founded The Republican
Main Street Partnership in 1997 to bring together moderate
lawmakers and business executives, governors and mayors. He has
been a staunch advocate for the National Endowment for the Arts and
public television.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton's views have often put him at odds with more
conservative leaders in the House. But many of those leaders --
worried about defending another open seat in November -- lobbied him
aggressively to stay. Democrats must pick up only six additional
seats to regain control of the House.

<HEADLINE> Congress Set To OK $1.8T Budget  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans accused Democrats today of
reverting to ''tax and spend'' ways as the GOP began pushing a
final $1.83 trillion budget through Congress calling for tax cuts,
debt reduction and extra money for defense, education and medical
research.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're trying to move us backwards,'' Rep. Mark Green,
R-Wis., said as the House moved toward a vote on the package. He
said that while Democrats prefer a ''tax and spend and spend and
tax'' philosophy, the GOP plan ''recognizes we have a
once-in-a-generation opportunity to make progress to secure
America's future, and that's what this reform budget does.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the GOP package plans excessive tax cuts that
would be paid for with harmful cuts in unspecified domestic
programs. They said that since Congress would never accept such
reductions, the budget ensures an end-of-year fiscal confrontation
with President Clinton like last year's.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're right on track,'' said Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash.
''We're going to do it all over again this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The House planned to vote on the election-year measure today,
and Senate passage was expected tonight or Friday morning. That
would let the two houses complete the budget by the usually ignored
April 15 deadline for the second consecutive year, underlining the
drive by GOP leaders for Congress to adjourn early this fall for
the political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton does not have to sign the budget, which sets spending
and tax targets for fiscal 2001. But none of the subsequent 13
annual spending bills for next year, which actually provide the
money, or any tax bills will become law without his signature. It
is these measures that will become political battlegrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP plan calls for at least $150 billion in tax cuts through
fiscal 2005, and up to an estimated $215 billion, depending on how
much economic growth occurs over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants $99 billion in tax cuts over the period, plus $96
billion in higher taxes on tobacco and some corporate transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Like Clinton, the GOP would set aside the entire Social Security
surplus -- about $1 trillion over the next five years -- to reduce
the publicly held debt. If achieved, many economists say that would
put downward pressure on interest rates and spur the economy. The
$5.7 trillion national debt includes $3.6 trillion owed to the
public and $2.1 trillion to federal trust funds, such as Social
Security's.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican budget also sets aside up to $40 billion over
five years for creation of prescription drug benefits for Medicare
recipients or other changes in the program. It does not, however,
require action on such a program.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said
Republicans were working on legislation that would establish new
private insurance coverage for prescriptions, with federal
subsidies for lower-income seniors and those with unusually high
prescription drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP budget calls for $311 billion for defense, or about $5
billion more than Clinton wants.
</P>
<P>
   And it sets about $289 billion for many domestic programs,
roughly $30 billion less than the president proposed. That includes
proposed increases for schools, veterans and research -- which will
have to await the coming spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the budget covers interest payments on the federal
debt and automatically paid benefits like Social Security, Medicare
and Medicaid.

<HEADLINE> Assembly proposes bill to toughen punishment for sex offenders  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Sex offenders using the Internet to solicit
minors will face harsher punishment under legislation introduced by
the state Assembly to restructure the state's sex-crime statutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Predators lurk around every turn in the cyberworld, and I
think this is a very important piece of legislation,'' Assemblyman
Joseph Lentol, D-Brooklyn, chairman of the Assembly's codes
committee, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Sexual Assault Reform Act would add five years to the
maximum sentence of a defendant who engaged in sex with a child
after contacting the victim through the Internet. Since 1996, the
state has had a law on the books making it a crime to use the
Internet to cruise for minors with the purpose of having sex with
them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to registering their names and addresses with law
enforcement agencies under ''Megan's Law,'' convicted sex offenders
would also have to provide any computer name or identifying
information to authorities, the Assembly proposal stated.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would require Internet service providers to give
information to all subscribers concerning availability of filters
to block access to sexual material.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said the proposed legislation
''brings us to the 21st century in terms of incorporating the
Internet and other communication technology into crimes resulting
from enticing minors for sexual activities using the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led Senate has passed Gov. George Pataki's
version of the Sexual Assault Reform Act for the past five years,
but the bill had always died in the Democratic-led Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Similarities -- such as creating a new class of offenses to
specifically punish ''date rape'' cases and boosting age limits for
statutory crimes -- exist between the two versions, but Silver said
the Assembly's bill is ''more comprehensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno today praised the Assembly's
move and said both sides would now work together to resolve their
differences.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very, very interested in passing that bill,'' Bruno
said. ''I believe that we'll have to go into conference committees
and see if we can't pass it into law this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions of the Assembly's bill include:
</P>
<P>
   --Making the penalty for engaging in sex with a victim
incapacitated by drugs a Class B felony, punishable by up to 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   --Making possession of a ''date rape'' drug called ''rohypnol'' a
Class C felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison. The Assembly
bill also makes another drug, GHB, a controlled substance.
</P>
<P>
   --Authorizing hospitals performing medical examinations on sexual
assault victims to receive compensation directly from the Crime
Victims Board rather than requiring the victims to cover the
expenses and then seek reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   --Requiring designated health care facilities to institute sexual
assault examiner programs.
</P>
<P>
   --Authorizing permanent funding of rape crisis centers. Such
programs are currently funded on a year-to-year basis through the
state Health Department.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 107.96; Nasdaq Up 26.90  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in another volatile session on
Wall Street today. Technology investors remained cautious after
Tuesday's steep selloff, and the Dow Jones industrials slipped due
to weakness in financial shares.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading, the Nasdaq composite index was up 26.90 at
3,796.53. The index initially lost more than 50 points, then
coasted as much as 92 points higher before slipping back.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 107.96 at 11,017.17.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was down 6.40 at 1,460.77.
</P>
<P>
   In a nervous market, even some good news on technology
companies' earnings failed to enliven the sector. Advanced Micro
Devices, a leading computer chip maker, said late Wednesday it
earned $1.15 a share in the first quarter, nearly twice analysts'
forecasts of 58 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro got a powerful lift, rising 6~ to 74~. The
broader semiconductor sector was higher, with LSI Logic up 2 7/16
to 63 7/16 and Texas Instruments up 5 13/16 at 144 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   But the broader technology group was mixed. Cisco Systems fell 1
7/16 to 63 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are reeling from a long, steep slide in the Nasdaq
composite, which last year posted the sharpest annual gains of any
stock market index in history. The Nasdaq has fallen 26 percent
from its peak on March 10, tumbling well into what some Wall Street
professionals consider a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the most fundamental reason for the drop is a
growing sense that investors pushed technology stocks too far last
year, awarding many young, unproven companies valuations they did
not yet deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Kerschner, chief investment strategist at PaineWebber,
said many technology stocks could see their share prices slashed by
another third before their prices are in line with their earnings
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sharp correction in the 'new new industrials' has not
fully erased their excesses,'' Kerschner said. Large-capitalization
technology stocks that have only recently gone public are most
vulnerable, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks kept the Dow lower. J.P. Morgan, which rose
Wednesday after reporting strong profit growth, fell 5 to 131 11/16
today. American Express fell 4[ to 146].
</P>
<P>
   Bank and brokerage stocks were weighed down by the latest
government report on inflation. The Labor Department's Producer
Price Index showed that wholesale prices shot up 1 percent in
March, led by the biggest jump in energy costs in nearly 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The advance was a worse showing on inflation than the 0.5
percent rise many analysts were expecting.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 340.11 million
shares, ahead of Wednesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.63 to 492.81.

<HEADLINE> Senate to pass 'fire safe' cigarette legislation  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The leader of the state Senate announced
today that his chamber will adopt legislation approved this week by
the state Assembly that would make New York the first state to
require tobacco companies to make self-extinguishing cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that now is the time to do it. New York can provide
leadership for the federal government,'' Senate Republican Majority
Leader Joseph Bruno said at a late-morning news conference at the
state Capitol. The legislation is to be acted on early next week by
the Republican-controlled Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The ''fire safe'' cigarette legislation was passed by the
Democratic-led state Assembly the past three years and again on
Monday, but had always failed to gain enough support in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Frank Padavan, who sponsored the Senate bill,
said with 15 Republican co-sponsors and the support of the
Democratic minority, ''there's no doubt that it will pass the
Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   After the bill is passed in the Senate, it would still need the
approval of Gov. George Pataki if it is to become law.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokeswoman Suzanne Morris said, ''We'll definitely take
a look'' at the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said he has spoken with Pataki and said, ''The governor
said he recognized the merits ... and he'll take a look at it when
he gets it.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of so-called ''fire safe'' cigarettes say the long,
continuous burn of most American cigarettes too often leads to
deadly fires when smokers fall asleep with them in their hands,
leave them unattended or fail to snuff them out.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters and anti-smoking groups praised the Assembly for
passing the Cigarette Fire Safety Act on Monday and today applauded
the Senate's plan to follow suit, saying the move could greatly
reduce the number of fires caused by burning cigarettes left
unattended.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know hundreds of lives of New York City residents and New
York state residents will be saved with passage of this
legislation,'' said Capt. Peter Gorman, president of the Uniformed
Fire Officers Association of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also calls for the industry to meet other
performance standards set by the state Office of Fire Prevention
and Control to limit the risk that cigarettes would ignite
household furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cigarette industry has treated this issue much like the
smoking issue,'' said state Democratic Assemblyman Alexander
Grannis, the bill's Assembly sponsor. ''They've known the problem
for a long time ... They can make a safer product and refused to do
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Cigarettes were the leading cause of fatal fires in New York in
1997, the latest year figures were available from the state Office
of Fire Prevention and Control.
</P>
<P>
   If signed into law, the measure would go into effect April 1 the
following year. Cigarette companies would be required to stop
making non-self-extinguishing cigarettes one year after the measure
goes into force.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Philip Morris said the tobacco giant already is
working on ''cigarettes that are less likely to cause fire when
handled carelessly.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to find a way to make cigarettes that are less
likely to ignite certain fabrics but also appealing for smokers,''
Brendan McCormick said. ''We think this is an issue that's best
dealt with at a federal level.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there is no such thing as ''fire safe'' cigarettes,
preferring instead to classify cigarettes according to their
''reduced ignition propensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Smith, a spokesman for Louisville-based Brown and
Williamson, agreed that self-extinguishing cigarettes don't exist.
</P>
<P>
   If such cigarettes appeared on the market, they wouldn't sell
because ''they'll go out while smoking, they won't burn.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are the characteristics smokers demand,'' Smith said.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- After posting its first membership loss
since 1926, the Southern Baptist Convention has reported an
increase of 122,400 for 1999. The new membership figure --
15,851,756 -- remains a bit below the 1997 total.
</P>
<P>
   The convention is America's largest Protestant body and a
bellwether for conservative Protestant trends.
</P>
<P>
   The denomination said the 419,342 baptisms for 1999 exceeded
1998 and 1997 totals. Sunday School enrollment was down 482 for the
year, to 8,147,457. Total giving rose 5.4 percent, to $7.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The denomination faces continued tension from those dissatisfied
with its rightward direction. This week the 800-member First
Baptist Church of Athens, Ga., part of the denomination since its
1845 founding, voted to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The church said it believes in the personal autonomy of members,
while the national denomination ''appeared to favor increased
pastoral authority.'' It maintains membership in the Cooperative
Baptist Fellowship, a group of 1,800 moderate congregations.

Lutheran leaders act on Episcopal pact, homosexual issues
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Leaders of the 5.2 million-member Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America have decided to press ahead on a unity
pact with the Episcopal Church, despite some opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The Church Council, which sets policy between sessions of the
Lutherans' national assembly, also asked the denominational staff
to consider whether exceptions should be allowed to a 1990 ban on
clergy same-sex behavior and report back in November. The issue
arose when the St. Paul, Minn., region requested a waiver for a
lesbian clergy candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The council rejected a separate proposal for a study on whether
to ordain gay and lesbian clergy who are not committed to celibacy.
</P>
<P>
   Though the latter study -- under consideration since the idea was
proposed last year to the assembly -- was scuttled, the council
called for ''deliberate, and prayerful conversations'' through 2003
on the inclusion of gays and lesbian in church life.
</P>
<P>
   On Episcopal Church relations, the council directed that a
comprehensive unity pact approved by last year's assembly go into
effect next Jan. 1 if the Episcopal Church gives its assent at a
July convention. Lutheran opponents of the pact had asked for
delay.
</P>
<P>
   The council also stated that regional units are not free to
accept or reject parts of the Episcopal pact, as opponents had
requested. There could be further discussions about bypassing rules
on clergy ordination ''in unusual circumstances and with
appropriate consultation,'' the council said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, who say the pact violates Lutheran tradition by
following the Episcopal concept of bishops, met March 26-29 to
organize the WordAlone Network.

Study proposes changing religious oath for future British monarchs
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A forthcoming report commissioned by the British
government will propose that future monarchs no longer be required
to swear allegiance to the Protestant faith, the Daily Telegraph
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The government confirmed that it had authorized a study by Derby
University professors concerning official treatment of British
religions, but said no recommendations had yet been given to Home
Secretary Jack Straw.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, the reigning monarch is head of the Church of
England and Catholics are not allowed to succeed to the throne or
to marry a monarch.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said the report would also put on the national
agenda the elimination of the Church of England as the official
state religion, a status it has held since King Henry VIII broke
with Roman Catholicism in the 16th century.
</P>
<P>
   The academic report was quoted as saying the primacy of the
established church represents a ''historically rooted religious
disadvantage'' to other faiths.

Oklahoma legislator defends amendment on God
</P>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The state lawmaker who wrote an amendment
requiring public school science texts to acknowledge God said that
if a majority of voters in his district didn't agree, ''it would
boggle my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Jim Reese, a Republican and a Methodist, filed
the amendment that would require all books adopted by the state
textbook committee to include ''acknowledgment that human life was
created by one God of the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese said he believes the amendment would aid family welfare
and send a message to textbook publishers. He favors equal
treatment for evolution and the concept that humanity was created
suddenly by God instead of evolving from more primitive life forms.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want publishers to know that the public is not happy with
their textbooks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson has said the textbook
committee did not have the authority last year to require the
publishers to put a disclaimer in science textbooks referring to
evolution as a controversial and unproven theory.
</P>
<P>
   Reese's amendment will probably be sent to a conference
committee with the state Senate.

Second student sues school that banned Wicca symbol
</P>
<P>
   ELWOOD, Ind. (AP) -- The Indiana Civil Liberties Union said a
second student has joined a lawsuit against Elwood High School over
its ban on wearing pentagrams, a symbol of the Wiccan religion.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Shauntee Chaffin is enrolled in the same ''cadet
teaching'' program as the original plaintiff, Brandi Lehman, 17,
who sued the schools in March for not allowing her to wear a
pentagram necklace.
</P>
<P>
   School officials ordered Lehman to remove the necklace when she
participates in a student teaching program at an elementary school.
An interim agreement allows Lehman to wear the jewelry to school,
but not while student-teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Chaffin, who also practices Wicca and wears a similar necklace,
contacted the civil liberties union for help after being subpoenaed
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Lehman, Brandi's father, said she had received
expressions of support since the suit became known. ''Many teachers
and coaches have told her they support her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wicca or Neo-Paganism is a modern variant of nature worship that
reached public notice with Gerald Gardner's ''Witchcraft Today''
(1954).

Ignoring bishop's order, nun speaks in Nebraska
</P>
<P>
   CAMP KITAKI, Neb. (AP) -- Despite being forbidden by the local
bishop to speak in his diocese, Sister Jeannine Gramick told a
group of Nebraska Catholics they should have the right to weigh
deeply held personal convictions against the church's official
positions.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one has the right to intrude on your conscience,'' Gramick
told 60 people at a meeting of Call to Action Nebraska, which seeks
church reforms. ''No one has a right to invade that sacred space
between you and God.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Vatican banned Gramick from ministering to gays
and lesbians because of her liberal views.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz of the Lincoln diocese wrote Gramick
saying he had Vatican authority to forbid her to speak. But canon
lawyers advised Gramick the bishop could not prevent her speech as
long as she did not violate the ban on homosexual ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Bruskewitz drew national attention in 1996 when he said
Catholics in the diocese who did not quit Call to Action and 11
other groups would be excommunicated. The excommunication directive
is still in force.

New Jersey Jewish leaders concerned about Christian missionaries
</P>
<P>
   ABERDEEN, N.J. (AP) -- Reform Rabbi Laurence Malinger has met
with congregants to warn them that missionaries known as Jewish
Christians, Hebrew Christians or Jews for Jesus are gaining more
converts from Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   He's not the only New Jersey Jewish leader concerned about the
evangelical groups' activity. At the Marlboro Jewish Center, Rabbi
George Schlesinger has invited speakers and scheduled discussion
sessions at the Conservative synagogue's school. Educating members
has become a priority, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Goldstein, director of the New Jersey region of the
American Jewish Congress, said those most vulnerable to conversion
are Jews who do not attend synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   There were an estimated 10,000 Jewish Christians in 1978
compared with 350,000 today, mainly in the United States, according
to Mark Powers of Jews for Judaism, an advocacy group that counters
the missionaries. He said Jewish Christians have 400 U.S.
congregations and 100 in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Defamation League provides a more conservative estimate
of 100,000 U.S. converts.
</P>
<P>
   ''In just about every Jewish community, this is a problem,''
Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   Malinger told his congregation, ''I'm not talking about Roman
Catholics, Episcopalians, Methodists, or mainline Christianity. I'm
not talking about 90 percent of the general Christian population.
I'm talking about fundamental Christians who use Jews as a primary
target.''

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>
By JULIA LIEBLICH, AP Religion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Ohio State University student Patricia
Cunningham II is going to not one, but two Passover Seders this
year, and she's preparing with the fervor of the scholar she is.
She's reading Exodus and feminist commentaries, and she's talked to
a couple of rabbis about the holiday's meaning.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that she's not Jewish. She wants to learn more about
the story of Jews' liberation from slavery in Egypt and to talk
about her own African-American heritage -- all over matzoh and wine.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the country, families and communities are inviting
Christians and Muslims, blacks and Latinos to Seders, whether
intimate dinners or gatherings for hundreds to reenact the story of
freedom. For non-Jews, it's an opportunity to learn about the
Jewish experience and tradition; for Jews, it's a chance to see how
others draw meaning from that tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Passover is uniquely Jewish but also universal, says Ruth
Broyde-Sharone, a documentary filmmaker who has shot 95 hours of
Seders with guests ranging from Latino garment workers to a Middle
Eastern imam. This year, she is taking 36 Jews, Christians, and
Muslims on a journey from Egypt to Israel to retrace the Exodus.
</P>
<P>
   ''People from different backgrounds who cannot agree what to
call God come to this ritual meal,'' she says, ''and it's
everyone's story.''
</P>
<P>
   Such Seders were unheard of in the late 1960s when writer Arthur
Waskow decided to open his family Passover meal to ''what was going
on in the street.''
</P>
<P>
   It was April 1968 in Washington, days after the assassination of
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and rioting that followed in many
cities. Soldiers in an armored car were stationed on his corner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Walking home, I thought I'm going to do Pesach (Passover), and
this is Pharaoh's Army,'' says Waskow, director of the
Philadelphia-based Shalom Center, which promotes peace. In the
past, his family had never talked about current events during the
Seder. ''That night we began to talk about what the Seder meant in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   He soon was compiling a new Haggada, the Passover liturgy,
incorporating writings by King and poet Allen Ginsberg into the
traditional text. The Rev. Channing Phillips, a civil rights
leader, offered his church basement for a public Seder, bringing
together blacks and Jews. It drew a crowd of 800.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an amazing, amazing moment,'' says Waskow, now a rabbi.
''To know that our own memory and experience speaks to the
experience of other people always strengthens us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Arthur Schneier, who has hosted Christian and Muslim
diplomats at Seders, agrees. ''The Seder is not only a
reaffirmation of one's faith and one's people, it's also an
opportunity to learn the lessons of oppression and liberation that
are applicable in every part of the world,'' says Schneier,
president of the interfaith Appeal of Conscience Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while inviting non-Jews to a Seder is easy, ''involving
them is the challenge,'' says Adam Shyevitch of The Community
Builders, a Boston group that develops affordable housing. In 1990,
he helped organize a Haitian-Jewish Seder. In addition to the
Jewish matzoh, the participants ate kasav, a bread Haitians make
when they can't afford flour. They recited Haitian poetry, told
Haitian stories of oppression and freedom, and said blessings in
English and Creole.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both of us know what it is like to be strangers in a strange
land,'' the Haggada said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dalai Lama, Tibet's Buddhist leader in exile, donned a
yarmulke at a Washington Seder three years ago, he thanked his
hosts for incorporating into the ritual his own people's efforts
for cultural survival.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal William H. Keeler of Baltimore says he'll never forget
a Seder he attended as a priest in the mid-1970s at the home of
Aaron Feinerman, the board chairman of a local Catholic hospital.
''I had a sense of the Scripture coming alive,'' he says. ''(It)
helped illumine my own preaching during the season, and (it) sealed
my relationship with the family.'' When Keeler was installed as
bishop, Feinerman and his daughter sat in the front row.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rev. Eugene Rivers, of Dorchester, Mass., attends a
Seder, ''I'm there to learn and share,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ''What was most meaningful to me is that the Jewish community
emphasizes the importance of memory, which involves successes and
failures, the great and the banal. It provides a moral and
conceptual basis for a vision of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he says, he's seen some Seders ''become little more than
networking opportunities ... to trade business cards under the
pretext of being a genuine interfaith experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Others warn against allowing Passover to be appropriated by
other faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi A. James Rudin, a leader in interreligious affairs, notes
the holiday's link to Christianity -- ''That's why Jesus was going
to Jerusalem: to observe the Passover.'' -- but says the Jewish
Seder should be ''authentically Jewish. The matzoh is matzoh; it's
not a host. The wine is wine; it's not blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Johann Christoph Arnold, an elder with the Bruderhof religious
community, agrees. The Bruderhof, an Anabaptist pacifist group
founded in the 1920s, has its own Seders with Christian themes. But
he says it would be a ''real disservice to impose my religion'' at
a Jewish Seder. ''I want to feel what (Passover) means to them.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he felt like family at a community Seder in Israel and
with Orthodox Jews in Manhattan. ''We celebrated and had joy in one
another,'' says Arnold, who hopes someday to attend a Seder with
his grandchildren, all 21 of them.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 76.86; Nasdaq Up 72.98  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology investors, chastened after three days
of steep losses, went cautiously back into the stock market today,
but blue chips fell after a spike in wholesale inflation raised new
fears about the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading, the Nasdaq composite index was up 72.98 at
3,842.61. The index again fluctuated, having slipped more than 50
points at the start of trading before moving higher. The Dow Jones
industrial average was down 76.86 at 11,048.27.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were improving after early declines.
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 2.97 at 1,470.14.
</P>
<P>
   Some good news on technology companies' earnings helped lend
support to the shaky sector. Advanced Micro Devices, a leading
computer chip maker, said late Wednesday it earned $1.15 a share in
the first quarter, nearly twice analysts' forecasts of 58 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro got a powerful lift, rising 7 1/16 to 75 1/16.
The broader semiconductor sector was higher, with LSI Logic up 2
7/16 to 63 7/16 and Texas Instruments up 6 1/16 at 145 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   But the broader technology group was mixed. Cisco Systems fell 1
7/16 to 63 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are reeling from a long, steep slide in the Nasdaq
composite, which last year posted the sharpest annual gains of any
stock market index in history. The Nasdaq has fallen more than 25
percent from its peak of 5,048.62 on March 10, tumbling well into
what some Wall Street professionals consider a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the most fundamental reason for the drop is a
growing sense that investors pushed technology stocks too far last
year, awarding many young, unproven companies valuations they did
not yet deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Kerschner, chief investment strategist at PaineWebber,
said many technology stocks could see their share prices slashed by
another third before they are in line with their earnings
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sharp correction in the 'new new industrials' has not
fully erased their excesses,'' Kerschner said. Large-capitalization
technology stocks that have only recently gone public are most
vulnerable, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks kept the Dow lower. J.P. Morgan, which rose
Wednesday after reporting strong profit growth, fell 3 11/16 to 133
today. American Express fell 4 15/16 to 145 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Bank and brokerage stocks were weighed down by the latest
government report on inflation. The Labor Department's Producer
Price Index showed that wholesale prices shot up 1 percent in
March, led by the biggest jump in energy costs in nearly 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The advance was a worse showing on inflation than the 0.5
percent rise many analysts were expecting.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony today before the Senate Banking Committee, Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan dismissed charges that the Fed has
tried to drive the stock market lower by boosting interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have denied and I continue to deny that our job is to
jawbone the stock market; it is not,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 482.47 million
shares, ahead of Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.25 to 495.69.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Bond Prices Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices were lower at midday.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond was down 7-16
point, or $4.37{ per $1,000 in face value, around midday, while its
yield rose to 5.84 percent from 5.81 percent late Wednesday. Prices
and yields move in opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 5.80 percent as the
discount rose 0.01 percentage point to 5.65 percent. Six-month
yields were 6.06 percent as the discount rose 0.01 percentage point
to 5.81 percent. One-year yields rose to 6.13 percent as the
discount rose 0.02 point to 5.82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the
discount is the interest at which they are sold.

<HEADLINE> BBC Assembles New Copperfield Crew  </HEADLINE>
By MARCUS ELIASON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''No cameo parts in Dickens, they're all gems,''
the actor Laurence Olivier once wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Olivier knew what he was talking about. The great man himself
played a small role as Creakle, the headmaster, in the 1970 film of
''David Copperfield.'' W.C. Fields had already played Micawber in
the 1935 Hollywood version.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as if to bear out Olivier's observation, the BBC has
assembled the cream of British theater in an array of cameos --
sorry, gems -- for yet another delightful ''David Copperfield,''
airing on PBS in two parts Sunday and Monday at 9 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   There's Oscar-winner Maggie Smith as David's redoubtable aunt,
Betsey Trottwood; and Ian McKellen (''Gods and Monsters'') as
Creakle, all spindly, wheezing malevolence; and Micawber in the
rotund shape of Bob Hoskins, who these days turns up everywhere
from Showtime (as Manuel Noriega) to TNT as (Sancho Panza) to
moviehouses (as a serial killer in ''Felicia's Journey'').
</P>
<P>
   And then there's a whole army of talent recognizable to the
''Masterpiece Theater'' crowd: Nicholas Lyndhurst, transformed from
his usual chirpy-Cockney persona into the oily schemer Uriah Heep;
Trevor Eve (''Heat of the Sun'') as David's tyrannical stepfather,
Mr. Murdstone; Zoe Wanamaker, a breathtaking ''Electra'' on
Broadway last year, as Murdstone's viperish sister.
</P>
<P>
   This is the BBC's fifth ''David Copperfield'' for television,
and give or take a few plot alterations, it covers all the
traditional terrain in lavish period costume and location shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The story: David (played as a youth by the angelic but never
cloying Daniel Radcliffe) is raised in rural bliss by his sickly
widowed mother (Emilia Fox) and the faithful family maid, Clara
Peggotty (Pauline Quirke). But the idyll ends suddenly when
Murdstone marries David's mother, fires Peggotty and ships David
off first to the sadistic Creakle's school, then to a nightmare job
in a shoe polish factory.
</P>
<P>
   David runs away to his Aunt Betsey, who takes him in. A new life
begins for the hapless boy. Grown up (and stalwartly portrayed in
part two by Ciaran McMenamin), he becomes a reporter, falls in
love, marries the wrong girl, inadvertently brings tragedy upon the
Peggotty family in a memorable disaster at sea, foils Heep's
dastardly scheme to bankrupt his friend Agnes' father, realizes
that Agnes is his true love, marries her and lives happily ever
after. Phew!
</P>
<P>
   From its beguilingly artless opening (''Chapter 1: I am born'')
to the heaving pathos of its final sentence (''O Agnes, O my
soul...'') ''David Copperfield'' is widely regarded as the most
autobiographical of Dickens' 14 novels. Dickens himself hinted as
much, and called it his ''favorite child.''
</P>
<P>
   Every Dickens-lover has a favorite child, be it ''Bleak House,''
''The Pickwick Papers,'' ''Oliver Twist'' or ''Nicholas Nickleby.''
But ''David Copperfield'' contains many of Dickens' most memorable
lines and characters, and the new production faithfully preserves
them:
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Aunt Betsey to her enchantingly loopy cousin, Mr.
Dick, when a ragged, starving David turns up on her doorstep:
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Dick, ... what shall I do with this child?''
</P>
<P>
   Pause.
</P>
<P>
   ''Have him measured for a suit of clothes directly.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Dick..., give me your hand, for your common sense is
invaluable.''
</P>
<P>
   Or the ever-impecunious Mr. Micawber's financial advice to
David: ''Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen
and six -- result, happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual
expenditure twenty pounds ought and six -- result, misery.''
</P>
<P>
   Or Barkis the cart driver delivering his famously terse proposal
of marriage to Clara Peggotty: ''Barkis is willin'.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard, in the TV-jaded consumer culture of today, to
imagine the impact the written or recited word had on Victorian
audiences. At cliffhanger junctures of Dickens' serializations,
crowds would gather in American harbors to await the ships bringing
the latest chapters. In Britain and America his public readings
made audiences weep with sorrow or laughter. Ralph Waldo Emerson
heard a reading in Boston and laughed so hard he felt he would
''crumble to pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   When the author died in 1870, aged 58, the historian Thomas
Carlyle eulogized him as ''The good, the gentle, high-gifted,
ever-friendly, noble Dickens -- every inch of him an Honest Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Today Dickens' popularity in English culture is second only to
Shakespeare's. The names Heep, Micawber, Gradgrind, Pecksniff and
Fagin have become part of the language. And an author dead for 130
years continues to enrich us with gems.

<HEADLINE> Bausch &AMP; Lomb's profit jumps 59 percent to $23.9 million  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Robust sales of eye-surgery products and
disposable contact lenses drove Bausch &AMP; Lomb Inc.'s profit up 59
percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding a $15.2 million gain from a patent dispute with rival
Alcon Laboratories, the world's biggest eye-care company said
Thursday its earnings from continuing operations were $23.9
million, or 42 cents a share, up from $15 million, or 26 cents a
share, a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The results edged Wall Street analysts' expectations of 41 cents
a share, according to First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Sales rose 4 percent to $406.9 million from $389.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   When the litigation gain and $7.4 million from discontinued
operations are included, Bausch &AMP; Lomb posted a net profit of $39.1
million, or 68 cents a share, up from $22.4 million, or 39 cents a
share, in the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Double-digit growth of SofLens66 and PureVision extended-wear
contact lenses helped boost lens sales by 8 percent in the quarter,
but that was offset by a 6-percent drop in sales of lens-care and
vision-accessories products.
</P>
<P>
   Propelled by double-digit growth in sales of refractive surgery
products, its surgical segment revenues jumped 14 percent over last
year. Pharmaceutical sales rose 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bausch &AMP; Lomb is in the midst of a hostile effort to take
control of Wesley Jessen VisionCare Inc., which controls about
two-thirds of the highly profitable cosmetic color-lens market. On
April 3, it launched a tender offer for all outstanding shares of
the Des Plaines-based company.
</P>
<P>
   If it takes control of Wesley Jessen, Bausch &AMP; Lomb will have
combined contact-lens revenues approaching $800 million. That would
put it within distance of market leader Johnson &AMP; Johnson, which
had about $900 million in contact-lens revenues in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Bausch &AMP; Lomb has been refocusing in recent years on eye care --
contact lenses, ophthalmic drugs, and eye surgery instruments -- by
selling its animal-research and hearing-aid businesses and a
sunglasses division that included the famed Ray-Ban brand.

Democratic allies, Republicans pushed through the House today a
final $1.83 trillion budget for next year that calls for tax cuts,
debt reduction and extra money for defense, education and medical
research.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed the measure on a near party-line 220-208 vote,
setting up likely final approval by the Senate later in the day.
Clinton does not have to sign the plan, which sets spending and tax
targets for fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the subsequent 13 annual spending bills which
actually provide the money, or any tax bill, will become law
without the president's signature. With Republicans planning deeper
tax cuts and less spending than Democrats prefer, the election-year
battle lines were already clear.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who would like to spend more are not keeping their eye
on the target: balancing the budget, paying down debt, protecting
Social Security,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The House Budget Committee chairman, Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio,
the budget's chief author, said Clinton considers the plan's tax
cuts too big because he ''thinks we should take our paychecks and
send it all to the government.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats said the GOP plan contained skewed priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a speech to the American Society of Newspaper
Editors, said the Republican budget was ''loaded with exploding tax
breaks and untenable cuts in critical investments.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ''We cannot afford to veer from the proven path onto a
trail of unmet obligations, unrealistic cuts and unnecessary
giveaways. We can't squander the moment by squandering the
surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   And on the House floor, Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, said,
''Any way you want to cut it, the center piece of this budget is a
massive tax cut at the expense of debt reduction, Social Security,
agriculture and defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate approval would let Congress complete the budget by the
usually ignored April 15 deadline for the second consecutive year,
underlining the drive by GOP leaders to let lawmakers go home early
this fall for the political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP plan calls for at least $150 billion in tax cuts through
fiscal 2005, and up to an estimated $215 billion, depending on how
much economic growth occurs over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants $99 billion in tax cuts over the period, plus $96
billion in higher taxes on tobacco and some corporate transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Like Clinton, the GOP would set aside the entire Social Security
surplus -- about $1 trillion over the next five years -- to reduce
the publicly held debt. If achieved, many economists say that would
put downward pressure on interest rates and spur the economy. The
$5.7 trillion national debt includes $3.6 trillion owed to the
public and $2.1 trillion to federal trust funds, such as Social
Security's.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican budget also sets aside up to $40 billion over
five years for creation of prescription drug benefits for Medicare
recipients or other changes in the program. It does not, however,
require action on such a program.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Hastert said Republicans were working on
legislation that would establish new private insurance coverage for
prescriptions, with federal subsidies for lower-income seniors and
those with unusually high prescription drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP budget calls for $311 billion for defense, or about $5
billion more than Clinton wants.
</P>
<P>
   And it sets about $289 billion for many domestic programs,
roughly $30 billion less than the president proposed. That includes
proposed increases for schools, veterans and research -- which will
have to await the coming spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the budget covers interest payments on the federal
debt and automatically paid benefits like Social Security, Medicare
and Medicaid.

<HEADLINE> Three-way Aluminum Co. Deal Nixed  </HEADLINE>
By JASON STRAZIUSO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- France's Pechiney SA , Canada's Alcan Aluminium
Ltd. and Switzerland's Alusuisse Lonza Group AG are abandoning
their three-way, $17 billion plans to create one of the largest
aluminum companies in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Alcan and Algroup will still pursue their two-way, $4 billion
combination, approved by European regulators last month, the
companies said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The three-way merger fizzled after Pechiney and Alcan could not
agree on which assets to sell to satisfy European antitrust
regulators, Pechiney spokesman Jean-Claude Nicholas said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Pechiney and Alcan were forced to withdraw their
application to the European Commission when it was clear the
three-way linkup request would be rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The three companies abandoned merger talks Thursday after it
became obvious that Alcan was not willing to sell its 50 percent
stake in a plant in Germany, Nicholas said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The European Commission set conditions that would have
undermined the industrial logic, strategic rationale and
shareholder value of our respective shareholders,'' Alcan president
Jacques Bougie told analysts in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Pechiney, the third largest aluminum maker in the world, with
consolidated net sales of $9 billion in 1999, said it is in no
hurry to find another merger.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no urgency, mostly because Pechiney is much stronger
financially than it was a year ago,'' Nicholas said.
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, however, analysts say Pechiney will need to
find acquisitions to stay competitive in the aluminum market.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no urgency in the short term,'' said Julian Onillon,
an analyst for CCF Securities in Paris. ''But in the long term they
will have troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   The smaller-scale merger leaves Alcan as a ''second-tier''
company, Onillon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''For Alcan, the merger is a lot less interesting now,'' he
said. ''In the aluminum market, it will become increasingly
necessary to have a large market share.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcan's Bougie said he predicts the combined Alcan-Algroup
company will bring share price increases of 20 to 29 percent over
the next three years. The linkup has yet to be approved by
shareholders and U.S. regulatory officials.
</P>
<P>
   The combination, if it is finalized, will be the latest in the
fast consolidating aluminum industry. Pittsburgh-based Alcoa Inc.,
the world's largest aluminum company, is currently waiting for
regulatory approval on its acquisition of Reynolds Metals.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. shares of Alcan were trading up 12{ cents to $34.37{ on the
New York Stock Exchange, where U.S. shares of Pechiney were down
$1.37{ to $23.06\. Shares of Alusuisse rose 4 Swiss francs in
Switzerland trading to 1,056 Swiss francs ($640.39).

<HEADLINE> Chemical Prolongs Gehrig's Mice  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An experimental chemical significantly
prolonged the lives of mice with Lou Gehrig's disease by blocking
an enzyme crucial for cell death, a finding that holds promise not
just for this killer but for other nervous-system diseases that
afflict millions.
</P>
<P>
   The research at Harvard Medical School may boost efforts already
under way by half a dozen drug companies to create ''caspase
inhibitors'' safe enough to test in people.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings ''provide a compelling argument ... for the
value of caspase inhibitors,'' Mark Gurney of the Pharmacia Corp.,
one drugmaker hunting such compounds, wrote in a review
accompanying the research in Friday's edition of the journal
Science.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea is very worthwhile, no question about it,'' added
Cornell University neurologist Dr. Flint Beal, although he
cautioned that human testing is not yet planned.
</P>
<P>
   Some 30,000 Americans have Lou Gehrig's disease, formally known
as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS. No one knows the cause,
but it results in a creeping paralysis as neurons, or nerve cells,
in the brain and spinal cord that control movement are
progressively destroyed. On average, patients die within five years
of the first symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Caspases are enzymes that signal a damaged or worn-out cell to
commit suicide. Scientists now believe that in a variety of brain
diseases -- from ALS and Alzheimer's to Parkinson's disease and
strokes -- caspases that should be lying dormant inside fairly
healthy neurons are somehow activated to kill them instead.
</P>
<P>
   So if doctors could block caspases' action, they might be able
to save important nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Friedlander of Harvard and Brigham and Women's
Hospital tested mice genetically engineered to get the human
version of ALS. He implanted miniature pumps in their brains to
bathe neurons with an experimental caspase-inhibiting chemical
called zVAD-fmk.
</P>
<P>
   Treated mice showed ALS symptoms 20 days later than untreated
mice -- a long time in a mouse's lifespan -- and they lived 22
percent longer, he reports in Science.
</P>
<P>
   If humans had a similar result, that would equal another 14
months of life, said Dr. Leon Charash, medical adviser to the
Muscular Dystrophy Association, which helped fund Friedlander's
work. In contrast, the only ALS drug sold today prolongs survival
by about three months.
</P>
<P>
   Would it work in people? Nobody knows, but Friedlander did find
some activated caspase in the spinal cords of ALS patients
identical to that in sick mice, a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to test zVAD in people, but said manufacturer Enzyme
Systems Inc. fears the chemical -- created solely for laboratory,
not human, use -- could cause toxic side effec ts. Pharmaceutical
companies ''are waiting for a better drug,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Threats Hit Army Depot  </HEADLINE>
By AMALIE YOUNG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERMISTON, Ore. (AP) -- Bomb threats have stopped construction
nine times in the past six weeks at an Army depot where workers are
building an incinerator to destroy millions of pounds of deadly
chemical weapons stored at the base.
</P>
<P>
   No bombs have been found. The FBI and Army authorities have
declined to comment on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Some workers at the Umatilla Chemical Depot said they are mostly
unfazed, worrying less about a leak of nerve agents than about the
loss of pay.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure that there are some that are scared. And if they
found that guy, he'd be lucky to get off that site,'' electrician
Joe Vandecar said. ''But as far as feeling threatened, no, no, not
a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Feb. 28, nine threats have been called in or been
broadcast over two-way radios used at the site. Each time,
construction has been halted, with workers briefly evacuated to a
safe area or sent home for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to take them all seriously,'' said Lt. Col. Thomas
Woloszyn, who oversees operations at the depot.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1,000 or so electricians, carpenters and other hourly
workers, the time has meant money -- 40 hours' worth.
</P>
<P>
   The depot, near the Columbia River that forms the
Oregon-Washington state line, holds about 220,000 munitions and
containers filled with 7.4 million pounds of deadly nerve and
mustard gas agents -- about 12 percent of the nation's stockpile of
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The incinerator is about two-thirds complete and is scheduled to
be finished next year. Woloszyn said it is not clear if the threats
have pushed back the completion date.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon Demilitarization Co., which is supervising
construction, an electrical subcontractor and two union groups are
offering a $30,000 reward for information about the threats.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Stars Hawk Products in Italy  </HEADLINE>
By VANIA GRANDI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Standing on a cliff high above the California
desert, Marlon Brando muses about the ethics of technological
change.
</P>
<P>
   Crossing a street in downtown Manhattan, Woody Allen converses
anxiously on a mobile telephone with his shrink about
life-prolonging genes.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't scenes from movies but TV commercials, the latest
in a series of Hollywood stars lured by fat contracts to Italian
television. Sharon Stone, Harrison Ford, Richard Gere and Robert De
Niro preceded them.
</P>
<P>
   Both Allen and the generally reclusive Brando are appearing in
separate commercials for the telecommunications giant Telecom
Italia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted personalities of great stature to express their
thoughts on the future,'' Telecom's corporate communications head,
Vittorio Meloni, told a news conference Thursday introducing the ad
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Meloni refused to reveal what the two stars were paid except to
say the total production costs for Allen and Brando and a third
commercial featuring former South African President Nelson Mandela
totaled 100 billion Italian lire, or nearly $50 million at current
exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   Spike Lee interspersed old footage of Mandela with scenes of
children in South Africa's black townships.
</P>
<P>
   The Brando ad shows the bulky 76-year-old star scanning the
horizon and viewing a photograph of his South Pacific island home.
</P>
<P>
   In his characteristic mumble Brando expresses both his fear for
the new communications technology and the regret he won't live long
enough to see all its achievements.
</P>
<P>
   In other frequently run commercials, Stone promotes Martini
spumante, Gere vouches for Ferrero Rocher chocolates and De Niro
puts his weight behind Beghelli's energy-saving lights.
</P>
<P>
   The going wisdom is, actors in the United States will rarely
appear in commercials out of fear it will cheapen their image at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Commercials have a different kind of impact in Europe,'' said
De Niro publicist Stan Rosenfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Gere did the commercials to raise money for charity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The money he raises goes into a foundation for social
causes,'' said Gere spokeswoman Pat Kingsley.
</P>
<P>
   Meloni said Brando was persuaded to do the ad with ''an
interesting package,'' which included the chance of working with
''Top Gun'' director Tony Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Allen directed, starred and -- saying he was good at writing his
own jokes -- contributed to the script for his commercial, Meloni
said.
</P>
<P>
   The ads will only be televised in Italy because of the ''image
rights'' of the artists involved, Meloni said.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers swear the colossal fees paid for the stars translate
into soaring sales and prestige.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian press reported what it said were rumors that Ford
was paid $2.3 million for a commercial for Lancia's Lybra station
wagon.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was absolutely worth it'' to hire Ford, said Lancia
spokesman Alfio Maganello,
</P>
<P>
   ''American actors are very good and very famous and everyone
knows that Italians love them,'' said Nicola Morello, creative
director for Italy's largest advertising agency, Armando Testa.
</P>
<P>
   The Turin-based agency wanted Ford to basically play himself in
the Lancia commercial.
</P>
<P>
   The ad shows Ford leaving his home with a stack of newspapers,
which he drops into a recycling bin. Here, he notices a dried up
bonsai plant and decides to take it for a drive.
</P>
<P>
   Pampered by the station wagon's air conditioning, silent motor
and smooth handling, the bonsai sprouts a leaf by the end of the
journey.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would never hire Harrison Ford to say 'I drive this car, so
why don't you,''' Morello said. ''We want actors to interpret a
story -- and hence they need to have charisma and good looks.''

<HEADLINE> Small Co. Fights Sugar Industry  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A battle raging behind closed doors on Capitol
Hill features a small 60-employee company fighting for its survival
against the powerful sugar industry.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Heartland By-Products of Taylor, Mich., wants to
continue to import Canadian molasses syrup without paying the
tariffs that prop up U.S. sugar prices. The sugar lobby and its
allies in Congress are trying to block them.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lobbying battle reminiscent of David and Goliath -- except
that the little guy has skipped the slingshot and armed himself
with some of the favorite weapons of the industry giants.
</P>
<P>
   To make its case, Heartland has enlisted one of the city's most
influential lobbyists and also hired a public relations firm with a
long list of blue-chip clients.
</P>
<P>
   The multibillion-dollar sugar industry says Heartland is
jeopardizing the price support system by bypassing the tariffs. The
company, which does just $35 million a year in business, counters
it will be forced to close if lawmakers act against it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's morally incorrect for Congress to pick on a single
company and pass a bill to put it out of business,'' declared
Heartland's president, Gregory Kozak.
</P>
<P>
   Heartland has scored one victory in court. But the big sugar
companies are trying to reverse that decision in the halls of
Congress, where Senate and House negotiators are trying to write a
bill to encourage freer trade with Africa and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The sugar provision isn't mentioned in either the House or
Senate version of the bill, but Sen. John Breaux, a Democrat who
represents the sugar-producing state of Louisiana, is seeking to
add it. Heartland is ''smuggling sugar into the country in the form
of molasses,'' Breaux said.
</P>
<P>
   The fight is over a sugar/molasses syrup that Heartland imports
from Canada without paying the higher duties levied against foreign
sugars. The company uses the syrup to produce a sugary product sold
to manufacturers of cereal, hard candy and dairy products such as
ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   American sugar producers and their congressional allies have
fought hard to rub out any threat to the current system that might
allow foreign sugar, which sells for a third of the U.S. price, to
gain a bigger foothold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has plenty of friends on Capitol Hill -- it
contributed more than $1 million to congressional candidates and
the political parties last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, Heartland made just $300 in donations when Kozak
wrote a check to his local congressman, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Industry supporters say the battle isn't about donations, but
rather about preserving a quota system that keeps American sugar
growers profitable.
</P>
<P>
   They are trying to insert a provision in the trade bill
overturning a ruling last fall by the U.S. Court of International
Trade that Heartland did not have to pay sugar tariffs on the
imported Canadian molasses.
</P>
<P>
   To block the move in Congress, Heartland has hired the
high-powered firm of Mayer, Brown &AMP; Platt. The lobbying firm has
counted such major corporations as Boeing, General Electric and RJR
Nabisco among its clients.
</P>
<P>
   Heartland also has some public relations help from BSMG
Worldwide, which has done publicity for such companies as
Microsoft, Philip Morris and Sara Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The company had gone to court after the U.S. Customs Service in
September revoked its 1995 decision that allowed Heartland to
import the sugar syrup without paying the higher tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   Customs acted after 26 senators -- including Breaux and both of
Michigan's senators, Democrat Carl Levin and Republican Spencer
Abraham -- wrote a letter to Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly
urging the department to overturn the 1995 ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was written in support of a petition filed by the
U.S. Beet Sugar Association and the U.S. Cane Sugar Refiners
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The 26 senators who signed the letter received $528,332 in
contributions from the industry between 1995 and 2000, according to
the Center for Responsive Politics, which studies political
donations.

<HEADLINE> Reading Methods Fighting Criticized  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The best way to teach children how to read is
not to fight over the best way to do it, a national panel of
reading teachers, parents and college instructors said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's report sought to quell the dispute over two basic
reading methods -- phonics or whole language. It endorsed neither as
the only way. Instead, it said beginning-reading instruction should
take the best from both: Children should start learning to sound
out letters and words, but also build their vocabularies early.
</P>
<P>
   In whole language, students learn the meaning of words through
the context in which they are used. Phonics teaches students how to
read through sound and letter drills. Reading advocates and
lawmakers Thursday praised the report for helping teachers wade
through a morass of reading research and theories.
</P>
<P>
   ''Teachers have been barraged with conflicting information,''
said Rep. Anne Northup, R-Ky., who wrote the 1997 law establishing
the 14-member panel. ''A six year old is only six once. If we don't
reach these youngsters now, we can't come back 15 years and make it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Education Secretary Richard Riley said the report's findings
provide ''further evidence that the reading wars are over.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate has been fueled by dismal test scores showing that
two-thirds of U.S. fourth graders can't read at the level expected.
Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., said he would seek federal funds to
help children who still can't read after third grade.
</P>
<P>
   Many teachers support whole language because they say it
emphasizes creative writing and immerses children in literature.
Critics say students are not provided the tools to understand what
they read. These building blocks are provided by phonics, they
maintain.
</P>
<P>
   But the dispute is sure to continue on the political front.
Normally debated only in school board elections, the dispute over
how children should be taught to read is now being discussed on the
presidential campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush, in campaign ads
against Vice President Al Gore, cites the use of phonics as a major
educational accomplishment. And in Indiana, Republican
gubernatorial candidate John Price has promised to require all
schools in the state to use phonics when teaching reading to young
children.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen states specifically tell their schools to teach
phonics or other methods such as whole language, said Richard M.
Long, of the International Reading Association. But half of the
state constitutions prevent state lawmakers from getting that
involved in how local schools teach children, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reading advocates will help by posting the information on web
sites and hosting public forums, said Andrew Hartman, director of
the National Institute for Literacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Expecting people to read big, thick reports is unrealistic,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Coppola 'Contact' Suit Dismissed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Francis Ford Coppola's lawsuit against the
late Carl Sagan and Warner Bros. for a share of ''Contact'' book
and movie profits was dismissed because it was filed too late.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 lawsuit claimed that Coppola came up with the idea in
1975 for a TV program called ''First Contact,'' about Earth's
connection with extraterrestrials, and that he had a contract with
Sagan to develop a script.
</P>
<P>
   The series never materialized. In 1985, Sagan published the book
''Contact.'' In 1995, Warner made a deal to produce the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The state Court of Appeal ruled April 6 that it wasn't until
1994, when Coppola was looking for leverage in his dispute with
Warner over ''Pinocchio,'' that Coppola thought about suing over
''Contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Coppola plans to appeal. Warner said it was pleased with the
result. A lawyer for Sagan's widow expressed outrage over the
timing of the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It exceeds all bounds of decency that after waiting over 20
years, he chose to sue Sagan's widow six days after Sagan died,''
Scott Edelman said.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Socialite Patricia Duff says she married

   Duff, 46, said that after she separated from movie executive

her he would give her the family she desperately wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I hesitated because I needed time to decide,'' Duff said
in court papers, Perelman ''repeatedly threatened that if I went
back to my husband, he would destroy both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He said you are both going to get 'whacked,''' Duff said. ''I
had never heard anyone act or speak like that. His threats seemed
very credible to me as he had the capability and the will to carry
his threats out.''
</P>
<P>
   Duff cited 10 incidents in which she said Perelman hit her,
kicked her and called her names.
</P>
<P>
   She filed the affidavit in her bitter fight with Perelman over
custody of their 5-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Perelman's lawyer, Adria Hillman, told the judge in the case
that Duff's physical abuse charges are lies.
</P>
<P>
   The custody trial resumes Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Mechanic Becomes German TV Star  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- When he first lumbered across the TV screen, there
was no indication a superstar lay dormant in the burly unemployed
mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   Known only by his first name, Zlatko, he didn't know who
Shakespeare was. He spoke German like a nonnative. He sang off-key.
He admitted he never read books.
</P>
<P>
   And that's exactly what clicked. Locked inside a house with
other residents of the reality TV show ''Big Brother'' -- a sort of
MTV ''Real World'' taken to an Orwellian extreme -- the 24-year-old
Zlatko seemed to be the only person who was real.
</P>
<P>
   At a time of growing disenchantment in Germany over a political
scandal and perceptions of increasing egotism, Zlatko appeared
open, honest and sincere. Threatened with ejection from the show as
part of its biweekly audience phone vote, fans flocked to support
Zlatko. They composed Web site tributes and wrote songs praising
him as an Average Joerg, just like them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even the politicians cheat on people who elect them ... but at
least Zlatko says what he is, he's honest,'' said Betty Siegel, a
sociologist in Hamburg. ''That is very likable at a time when you
get the impression that nobody's being honest and all are trying to
play games to get the most out of relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his following, Zlatko was voted off the show Sunday. And
that's when things really started to take off.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, he had already recorded a pop song; a tour this
summer is likely. Stern magazine put him on its cover Wednesday and
heralded him as ''King of Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   He's making the rounds of the German talk shows. He's been
besieged by more than 100 interview requests. And the network that
produces ''Big Brother'' is giving him his own reality TV show --
''Zlatko's World.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the $125,000 prize awarded to the last person left
after 100 days on ''Big Brother'' seemed like chump change.
Tabloids have speculated he could earn millions; talk is he's been
offered advertising deals for everything from beer to cosmetics to
exercise equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has as many inquiries as a pop star,'' said Harald
Stoffels, Zlatko's agent. ''Our phone system was overloaded. I've
never seen anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Baring his tattooed arms on ''Big Brother'' while working out
with housemate Juergen, Zlatko always did his own thing under the
camera's eyes. He never put on pretenses to win favor with the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   He and Juergen hung out and played chess, sometimes offending
their housemates with their politically incorrect humor.
</P>
<P>
   Zlatko never tried to act smarter than he was.
</P>
<P>
   Asked who Shakespeare was, he responded: ''Mmm..., I have no
idea if he wrote novels, made films, documentaries, no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation about sex, housemate Kerstin told Zlatko she
thought he was definitely ''hetero.'' ''I'm not gay,'' Zlatko
quickly retorted.
</P>
<P>
   When he was selected by his fellow residents, along with
Juergen, as the two whose fate would be put in the audience's hands
on Sunday, Zlatko's popularity soared.
</P>
<P>
   Fans launched ''Save Zlatko'' campaigns on the Web and composed
songs with choruses of ''Zlatko is our hero.'' Reporters
interviewed his family and friends in Schwabia, where his
Macedonian parents settled.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Big Brother'' show on Zlatko's day of reckoning drew the
highest rating for station RTL II since it's been on the air: 4.7
million viewers, including nearly half the 14- to 29-year-olds
watching TV at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Zlatko was voted out by viewers. Juergen survived and if
he wins, the friends have made a pact to split the prize.
</P>
<P>
   Matthias Biehler, who produced a ''Save Zlatko'' Web site,
speculated that fans were simply confused and those who dialed the
number for Zlatko didn't realize they were actually voting him out.
</P>
<P>
   Zlatko's last name, Trpkovski, wasn't known until after the show
because producers kept it secret. Now it's everywhere. His brother
has launched his own Web site selling T-shirts and coffee mugs
labeled ''The Brain'' and ''Shakesbier?''
</P>
<P>
   Time will tell if Zlatko's fame remains.
</P>
<P>
   ''You did in four weeks what it took me seven years to do,''
comedian Stefan Raab told Zlatko during his TV talk show debut.
''But come and talk to me again after seven years.''
</P>
<P>
   Down-to-earth as ever, Zlatko has no unrealistic expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ''A superstar? I don't know. Someday normal life will return.
Then I'd like to have a little house, a truck garage, my family, my
peace,'' he told the Bild newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his interview on Raab's show, the host gave Zlatko
a copy of Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet'' -- claiming he had the
bard himself sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Zlatko chuckled, but didn't appear to quite get the joke.

<HEADLINE> Patriot Missile Costs Will Be Higher  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fielding a new, more sophisticated version of
the Patriot missile that gained acclaim in the 1991 Gulf War will
cost $2.3 billion more than previously estimated, the Pentagon said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That is about a 30 percent increase, to a total of $10.1
billion, for the version known as Patriot PAC-3.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the added cost reflects an increase in the number
of missiles the Army plans to buy, from 560 to 1,012. The Army
hopes to expand the number even more, perhaps to about 1,300, if
the cost can be covered.
</P>
<P>
   The other portion of the extra cost is due to a higher estimate
of engineering costs and a decision to buy the new missiles over a
longer period of time. Some manufacturing efficiencies are lost in
a longer buy period.
</P>
<P>
   The new Patriot system is expected to be ready for use in
limited numbers next year and will eventually replace the air
defense missiles now deployed with U.S. troops in South Korea,
Germany and the Persian Gulf. The current Patriot system also has
been sold to Japan, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriot is the only weapon now available to U.S. forces for
shooting down ballistic missiles like the Scud missiles that Iraq
launched against Saudi Arabia and Israel during the Gulf War. The
Pentagon believes an increasing number of countries hostile to the
United States will acquire ballistic missiles in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the Army disclosed that it had to hurriedly replace
hundreds of Patriot missile systems in the Gulf and South Korea
because of a glitch that raised questions about whether they would
work in combat. The glitch appeared related to the fact that
Patriot missiles have been on high alert there for long periods.
</P>
<P>
   The new PAC-3 system has upgraded its radar and the firing
station in which troops operate the system. It also has a newly
designed missile that destroys its target by ramming into it at
high speed. The current Patriot missile uses a fragmentation
warhead that explodes near the target. The newer system, known as
''hit-to-kill'' technology, is supposed to be more effective
against enemy missiles armed with nuclear, chemical or biological
warheads. It also is capable of hitting low-flying cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The higher estimated cost of fielding the PAC-3 system was
included in a longer Pentagon report released Thursday on several
major weapons programs. Among other program cost increases reported
were:
</P>
<P>
   -- The Crusader artillery system. Development costs increased by
nearly $1.4 billion, to $4.3 billion. This was attributed mainly to
changes in the program resulting from the Army's decision last year
to ''transform'' itself into a lighter, more mobile and more easily
deployable force for war as well as peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Navy's new-generation destroyer, designated the DD-21.
Development costs jumped by $2 billion, to $5.2 billion. The Navy
has estimated the total cost of building 32 of these destroyers
will be $25 billion.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Pentagon's national missile defense project. A little over
$1.5 billion was added to reflect the decision made last year to
buy 100 missile interceptors instead of 20. This and other cost
increases recently acknowledged by the Pentagon have pushed the
total program cost to $20.2 billion. The Pentagon hopes to have it
ready for use by 2005.

<HEADLINE> Panel Passes Cockfighting Bill  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House subcommittee Thursday unanimously
passed legislation to ban the shipment of birds for cockfighting
across state lines, bringing supporters one step closer to closing
a loophole in federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   ''The public's behind this,'' said Rep. Collin Peterson, the
pro-hunting Minnesota Democrat who sponsored the bill.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation would prevent birds from the 47 states where
cockfighting is illegal from being shipped to the states where it
is still legal -- New Mexico, Oklahoma and Louisiana. Peterson said
that state law enforcement officials have complained that the
loophole makes it difficult to enforce their own states'
cockfighting bans.
</P>
<P>
	   With little discussion, the House Agriculture Committee's
livestock and horticulture subcommittee approved the bill, paving
the way for a vote by the full committee. The Senate Agriculture
Committee has already approved similar legislation sponsored by
Congress' only veterinarian, Wayne Allard, R-Colo.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents had tried to block the vote, acknowledging that it was
difficult for members to oppose the bill. Cockfighting matches
blade-wearing birds in what is often a death match, and spectators
often bet on which bird will win.
</P>
<P>
	   ''Behind the scenes there are people that have concerns about
this bill,'' Peterson said. ''But as you can see here today, nobody
wants to go on record against it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Former Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, who has been hired to lobby
against the bill by the cockfighting industry, said he would now
focus on the full committee.
</P>
<P>
	   ''What we have to do is make members realize that they are
falling into the trap of elitists in Washington knowing what's best
for people around the country,'' said Symms, adding that the
legislation would put ''honest game breeders'' out of business.
</P>
<P>
	   ''If that bill becomes law, then the forces behind the bill
would start in on circuses, rodeos, and dog races, which are also
sporting events which use animals for the entertainment of the
public.''
</P>
<P>
	   He called the bill ''a test of states rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Peterson, the subcommittee's top Democrat, said he had a
quick answer to members who had lobbied him not to bring the bill
up for a vote: ''If you want to have cockfighting, if you want to
have your people in this business, then go to your state
legislature and change the law.''
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson, the co-chairman of the Congressional Sportsmen's
Caucus, was asked by the Humane Society of the United States to
sponsor the bill to counter arguments that the legislation was part
of an aggressive animal rights campaign.

<HEADLINE> Bush Meets Gay Republicans  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Emerging from a meeting with gay
Republicans, George W. Bush today declared he was ''a better
person'' for hearing their stories although he said they still
disagree on such subjects as gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Former presidential contender Gary Bauer, however, warned that
Bush was risking losing conservative support to third-party
candidate Pat Buchanan. He said one idea broached at the meeting --
having a gay speaker at this summer's Republican National
Convention -- would go over ''like a lead balloon.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it would be bizarre to pick somebody to speak at the
convention based on their sexual preference, because once you go
down that road, why don't you pick a transvestite?'' Bauer told The
Associated Press in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   After his meeting, Bush declared: ''I welcome gay Americans into
my campaign.'' While reaffirming that he opposes gay marriage, a
position important to his conservative Republican base, Bush
preferred to focus on the simple fact that he had met with the
gays.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important for the next president to listen to people's
real-life stories,'' Bush told reporters at a news conference at
his Texas headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are people from our neighborhoods, people with whom all
of us went to school,'' Bush said. ''I appreciate them sharing
their stories with me. I'm mindful that we're all God's children.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the primaries, the Texas governor has been trying to
moderate his political image after his appeals to religious
conservatives helped him win in South Carolina in February.
</P>
<P>
   But that shift to the center is raising a new concern: that Bush
might alienate those same conservatives with any concession to
homosexuals, who tend to support Democrats. Exit polling in the
1998 congressional elections found that voters who said they were
gay identified themselves as Democrats much more often than as
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group that met with Bush today said they were
pleased by their hour-long session.
</P>
<P>
   ''The goal was not to change his mind. It was to start a
conversation,'' said Steve Gunderson, a gay former Republican
congressman from Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   David Catania, a Republican city councilman from Washington,
said, ''We went in with the hope and expectation that we would
raise his consciousness on certain issues. We think we've done
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush ''was very interested in the idea'' of having a gay speaker
at the Republican National Convention, Catania said. The discussion
centered on the possibility that Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., might be
that speaker.
</P>
<P>
   In his news conference Bush also:
</P>
<P>
   -- Confirmed reports that he planned to meet with his former
chief rival, Arizona Sen. John McCain, on May 9 in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   -- Criticized the Clinton administration for its handling of the
Elian Gonzalez case. He said the administration had succumbed to
publicity and pressure from Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   -- Responded to criticism from his Democratic rival, Vice
President Al Gore, that Bush's health record in Texas and his
recently announced health care plan amount to ''political
malpractice.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, ''This is a good plan and yet rather debating merits,
the way this man wants to run his campaign is to say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the meeting with the gay Republicans, social
conservatives had said they would reserve judgment, partly because
Bush's campaign had assured them he would stay true to his core
conservative beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Others expressed some concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the meeting that's the problem, it's what he says
when he gets there,'' said Janet Parshall, a spokeswoman for the
Family Research Council in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Log Cabin Republicans, an organization for gays, has
pressured the presumed Republican presidential nominee to take a
stand on such issues as gay marriage. Bush has shunned the group
and was criticized for it during the presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Before today's meeting, some of those who planned to attend said
it was a good first step.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to be talking about who we are and what it's like
to be gay and get a greater understanding of who we are and the
issues that we face,'' said Carl Schmid of the Human Rights
Campaign, a gay political organization in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Huch, a gay activist from northern Virginia, said, ''If we
come out of that meeting at a minimum and have Bush say, 'This is a
good conversation ... I expect to learn more,' considering where
this party has been in the past on gay and lesbian issues, I think
that is a tremendous step in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was arranged by Charles Francis, a gay public
relations executive in Washington whose brother, James Francis Jr.,
is a Bush fund-raiser.

   BP Amoco, Arco Merger Approved
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission today approved BP
Amoco's $27.6 billion purchase of Atlantic Richfield Co., after the
company agreed to sell large oil holdings in Alaska. The merger
will create one of the world's largest oil companies. The approval
requires BP Amoco to sell all of Atlantic Richfield's oil holdings
in Alaska within 30 days to resolve anticompetitive problems. The
FTC had opposed the merger because of concern that the combination,
without such a divestitures, would be able to dominate the West
Coast oil market. BP Amoco already tentatively has agreed to sell
Arco's holdings to Philips Petroleum Co.

   Nasdaq Up 37.26; Dow Down 105.48
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology investors, chastened after three days
of steep losses, went cautiously back into the stock market today,
but blue chips fell after a spike in wholesale prices raised new
fears about the economy. Just before 3 p.m. EDT, the Nasdaq
composite index was up 37.26 at 3,806.89. The index again
fluctuated, having slipped more than 50 points at the start of
trading before moving higher. The Dow Jones industrial average was
down 105.48 at 11,019.65.

   Financial Figures
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Financial figures just before 3 p.m. EDT:
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The biggest rise in energy costs in nearly 10
years led wholesale prices up 1.0 percent in March, the government
reported today. The advance in the Labor Department's Producer
Price Index was a worse showing on inflation than the 0.5 percent
rise many analysts were expecting. The jolt came from a 5.8 percent
gain in energy prices, the sharpest rise since a 7.5 percent
increase posted in October 1990. But outside the volatile energy
and food categories, the ''core'' rate of inflation at the
wholesale level rose a tiny 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the Commerce
Department reported that retail sales in March were up 0.4 percent,
compared to a 1.1 percent rise in February.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan Stands by Rate Hikes
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
today that the market's wild swings in recent days ''are reflecting
the basic underlying forces'' of sharply different rates of return
on high-technology stocks compared with more traditional ones. ''I
think what's happening is that the markets are groping for the
correct balance underlying the system,'' Greenspan told the Senate
Banking Committee. In response to a question, the central bank
chief denied that the dramatic losses in the technology-heavy
Nasdaq index in recent days were caused by the Fed's policy of
raising interest rates. ''I have denied and I continue to deny
''that our job is to jawbone the stock market; it is not,''
Greenspan said.

   IMF Official Defends Globalization
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- International Monetary Fund and Clinton
administration officials today defended their efforts to promote
freer trade and greater integration of the global economy. They
said such steps offered the best hope of lifting hundreds of
millions of people out of abject poverty. Globalization -- the bane
of thousands of demonstrators in the nation's capital this week who
contend that global capitalism has failed to help the poor -- has
gotten a bad rap, said acting IMF Managing Director Stanley
Fischer.

<P>
   First Union Reports 13 Percent Drop
</P>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE (AP) -- First Union said today that profits slumped 13
percent in the first quarter as fee income declined and costs rose
at the nation's sixth-largest bank. Operating profits, which
exclude merger-related costs, totaled $838 million, or 85 cents a
share, meeting Wall Street's lowered expectations. That compares
with operating earnings of $965 million, or $1 a share, for the
first quarter last year. Including charges for First Union's
acquisition of CoreStates Financial two years ago, net income
totaled $840 million, or 85 cents a share, compared with $706
million, or 73 cents a share.

   GM Earns $1.78B in First Quarter
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. earned $1.78 billion in the
first quarter, down 2 percent from a year ago. The results still
beat Wall Street expectations. The world's largest automaker said
today it earned $2.80 a share, in the January-March period compared
to $1.82 billion, or $2.68 a share last year. Earnings per share
increased because fewer shares of GM are on the market now than a
year ago. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial
expected earnings of $2.66 a share in the latest quarter. Revenues
totaled $46.9 billion, a 10 percent increase over $42.4 billion in
the same quarter in 1999.

<P>
   World Online Chairwoman Resigns
</P>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- World Online chairwoman Nina Brink
resigned today shortly after a shareholders group announced a
lawsuit over the Internet service provider's disappointing initial
public offering. A company statement said Brink took the decision
''in the interests of the company.'' Investors had called on Brink
to resign after World Online's share price fizzled following the
March 17 initial public offering and the chief's admission she
divested most of her equity in December. World Online shares jumped
2.7 percent to finish the day at 18.85 euros ($18.10) after the
resignation was announced about 15 minutes before the close of
trading. The price was still less than half the offering price of
43 euros ($41.30).

<P>
   European Bank Hints at Rate Hike
</P>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The European Central Bank kept key
interest rates steady today but dropped several warnings about
Europe's fragile economic recovery and hinted a rate hike is around
the corner. ECB President Wim Duisenberg said ongoing labor
negotiations throughout the 11 countries using Europe's common
currency, the euro, could spur inflation if unions push through
excessive wage increases. He said inflation could also snowball if
the euro doesn't gain value against the dollar.

   European Stocks Close Higher
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- European stocks closed marginally higher today,
dragged down by a faltering technology sector. Shares rallied a

trading. The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of shares in European companies
fell 0.12 points to 384.84 and the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index ended
down 0.04 points at 430.79. In domestic markets, London's FTSE-100
Share Index rose 6.2 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,357.0. In Paris,
the CAC 40 closed up 25.64 points or 0.4 percent at 6,264.34
points. In Milan, the blue-chip MIB30 index gained 0.2 percent, or
110 points, to close at 45,534, while the overall Mibtel index rose
0.2 percent, or 55 points, to 30,894.

   Three-Way Aluminum Co. Deal Nixed
</P>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- France's Pechiney SA , Canada's Alcan Aluminium
Ltd. and Switzerland's Alusuisse Lonza Group AG are abandoning
their three-way, $17 billion plans to create one of the largest
aluminum companies in the world. Alcan and Algroup will still
pursue their two-way, $4 billion combination, approved by European
regulators last month, the companies said in a statement today. The
three-way merger fizzled after Pechiney and Alcan could not agree
on which assets to sell to satisfy European antitrust regulators,
Pechiney spokesman Jean-Claude Nicholas said. Last month Pechiney
and Alcan were forced to withdraw their application to the European
Commission when it was clear the three-way linkup request would be
rejected.

<HEADLINE> 'American Psycho': Minor Cult Item  </HEADLINE>
By HILLEL ITALIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Reading to a standing-room-only crowd at Barnes
&AMP; Noble, Bret Easton Ellis didn't suggest a youth icon or a man who
inspired hate mail. He's a modest sort, pudgy and balding, his
voice less a sharpened blade than a dull whine, like a waiter
reciting the daily specials.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old novelist was at the store this week to promote
his latest book, 1999's ''Glamorama,'' but audience members wanted
to talk about ''American Psycho,'' his notorious riff on a
sociopathic yuppie that comes out Friday as a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, there were death threats before the book came out,''
Ellis told a young-looking gathering of about 100 men and women,
some sitting cross-legged in the aisles, others standing tippy-toe
in the back. ''The threats stopped once people had the chance to
read it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 years after publication, ''American Psycho'' has
evolved from a reviled media obsession to a minor cult item. More
than 400,000 copies are in print -- it's Ellis' most popular work --
with more than 80,000 shipped this year because of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said he still gets letters, mostly positive. College
students send him their theses, and fans maintain Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cushman, manager of the New York-based Murder Ink bookstore,
said the gory 1991 novel has been a slow but steady seller.
</P>
<P>
   ''When people buy it at the store, they don't just happen to
find the book, they're looking for it,'' Cushman said Thursday.
''We have some people who just want serial killer books, the
grislier the better. Other people have heard something about it.
Controversy will pique their interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Set during the stock-market boom of the 1980s, ''American
Psycho'' tells the story of Wall Street hotshot Patrick Bateman,
whose interests run to serial killing. Like such earlier Ellis
novels as ''Less Than Zero,'' the book was a catalog of materialism
and amorality, but many wondered whether the author satirized or
symbolized the subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   Feminists attacked its encyclopedic depictions of violence
against women, with the Los Angeles chapter of the National
Organization for Women playing excerpts on an information hot line.
Some bookstores refused to carry it and Ellis said he received 13
death threats.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis' publisher, Simon &AMP; Schuster, dropped ''American Psycho''
despite having paid a $300,000 advance. Vintage Books quickly
acquired the novel but did not send Ellis on a tour and included no
promotional material in copies mailed to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Most critics hated the book.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Yardley of The Washington Post called it ''a
contemptible piece of pornography.'' Norman Mailer, writing in
Vanity Fair, defended Ellis' right to be published but believed
''American Psycho'' the work of ''a half-competent and narcissistic
young pen.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's amazing to me the book still sells,'' said Roger
Rosenblatt, a columnist for Time who panned the novel back then in
The New York Times. ''I think the fact that 400,000 copies are in
print doesn't mean it's any good. It just means 400,000 people are
interested in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie version is more lighthearted and less bloody, but it,
too, has had some trouble. An anti-violence group in Toronto, where
the film was made, pointed out that a local serial killer had owned
a copy of ''American Psycho.'' Although at least one of the murders
happened before Ellis' book came out, the production team lost
permission for some location shooting and had to build sets
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ''In one case, we were going to use a real office building for
where Patrick works, but the landlord got scared,'' explained Mark
Urman, co-president of the film's distributor, Lions Gate
Releasing.
</P>
<P>
   Rock star Huey Lewis, whose ''Hip to be Square'' becomes music
for Bateman to murder by, pulled the song from the soundtrack
album. (It remains in the movie).
</P>
<P>
   The film version was made by a woman, Mary Harron, and stars
British actor Christian Bale. Ellis called the adaptation
''intelligent'' and true to the book.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Kotek of Raleigh, N.C., who set up a Web site for the book
(http://www.dweworldcom.com/brian/psycho/psycho.cfm), said he finds
the book ''hilarious, or at least the non-killing parts are.'' He
also appreciated the book's critique of materialism, and concluded,
''It's also very controversial, and Americans love controversy.''

<HEADLINE> Anthony Hopkins Becomes U.S. Citizen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sir Anthony Hopkins has become a Yank, but he
hasn't given up his British citizenship or his title.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has taken a dual citizenship,'' his spokeswoman Catherine
Olim said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge administered the oath of citizenship on
Wednesday. The ''Silence of the Lambs'' star, who received a
knighthood eight years ago, was joined by friends, including Steven
Spielberg, during the courthouse ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been his home for some time and it seemed like the
right thing to do,'' Olim said.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins, 62, will be able to keep his British title of ''Sir.''

<HEADLINE> Boeing Warns of Wrong Jet Rivets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co. has warned airlines and federal
regulators that rivets that reinforce a plane's structure need to
be replaced in 27 747-400 jumbo jets.
</P>
<P>
   A mechanic at Boeing's Wichita, Kan., plant discovered that as
many as 1,000 of the wrong kind of rivets had been installed on
each of the 27 aircraft, 10 of which have been delivered and are in
service with airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing spokeswoman Shannon Myers said the rivets used on the
upper deck and main deck of the jumbo jets do not pose a flight
safety risk. Myers said, however, that the rivets do help reinforce
part of the plane's structure and that those used cannot handle the
stresses involved.
</P>
<P>
   She said about 300 to 1,000 rivets on each plane were at issue --
a small number given the tens of thousands of rivets used in each
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The company will issue a service bulletin in a few days telling
its customers how to fix the problem. Boeing itself will have to
take an additional three days per aircraft to fix the problems on
the airplanes still under construction. Myers said the problem
would not affect the number of deliveries Boeing hopes to make this
month.
</P>
<P>
   This is the eighth instance of manufacturing and parts problems
Boeing has faced since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   There also have been problems with loose nuts on next-generation
737 aircraft, improper fasteners on various aircraft models and
weakened wing structure supports in a few planes.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration recently completed a full
survey of Boeing's supply and manufacturing processes. The FAA
plans to issue a joint ''action plan'' with the company to rectify
the problems. That plan will likely be released in early summer.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 169.39; Nasdaq Down 11.07  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A fragile advance by technology stocks
evaporated today, as weakness in the blue-chip Dow industrials
spread to the broader market. Stocks came under pressure after a
spike in wholesale inflation raised new fears about the economy.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
Nasdaq composite index was down 11.07 at 3,758.56. The index had
risen as much as 145 points earlier in the session.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 169.39 at 10,955.74.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 11.95 at 1,455.22.
</P>
<P>
   Some good news on technology companies' earnings helped lend
support to the shaky sector. Advanced Micro Devices, a leading
computer chip maker, said late Wednesday it earned $1.15 a share in
the first quarter, nearly twice analysts' forecasts of 58 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro stock got a powerful lift today, rising 5} to
73}. The broader semiconductor sector was higher, with LSI Logic up
1 to 62 and Texas Instruments up 4~ to 144.
</P>
<P>
   But there were still signs of discomfort in the broader
technology group. Some of the Nasdaq's most volatile stocks turned
sharply lower, proving that the nervousness that has dominated
trading this week still hangs over Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Juniper Networks fell 11 1/16 to 193 1/16, while Rambus lost 13
13/16 to 200. Just Wednesday, Rambus reported a quarterly loss of
$6.98 per share, citing acquisition costs and one-time expenses.
</P>
<P>
   That was apparently too steep for many investors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any bottom-fishing that occurs will be among stable companies
that make money,'' said Michael Strauss, managing director of
Commonfund Asset Management. ''The heyday for stocks that have a
good story but no earnings is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors are skittish after a long, steep slide in the Nasdaq
composite, which last year posted the sharpest annual gains of any
stock market index in history. The Nasdaq has fallen more than 23
percent from its peak of 5,048.62 on March 10, tumbling well into
what some Wall Street professionals consider a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the most fundamental reason for the drop is a
growing sense that investors pushed technology stocks too far last
year, awarding many young, unproven companies valuations they did
not yet deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Kerschner, chief investment strategist at PaineWebber,
said many technology stocks could see their share prices slashed by
another third before they are in line with their earnings
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sharp correction in the 'new new industrials' has not
fully erased their excesses,'' Kerschner said. Large-capitalization
technology stocks that have only recently gone public are most
vulnerable, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks kept the Dow lower. J.P. Morgan, which rose
Wednesday after reporting strong profit growth, fell 5\ to 131 7/16
today. American Express fell 3 13/16 to 146 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Bank and brokerage stocks were weighed down by the latest
government report on inflation. The Labor Department's Producer
Price Index showed that wholesale prices shot up 1 percent in
March, led by the biggest jump in energy costs in nearly 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The advance was a worse showing on inflation than the 0.5
percent rise many analysts were expecting.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony today before the Senate Banking Committee, Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan dismissed charges that the Fed has
tried to drive the stock market lower by boosting interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have denied and I continue to deny that our job is to
jawbone the stock market; it is not,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 826.45 million
shares, behind Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.03 to 492.41.

<HEADLINE> FCC Requires Closed Captioning  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Broadcasters and cable operators must transmit
emergency information to people with hearing disabilities in the
event of floods, fires, earthquakes or other disasters under rules
adopted Thursday by the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The commission unanimously approved rules that give the deaf and
hard of hearing access to information that threatens life, health,
safety and property. That can be accomplished through real-time
closed captioning, open captioning, scrolling words or some other
means.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is essential that emergency information be provided,'' FCC
Chairman William Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
   The rules come after complaints that some people with
disabilities nearly lost their lives during Hurricane Fran and
Hurricane Floyd because weathercasts did not carry closed
captioning.
</P>
<P>
   Although broadcasters will be allowed to deliver the information
in a variety of ways besides closed captioning, the FCC rules
require them to provide critical information like evacuation routes
and the location of shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The new rule is expected to become effective in about 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Closed captioning is a form of technology that transmits
information as encoded data in the television signal. A person who
wants to see closed captions must have a decoder.

<HEADLINE> S.C. Senate Votes To Remove Flag  </HEADLINE>
By LEIGH STROPE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A bill to remove the Confederate flag from
South Carolina's Statehouse dome cleared the final Senate hurdle
today, but the NAACP said today that the move won't end a racially
tinged controversy that led to a punishing tourism boycott and new
scrutiny of Southern heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved a compromise bill, 36-7 -- the same vote as
Wednesday night's preliminary approval, which came exactly 139
years after the Civil War began when Confederate troops fired on
Fort Sumter, the federal installation in Charleston harbor. All
opponents were Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one more hurdle that has been overcome,'' said
Democratic Gov. Jim Hodges, who supports flag removal.
</P>
<P>
   Now that today's procedural vote has been taken, the bill still
needs approval by the Republican-controlled House, which has twice
refused to pass such a measure in the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would remove the banner from the dome and place a
similar battle flag behind an existing monument honoring
Confederate soldiers in front of the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The flag would fly from a pole no taller than 20 feet -- shorter
than the monument in front of it -- an element added to satisfy
black lawmakers and others who did not want the flag in a prominent
position to passers-by. Six black lawmakers were among those voting
for it.
</P>
<P>
   But the South Carolina NAACP today issued a statement rejecting
the plan and stating that its tourism boycott would continue.
</P>
<P>
   The location still represents a position of sovereignty, and it
is still too visible, state NAACP President James Gallman said. The
organization's executive committee voted unanimously against the
proposal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate plan ''adds insult to injury,'' said Nelson Rivers,
field operations director for the national organization and a
former official in the South Carolina conference. NAACP President
Kweisi Mfume said the national organization backs the state
conference's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ralph Anderson, one of the black senators who backed the
proposal, said he appreciated the NAACP's efforts, but ''as a
senator, we had to work and look at the whole picture. I felt that
we got the best deal that we could and created an atmosphere that
would create better race relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The NAACP could come to accept the flag at the monument to the
Confederate soldiers,'' he said. ''I think they know that this is
better than what we had. I think the nation will understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would remove Confederate flags hanging in the
House and Senate chambers, and protect monuments, memorials and
buildings erected or named in honor of the Confederacy or civil
rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have fought this thing and we have fought this thing, and
the olive branch is now out on both sides,'' said Republican Sen.
Glenn McConnell, who owns a Confederate memorabilia shop in
Charleston. He spoke before the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People took the stance against the
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is the only state that flies the Confederate flag
above its Statehouse. Opponents say it is a racist symbol, while
supporters say it represents Southern heritage and honors
Confederate war dead. Only the Legislature can take down the flag,
which has flown since 1962.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is not a new one. In 1994, the House adjourned
without considering a Senate-approved plan to remove the flag and
in 1997 shot down Republican Gov. David Beasley's attempt to get
the flag moved. Beasley lost to Hodges a year later.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate just last week couldn't decide whether to discuss,
let alone agree on, the flag's removal. But key senators reached a
compromise they thought would satisfy flag supporters and
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Not all senators were on board.
</P>
<P>
   ''Race relations will not be the same in this state in my
lifetime if you take that flag down,'' said Republican Sen. Harvey
Peeler. He said ''the rebels would yell'' if the flag was removed
because they do not want to be told what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of supporters with Confederate flags decorating hats,
shirts, belts and jewelry lined up to get inside the Senate gallery
to watch Wednesday's debate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a nonpartisan, binding referendum,'' Steven Roark
said. ''The people who lost their lives for that flag didn't know
anything about politics. They just knew they had to pick up the
squirrel gun and fight for the farm.''
</P>
<P>
   As the debate continued, tennis player Serena Williams, who's
black, withdrew from the Family Circle Cup next week in Hilton Head
Island, the biggest sports name to back the NAACP's tourism
boycott.
</P>
<P>
   The boycott, which took effect Jan. 1, has also been honored by
the New York Knicks basketball team and the American Bar
Association. Industry officials in February estimated that South
Carolina had lost almost $7 million in cancellations of conventions
and meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has even been discussed by presidential candidates.
Both Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain refused
to take a position on the flag, calling it a local issue.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and his then-challenger, former New
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, both said the flag should come down.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. led hundreds of
supporters on a five-day, 120-mile march to Columbia to ask
lawmakers to remove the flag.

<HEADLINE> Jury Gives Victim's Kids $9M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A jury has ordered a physicians group to
pay $9 million to the children of a man who died of a brain
aneurysm the size of a golf ball.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors could have saved the life of Gabriel Anderson, 24, if
they had operated before the aneurysm burst, argued a lawyer for
Anderson's children, ages 3, 5, and 7.
</P>
<P>
   The jury returned the verdict Tuesday against Florida Emergency
Physicians, Kang &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Ramsey, a lawyer for the doctors, said the physicians
provided excellent care and nobody should be blamed for Anderson's
death.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are deadly conditions and the patients can die despite
the best of care,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> RETRANSMITTING to fix state coding  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists have used a chemical to delay the
onset of Lou Gehrig's disease in mice and prolong their lives by
blocking an enzyme crucial for cell death -- a finding that holds
promise not just for deadly Lou Gehrig's disease but for other
degenerative nerve disorders that afflict millions.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard Medical School research may boost efforts already
under way by half a dozen drug companies to create so-called
''caspase inhibitors'' safe enough to test in people suffering a
variety of brain diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings ''provide a compelling argument ... for the
value of caspase inhibitors,'' Mark Gurney of the Pharmacia Corp.
of Peapack, N.J., one drugmaker pursuing the compounds, wrote in a
review accompanying the research in Friday's edition of the journal
Science.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea is very worthwhile, no question about it,'' added
Cornell University neurologist Dr. Flint Beal, although he
cautioned that human testing is not yet planned.
</P>
<P>
   Some 30,000 Americans have Lou Gehrig's disease, formally known
as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS. No one knows the cause,
but it results in a creeping paralysis as neurons, or nerve cells,
in the brain and spinal cord that control movement are
progressively destroyed. On average, patients die within five years
of the first symptoms, as paralysis leaves them unable to eat or
breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Caspases are enzymes that signal a damaged or worn out cell to
commit suicide. Scientists now believe that in a variety of brain
diseases -- from ALS and Alzheimer's to Parkinson's disease and
strokes -- caspases that should be lying dormant inside fairly
healthy neurons are instead activated to kill them.
</P>
<P>
   If doctors could block the caspases' action, they might be able
to save important nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's one of the things I find most exciting,'' said Dr.
Robert Friedlander of Harvard and Brigham and Women's Hospital, who
conducted the new ALS research. ''A drug that's going to work for
one of these diseases is likely going to work'' for several.
</P>
<P>
   Friedlander tested mice that were genetically engineered to get
the human version of ALS. He implanted miniature pumps in their
brains to bathe neurons with an experimental caspase-inhibiting
chemical called zVAD-fmk.
</P>
<P>
   The treated mice showed ALS symptoms 20 days later than
untreated mice -- a long time in a mouse's lifespan -- and they lived
22 percent longer, he reports in Science.
</P>
<P>
   If humans had a similar result, that would equal another 14
months of life, said Dr. Leon Charash, medical adviser to the
Muscular Dystrophy Association, which helped fund Friedlander's
work. In contrast, the only ALS drug sold today prolongs survival
by about three months.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, Friedlander stressed, was his discovery that
caspases don't just abruptly kill off a damaged cell. Instead,
their activity in one cell is essentially contagious, affecting the
secretion of toxic substances that make neighboring neurons too
sick to work properly.
</P>
<P>
   So while ''it's not a cure,'' he said giving zVAD to mice very
early in the disease apparently protected some neurons that
caspases had just started sickening.
</P>
<P>
   Would it work in people? Nobody knows, but Friedlander did find
in the spinal cords of ALS patients some activated caspase
identical to that in sick mice, a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   But pharmaceutical companies are waiting for a better drug
before testing it in people, said Friedlander, who found similar
results a year ago when he tested a caspase-inhibiting chemical in
mice with Huntington's disease, another incurable killer.
</P>
<P>
   He said he does want to test zVAD in people, but its maker fears
it could cause serious side effects. The chemical was created
solely for laboratory use, not as a potential human drug.
</P>
<P>
   A woman answering the phone at California-based manufacturer
Enzyme Systems declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   The drug also would require direct infusion into the brain or
spinal cord, ''no trivial matter,'' Cornell's Beal cautioned.
Still, he said, ''This is a desperate illness'' and he expects high
patient demand for any caspase inhibitor that makes it to human
testing.
</P>
<P>
   Half a dozen companies, including Pharmacia and drug giant Merck
&AMP; Co. of Whitehouse Station N.J., are trying to create caspase
inhibitors. When asked if human tests were foreseeable within the
year, Pharmacia's Gurney said not with his company's version; Merck
officials didn't comment.

<HEADLINE> Dismissal for judge who abused defendants, condemned dog  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A judge accused of swearing at defendants,
violating their rights and of ordering a neighbor's dog destroyed
after seeing it running loose should be removed from the bench, a
state commission recommended Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas R. Buckley allegedly ordered ''Baby,'' a 12-year-old
beagle, to be put to sleep. He held no hearing on the issue and no
witnesses except himself saw the dog running free, the state
Commission on Judicial Conduct said.
</P>
<P>
   Baby's case was one of nine instances of alleged misconduct by
Buckley, justice of the town and village courts of Dannemora, near
Plattsburgh, cited by the eleven-member panel. Buckley was also
accused of swearing at defendants and denying them fundamental
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''This record portrays a biased judge who routinely denies
defendants their fundamental rights and ignores proper criminal
procedure,'' the commission ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, 73, a retired phone worker, has been justice of
Dannemora's Town Court since 1987, and an acting Village Court
justice since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's ruling included a colorful account of a judge
accused of writing in his docket that he charged and forgave one
defendant without the accused ever being aware of the charge. He is
also accused of more than once refusing to recuse himself on cases
with which he was personally involved.
</P>
<P>
   Among the charges against Buckley:
</P>
<P>
   --In 1997, the judge allegedly misinformed a person heading to
jail of the day a tuberculosis test was given. The test was
mandatory for the person's entry to the jail. The court record says
that when the defendant explained why he had not reported for the
test, Buckley said he was not taking ''the (expletive) blame'' and
sent him to jail without bail.
</P>
<P>
   --Responding to one complaint, Buckley allegedly told the
commission there was something about a defendant that reminded him
of ''gypsy contractors'' so that he gave the accuser in the
harassment case, who was an acquaintance of the judge, more
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   --In one case, Buckley told the commission that he wanted to keep
a probate in jail for his own benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't want to know what I think'' of the ruling, Buckley
said Thursday when contacted at home. When told that his removal
was recommended, he said he agreed with the commission on that
determination and would not appeal to the state's highest court,
the Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's all I can say that you can put in the paper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley added that he is considering resigning. If the
commission's ruling ousting him from the bench goes into force,
Buckley would be prohibited from ever holding judicial office again
in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Buckley judicial fate, it comes too late for Baby, who
was killed last year after the judge's order.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was either that, or go to jail for her'' the dog's owner,
Mark Bordeau, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bordeau said that Buckley added insult to injury by his language
in court.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know any stupid ass that would go to jail over a
dog,'' the judge is quoted as saying in the commission's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Ten members of the judicial panel voted for Buckley's dismissal.
The other member was absent.

<HEADLINE> FDA OKs Use of Clot-Busting Tool  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A device used to remove blood clots from the
heart won government approval Thursday for use on leg arteries.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration approved the additional use of
AngioJet for clearing blockages in the leg, a problem for thousands
of diabetics and others with high blood pressure, high cholesterol
and the overweight.
</P>
<P>
   AngioJet, which won approval last year for heart use, is a
catheter containing a steel and a plastic tube. The end of the
metal tube is bent into a halo shape and shoots a jet of saline
solution back into the tip of the plastic one, creating a vacuum
that pulls along any blood clots.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment with the device takes about one minute, FDA said.
</P>
<P>
   The new use will assist patients with peripheral vascular
disease, which develops when the arteries carrying blood to the
legs become narrow or clogged, stopping the flow of blood.
Currently, these clots are generally treated with drugs, but those
can cause bleeding problems and, if left untreated, the clots can
lead to amputation of the leg.
</P>
<P>
   AngioJet is made by Possis Medical Inc. of Minneapolis.

<HEADLINE> Senate to pass 'fire-safe' cigarette legislation  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The leader of the state Senate said Thursday
his chamber will pass legislation early next week that would make
New York the first state to require tobacco companies to sell
self-extinguishing cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that now is the time to do it. New York can provide
leadership for the federal government,'' Senate Republican Majority
Leader Joseph Bruno said at a news conference at the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The Cigarette Fire Safety Act was passed by the Democratic-led
state Assembly the past three years and again on Monday, but had
always failed to gain enough support in the Republican-controlled
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   GOP Sen. Frank Padavan, who sponsored the Senate bill, said with
15 Republican co-sponsors and the support of the Democratic
minority, ''there's no doubt that it will pass the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   After the bill is passed in the Senate, it would still need the
approval of Gov. George Pataki if it is to become law.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokeswoman Suzanne Morris said, ''We'll take a look at
it when we get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of so-called ''fire-safe'' cigarettes say the long,
continuous burn of most American cigarettes too often leads to
deadly fires when smokers fall asleep with them in their hands,
leave them unattended or fail to snuff them out. They said the bill
could greatly reduce the number of fires caused by burning
cigarettes left unattended.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarettes were the leading cause of fatal fires in New York in
1997, the latest year figures were available from the state Office
of Fire Prevention and Control.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know hundreds of lives of New York City residents and New
York state residents will be saved with passage of this
legislation,'' said Capt. Peter Gorman, president of the Uniformed
Fire Officers Association of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the legislation would require tobacco companies to
make cigarettes that stop burning if they're not smoked within a
certain time period. It also calls for the industry to meet other
performance standards to be set by the state Office of Fire
Prevention and Control to limit the risk that cigarettes would
ignite household furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   If signed into law, the measure would go into effect April 1,
2001. The industry would be required to stop marketing
non-self-extinguishing cigarettes in New York one year after that
date.
</P>
<P>
   Federal legislation on the issue would pre-empt the state bill,
Padavan said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Philip Morris said the tobacco giant already is
working on ''cigarettes that are less likely to ignite certain
fabrics but also appealing for smokers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We think this is an issue that's best dealt with at a federal
level,'' Brendan McCormick said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that there is no such thing as ''fire safe''
cigarettes, preferring instead to classify cigarettes according to
their ''reduced ignition propensity.''
</P>
<P>
   McCormick said one example of what Philip Morris is working on
is a ''banded'' cigarette paper, which has compounds at regular
band intervals that induce the cigarette to stop burning.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Smith, a spokesman for Louisville-based Brown and
Williamson, said smokers don't want a self-extinguishing cigarettes
if they will go out while they are being smoked.

<HEADLINE> Powell: No VP, Maybe Cabinet  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO N.C. (AP) -- Colin Powell hasn't changed his mind
since 1995. The retired general still insists the presidency or
vice presidency still isn't in his future.
</P>
<P>
   When the conversation moves to a Cabinet position however, that
opportunity just might make the former Joint Chiefs of Staff
rethink a few things.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no interest in being vice president. I'm not being coy
or cute. ... I admire people who seek political office but you need
to have a certain type of passion for that,'' Powell said, en route
to North Carolina for an event this week for America's Promise, The
Alliance For Youth, the volunteering and mentoring organization for
youth he has led for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ''If any president or elected official asks you to serve (in a
Cabinet post), you've got to listen to that request. I'm not ruling
anything like that out but I'm not ruling it in either.''
</P>
<P>
   Folks around Washington have already been talking up Powell as a
perfect fit as Secretary of State if George W. Bush, the
presumptive Republican presidential nominee, made the call.
</P>
<P>
   For now at least, Powell said he was fulfilled leading the
charge for the nation's youth while heading up America's Promise.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been in the vineyards planting the vines and we now see
them bearing fruit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, Powell got Gov. Jim Hunt to support the goals
of America's Promise.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement, signed during a rally at a Greensboro
shopping mall, Hunt issued an executive order giving state
employees paid time off to mentor children.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of community and corporate leaders in North
Carolina, Powell drinks in the message from representatives from
companies like First Union Bank, the Pepsi Bottling Co. and General
Electric -- a pledge to give employees paid leave to volunteer at
local schools and community facilities.
</P>
<P>
   At the mall, Powell tells a cheering crowd, ''The children of
today have enemies in their lives - drugs, crime, violence and
despair. We have to step forward and be mentors.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how many times Powell expresses his passion for
helping children or his aversion to the prospect of nonstop
political fund raising and the other confines of seeking elected
office, the general knows another question about his nonexistent
political ambitions is just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ten years ago, I was a lieutenant general who was dragged into
the White House. Before I knew what happened, I was chairman,''
Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you turned back the clock 12 years and gave me back the
anonymity I had, it wouldn't bother me in the least. At least I
could go to garage sales again.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell said he believes American voters could look beyond its
racially divided past and unite behind a black candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the country is ready,'' he said. ''When I considered
running (for president) in 1995, I had to talk to America and I
concluded the country had changed to a point where it would be
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he added, ''the country has matured.''

<HEADLINE> N.H. Opens Impeachment Inquiry  </HEADLINE>
By NORMA LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- The state House voted overwhelmingly
Thursday to open an impeachment inquiry into New Hampshire's
Supreme Court justices, deepening a constitutional crisis that
began over a divorce case.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers decided 343-to-7 to authorize the first impeachment
probe of a New Hampshire judge in 210 years.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis has brought down one member of the high court already
and threatens three of the four remaining justices.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court's been sinking its own ship pretty well,'' said Rep.
Paul Mirski, sponsor of the legislation. ''We've got to let the
committee go where it can go. This stuff is just going to continue
to erupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeanne Shaheen called the vote ''a necessary step toward
restoring the public's confidence in our judicial system.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote, which empowers the House Judiciary Committee to
investigate Chief Justice David Brock and other members of the
court, comes nearly two weeks after Justice Stephen Thayer resigned
rather than face prosecution on charges he tried to influence the
assignment of judges to hear his own divorce case.
</P>
<P>
   In a report, Attorney General Philip McLaughlin also alleged
Brock violated the law by listening to Thayer.
</P>
<P>
   While Brock's alleged offense was not criminal and carries no
punishment, the report also concluded that justices who were
excused from cases because of conflicts of interest were still
allowed to comment on proposed rulings in those cases.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general said in his report that it was up to the
Legislature to decide what to do about the alleged ethics lapses.
</P>
<P>
   Brock has defended the court, saying no justice besides Thayer
ever tried to affect the outcome of a case in which he was
disqualified. He said judges who disqualified themselves merely
corrected grammar or factual errors in proposed rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Julie Brown called the inquiry a ''political hack job''
prompted by the court's unpopular ruling two years ago requiring
the state to overhaul the way it pays for the public school system.
</P>
<P>
   ''These men have served the state well. Their reputations are
destroyed by using the word 'impeachment,''' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Vermont Constitution, impeachable offenses include
''bribery, corruption, malpractice or maladministration of
office.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Judiciary Committee recommends impeachment of any of the
justices, the House would put the articles of impeachment to a
vote. If any passed, the Senate would sit as a jury.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Brock, two others could face removal -- Sherman Horton
and John Broderick. The fourth member of the current court, Justice
Joseph Nadeau, was not named in the attorney general's report.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Won't Ask for a Pardon  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he did not want
and would not ask for any pardon from his successor for any
possible crimes committed while in office. But he did not say
whether he would accept a pardon if it were offered.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have any interest in that,'' Clinton told the American
Society of Newspaper Editors. ''I don't want one and I am prepared
to stand before any bar of justice I have to stand before.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said, ''I'm glad I didn't quit'' when faced with
impeachment by the House and removal by the Senate -- a battle he
won after a historic trial that concluded last year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his remarks in a question and answer session after
a speech in which he criticized the $1.83 trillion budget that
Republicans later pushed through the House. Clinton said the GOP
plan was ''loaded with exploding tax breaks and untenable cuts in
critical investment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the question session, Clinton was asked if he would request
or accept any pardon. ''I have no interest in it, I wouldn't ask
for it, I don't think it would be necessary,'' Clinton said,
stopping short of saying he would not accept it.
</P>
<P>
   Later, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart sharply criticized the
editors for asking Clinton about pardons and impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are purportedly reasonably intelligent people but I
think it demonstrates just how isolated some newspaper editors are
from the rest of the country,'' Lockhart said. ''They get a chance
to ask the president about anything, any challenges that face
America and ... the best they can come up with is two questions
about impeachment. The country has moved past this. Unfortunately
many major newspaper editors haven't. It may be some reason for
declining circulation.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House allowed four questions.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said it was implicit in Clinton's comment about being
willing to stand before any bar of justice that he would not accept
any pardon. ''That's what I take it to (mean),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president spoke a day after Vice President Al Gore addressed
the same gathering and said that Clinton would not request or
accept any pardon from a successor. Gore told the group that
Clinton said ''publicly some time ago that he would neither request
nor accept a pardon, so that's the answer to your question.''
</P>
<P>
   When the same question was posed to Clinton today, the president
said, ''The answer is, I have no interest in it. I wouldn't ask for
it. I don't think it would be necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   However, despite his acquittal by the Senate, Clinton still
faces a continuing investigation by Independent Counsel Robert Ray,
who has said he has hired additional prosecutors and is considering
whether to indict Clinton after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that ''I wouldn't be surprised by anything that
happens but I'm not interested in being pardoned.''
</P>
<P>
   In reply to another question, Clinton said his presidential
library would not ignore his impeachment by the House and trial and
acquittal in the Senate. ''We have to deal with it, it is an
important part'' of his presidency, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared irritated by the line of questioning, responding in
clipped sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his impeachment battle, Clinton said, ''Let me tell
you I am proud of what we did there. Because I think we saved the
Constitution of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was impeached by the House on perjury and obstruction
charges, then acquitted by the Senate a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not ashamed of the fact they impeached me,'' Clinton said.
''That was their decision, not mine. And it was wrong. As a matter
of law, Constitution and history, it was wrong. And I'm glad I
didn't quit and I am glad we fought it and the American people
stuck with me. And I am profoundly grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged that he had made ''a terrible mistake'' in
behavior in his affair with one-time White House intern Monica
Lewinsky. He said he was ''deeply regretful.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But I think that an average, ordinary person reviewing the
wreckage left in that would say I paid for that. And should have
paid for it. We all pay for our mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton likened his impeachment struggle to his battle against
the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994. He said that if the
Republican agenda had prevailed, it would have ''changed the
Constitution forever in a way that would have been very destructive
for the American people.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Newspaper, Web Can Coexist  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Thursday declared himself
''a troglodyte media person'' who still gets his news the
old-fashioned way: from newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech before the American Society of Newspaper Editors,
Clinton said the advent of the Internet should not pose a problem
for newspapers, because they will be needed to impart detailed
information in a way that online or television media cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing I worry most about is that people will have all the
information in the world, (but) they won't have any way of
evaluating whether it's true or false, A or B, even if it's true,
how to put it in proper perspective,'' Clinton said. ''That's what
I consider to be the single most significant challenge presented to
all of you.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, the president cited research into the human
genome -- determining how genes come together to make a single human
being. Newspapers, he said, could provide in-depth coverage of the
research itself, as well as the political and social ramifications,
that otherwise might be glossed over or deleted for brevity.
</P>
<P>
   ''How much will it cost you to run a long series on exactly what
that is, what it's implications might be, how it came to be and
where we're going from here?'' Clinton said. ''Even if you feel
beleaguered now, the nature of what is unfolding may make
newspapers and old-fashioned newspaper work more important in the
next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also asked the editors to encourage their readers
to fill out and return forms for the 2000 Census. He noted that so
far, only about 60 percent of Americans, or three of every five
households, have turned in the form.
</P>
<P>
   ''The census is, at its core, information about who we are as a
democracy. I would imagine everyone in this room is particularly
interested in it,'' Clinton said. ''We want everyone to count, and
we hope that you will help us to reach them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said newspapers' struggles with the Internet are very
similar to his own during his presidency: ''Getting stuck in a
place that amplifies the sensational and the emotional.'' Then he
sheepishly explained the real reason that he wants newspapers to
remain traditional.
</P>
<P>
   ''Usually my only source of news is the newspapers. I'm sort of
a troglodyte media person,'' Clinton said, using a term that
describes prehistoric man or a recluse. ''I actually sit down and
read the papers.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Clinton said, like plenty of news junkies, ''I watch CNN a
lot because I can get it at anytime of the day or night.''
</P>
<P>
   Joking that he didn't want to ignore television networks (''I
need the exposure still''), Clinton said the Internet posed ''real
challenges'' for broadcast media also, but overall is a positive
development that can only serve to better inform the American
people.

<HEADLINE> Jury Orders Mack Trucks To Pay $50M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROVE HILL, Ala. (AP) -- Mack Trucks Inc. was ordered to pay $50
million in a lawsuit alleging a trucker would have survived a fiery
wreck if the manufacturer had installed an inexpensive electrical
cutoff device.
</P>
<P>
   A jury returned the verdict Wednesday in favor of Mary
Witherspoon. Her son, Tonnie Witherspoon, was driving a load of
logs in 1995 when his rig jackknifed, pinning the 33-year-old
driver inside, then caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   The mother's lawyers argued that Mack should have installed a
switch that could have disabled the electrical system in a
rollover.
</P>
<P>
   ''The inexpensive device would have interrupted electrical
arcing in the power system, preventing the fire that claimed the
man's life,'' lawyer Robert T. Cunningham Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   A 1975 proposal from the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration to install such switches died after truck companies
fought it, he said. He said Mack still does not install the switch.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, we have great sympathy for the family,'' William
Daniels Jr., a lawyer for Mack, said Thursday. ''At this point, we
are evaluating all our options.''

<HEADLINE> Human Rights Bind Diverse Groups  </HEADLINE>
By TRACI CARL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Upstairs, protesters learn first aid and how
to cope with tear gas as they vent their anger against
international financial institutions. Outside, leaders teach how to
form blockades. A diverse group of activists, the protesters are
mutually committed to deterring world capitalism from allegedly
running roughshod over human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of some of the same organizations that led the noisy and
often violent demonstrations that disrupted the World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle last fall have set the same goal
for the World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings this
weekend in the nation's capital. And they are building on the
lesson they say they learned out West: the need to keep strong
alliances with all groups opposed to globalization.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're more aware now of sensitivity between different groups
than we were then,'' said Matthew Smucker, 22, an activist for
Rainforest Action Network in Minneapolis who is helping to organize
this week's protests.
</P>
<P>
   The Mobilization for Global Justice's temporary headquarters is
in an old warehouse near the downtown business center and the two
international financial institutions. The organization says roughly
450 groups have endorsed its mission. It is coordinating dozens of
organizations spanning a wide range of ideologies, including
environmentalists, organized labor and feminists.
</P>
<P>
   Activists describe the movement as leaderless, and most of the
protesters seem to have come together through an informal network
of groups across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Information is spread largely through word of mouth and the
Internet. Decisions -- when and where to hold a march, what strategy
to pursue -- are made by consensus, reached by a council of
representatives of the various groups.
</P>
<P>
   Sophia Conroy, 25, participated in the Seattle protests and has
stayed active in the movement by attending meetings of the New York
City Direct Action Network, one of several local networks set up
around the country to keep globalization opponents mobilized.
</P>
<P>
   An activist with the U.S. Tibet Committee, a nonprofit
organization working for Tibet's independence from China, Conroy
came to Washington because she felt the fight against globalization
was closely linked to Tibet's freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all part of the greater picture,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although many protesters are focused on their individual issues,
Smucker said they share common enemies: the WTO, the IMF, the World
Bank -- and a feeling that power is being taken away from local
people.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, not everyone agrees, even when it comes to the so-called
common enemies. Some advocate dismantling the WTO, the IMF and the
World Bank, while others are simply pushing for reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Many protesters believe the IMF and World Bank impose severe
penalties on the poor countries they help with loans and economic
bailouts. Labor unions complain that the IMF and World Bank do
nothing about sweatshops. And environmental groups contend the
funding of big dams and mineral exploration devastate the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   They continue to work together, Smucker said, because of the
movement's democratic process. He stressed that nothing is
dictated, and each individual group is allowed to maintain its
autonomy and beliefs within the larger framework of the fight
against globalization
</P>
<P>
   Richard Boren, 42, an environmental activist from Tucson, Ariz.,
said his participation in a council of representatives meeting
convinced him of the movement's organization and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have any reservations about putting myself on the line
-- my body on the line -- for these people,'' he said, sifting
through fliers describing how to save the rain forest or fight the
use of genetically engineered crops.

<HEADLINE> UN Sanctions Get Mixed Success Rate  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. sanctions are often ignored, but when
they do strike home, it's often innocents who are hurt and not the
rogue regimes they targeted, according to the first case-by-case
report card on their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The report highlights a dilemma Secretary-General Kofi Annan has
raised repeatedly with regard to Iraq, and comes after a decade in
which the United Nations imposed more sanctions than at any other
time.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Sanctions Decade: Assessing U.N. Strategies in the
1990s,'' is expected to generate a lengthy debate when it is
presented to the Security Council on Monday, when it takes up the
issue of reforming sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the 274-page report backs ''smart sanctions''
that target regimes with specific measures and not broad-based
trade embargoes that often hurt innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
   It cites a ban on Angolan rebels' diamond exports as a good way
to starve the rebels' ability to finance their military campaign --
but notes that the ban was never enforced and was only imposed
after the rebels had earned nearly $4 billion from gem sales.
</P>
<P>
   The book examines the Angola ban and 10 other U.N. embargoes
imposed in the last 10 years. It rates their success and offers
concrete recommendations for how embargoes can work better in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Among its findings: Sanctions against Iraq fared well initially
because they helped disarm Baghdad, but they have outlived their
usefulness and now sully the U.N. reputation.
</P>
<P>
   A key reason, the study says, is that the Security Council
failed early on to reward Iraqi compliance with an easing of the
embargo that would have encouraged future cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   An arms embargo on Rwanda had no impact whatsoever because it
was imposed too late to stop the 1994 genocide and resoundingly
ignored, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Security Council would have greatly improved its
one-third success rate if it had chosen to enforce sanctions rather
than rely on the goodwill of U.N. member states to abide by them,
the study said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Getting sanctions right has often been a less compelling goal
than getting sanctions adopted,'' Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy said in a forward.
</P>
<P>
   The report urged the council to put more money into monitoring
embargoes and assessing their impact, and make clear in resolutions
how sanctions can be eased so targeted states have an incentive to
comply.
</P>
<P>
   Similar suggestions have been made in the past in academic and
U.N. studies, but ''The Sanctions Decade'' is the first
comprehensive look at U.N. sanctions and its recommendations come
at a critical time, said David Malone, president of the
International Peace Academy, the independent New York think-tank
that compiled the report.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the council is expected to appoint a working group to
recommend guidelines for improving sanctions' effectiveness while
sparing civilians. Whether the recommendations are implemented is
another question. The United States has been reluctant to even
discuss sanction reform, primarily out of fear it would lead to
criticism of its Iraq policy, Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy U.S. Ambassador James Cunningham said the United States
was interested in finding ways to make sanctions work better.
</P>
<P>
   ''But in having this discussion, we also need to keep focused
that the object ... is compliance, and that's across the board,''
he said in an interview. ''We're not pursuing sanctions just for
sanctions' sake.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada, which has taken a lead in pressing for sanction reforms,
helped fund the study. Prior to 1990, sanctions had been imposed on
only two countries: Rhodesia and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is about time we began to look at who (sanctions) affect,
what is their impact and how they can be used as an effective
tool,'' Axworthy, the Canadian foreign minister, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Canada chairs the U.N. sanctions committee on Angola's UNITA
rebels and presented a groundbreaking independent report on the
ineffectiveness of the UNITA measures last month, findings that
were echoed in the new report.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions are most effective if they are used as a tool to
bargain with targeted regimes, not as a blunt form of punishment,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   It cited the sanctions against Yugoslavia, where the embargo
against Belgrade was used as a bargaining chip in negotiations
leading to the Dayton peace accords. The measures were eased after
Belgrade made some concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most effective approach appears to be one that combines
sticks and carrots,'' said Andrew Mack, director of Kofi Annan's
strategic planning unit.
</P>
<P>
   That requires a willingness to ease the measures to reward good
behavior and encourage further concessions -- a position the United
States has rejected for Iraq, the report notes.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, however, has recently seen that a little flexibility
can work to its advantage, it said. Once the United States and
Britain agreed to a longtime Libyan offer to prosecute the suspects
in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing in a neutral, third country, Libya
delivered the men for trial.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. air embargo was immediately suspended -- one of the few
successes the United Nations can count.

<HEADLINE> 7 World Bank Protesters Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Washington police stepped up security today
following the arrest of seven World Bank protesters and
confiscation of equipment they allegedly planned to use for
blockades.
</P>
<P>
   Police made the arrests Wednesday night after stopping two
vehicles filed with ''lock boxes,'' lengths of PVC pipes that
demonstrators can use to lock arms and make it difficult to break a
''human chain.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they knew in advance the vehicles would be
entering the city from Landover, Md. Police also confiscated
chicken wire and duct tape in addition to the pipes, also known as
''sleeping dragons.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven were charged with possession of implements of crime.
</P>
<P>
   An increased police presence -- even for security-conscious
Washington -- was evident on bridges spanning the Potomac River, at
downtown street corners and near office buildings, particularly in
blocks surrounding the World Bank headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Buses filled with police rumbled down streets and groups of
uniformed police gathered in small groups in the downtown area
Wednesday. Police officers on bicycles cruised around buildings and
up and down sidewalks patrolling for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank-International Monetary Fund complex has been
blocked off for vehicular or pedestrian traffic. ''Can I see your
ID please?'' one uniformed policeman asked a reporter Wednesday as
he stood on a street corner looking at the building. ''You can
never be too careful,'' the officer commented as he walked back
behind a barricade.
</P>
<P>
   The protest activities are being coordinated by Mobilization for
Global Justice, a coalition of groups with wide ranging complaints
about the World Bank and International Monetary Fund's lending
practices. They complain that too often these loans go to projects
that harm the environment and hurt the poor. They also want debt
relief for developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those same groups successfully disrupted meetings of the
World Trade Organization in Seattle in December, forcing
authorities to declare a state of emergency and call out the
National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, hundreds of demonstrators were being given intense
training in nonviolent tactics, including ways to form a human
chain that is difficult to break without using pepper spray or tear
gas.
</P>
<P>
   Trainees were asked to pledge they would avoid the violence that
marred the WTO demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's capital over the years has seen many marches,
protests and demonstrations. But the events in Seattle have left
police more guarded and a little bit on edge, District of Columbia
Police Chief Charles Ramsey acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone's kinda anxious about that, not knowing whether or
not the groups that are bent on destroying property and so forth
are actually here and intend to do the same thing,'' Ramsey said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the organizations say they plan peaceful and nonviolent
protests. Earlier in the week a group of environmental
demonstrators blocked a street and triggered a confrontation with
police. Seven were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen people gathered outside the Colombian ambassador's
residence on Wednesday, then peacefully marched several blocks, to
protest a $1.6 billion emergency assistance proposal for the South
American country. A line of policemen watched as the march
proceeded.
</P>
<P>
   At the U.S. Capitol, police on foot and on motorcycles watched
closely as the AFL-CIO brought 5,000 people to Washington to
protest a bill that would give permanent normal trade status to
China instead of annual reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that the big days are Sunday and Monday so no one's
being lulled to sleep because it's slow here,'' said Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hoping that it stays peaceful and nonviolent and no one
is of a mind to create any property damage or anything like that,
but if they do choose to do that, we'll take whatever actions we
need to stop it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers are working 12-hour shifts through Monday and while
police are in their regular uniforms, riot gear is always kept
close by, he said. The police department has spent $1 million on
new helmets and body armor.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan: Watch Trading Costs  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The risk of inflation persists, Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Thursday, as new government
figures showed the spike in energy costs lifting wholesale prices 1
percent last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of indications of prices going up,'' Greenspan
said in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee. ''If you look,
however, at the underlying cost structure of American business, I
see no evidence of an acceleration'' in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan defended the Fed's moves to raise interest rates and
said the stock market's wild swings in recent days showed it is
''groping for the correct balance.''
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday's close, the technology-heavy Nasdaq index had
tumbled 27 percent since its record high on March 10, putting it in
bear market territory. The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average
is down a more modest 7 percent from its Jan. 14 record, with a
decline Thursday of more than 200 points amid inflation jitters
stirred up by the report on wholesale prices.
</P>
<P>
   The recent gyrations and divergence between the two stock
indexes ''are reflecting the basic underlying forces'' of sharply
different rates of return on high-technology stocks compared with
more traditional ones, Greenspan told the senators.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what's happening is that the markets are groping for
the correct balance underlying the system,'' Greenspan said. He
added that it is very difficult to determine what the correct price
level should be.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question, the central bank chief denied that
the dramatic losses in the Nasdaq index in recent days were caused
by the Fed having pushed up interest rates five times in the past
10 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ... insist upon continuing to deny that our goal is to
jawbone the stock market. It is not,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the Fed's interest rate moves were designed to protect
the economy from potential damage from the persistent risk of
inflation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the rapid changes sweeping the nation's securities
markets, Greenspan advised against a government mandate for any
form of centralized network for displaying stock quotes and urged
caution on switching to stock trading in decimals.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street appears to be inching toward creation of a
centralized quote network, which would show stock quotes across an
array of competitive markets. Greenspan said that given the pace of
technology-driven change in the markets, ''It is difficult to
contemplate how a government mandate could be implemented; systems
might well be obsolete before we were halfway through the planning
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Millions of new investors and increasing competition from new
electronic communications networks, known as ECNs, have put
pressure on the nation's two biggest exchanges, the New York Stock
Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it fails to respond to technological change, one
centralized trading venue, even the NYSE, can be displaced by
another as other trading systems take advantage of newer technology
to offer greater efficiency or to provide new functions investors
value more highly,'' Greenspan testified.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the stock exchanges' anticipated switch to quoting
prices in decimals, rather than fractions, Greenspan said he agreed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission ''about being careful
about trying to move forward too soon.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, under a decimal system, a stock price now quoted as
10{ would become 10.50.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC wants the exchanges to begin decimal trading later this
year, but the Nasdaq market has said its computer systems aren't
ready yet to handle the switch from traditional fractions. SEC
Chairman Arthur Levitt recently said he believed it would be
confusing for investors to have the NYSE start trading in decimals
before the Nasdaq did so.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anybody is smart enough to figure out where the
markets are going as we go through this dramatic change,'' Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, the Banking Committee chairman, said at the
start of the hearing. ''I think it is very important that we let
technology lead and that we let regulation follow.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said some degree of government
intervention was needed. ''The government should set speed
limits,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain To Meet Next Month  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush and his toughest
rival in last winter's presidential nominating fight, John McCain,
will meet in Pittsburgh on May 9 for the first time since the
Arizona senator folded his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course I want his support, but I don't know if it will
happen as a result of the meeting,'' Bush told reporters Thursday
in Austin. ''John wants to visit. I want to visit,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters just off the Senate floor, McCain said,
''I'm sure we'll have a fruitful discussion'' including possible
ways of helping out in the GOP campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he hopes to address the party convention this
summer, he said, ''that's a decision Governor Bush will make.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has already pledged to support the nominee of his party,
but has said the enthusiasm he puts into the effort will depend in
part on Bush's willingness to adopt elements of the senator's
''reform agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain already has begun campaigning for GOP candidates for the
House and Senate, and in a separate announcement during the day,
his office said he would travel to Pennsylvania, New York and New
Jersey over the next two days on behalf of GOP congressional
hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential nomination in hand, Bush has been attempting in
recent weeks to unify the party and place his own mark on the GOP
national organization.
</P>
<P>
   He pocketed the endorsement of another primary rival, Steve
Forbes, late last month. And earlier this week, he dispatched Fred
Meyer, a former state GOP chairman in Texas, and Maria Cino, a
senior campaign aide, to the Republican National Committee. Several
GOP sources say the Bush campaign is also intent on placing trusted
aides in key positions overseeing the RNC's communications
apparatus and operations at the GOP convention scheduled for
Philadelphia this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain talked by phone the night the primary campaign
effectively ended, on March 7, and at least once since. Their
relationship, outwardly quite cordial during the early stages of
the campaign, deteriorated as the two men engaged in a fast-paced
series of primaries with the nomination at stake.
</P>
<P>
   They attacked one another in television commercials and through
surrogates -- Bush standing by at one point while a veteran accused
the former Vietnam POW of neglecting veterans' concerns, and McCain
airing television ads that said the Texas governor twisted the
truth like President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also angered the McCain camp in a newspaper interview in
mid-March in which he said McCain ''didn't change my views'' about
any issues. Bush swiftly changed his tone and said the next day
that McCain had highlighted the need for reform, for example.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 201; Nasdaq Off 92  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A fragile advance by technology stocks shattered
today as weakness in the blue-chip Dow Jones industrials spread to
the broader market. Stocks came under pressure after a spike in
wholesale inflation raised new fears about the economy.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary calculations, the Nasdaq composite
index fell 92.85 to close at 3,676.78, bringing its loss for the
week to 769 points. The index had risen as much as 145 points
earlier in the session before collapsing in the final hour of
trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow plummeted 201.58 to close at 10,923.55, its steepest
point drop since March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 26.66 to 1,440.51.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-8 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,721 down, 1,251 up and 486
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 1.03 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.14
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.23 to 492.21.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology stocks are clearly in a bear market.'' said Eugene
G. Mintz, financial markets analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP;
Co. ''The Nasdaq tried to rally two or three times and just
couldn't hold it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's loss left the Nasdaq 27 percent below its March 10
closing record of 5,048.62. Wall Street professionals consider a 20
percent drop from a peak the traditional touchstone of a bear
market.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the most fundamental reason for the drop is a
growing sense that investors pushed technology issues too far last
year, giving many young, unproven companies stock prices they did
not yet deserve.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's inability to sustain its short-lived rallies
indicates that the nervousness that sent the index on a long spiral
downward is still in place, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Rambus, a maker of technology used in the computer chip
industry, provided the latest cautionary tale. Just Wednesday, the
company reported a quarterly loss of $6.98 per share, citing
acquisition costs and one-time expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Today, several Wall Street brokerages raised their ratings on
Rambus stock. But investors apparently felt the steep losses were
reason enough to dump the stock, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any bottom-fishing that occurs will be among stable companies
that make money,'' said Michael Strauss, managing director of
Commonfund Asset Management. ''The heyday for stocks that have a
good story but no earnings is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Kerschner, chief investment strategist at PaineWebber,
predicted bigger declines ahead for technology companies that he
dubbed ''new new industrials'' -- large-capitalization technology
stocks that have only recently gone public.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies in that category could see their share prices
sliced by another 33 percent before their prices are in line with
their earnings potential, Kerschner said.
</P>
<P>
   The late-day selloff overshadowed some genuinely good news on
corporate earnings. Advanced Micro Devices, a leading computer chip
maker, said late Wednesday it earned $1.15 a share in the first
quarter, nearly twice analysts' forecasts of 58 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro stock got a powerful lift today. The broader
semiconductor sector also rose, with LSI Logic and Texas
Instruments up.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks kept the Dow lower as inflation fears
resurfaced. J.P. Morgan, which rose Wednesday after reporting
strong profit growth, fell today. American Express also declined.
</P>
<P>
   Bank and brokerage stocks were weighed down by the latest
government report on inflation. The Labor Department's Producer
Price Index showed wholesale prices shot up 1 percent in March, led
by the biggest jump in energy costs in nearly 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The advance was a worse showing on inflation than the 0.5
percent rise many analysts expected.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric fell sharply even after reporting its earnings
rose 20 percent in the first quarter, led by strong performances at
its industrial systems and NBC units. Profits beat analysts'
estimates by a penny.
</P>
<P>
   Separately today, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
dismissed charges that the Fed has tried to drive the stock market
lower by boosting interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have denied and I continue to deny that our job is to
jawbone the stock market; it is not,'' Greenspan said in testimony
today before the Senate Banking Committee.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel OKs College Bet Ban  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate committee voted Thursday to ban
betting on college sports -- a practice legal only in Nevada -- but
declined a challenge from a Nevada senator to set a nationwide
minimum gambling age of 21.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., accused his colleagues on the Senate
Commerce Committee of hypocrisy on the issue of gambling by young
people. He suggested they were interested only in ''trying to give
Nevada the shaft.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would outlaw betting on Olympic, college or high
school athletic events. Though there is little legal betting on the
Olympics and none on high school sports, Nevada's gambling industry
accepts bets on college sporting events that do not involve a
school in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada gambling industry took in $2.3 billion in sports
wagers in fiscal 1999, with 30 percent to 40 percent bet on college
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent requests by the National Hockey League, National
Basketball Association, National Football League and Major League
Baseball to extend the proposed ban to professional sports, the
committee focused solely on amateur events.
</P>
<P>
   ''Legalized gambling on kids is wrong,'' said Commerce Chairman
John McCain, R-Ariz. ''They should not be reduced to a point spread
and a spectacle for wagering.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the amateur sports betting ban said it would help
in the broader fight against illegal gambling on college campuses.
Bryan said the ban ''will have absolutely no impact at all''
because 99 percent of gambling on college sports occurs illegally
on college campuses, not legally in Nevada casinos. The committee
rejected his amendment to exempt college sports betting from the
ban.
</P>
<P>
   In its report last year, the National Gambling Impact Study
Commission recommended banning bets on college sports. It also
recommended a nationwide minimum age of 21 to gamble, which Bryan
proposed as an amendment to the bill. The committee rejected the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   While casinos in Nevada and most other states forbid betting by
those under 21, some states allow people as young as 18 to bet on
horse races or buy lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also rejected proposals by Bryan to force colleges
to spend more money on gambling abuse prevention, to cut off aid to
any student-athlete caught gambling illegally, and to step up
efforts to reduce illegal gambling by students.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan said the National Collegiate Athletic Association, a
principal supporter of the betting ban, and its member colleges and
universities worried too much about Nevada while doing too little
to address gambling on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ''How serious are we about this effort?'' Bryan asked
rhetorically as his amendments were rejected. ''Is this a serious
national problem or isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Doris Dixon, NCAA director of federal relations, said
representatives travel to campuses for seminars on gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The House has not yet held hearings on a similar bill sponsored
by Reps. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Tim Roemer, D-Ind.

<HEADLINE> AM-CT--Boy Witness, 1st-Ld Writethru,670  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Lawyers for a man accused in the
killings of an 8-year-old boy and his mother are asking that the
charges be dropped because a woman who claimed to be an eyewitness
to the murders later said she lied.
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Lee -- the prosecution's star witness -- originally told
police she acted as a lookout and then watched Adrian Peeler shoot
Leroy ''B.J.'' Brown Jr. and his mother, Karen Clarke, in their
Bridgeport home on Jan. 7, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Lee later pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and
agreed to testify against Adrian Peeler and his brother, Russell,
who is accused of masterminding the killings to stop the little boy
from testifying against him in an earlier murder.
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter she wrote to her lawyer in December -- after she
cut a deal with prosecutors for a seven-year sentence -- Lee says
she lied about what she told police.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything that I have told them is lies,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to make this thing right and deep down inside God's
know (sic) that I did not have anything to do with the murder.''
</P>
<P>
   She also wrote, ''I can't not (sic) live with myself telling a
lie on the Peelers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection in Russell Peeler's trial is nearly completed.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a day after the letter was made public, Russell
Peeler's lawyers filed a stack of motions asking for dismissal of
the charges, immediate adjournment of the trial, a mistrial and
continuance.
</P>
<P>
   ''This statement of this witness alters the nature and
complexion of this prosecution so dramatically that the trial may
not proceed forward without court intervention,'' Peeler's lawyers
argue in their motion for a mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler's lawyers, John Walkley and William Koch, also ask Judge
G. Sarsfield Ford to order that the defense be given access to Lee
immediately so they can get a new statement from her.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's basically admitted that everything she's said to this
point is a lie,'' said Walkley.
</P>
<P>
   Ford rejected the request for an adjournment of the trial, but
said he would reserve a final decision until a full hearing is held
Monday on all the defense motions.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict would not comment
on Lee's letter.
</P>
<P>
   ''The jury will have to decide,'' he said, when asked if Lee
will be a credible witness.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter to her lawyer, Lee says she hopes to get a lighter
sentence than the seven years prosecutors are expected to
recommend. She has an undisclosed terminal illness.
</P>
<P>
   That letter contradicts three letters Lee wrote to Bridgeport
police detectives at about the same time.
</P>
<P>
   In those letters, Lee admitted her role in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know what I did was wrong. I get down on my knees every
night and ask God to forgive me for what I have done to the boy and
his mother,'' she said in a letter to Detective Dwayne McBride.
</P>
<P>
   She also mentions her fear of the Peelers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God that my life is still here because the Peelers did
not kill me and that is a blessing from God,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Koch said the Peelers did not threaten Lee to get her to change
her story.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's impossible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has been in the federal witness protection program while
waiting to testify against the brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Peeler's lawyer, Patrick Culligan, said he may file
similar motions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Josephine Lee's letter to her attorney certainly undermines
and probably eliminates any probable cause for the state to
continue to prosecute Adrian Peeler and his brother, Russell,''
Culligan said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyer, Richard Reeve, would not comment on the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Both brothers face the possibility of the death penalty if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Peeler is already serving a 105-year sentence for the
killing of Rudolph Snead, Clarke's boyfriend. The little boy was to
testify against Peeler in the Snead murder trial. Peeler also is
serving a life sentence on federal drug charges.

<HEADLINE> General Mills To Promote Car Safety  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TACOMA, Wash. (AP) -- Stung by criticism over their rewards to a
7-year-old who drove off in his sister's car in search of Cheerios,
General Mills officials say they will produce car-safety messages.
</P>
<P>
   The Minneapolis cereal maker announced the move Wednesday after
delivering coupons for a year's supply of Cheerios and other
goodies to the family of Perley King.
</P>
<P>
   General Mills will produce and distibute both print and radio
ads to be run at no charge as public service messages. General
Mills spokeswoman Liv Lane said the company has not determined how
much it will spend on the ads.
</P>
<P>
   ''General Mills certainly does not condone reckless behavior,''
the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
   But that's precisely how many people interpreted the company's
decision to provide the youngster with freebies.
</P>
<P>
   Callers to at least one radio talk show in Seattle blasted the
rewards, and a letter writer to the local newspaper, The News
Tribune, said she planned to boycott General Mills products for a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''What upset me about this is that ... he's clearly getting very
mixed messages here,'' said Deirdre Sargent of Fort Lewis, whose
letter arrived at the newspaper Wednesday. ''He gets free cereal
for a year and a bike.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on April 1, while other family members slept, Perley and
his dog, Bear, climbed into the car and drove three miles in search
of a food store.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce County sheriff's deputies received reports from other
drivers of an ''erratic driver'' or ''a little kid driving'' and
surrounded the car within blocks of Interstate 5, sheriff's
spokesman Ed Troyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Perley apparently managed the adventure without an accident,
except for putting a small dent in his mother's truck and bumping a
patrol car when he stepped off the brake at the roadblock, Troyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, representatives from General Mills visited
Perley's family at its south Tacoma home. They presented him with
coupons for a year's supply of Cheerios and a new yellow mountain
bike ''to help him understand that a 7-year-old should travel on
two wheels, not four,'' General Mills said.

   Dow Ends Down 201.58; Nasdaq Off 92.85
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A fragile advance by technology stocks shattered
today as weakness in the blue-chip Dow Jones industrials spread to
the broader market. Stocks came under pressure after a spike in
wholesale inflation raised new fears about the economy. The Nasdaq
composite index fell 92.85 to close at 3,676.78, bringing its loss
for the week to 769 points. The index had risen as much as 145
points earlier in the session before collapsing in the final hour
of trading. The Dow plummeted 201.58 to close at 10,923.55, its
steepest point drop since March 7. Broader stock indicators were
also lower.

   Wholesale Prices Surge in March
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The biggest leap in energy prices in nearly 10
years made wholesale inflation in March rise 1 percent for the
second month in a row. Meanwhile, soaring gasoline prices helped
push up retail sales by a faster-than-expected pace. The federal
reports show the speeding economy continues to be fueled by hardy
consumer spending, yet aside from energy prices, inflation remains
quiet. The core rate rose a modest 0.3 percent. On the retail
front, sales rose 0.4 percent in March, twice as fast as economists
expected. Excluding the volatile category of car sales, which fell
sharply, March's total retail sales were up a sizable 1.4 percent.

   BP Amoco, Arco Merger Approved
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- BP Amoco PLC promised today to move swiftly to
conclude its purchase of Atlantic Richfield Co. after receiving
government approval that had been held up for months over concern
about its impact on competition. The Federal Trade Commission voted
5-0 to approve the merger of BP Amoco and Atlantic Richfield, or
Arco, for $27.6 billion after an agreement to divest significant
holdings in Alaska. The new company will be the second-largest oil
company not owned by a government, behind Exxon Mobil Corp., a
merger approved by the FTC last November. BP Amoco stock was down |
at 51{ today; Atlantic Richfield was also down |, at 83 9/16.

   Greenspan: Watch Trading Costs
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
today ordinary investors should pay attention to costs that may be
''buried'' in their trading contracts. He also said the time may
not be ripe yet for stock trading in decimals instead of fractions.
Greenspan said investors should not only consider commissions in
trading. He told the Senate Banking Committee that other costs
could include delayed executions of stock trades, failures to
execute trades and lost profit. He said disclosure to investors by
brokerage firms will enable them to make more informed choices.

   IMF Official Defends Globalization
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- International Monetary Fund and Clinton
administration officials today defended their efforts to promote
freer trade and greater integration of the global economy. They
said such steps offered the best hope of lifting hundreds of
millions of people out of abject poverty. Globalization -- the bane
of thousands of demonstrators in the nation's capital this week who
contend that world capitalism has failed to help the poor -- has
gotten a bad rap, said acting IMF Managing Director Stanley
Fischer.

   Boeing Warns of Wrong Jet Rivets
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co. has warned airlines and federal
regulators that rivets that reinforce a plane's structure need to
be replaced in 27 747-400 jumbo jets. A mechanic at Boeing's
Wichita, Kan., plant discovered that as many as 1,000 of the wrong
kind of rivets had been installed on each of the 27 aircraft, 10 of
which have been delivered and are in service with airlines. Boeing
spokeswoman Shannon Myers said the rivets used on the upper deck
and main deck of the jumbo jets do not pose a flight safety risk.
Myers said, however, that the rivets do help reinforce part of the
plane's structure and that those used cannot handle the stresses
involved.

   Libraries Get $2.5B Internet Funds
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A program to connect schools, libraries and
communities nationwide to the Internet will receive $2.25 billion
in funding this year, the Federal Communications Commission
announced today. That's the full amount allowed under FCC rules.
Last year, 82 percent of the nation's public schools and more than
half of the public libraries received discounted services under the
''e-rate'' program, with more than 53,000 urban schools and more
than 25,000 rural schools receiving support. Vice President Al Gore
said the additional funds would ensure that a total 1 million
classrooms would be connected.

   GM Earns $1.78B in First Quarter
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. stock was up { at 88 today
after it reported that it earned $1.78 billion in the first
quarter, down 2 percent from a year ago. The results still beat
Wall Street expectations. The world's largest automaker said today
it earned $2.80 a share, in the January-March period compared to
$1.82 billion, or $2.68 a share last year. Earnings per share
increased because fewer shares of GM are on the market now than a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   New York Times Earnings Up 35 Pct.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Times Co. posted a 35.3 percent
increase in first-quarter earnings, beating Wall Street estimates
as newspaper advertising revenue surged. The owner of The New York
Times, The Boston Globe and 22 other newspapers earned $83.1
million, or 47 cents a share, in the January-March period, up from
$61.4 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest
results beat the analysts' expectations of 43 cents a share.

   LONDON (AP) -- European stocks closed marginally higher today,
dragged down by a faltering technology sector. Shares rallied a
bit, however, as the Nasdaq in New York recouped in early U.S.
trading. The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of shares in European companies
fell 0.12 points to 384.84 and the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index ended
down 0.04 points at 430.79. In domestic markets, London's FTSE-100
Share Index rose 6.2 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,357.0. In Paris,
the CAC 40 closed up 25.64 points or 0.4 percent at 6,264.34

<HEADLINE> Dixie Chicks May Boost Concerts  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The country music industry is hoping the
first top-billed tour of the Dixie Chicks will boost sluggish
concert ticket and album sales.
</P>
<P>
   Country music concerts collected 16 percent less gross revenue
in 1999 than in 1998 and attendance was down 28 percent, according
to Amusement Business magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of country music peaked at about $2 billion in 1995 when
Garth Brooks helped make the genre trendy. But sales were down 4.5
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Country music's market share of album sales has declined to 14.1
percent, according to the Recording Industry Association of
America's 1998 Consumer Profile. That's still second -- rock is
first at 25.7 percent -- but country's share has declined each year
since peaking at 18.7 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's top attraction Shania Twain doesn't plan to tour in
2000, and Brooks will stay home a second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't have a lot of country acts trying to be arena
headliners now,'' said Ray Waddell of Amusement Business. ''They're
playing casinos, fairs and festivals, or looking for a strong tour
to jump on as a lower-billed act.''
</P>
<P>
   That means the Dixie Chicks will be looked to to get fans back
in the stands. George Strait will also head an annual stadium tour
and Tim McGraw and his wife Faith Hill are expected to announce
joint concerts later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The industry is going to be watching (the Dixie Chicks) tour
really close. It's like a snowball rolling down a hill. If somebody
does good, it increases excitement about others,'' Waddell said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas trio -- Natalie Maines, Emily Robison and Martie Seidel
-- have held off headlining concerts despite selling more than 10
million of their last two albums. ''Fly'' has been the best-selling
country music album for more than 20 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The group starts a 70-city North American tour in June starting
with five shows in Canada. Tickets go on sale April 22 for six of
the American dates. The tour ends in November.
</P>
<P>
   The group will promote the tour via humorous television
commercials showing the singers adjusting to life on the road by
doing things like smashing banjos in their hotel room and pumping
gasoline into their limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Griffin will open most of the dates. At other shows,
either Willie Nelson or Ricky Skaggs will be on the bill.

<HEADLINE> Plan: Ships To Treat Ballast Water  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ships would be required to replace or purify
their ballast water before entering the Great Lakes under
legislation being pushed by several lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the bill will keep out foreign species such as
the sea lamprey, ruffe and zebra mussel that are wrecking havoc on
marine ecology and industries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are suffering a number of economic consequences because of
non-native species,'' said Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich. ''That's not
new. What is new is that we are introducing federal legislation to
deal with the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Ships use ballast water to stabilize the vessel. But the water
also can carry marine life from other places the ship has visited.
Most ships empty most of their ballast by the time they enter the
Great Lakes, but there is often enough to keep non-native species
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Invaders such as the sea lamprey, ruffe and round goby threaten
the $4.5 billion Great Lakes fishing industry. Zebra mussels clog
water intake pipes, doing an estimated $120 million in damage
between 1989 and 1994, according to a report sponsored by the eight
Great Lakes states.
</P>
<P>
   But the shipping industry says it would be unduly burdened by
such a rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm concerned about my job,'' said Karl Hardesty, a Michigan
freighter pilot. ''I'm concerned about the jobs of the tugmen that
provide services to these vessels.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm concerned about the jobs of the longshoremen ... the truck
drivers who deliver these goods, the jobs of the miners. There's a
huge industry that's supported by Great Lakes shipping.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Barcia, D-Mich., said the lawmakers would work with
shippers to come up with a solution that would not ruin their
livelihood.

<HEADLINE> Clinton cancels plans to headline Arab event  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights -- smarting from
news that its chairwoman contributed to Hillary Rodham Clinton's
campaign, on Thursday postponed public discussion of a report said
to criticize Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's New York Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The commission denied any connection.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the first-lady-turned-politician scrapped plans to
headline a charity dinner for an Arab-American group because
representatives from the Israeli Embassy were not invited. Certain
Arab states do not recognize the state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under these circumstances, Mrs. Clinton will no longer be able
to serve as honorary chair of the Mosaic Foundation event,'' a
statement from the first lady's office said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mosaic Foundation is made up of the wives of Arab
ambassadors to the U.S. who raise money for charity. This year's
dinner on May 3 is to benefit Save the Children. Clinton has served
as honorary chairwoman for the dinner for the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign spokeswoman Kim Serafin called Clinton's
decision to back out ''a classic Clinton flip-flop.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously she's pandering for the Jewish vote,'' Serafin said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is courting New York's large Jewish population in her
bid for the U.S. Senate against Giuliani. She strained her
relationship with some Jews last year after a visit to the West
Bank. There, Clinton embraced Soha Arafat after the wife of Yasser
Arafat accused Israelis of using poison gas on Palestinian women
and children. The first lady distanced herself from Mrs. Arafat's
remarks the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Giuliani denounced a civil rights commission
probe against the NYPD after word surfaced in Newsday that the
panel's chairwoman Mary Frances Berry contributed to the first
lady's campaign. Berry gave $250 last year to Clinton and another
$300 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which has
pledged support to her Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't take much to figure out this is a political
operation,'' Giuliani said Thursday after a campaign stop on Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   But Berry defended her donation.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have a right to make campaign contributions to anyone
they please,'' Berry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   She said she would continue to participate in the commission's
discussion of the NYPD.
</P>
<P>
   ''It (the report) is about Giualiani's office, not Giuliani.
It's about the police department in New York. It's not about
Hillary Clinton and it's not about the senatorial campaign,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's spokesman David Aronson said it was unclear
when the draft report would be discussed and declined to explain
the delay. The report was scheduled for discussion Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-member commission is preparing a report on the NYPD
that several sources say is expected to be highly-critical and
could call for the appointment of a federal monitor. The commission
began its probe into the police force last year in the wake of the
shooting of Amadou Diallo and the torture of Abner Louima at the
hands of New York City cops.
</P>
<P>
   The commission held a hearing in New York City in May. Giuliani
and Police Commissioner defended the police force. But the Rev. Al
Sharpton and others described it as out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Six members of the commission were appointed by Democrats and
two by Republicans. The panel has no enforcement powers but can
make recommendations to the president, Congress and federal
agencies.

<HEADLINE> Mexico-Jamaica Drug Ring Broken  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Making dozens of arrests, federal drug agents
on Thursday broke up a Jamaican-led narcotics ring that employed
bribed FedEx drivers in a scheme to distribute 121 tons of Mexican
marijuana to East Coast markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Drug Enforcement Administration said FedEx's top officials
fully cooperated with the 18-month investigation, which has led to
the arrests of 101 people since it began.
</P>
<P>
   The latest arrests began shortly after midnight Thursday and
that by late afternoon there had been 45 arrests, 22 of them FedEx
employees, DEA agents said at a news conference. Rod Benson,
assistant special agent of the DEA's special operations branch said
he expected an additional 10 or 15 arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Agents said the arresting officers also seized two tons of
marijuana in West Coast warehouses, one under control of the
Mexican group and another controlled by the Jamaican traffickers.
They also seized 18 firearms and more than $4 million in cash and
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Donnie R. Marshall, acting DEA administrator, said that the
operation marks the first time that marijuana smugglers have used a
single, private, overnight-express delivery service as a
distribution network.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said the smuggled marijuana was shipped in more than
4,000 cartons and boxes, some of them sprinkled with household
detergents to try to mask the smell of the plastic-wrapped
marijuana from drug sniffing dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, he said, the shipments had a retail value of more than
$140 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''They thought they had built a foolproof system,'' said Raymond
W. Kelly, commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bryden, FedEx's security chief, said the company was
asked to become involved after a suspicious package was reported by
a FedEx employee and found by the DEA to contain marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   That package and many others seized over nearly two years bore
forged shipping labels believed to have been provided by three
Federal Express customer service representatives who also will be
charged, DEA agents said.
</P>
<P>
   One FedEx security officer also is believed to have been
involved, they said.
</P>
<P>
   DEA officials in Washington and court papers filed by the U.S.
Attorney's office in New York City alleged that bribes of up to
$2,000 a week were paid to targeted FedEx drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This drug trafficking operation, aided by corrupt employees of
an international shipping company, was staggering in its size and
scope,'' said U.S. Attorney Loretta E. Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Her office said that if convicted, the defendants face maximum
40-year prison sentences and $2 million fines.
</P>
<P>
   DEA officials in Washington said that so far arrests have
occurred in California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, New
Jersey, Georgia and Florida, agents said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the world's largest drug organizations, the Arellano
Felix gang, based in Tijuana, Mexico, supplied the marijuana to
Jamaican traffickers in Southern California, the agents said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was predominantly a Jamaican organization based in Los
Angeles,'' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jamaicans used FedEx trucks to move the marijuana to company
aircraft, which flew it to airports on the East Coast. From there
it was moved by FedEx truck to Jamaican confederates in
Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Georgia and
Florida for sale to drug users.
</P>
<P>
   The DEA said he had no information that any FedEx pilots were
involved.
</P>
<P>
   The agents said that once the packaged marijuana reached a FedEx
warehouse in New York or New Jersey it would be loaded on a FedEx
truck. Somewhere on the truck's normal delivery route it would be
met by another vehicle and the marijuana transferred, the agents
said.
</P>
<P>
   They said that because false labels were used, the marijuana
ring also avoided FedEx shipping charges which they estimated at
more than $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The agents said that when one FedEx driver was arrested at his
New Jersey home Thursday morning agents discovered $20,000 in cash
in a shoebox under his bed.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: Libya Seeks Missile Help  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon said Thursday that Libya is
seeking help from Asian and other countries to develop a
longer-range ballistic missile, but it would not confirm a
published report that China has provided such assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Times reported in Thursday's editions that China
has been providing Libya with missile technology since March 1999.
The newspaper said Lt. Gen. Michael Hayden, director of the
National Security Agency, outlined the technology transfer in a
classified government report dated March 2.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, chief spokesman for Defense Secretary William
Cohen, said when asked about the Times report that it was well
known Libya wants to build missiles of longer range than the Scud-B
missiles it currently has.
</P>
<P>
   ''They do not have the indigenous technological capability to do
that, so they have been trying to work with other countries in the
world in order to gain that capability,'' Bacon said. ''And beyond
that, I'm not going to comment on specific intelligence reports,
but those countries are in Asia and other parts of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   China is not a party to the international Missile Technology
Control Regime that limits transfers of missile-building knowhow
and components, but Bacon said China has pledged not to provide
other countries with finished missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ''So the question is, if China were providing help, what would
the help be and how would it compare to the pledge not to transport
entire missiles?'' Bacon said.

<HEADLINE> FedEx worker stabbed to death by co-worker in airport parking lot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A Federal Express employee stabbed a
co-worker to death in a parking lot of Newark International Airport
early Thursday, then confessed to a toll taker on the New Jersey
Turnpike and patiently waited at the toll booth for police to
arrest him, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Ernestine Williams of Roselle, 25, was stabbed to death in her
car at about 3:15 a.m. A co-worker, Raheem Wilcox, 21, of
Irvington, was charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey, which operates the airport, said the two left the
Federal Express building on the airport grounds and went together
to Williams' car in parking lot F.
</P>
<P>
   While they were inside, a struggle ensued, and Williams suffered
a fatal stab wound, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox fled on foot and ran to the nearby toll booths at New
Jersey Turnpike Interchange 13A just across the city line in
Elizabeth, Coleman said. Once there, he approached a toll collector
and told him what had happened, Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   The collector called state police, who responded and held him
until Port Authority police arrived. Wilcox waited at the toll
booth for police to arrest him, Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was taken to University Hospital in Newark, where she
was pronounced dead at 3:40 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the two had dated at some point, but were not
sure if their relationship had ended before the stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox was being held at the Port Authority police facility at
the airport, but was to be taken later in the day to the Essex
County Jail.

<HEADLINE> Baghdad To Let Congressman Into Iraq  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government of Saddam Hussein has agreed to
let Rep. Tony Hall enter Iraq to examine the conditions under which
its people live, the congressman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, D-Ohio, who would be the first American congressman to
visit Iraq since the Gulf War, said he would depart for Jordan on
Friday and make the overland journey to Baghdad on Sunday. His
plans call for spending four nights in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope to be able to go in there and separate the humanitarian
work from the political issues,'' Hall said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who has made hunger-fighting the primary focus of his
public life, said he wanted to investigate reports from relief
agencies that a quarter of Iraqi children may be suffering from
chronic malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would be paying particular attention to what happens
to the food and medicine entering the country under the
oil-for-food program started in 1996 to provide for Iraqis
suffering under economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   If food and medicine are not reaching the people who need them,
Hall said, he wanted to find out whether the United Nations needed
to handle things differently, whether the relief agencies needed to
do more or whether ''maybe Iraq needs to get out of the way and let
us do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   ''These are questions I have,'' he said. ''Right now I don't
have any answers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The last two United Nations officials charged with running the
oil-for-food program resigned in protest of sanctions' effect on
Iraq's people,'' Hall said. ''There is ample evidence that the
suffering is real, although the causes are less clear to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi government blames the embargo for poverty, illiteracy,
child malnutrition, infant mortality and other hardships.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions cannot be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify
Iraq is not producing weapons of mass destruction. Iraq has barred
inspectors for the past year.

<HEADLINE> Report: EPA failing to protect children farmworkers frompesticides  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government is failing to protect
children working in farm fields from exposure to potentially
dangerous pesticides, according to a report released on Thursday by
Congress' nonpartisan investigative arm.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office report concluded that children in
farm fields ''are especially vulnerable to the adverse effects of
pesticides and are not adequately protected from pesticide
exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said the Environmental Protection Agency's Worker
Protection Standard is not enforced consistently and treats
children as adults.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when the EPA measures the amount of time that
should elapse before workers are allowed back into the fields after
pesticides are sprayed, it uses a body weight of 154 pounds - well
over the weight of a small child, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas Lantos, D-Calif., requested the GAO probe along with
Reps. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.
But in a written response to the GAO, Marcia Mulkey, director of
pesticide programs, said EPA was reviewing its worker protection
standards. She said, in concept the agency agreed with the report's
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Mull, executive director of the Association of Farmworker
Opportunity Programs, called the report's findings troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Department of Labor has found children as young as six
working in agriculture. We know that children far younger than that
are accompanying their parents into the field,'' she said. ''The
health of hundreds of thousands of children is at great risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Children age 13 and under may perform agricultural work with
parental permission and certain other restrictions, under
Department of Labor guidelines. While it is difficult to measure
exactly how many child workers there are at any one time, a Rutgers
University study in 1998 estimated that 290,000 children --
two-thirds of them 15 years or younger -- were working unlawfully in
American in 1997. The study analyzed census and other data.
</P>
<P>
   According to the EPA guidelines, the 154-pound benchmark can be
used to protect children 12 years old and up because ''their bodies
have less surface area and they perform less work.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mull said that failed to take into account that children
''tend to roll right around in the dirt and plants'' more than
adults, increasing their exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The report called on the EPA to back up their claim that the
current standards are adequate for children ages 12 and up. And
noting that children under age 12 are even more vulnerable to
pesticide exposure, it recommended the EPA create separate
standards for them.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report said children under age 12 are at increased risk
because their internal organs are maturing, they fail to wear
clothing that protects them from exposure and they are involved in
more contact with plants and soil.
</P>
<P>
   The report also urged the EPA to expand its database on
pesticide-related illnesses and to improve the distribution of that
information, saying there was a general lack of reliable
information. And it recommended more consistent enforcement of
existing worker standards.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect EPA to implement these recommendations and report to
us on their progress,'' Waxman said.

<HEADLINE> New York Times Earnings Up 35 Pct.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Times Co. posted a 35.3 percent
increase in first-quarter earnings, beating Wall Street estimates
as newspaper advertising revenue surged.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of The New York Times, The Boston Globe and 22 other
newspapers earned $83.1 million, or 47 cents a share, in the
January-March period, up from $61.4 million, or 34 cents a share, a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The latest results beat the consensus estimate of 43 cents a
share of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue climbed 14.1 percent to $843.2 million from $739.1
million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   New York Times shares fell $1.43} to $41.43} in trading at 4:30
p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ''The year is off to a very strong start with newspaper
advertising revenues up 18.0 percent in the first quarter,'' said
chairman Arthur Sulzberger Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Operating profit increased 38.9 percent in the newspaper group.
Ad revenue rose 19.9 percent at its flagship newspaper and 13.3
percent at the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, newsprint expenses fell 3.7 percent due to
lower costs.
</P>
<P>
   Profits were up 5.7 percent in the broadcast group, which
includes eight TV and two radio stations, and were flat in the
magazine group that includes three titles led by Golf Digest.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the New York Times Co. said it was forming a

suppliers for a range of goods and services including computer
equipment and production supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium will be called KR/NYT Enterprises LLC and ''will
make full use of its considerable marketplace leverage to reduce

<HEADLINE> FleetBoston Earnings Jump in 1Q  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN POPE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- FleetBoston Financial reported a 45 percent jump
in first-quarter net income as the bank capitalized on a strong
capital markets business tied to the frenzied stock market.
</P>
<P>
   A year after Fleet and BankBoston merged to create the country's
eighth largest bank, the company reported earnings of $957 million
in the first quarter, or $1.03 per share, compared with $661
million, or 68 cents a share a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding merger-related costs, earnings rose 22 percent to $808
million, or 87 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ''The early read on the combination between BankBoston and Fleet
Financial is that it's a smashing success,'' said Gerard Cassidy,
managing director of equity research at Tucker Anthony Cleary Gull
in Portland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings easily beat predictions of analysts, who were told
last month the company should beat their average estimate of 80
cents by 7 cents a share. In January, analysts were estimating
earnings of 67 cents a share, Cassidy said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very impressive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   FleetBoston's shares fell $1.06\ to $37.25 in trading at 4:30
p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange, where stocks were broadly
lower Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The bank posted very strong results in non-interest income,
which jumped 51 percent to $2.36 billion from $1.56 billion in the
first quarter 1999. Much of that was driven by the company's
capital markets business led by Robertson Stephens, and investment
services, which includes its online trading unit Quick &AMP; Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   The bank raked in fees from mergers and acquisitions and by
underwriting public offerings, Cassidy said.
</P>
<P>
   FleetBoston's specialist operations, meanwhile, benefitted from
heavy trading in stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their specialist operations don't really care if the markets
go up and down, they just care about volume,'' Cassidy said.
</P>
<P>
   Net-interest income was basically flat at $1.72 billion in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   While non-interest expenses also were up, $2.41 billion compared
to $1.94 billion last year, FleetBoston plans to fire 4,000
employees by the end of the year to reduce overlapping jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The merged company has outperformed all expectations,'' said
Terry Murray, FleetBoston chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy agreed FleetBoston is off to a fast start. But he said
the final verdict won't come for another year, when the two
companies are fully integrated and have completed their divestiture
of 278 branches to Sovereign Bank of Pennsylvania, as required by
the Federal Reserve Board when it approved the merger.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Amo Houghton says he will seek an eighth term  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLEAN, N.Y. (AP) -- Rep. Amo Houghton, eager to protect his
district and the Republicans' slim majority, said Thursday he will
seek an eighth term.
</P>
<P>
   The 74-year-old Houghton had planned to retire but was concerned
if he did that his district in southwestern New York might be
eliminated when Congressional lines are redrawn after this year's
census count. New York is expected to lose two Congressional seats.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rural representation is real and if you want to look out the
window and let the scene pass you by then you get outdistricted and
I'm not going to allow that,'' Houghton said in Olean during a trip
through his 10-county district, which stretches from Lake Erie in
Chautauqua County to the Finger Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   He made his plans known to Gov. George Pataki and state Senate
Majority Leader Joe Bruno on Wednesday. ''Now, they can't give me
any promises but at least they know how strongly I feel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A self-described moderate, Houghton was one of only two
Republicans to vote against impeaching President Clinton. He pushed
instead for a strongly worded censure. He founded The Republican
Main Street Partnership in 1997 to bring together moderate
lawmakers and business executives, governors and mayors. He has
been a staunch advocate for the National Endowment for the Arts and
public television.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton's centrist views have often put him at odds with more
conservative leaders in the House. But many of those leaders --
worried about defending another open seat in November -- lobbied him
aggressively to stay. Democrats must pick up only six seats to
regain control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert was among those who met with
Houghton in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had a lot of impact on me,'' Houghton said. ''It's not that
he put the hard sell on it but he said, 'please, if this is
important to you, hang with it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert spokesman John Feehrey called Houghton's announcement
''a very important decision for the GOP.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This shows that Republicans are going to keep the majority,''
Feehrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton came to Congress after 25 years at the helm of the
Fortune 500 Company Corning Inc., which his family founded in his
hometown of Corning. He is one of the wealthiest members of
Congress and pays for his foreign travel. Corning's stock has
soared recently because the company is the largest supplier of
fiber optics, credited with allowing for expansion of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from Corning, Houghton considered becoming a
missionary in Africa, but ran for Congress instead. He has won
re-election easily.
</P>
<P>
   A devout Episcopalian, Houghton is co-chairman of the Faith and
Politics Institute, a nonpartisan interfaith group set up to
provide political leaders with opportunities for moral reflection
and spiritual community.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Won't Ask For Pardon  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton heatedly said Thursday ''I'm
not ashamed'' about being impeached and ''I'm not interested'' in
being pardoned for any alleged crimes in the Monica Lewinsky
scandal and Whitewater investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton did not say whether he would accept a pardon if it
were offered by his successor. Republicans immediately pounced on
his failure to answer the question.
</P>
<P>
   ''The answer is I have no interest in it. I wouldn't ask for it.
I don't think it would be necessary,'' the president told the
convention of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. ''I am
prepared to stand before any bar of justice I have to stand
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance brought forth his most emotional outpouring
yet about the impact of the sex-and-lies Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've paid quite a lot,'' he said. ''I struggled very hard to
save my relationship with my wife and my daughter.... I made a
terrible mistake of which I am deeply regretful. But I think that
the average, ordinary person reviewing the wreckage left in that
would say that I paid for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was obviously irritated that the pardon and impeachment
issues arose in a question-and-answer session after he spoke to
editors about the Republicans' $1.83 trillion budget. He boasted
about the nation's booming economy and criticized the GOP budget as
''loaded with exploding tax breaks and untenable cuts in critical
investment.''
</P>
<P>
   After his address, the first question was whether Clinton would
request or accept a pardon. It was a subject Clinton has never
directly addressed, although his former lawyer Charles F.C. Ruff,
told the House impeachment hearings in 1998 that the president
would not pardon himself nor accept a pardon. Vice President Al
Gore, in what his office said was a reference to Ruff's comment,
repeated that assertion in an appearance before the editors
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton remains under a legal cloud despite being acquitted of
perjury and obstruction of justice charges by the Senate last year
after his impeachment by the House. Independent Counsel Robert Ray,
who succeeded Kenneth Starr in the investigation of the Whitewater
and Lewinsky cases, has said he has hired additional prosecutors
and was considering whether to indict Clinton after he leaves
office.
</P>
<P>
   The president angrily called the Whitewater investigation ''a
lie and a fraud from the beginning'' and railed that ''no one has
written the full story yet.'' He snapped at the audience, ''I can
imagine why you wouldn't, particularly, given the way a lot of this
has been covered.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ended his answer with a curt command: ''Next question.''
He promptly was asked if his presidential library would have a wing
to deal with impeachment saga of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll have to deal with it, it's an important part of it,''
Clinton said. But he then said, ''I am proud of what we did there
because I think we saved the Constitution of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   He portrayed his impeachment battle as part of a struggle
against the Republican crusade that began with the GOP takeover of
the House in 1994 and led to the government shutdown in 1995. ''We
beat back the Contract on America (the GOP agenda). Then we had to
beat it in the impeachment issue,'' Clinton said. ''Then we had to
beat it when I vetoed the (GOP) tax cut last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said voters rendered their verdict when they re-elected
him in 1996 and boosted the Democrats' strength in the House in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''But as a political matter, you have no idea -- I'm not ashamed
of the fact that they impeached me,'' the president said. ''That
was their decision, not mine. And it was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a matter of law, the Constitution and history, it was
wrong,'' Clinton continued. ''And I am glad I didn't quit and I'm
glad we fought it. And the American people stuck with me, and I am
profoundly grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   He called his impeachment ''one of the major chapters in my
defeat of the revolution'' led by former House Speaker Newt
Gingrich. He said Gingrich's agenda ''would have taken this country
in a very different direction than it's going today and also would
have changed the Constitution forever, in a way that would have
been very destructive to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart sharply criticized the
editors for their questions -- limited to four by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are purportedly reasonably intelligent people but I
think it demonstrates just how isolated some newspaper editors are
from the rest of the country,'' Lockhart said. ''They get a chance
to ask the president about anything, any challenges that face
America and ... the best they can come up with is two questions
about impeachment. The country has moved past this. Unfortunately
many major newspaper editors haven't. It may be some reason for
declining circulation.''
</P>
<P>
   In reply, N. Christian Anderson III, ASNE president and
publisher-chief executive officer of The Orange County Register,
expressed regret that the White House limited the number of
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''All four questions were thoughtful and concerned issues that
are on the minds of many Americans represented by newspaper editors
who are much closer to their communities than Mr. Lockhart might
imagine,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson seized on
Clinton's pardon answer, noting the president merely said he would
not ask for nor want a pardon. ''Perhaps the question of the year
is whether or not he will accept a pardon,'' he said. ''Once again,
Clintonian speak rears its ugly head.''

<HEADLINE> First Union Reports 13 Percent Drop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE (AP) -- First Union said Thursday that profits slumped
13 percent in the first quarter as fee income declined and costs
rose at the nation's sixth-largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   Operating profits, which exclude merger-related costs, totaled
$838 million, or 85 cents a share, meeting Wall Street's lowered
expectations. That compares with operating earnings of $965
million, or $1 a share, for the first quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   Including charges for First Union's acquisition of CoreStates
Financial two years ago, net income totaled $840 million, or 85
cents a share, compared with $706 million, or 73 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been prepared for a less prosperous year at the
Charlotte, N.C.-based bank, which has branches in 12 eastern states
and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   First Union's shares fell 81\ cents to $35.87{ in trading at
4:30 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange. The bank's stock has
fallen almost 38 percent in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, fee income slipped more than 3 percent to
$1.86 billion from $1.93 billion. That was offset by a 10 percent
rise in net interest income to $1.99 billion.
</P>
<P>
   However, the bank's strategy of saving money by laying off
workers appeared to have backfired. First Union is now spending
heavily to keep key employees. The bank's non-interest expenses
jumped 13 percent to $2.39 billion in the first quarter.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Rebound As Stocks Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Government bonds rebounded Thursday as blue-chip
stocks stumbled and traders looked for a haven for money coming out
of the stock market. The gains came despite fresh inflation
warnings.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/32, or
$2.81 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the
opposite direction, fell to 5.79 percent from 5.81 percent late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Treasurys bounced higher amid a broad selloff of stocks. The Dow
industrials fell 201.58 and the Nasdaq composite index extended its
slide into bear market territory, giving up early gains to close
down an additional 92.85.
</P>
<P>
   Traders typically buy relatively safe Treasury bonds to park
their money during turbulent times on stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   The late gains for bonds reversed early losses on fresh
inflation jitters.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the trading day, the government reported that
soaring energy prices made wholesale inflation in March rise 1
percent for the second month in a row. In addition, there was a
fresh inflation warning from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised interest rates five times since June to try
to keep a lid on inflation. It is widely expected to increase rates
a sixth time in May.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates and high inflation both reduce the value
of investments that pay a fixed return, such as bonds.
</P>
<P>
   In the broader bond market, short-term notes were unchanged to
up 3/32 point, while intermediate notes rose [ point to 7/32 point,
reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.79 percent as the
discount fell 0.02 percentage point from Wednesday to 5.64 percent.
Six-month yields were 6.05 percent, and the discount remained at
5.80 percent. One-year yields were 6.10 percent as the discount
fell 0.01 percentage point to 5.79 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the
discount is the interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, rose to 6.00 percent from 5.94 percent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 1/32 at 95 23/32. The average yield to
maturity was 5.92 percent, unchanged from Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Senate Dems To Push Gun Control  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- Frustrated over gridlocked gun control
legislation, Senate Democrats said Thursday they would ''consider
all procedural and parliamentary options'' to restart negotiations,
even if it means blocking some legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they were angry that the legislation is stuck in
a conference committee, with the anniversary next week of the
Columbine High School shootings. The measure passed the Senate soon
after last year's shootings at the Colorado school.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our message is simple,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.
''There is nothing on the Senate schedule more pressing than saving
children's lives. We are sick and tired of delay and we aren't
going to take it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten Senate Democrats detailed their concerns in a letter to
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are extremely frustrated, as most Americans must be, by
this lack of progress,'' they wrote. ''We will carefully consider
all of our procedural and parliamentary options in an effort to
ensure that the conferees finish their work and send a conference
report to the House and Senate before the school year ends in
June.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they were still working out details of their plan
to get the bill moving and could not specify their actions.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans pointed the finger at Democrats and said the dispute
could have been resolved months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's certainly regrettable that the Democrats would try to use
the Columbine tragedy as a news hook to further their political
aims,'' said Lott spokesman John Czwartacki.
</P>
<P>
   Czwartacki accused House Democrats of rejecting GOP-backed gun
control measures. ''Today we could be one step closer. These could
all be law today if Democrats had not decided to put politics
before progress.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton traveled to Columbine on Wednesday in hopes of
turning up the pressure on Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   A House-Senate conference committee has been assigned to
reconcile differences between a Senate-passed bill that would set a
72-hour background check on gun-show sales and a House bill that
shrank the wait to 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has met only once, in August. The White House
attributes the delay to political maneuvering by the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., floated a
concession on the key issue of waiting periods for gun show
purchases. In a letter Wednesday, Hyde said a majority of House
Republicans involved in negotiating the legislation supported a
compromise closer to the president's position.
</P>
<P>
   In line with Clinton's thinking, Hyde said, background check
waiting periods would apply both to would-be gun purchasers with
unresolved arrest records and those with red flags for other
offenses such as drug use, mental incapacity, domestic violence or
stalking.
</P>
<P>
   But the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Rep. John
Conyers of Michigan discounted Hyde's offer and said it was
''further capitulation by the Republican leadership to the NRA's
political gamesmanship.'' Conyers said the GOP compromise contained
fatal loopholes that exempted people indicted for crimes from
longer waiting periods and allowed ''bad apple'' gun dealers to
avoid federal scrutiny.

<HEADLINE> Congress Nears OK of $1.83T Budget  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ignoring President Clinton's position that the
plan ''defies common sense,'' Congress moved Thursday to the brink
of approving a $1.83 trillion budget calling for tax cuts, debt
reduction and extra money for schools and the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted nearly party-line, 220-208, to approve the
fiscal 2001 measure. Quick Senate passage was expected. Clinton
does not have to sign the fiscal outline, but an election-year veto
battle looms over 13 annual spending bills and any tax legislation
lawmakers send him translating their budget's plans into reality.
</P>
<P>
   The package leaves the two parties poised for a campaign season
touting starkly different views of how to use surpluses from the
non-Social Security side of the budget. Republicans would use much
of it for tax cuts, Democrats prefer more domestic spending and
debt reduction, and each accuses the other of jeopardizing Social
Security surpluses they have pledged to leave alone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who would like to spend more are not keeping their eye
on the target: balancing the budget, paying down debt, protecting
Social Security,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that to pay for excessive tax cuts, Republicans
would slice needed domestic programs while insufficiently
bolstering Social Security and Medicare or reducing the national
debt. He said Congress should have done a better job of using
''this magic moment of possibility'' -- the government's hardy
fiscal health.
</P>
<P>
   ''The proposal from my point of view defies common sense,'' he
told the American Society of Newspaper Editors. ''I think the
argument is over. We had a test run. We had 12 years of their
proposals -- do the big tax cuts first and it'll all work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's reference was to the 12 years of Presidents Reagan and
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He also seemed to take a swipe at George W. Bush, the GOP's
presumptive presidential nominee, saying the tax cut plan
Republicans are ''running on this year is even bigger'' than the
10-year, $792 billion tax package he vetoed last year. Bush's $483
billion, five-year plan has an estimated 10-year cost of more than
$1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Completion of the budget would mark the second straight year
Congress had done so by the April 15 deadline. The date is usually
ignored, but the quick action illustrates how GOP leaders are
determined to adjourn Congress early for re-election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides would use the $1 trillion in expected Social Security
surpluses over the next five years to reduce the $3.7 trillion
publicly held debt, with the goal of eliminating it by 2013. Most
economists say such a dramatic reduction of that debt would press
interest rates downward and fuel the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the two parties are divided over how to use the surplus
projected from the rest of the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans would use much of it for a tax cut of at least $150
billion and perhaps more than $200 billion, depending on lawmakers'
decisions and how much economic growth occurs over the next few
months. Democrats want a smaller tax reduction, with more money set
aside for domestic programs and debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   ''In an election year, they want to spend all your money and
tell you that's right,'' Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete
Domenici, R-N.M., said of Democrats, adding, ''Beware.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, said, ''Any way you want to
cut it, the center piece of this budget is a massive tax cut at the
expense of debt reduction, Social Security, agriculture and
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican budget would set aside up to $40 billion over
five years for any new prescription drug benefits that lawmakers
add to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   But action is not required, and the money could be used for
other ''reforms,'' such as easing cuts in Medicare reimbursements
to many hospitals enacted in the 1997 budget-balancing deal.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties say they want to enact a prescription program this
year. Clinton wants it to cover all elderly Americans, while
Republicans want to limit it to lower-income people or those with
extremely high drug bills.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also calls for $311 billion for defense next year, $5
billion more than Clinton wants. And it would spend $289 billion
for domestic programs, about $30 billion less than Clinton seeks.
</P>
<P>
   Included would be increases for education, veterans and
biomedical research, though final decisions will be made in later
spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining two-thirds of the budget covers interest payments
on the debt, plus benefits like Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The measure approved Thursday was a House-Senate compromise of
similar budgets each chamber had passed earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In a symbolic victory for environmentalists, the compromise
dropped non-binding language assuming that some money would be
raised by allowing oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge. The Senate had narrowly refused last week to drop
that provision.

<HEADLINE> Total Mutual Fund Assets Are Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market
mutual funds fell by $3.73 billion in the latest week to $1.014
trillion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category fell
by $3.50 billion to $841.69 billion for the week ended Wednesday,
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund
assets fell by $229.2 million to $172.29 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Assets of institutional money market funds rose by $2.64 billion
to $705.34 billion for the same period. Among institutional funds,
taxable money market fund assets rose by $2.76 billion to $652.01
billion; assets of tax-exempt funds fell by $124.5 million to
$53.33 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Total money market assets stood at $1.719 trillion for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.720 trillion to
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 5.45 percent from 5.47 percent the
previous week, said Money Fund Report, a service of iMoneyNet Inc.
in Westboro, Mass. The 30-day average yield rose to 5.40 percent
from 5.36 percent, according to Money Fund Report.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-day compounded yield fell to 5.60 percent from 5.62
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield rose to
5.54 percent from 5.50 percent, Money Fund Report.
</P>
<P>
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds
remained unchanged at 48 days, said Money Fund Report.
</P>
<P>
   The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage
yield available on money market accounts remained unchanged at 2.03
percent as of Wednesday from a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing
checking accounts kept at 0.83 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.94 percent
on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 4.90 percent the
previous week. Yields held steady at 5.36 percent on 1-year CDs;
5.61 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 5.63 percent; and 6.00
percent on 5-year CDs, down from 6.01 percent.

<HEADLINE> Treasurer reform bill passes Legislature  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A bill intended to reform the operation
of the state treasurer's office in the wake of crimes committed by
former-Treasurer Paul Silvester has passed the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The bill sailed through the Senate unanimously, then passed the
House on a 141-7 vote Thursday. It now goes to Gov. John G.
Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll decide whether to sign the bill after reviewing it,''
said Rowland spokesman Dean Pagani.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland had threatened to veto a weaker version of the bill last
week because it didn't impose enough oversight of the office or
crack down on so-called finder's fees paid by companies to people
who set up investment deals with the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''This makes the office of treasurer a little bit less risky,''
said Rep. Ronald San Angelo, R-Naugatuck. ''This truly is the real
treasurer reform bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The reform measure came out of last year's scandal surrounding
Silvester, a Rowland appointee who pleaded guilty in September to
charges of racketeering and money laundering related to
fund-raising in his failed 1998 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted accepting kickbacks from finders fees paid by
companies with which he invested state pension money. He is to be
sentenced June 16.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, the state Ethics Commission would have a say in
determining who can collect finder's fees for brokering investments
of state pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would create the position of investment specialist
in the treasurer's office and strengthen oversight safeguards by
the Investment Advisory Council.
</P>
<P>
   The bill outlaws the payment of finder's fees to anybody except
qualified financial counselors so designated by the treasurer in
consultation with ethics officials. It provides penalties for
anybody who violates the finder's fee provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bill addresses our concerns,'' said Alan Plofsky,
executive director of the state Ethics Commission. He had attacked
the earlier version of the bill, which would have permitted
''investment professionals'' to do business with the treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   Plofsky said the earlier bill was virtually worthless because
anybody could call himself an ''investment professional.'' The
amended bill is a great improvement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   State Treasurer Denise Nappier also supports the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is sound, it is prudent and it was the right thing to do,''
Nappier said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, among other things, replaces the deputy treasurer with
a chief investment officer and prohibits the state treasurer, any
candidate for state treasurer, or any member of the Investment
Advisory Council, from seeking campaign contributions from persons
connected to an investment company.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, who has denied any knowledge of Silvester's
fund-raising illegalities, appointed Silvester after former
treasurer Christopher Burnham resigned to take a job with an
investment company that had done business with the state.
</P>
<P>
   The reform bill requires the treasurer to wait at least one year
from the date a contract is negotiated before going to work for the
company, if the contract amounts to at least $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also restricts the governor's power to appoint someone
to fill a vacancy in the Treasurer's Office when the General
Assembly is not in session.

<HEADLINE> Senate panel passes ban on college betting, rejects minimumgambling age  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate committee voted Thursday to ban
betting on college sports -- a practice legal only in Nevada -- but
declined a challenge from a Nevada senator to enact a nationwide
minimum gambling age of 21.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., accused his colleagues on the Senate
Commerce Committee of hypocrisy on the issue of gambling by young
people. He suggested they were interested only in ''trying to give
Nevada the shaft.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation approved by the committee would outlaw betting
on Olympic, college or high school athletic events. Though there is
little legal betting on the Olympics and none on high school
sports, Nevada's gambling industry does accept bets on college
sporting events that do not involve a Nevada school.
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada gambling industry took in $2.3 billion in sports
wagers in fiscal 1999, with 30 percent to 40 percent bet on college
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent requests by the National Hockey League, National
Basketball Association, National Football League and Major League
Baseball to extend the proposed ban to professional sports, the
committee retained the bill's focus on amateur events.
</P>
<P>
   ''Legalized gambling on kids is wrong,'' said Commerce Committee
Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz. ''They should not be reduced to a
point spread and a spectacle for wagering.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the amateur sports betting ban say it will help in
the broader fight against illegal gambling on college campuses. But
Bryan said the ban ''will have absolutely no impact at all''
because 99 percent of gambling on college sports occurs illegally
on college campuses, not legally in Nevada casinos.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 16-2, the committee rejected an amendment offered
by Bryan that would have exempted colleges from the ban. Only Sen.
John Breaux, D-La., joined Bryan in voting to exempt college sports
betting.
</P>
<P>
   In its report last year, the National Gambling Impact Study
Commission recommended banning bets on college sports. But it also,
as Bryan noted, recommended a nationwide minimum age of 21 to
gamble. He proposed that as an amendment to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   While casinos in Nevada and most other states forbid betting by
those under 21, some states -- including New Jersey -- allow people
as young as 18 to bet on horse races or buy lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how anybody can defend allowing high school kids
to gamble,'' Bryan said. But the committee voted down the idea,
13-5.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also rejected proposals by Bryan to force colleges
to spend more money on gambling abuse prevention, to cut off aid to
any student-athlete caught gambling illegally, and to step up
efforts to reduce illegal gambling by students.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan said the National Collegiate Athletic Association, a
principal supporter of the betting ban, and its member colleges and
universities are worrying too much about Nevada while doing too
little to address the real problem of gambling on campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ''How serious are we about this effort?'' Bryan asked
rhetorically as his amendments were shot down, one after another.
''Is this a serious national problem or isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., defended the NCAA's efforts on
illegal gambling by students.
</P>
<P>
   So did Doris Dixon, NCAA director of federal relations, who said
representatives travel from campus to campus to hold seminars on
the topic.
</P>
<P>
   The House has not yet held a hearing on companion legislation
sponsored by Reps. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Tim Roemer, D-Ind.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Elections Spur Tension  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez's main
challenger in next month's polls has refused to take part in a new
plan to include opposition members on a panel meant to ensure fair
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidate Francisco Arias Cardenas called the
government's proposal a ''joke'' because it doesn't give the
opposition a vote on the National Election Council.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't name someone to serve on the National Election Council
as a clown,'' said Arias, according to a campaign press release
issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Arias's comments came as tensions over May 28 presidential
elections intensified with opposition politicians, Catholic Church
leaders and retired military officials insisting fair balloting may
not be possible because Chavez controls the electoral council.
</P>
<P>
   Election authorities this week proposed allowing each
presidential candidate to name a representative to the council as
observers without decision making power.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the government's plan to add nonvoting members,
Arias, a former army officer who helped Chavez stage his famous
1992 coup attempt, has asked the council to add five new voting
representatives from various civic and political organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The National Election Council has come under increasing pressure
to move quickly to ensure fair elections after two mayors from the
opposition party were dismissed from office Tuesday and replaced
with members of President Hugo Chavez's ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   An interim legislature appointed by a pro-Chavez constitutional
assembly alleged the mayors from the eastern state of Delta Amacuro
were creating an ''unstable situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an abuse of power,'' said Armando Rodriguez, head of
Venezuela's mayoral association. He said the allegations were vague
and unfounded. ''This may be the start of a grand persecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's critics say the decision was just the latest attempt by
the president to amass power and silence opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office last year, Chavez has pushed through a new
constitution that dissolved congress and called for new balloting
to ''re-legitimize'' most public offices, including the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez faces his most serious challenge from Arias, a former
comrade-in-arms who accuses the president of abandoning the
original goals of their 1992 rebellion. Arias is seen as having a
real chance against the charismatic president because he isn't part
of the traditional parties Chavez virtually erased since taking
office.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders have expressed concern over the fact the election
council was hand-picked by Chavez's movement, saying it failed to
guarantee the most basic impartiality needed in a popular election.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Two small bombs exploded next to an
Israeli military vehicle near an Israeli settlement in the Gaza
Strip Thursday, Palestinian police said. There were no injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian and Israeli security forces searched the area after
the explosions near the settlement of Netzarim, an isolated Israeli
enclave southwest of Gaza City, said Abdel Razek al-Majaideh,
commander of Palestinian police in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   The bombs exploded as Israelis were gathering at the settlement
for a ceremony, Israel radio reported. Gunshots were fired at an
Israeli military jeep escorting civilian vehicles, said the radio
report. Israeli forces returned fire.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians control most of the Gaza Strip, but Israeli
soldiers patrol areas around Jewish settlements. Israeli soldiers
and Palestinian police patrol some of the main roads together. Most
of the settlements are in a bloc at the southern end of the
territory, but Netzarim stands alone near the largest Palestinian
city.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians demand that all the Israeli settlements be removed
as part of a peace treaty.

<HEADLINE> Monitors Said Key in Peru Runoff  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- International monitors may have made the
difference between election fraud and a ballot outcome that will
force President Alberto Fujimori into a runoff election with
economist Alejandro Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   Observers and diplomats, mainly from the United States and
Europe, were key players in last Sunday's general elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''Based on their reports, the international community stepped up
the pressure on the government,'' said political scientist Fernando
Rospigliosi. ''Ultimately, the government might have been disposed
to ignore the popular protests, but what they definitely could not
ignore was international pressure and the threat of sanctions. That
was key.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, exit polls and unofficial tallies by independent
monitors had indicated Fujimori would not reach the 50 percent plus
one vote needed to win.
</P>
<P>
   But after an unexplained 12-hour delay, the first official
returns showed Fujimori on track to claim a first-round victory,
prompting suspicions of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   For three tense days, Toledo's supporters took to the streets by
the tens of thousands in Peru's main cities in mostly peaceful
demonstrations that threatened to turn violent if Fujimori claimed
an unprecedented third five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   The president's supporters complained that the monitors were
helping destabilize the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are conscious that our work has been highly scrutinized,''
said Eduardo Stein, head of the delegation from the Organization of
American States, responding to government criticism that election
monitors overstepped their bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe we have tried to conduct an active observation in an
extremely complex and questionable election,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS mission fielded 80 people on election day, complimenting
some 20,000 Peruvian monitors from Peru's Ombudsman office and
Transparencia, a citizen watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   While Peruvians went to the polls on Sunday, the U.S. Congress
was in the process of passing a bipartisan resolution advising
President Alberto Fujimori that the United States could ''modify
its political and economic relations with Peru'' if international
observers continued to find fault with his third-term re-election
bid.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Tudela, Fujimori's vice presidential candidate and a
former foreign minister, complained bitterly about U.S.
interference in the election.
</P>
<P>
   He said he rejected in the ''most energetic terms the fact that
a foreign government would emit a judgment value about elections in
another country before the official count is in.''
</P>
<P>
   But political scientist Fernando Tuesta said without the
attention brought to bear by the monitors, ''the government would
have imposed a first round victory.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Of that I'm absolutely sure,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 30-Yr., 15-Yr. Mortgage Rates Slip  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rates on 30-year and 15-year mortgages edged
down for the second week in a row but are still up more than 1
percentage point from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell
to 8.12 percent for the week ending April 14 from 8.20 percent the
previous week, according to a survey released Thursday by Freddie
Mac, the mortgage company. This time a year ago, 30-year mortgages
averaged 6.87 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-February, the rates on 30-year mortgages hit a 3{-year
high of 8.38 percent. That was the highest since a 8.42 percent
rate for the week ending July 12, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing, also
ticked down this week to 7.76 percent from 7.83 percent. This time
a year ago, 15-year mortgages were at 6.47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an
average initial rate of 6.86 percent this week, up from 6.79
percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three
types of mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said
that mortgage loan applications for the week ending April 7
increased 7.7 percent from the previous week and were down 13
percent compared with the same week last year.

<HEADLINE> Nike hits the wrong chord with Bo Diddley  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- If Nike thought it could sell Bo Diddley
T-shirts without paying the guitar legend, the company might not
know Diddley.
</P>
<P>
   Diddley filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Manhattan late
Wednesday against Nike, saying the company had been marketing
T-shirts with his name, likeness and the words, ''You Don't Know
Diddley.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry that it's come to this but what's right is right,''
Diddley said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed with Diddley's real name, Ellas McDaniel,
said Nike struck a sour note with the 71-year-old rock 'n' roll
performer last year when it went ahead with the T-shirt sales even
though he never accepted the terms of a contract proposal made by
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 28,000 T-shirts were sold worldwide for more than
$200,000 after the company concluded it had an oral agreement with
Diddley, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   The T-shirt campaign was a revival of a T-shirt sold a decade
earlier when Diddley was featured in a Nike television commercial
with athlete Bo Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit sought unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   Vada Manager, Nike's director of Global Issues Management, said
the Beaverton, Ore., company was aware of the lawsuit but had not
yet seen it.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company had authorized a royalty payment of between
$10,000 and $15,000 to be paid to Diddley and was prepared to
negotiate further if that was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll respond to their suit with the facts. Hopefully with
this offer, we'll have further discussions,'' said Manager, reached
by telephone in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   John Rosenberg, a lawyer for Diddley, said he was surprised to
learn Nike was talking about settlement offers similar to those
which had already been rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no settlement discussions pending at this time.
There are no proposals on the table,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Nike meant to make a proposal through the press, I will
respond through the press and say we reject it as entirely
unacceptable,'' Rosenberg added.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan: Inflation Risks Persist  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The risk of inflation persists, Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Thursday, as new government
figures showed the spike in energy costs lifting wholesale prices 1
percent last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of indications of prices going up,'' Greenspan
said in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee. ''If you look,
however, at the underlying cost structure of American business, I
see no evidence of an acceleration'' in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan defended the Fed's moves to raise interest rates and
said the stock market's wild swings in recent days showed it is
''groping for the correct balance.''
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday's close, the technology-heavy Nasdaq index had
tumbled 27 percent since its record high on March 10, putting it in
bear market territory. The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average
is down a more modest 7 percent from its Jan. 14 record, with a
decline Thursday of more than 200 points amid inflation jitters
stirred up by the report on wholesale prices.
</P>
<P>
   The recent gyrations and divergence between the two stock
indexes ''are reflecting the basic underlying forces'' of sharply
different rates of return on high-technology stocks compared with
more traditional ones, Greenspan told the senators.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what's happening is that the markets are groping for
the correct balance underlying the system,'' Greenspan said. He
added that it is very difficult to determine what the correct price
level should be.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question, the central bank chief denied that
the dramatic losses in the Nasdaq index in recent days were caused
by the Fed having pushed up interest rates five times in the past
10 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ... insist upon continuing to deny that our goal is to
jawbone the stock market. It is not,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the Fed's interest rate moves were designed to protect
the economy from potential damage from the persistent risk of
inflation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the rapid changes sweeping the nation's securities
markets, Greenspan advised against a government mandate for any
form of centralized network for displaying stock quotes and urged
caution on switching to stock trading in decimals.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street appears to be inching toward creation of a
centralized quote network, which would show stock quotes across an
array of competitive markets. Greenspan said that given the pace of
technology-driven change in the markets, ''It is difficult to
contemplate how a government mandate could be implemented; systems
might well be obsolete before we were halfway through the planning
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Millions of new investors and increasing competition from new
electronic communications networks, known as ECNs, have put
pressure on the nation's two biggest exchanges, the New York Stock
Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it fails to respond to technological change, one
centralized trading venue, even the NYSE, can be displaced by
another as other trading systems take advantage of newer technology
to offer greater efficiency or to provide new functions investors
value more highly,'' Greenspan testified.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the stock exchanges' anticipated switch to quoting
prices in decimals, rather than fractions, Greenspan said he agreed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission ''about being careful
about trying to move forward too soon.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, under a decimal system, a stock price now quoted as
10{ would become 10.50.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC had ordered the exchanges to begin decimal trading by
July 3, but the Nasdaq market said its computer systems aren't
ready to handle the switch from traditional fractions by then.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday evening, the SEC announced it was abandoning the
July 3 deadline and seeking public comment on two alternative
plans, which would bring the start of decimal trading on all
exchanges by next March 31 at the latest.
</P>
<P>
   SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt recently said he believed it would be
confusing for investors to have the NYSE start trading in decimals
before the Nasdaq did so.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anybody is smart enough to figure out where the
markets are going as we go through this dramatic change,'' Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, the Banking Committee chairman, said at the
start of the hearing. ''I think it is very important that we let
technology lead and that we let regulation follow.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said some degree of government
intervention was needed. ''The government should set speed
limits,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bill To Up Taiwan Military Aid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., on
Thursday put a bill to increase U.S. military aid to Taiwan on the
Senate calendar, possibly leading to a floor vote on the issue
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., immediately imposed a ''hold'' on
the measure, complicating Lott's efforts to bring it to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Baucus, a leader in the effort to grant China permanent trade
benefits, contends the bill could complicate the upcoming Senate
debate on the Clinton administration's China trade package.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has asked the Senate not to consider the
legislation, even though it won the 341-70 support of the House
last Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwan Security Enhancement Act would increase military
exchanges with Taiwan and reassert Congress' role as a consultant
in annual arms sales to Taiwan. China, which considers the
self-governing island a renegade province, has voiced strong
opposition to the measure.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott supports the bill and would like to see the Senate vote
on it, said Lott spokesman John Czwartacki.
</P>
<P>
   Lott put the bill on the Senate calendar at the request of a
bipartisan group of 13 senators led by Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark.
''This legislation will provide greater balance and clarity to our
relations with Taiwan and China,'' Hutchinson said in a letter to
Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Baucus' countermove means that, at the least, Lott will have to
marshall 60 votes for the measure to overcome threatened delaying
tactics.

<HEADLINE> Camden to face intense state scrutiny of financial practices  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The state agency that oversees municipal
governments plans to ask on Friday for the power to supervise all
of Camden's financial records and operations, one step shy of a
full takeover of New Jersey's poorest city.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being poor and operating efficiently is way different than
poor and not caring how you operate, and that's the point here,''
said Ulrich Steinberg, the state's director of the Division of
Local Government Services. ''The city seems to think that because
they're poor, they don't have to keep records.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials have until Saturday to correct a dozen faults
outlined by the state or face action that could include a takeover.
Camden -- where 70 cents of every city dollar spent comes from state
aid -- does not keep proper financial records, including a general
ledger and an account of city payouts, all of which are required by
law, the state alleges.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimatum came a day after Camden Mayor Milton Mayor Milan
was named in an indictment charging him with extortion, money
laundering and mail fraud. Authorities say Milan accepted payoffs
and gifts from city contractors and took bribes from organized
crime figures.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have very low ratables. They have practically no
commercial industry,'' Steinberg said. ''But the overall problem is
that you have no private investment in Camden because of the
economic and political instability.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg's application for the supervision program is scheduled
to be heard Friday morning by the state Local Finance Board. If the
board sides with Steinberg, the measure would be forwarded to the
attorney general and three cabinet officers for final approval.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman said Thursday she supports the supervision
program and if that doesn't work she will ask the Legislature for
the power to assume complete control of the city. Whitman said she
will ''certainly encourage the attorney general to move quickly''
with approval.
</P>
<P>
   ''But at the same time, I want to make sure that we are moving
forward with legislation that would give us the ultimate authority
to do a complete takeover if, in fact, the supervision doesn't do
what the people expect, and what the people of Camden deserve,''
Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hope that we'd never have to exercise that, because
it's dramatic and it's extreme, but the problems in Camden are
dramatic, and they're extreme, and we need to rectify them,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands now, Camden does not meet the strict legal grounds
for a state takeover, Steinberg said. If it did, it would become
the first municipality to be controlled by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Under the supervision program, all city spending would be
monitored by Steinberg's office, he said. The division also would
monitor hiring practices and other city procedures, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Milan did not return calls left at his office by The Associated
Press. His staff directed all questions to city attorney John A.
Misci.
</P>
<P>
   ''The city is prepared to discuss the dictates and the
timetables and the status of each one of those dictates,'' Misci
said.
</P>
<P>
   If the state does engage in the supervision program, city
residents will not notice an immediate change, Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   He and his staff will use the first few weeks to survey the
city's business practices before making changes.

<HEADLINE> Satellite TV Service Bill Approved  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House approved a bill Thursday to make it
easier for rural and small town Americans who rely on satellite
dishes for their television to get local TV signals.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which passed on a 375-37 vote, would offer $1.25
billion in loan guarantees to help satellite and other television
providers extend local TV broadcasts to areas where it is not now
financially viable to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bill is crucial for Americans in rural and smaller markets
who rely on their local television stations for news, politics,
weather, sports and emergency information,'' said Rep. Bob
Goodlatte, R-Va., a co-sponsor with Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has passed similar legislation and differences
between the two sides must now be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   A bill enacted into law last fall opened the way for satellite
carriers to provide local network TV broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   While satellite companies have begun offering local stations for
viewers in larger, more populated markets, they have made clear
that it is not economically feasible to provide such service in
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Goodlatte said that Roanoke, a city of 100,000 in his district,
will not benefit from last year's law and that more than 30 million
TV households will remain beyond the reach of local TV via
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   The bill ''will ensure that rural Americans will not be treated
as second-class citizens,'' said Eva Clayton, D-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The loan guarantees would be capped at 80 percent, meaning that
the federal government would promise to cover 80 percent of the
loans if the borrower defaults.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Military Aid Bill Submitted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., on
Thursday put a bill to increase U.S. military aid to Taiwan on the
Senate calendar, possibly leading to a floor vote on the issue
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., immediately imposed a ''hold'' on
the measure, complicating Lott's efforts to bring it to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Baucus, a leader in the effort to grant China permanent trade
benefits, contends the bill could complicate the upcoming Senate
debate on the Clinton administration's China trade package.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has asked the Senate not to consider the
legislation, even though it won the 341-70 support of the House
last Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwan Security Enhancement Act would increase military
exchanges with Taiwan and reassert Congress' role as a consultant
in annual arms sales to Taiwan. China, which considers the
self-governing island a renegade province, has voiced strong
opposition to the measure.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott supports the bill and would like to see the Senate vote
on it, said Lott spokesman John Czwartacki.
</P>
<P>
   Lott put the bill on the Senate calendar at the request of a
bipartisan group of 13 senators led by Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark.
''This legislation will provide greater balance and clarity to our
relations with Taiwan and China,'' Hutchinson said in a letter to
Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Baucus' countermove means that, at the least, Lott will have to
marshall 60 votes for the measure to overcome threatened delaying
tactics.

<HEADLINE> Bombs Explode in Gaza  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Two small bombs exploded next to an
Israeli military vehicle near an Israeli settlement in the Gaza
Strip Thursday, Palestinian police said. There were no injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian and Israeli security forces searched the area after
the explosions near the settlement of Netzarim, an isolated Israeli
enclave southwest of Gaza City, said Abdel Razek al-Majaideh,
commander of Palestinian police in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   The bombs exploded as Israelis were gathering at the settlement
for a ceremony, Israel radio reported. Gunshots were fired at an
Israeli military jeep escorting civilian vehicles, said the radio
report. Israeli forces returned fire.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians control most of the Gaza Strip, but Israeli
soldiers patrol areas around Jewish settlements. Israeli soldiers
and Palestinian police patrol some of the main roads together. Most
of the settlements are in a bloc at the southern end of the
territory, but Netzarim stands alone near the largest Palestinian
city.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians demand that all the Israeli settlements be removed
as part of a peace treaty.

<HEADLINE> House Republicans Amass War Chests  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Jim Rogan, a California Republican who is
among the Democrats' top targets this fall, had almost $1 million
in the bank as of the end of March, according to figures released
Thursday by the National Republican Congressional Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan was one of the House managers who presented the case for
impeaching President Clinton to the Senate. He had $965,000 in his
account as of March 31, as compared to $255,356 at the same time
two years earlier. Rogan has raised close to $4 million for his
re-election; in 1998, he spent a total of $1.3 million on his
campaign, which he won with 51 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan, who faces state Sen. Adam Schiff this fall, is one of
several vulnerable House Republicans who have amassed large war
chests in anticipation of tough re-election fights.
</P>
<P>
   The NRCC released the numbers Thursday to highlight how these
lawmakers are well-prepared financially to take on their Democratic
opponents. The reports are due at the Federal Election Commission
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''These record-breaking fund-raising figures clearly show that
Americans support the progress Republicans have made on issues
important to our families,'' NRCC spokeswoman Marit Babin said.
''People have responded to our message of reducing the marriage tax
penalty, returning local control of education and restoring
character and morality in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Others include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Rep. Clay Shaw in Florida, who is facing state Rep. Elaine
Bloom. Shaw had $1.3 million in the bank as of March 31 -- more than
twice as much as the $530,127 cash on hand he had two years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   -- Rep. Ernie Fletcher in Kentucky, who has raised $1.1 million
for his re-election and had $925,000 in the bank. When he first ran
in 1998, he spent $1.3 million on his campaign. Fletcher is being
opposed by former Rep. Scotty Baesler, who gave up the seat in 1998
to run for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   -- Rep. Don Sherwood in Pennsylvania, who narrowly beat Democrat
Pat Casey two years ago and now is in a rematch. Sherwood raised
$800,000 for his re-election and had $560,000 in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats touted the fund-raising success of their
candidate for the Virginia seat being vacated by retiring
Democratic Rep. Owen Pickett. Lawyer Jody Wagner raised $337,000
during the first three months of 2000 as compared to $264,000 for
GOP state Sen. Edward Ed Schrock.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a huge deal,'' Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee spokesman John Del Cecato said. ''She has really stunned
a lot of people with how successful she's been. Her fund-raising
strength shows how much support she has in the district.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also cited former Rep. Jane Harman, trying to reclaim
the California congressional seat she gave up to run for governor
in 1998. Harman raised $863,000 during the first three months of
the year, as compared to $820,000 for Republican incumbent Steve
Kuykendall. Harman also had almost twice as much money in the bank,
$700,000 versus $370,000 for Kuykendall.

<HEADLINE> Police Refuse Kennedy Video Request  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF WILSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Police rejected a plea Thursday from Rep.
Patrick Kennedy to release a videotape of his confrontation with an
airport security guard.
</P>
<P>
   Police said detectives were still investigating the March 26
incident at the Los Angeles airport and there was no decision on
whether charges would be filed.
</P>
<P>
   Security guard Della Patton claims Kennedy shoved and grabbed
her when she told him his bag was too big to fit through an X-ray
scanner.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, the Rhode Island
Democrat's lawyer asked that the surveillance videotape be made
public. Kennedy attorney Abbe Lowell said the video would clear the
congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Police have said the video shows ''physical contact'' between
Patton and Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is still being investigated by our robbery-homicide
detectives and they are proceeding. They are treating this as they
would any investigation,'' Lt. Horace Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not our intention to release that videotape. We won't do
it. It's not fair for him to do this and it's not fair to the
victim to do this. We have to maintain the integrity of the
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   During an appearance Wednesday in Washington, Kennedy admitted,
''I lost my temper.'' But he said he never hurt the woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''The entire episode has been blown completely out of
proportion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Kennedy's chief of staff, Tony Marcella, said the
congressman respected police concerns but hoped that the video
would be released when investigators were through with it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very confident that when the tape is viewed by the
public, they are going to see something that might not be the most
polite behavior in the world, but it's going to be nothing like the
press has made it out to be,'' Marcella said.

<HEADLINE> TV Used As Ammo in Elian Case  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Television became ammunition in the Elian
Gonzalez custody battle Thursday, with the boy speaking in a
frequently repeated videotaped message and his Miami relatives
inviting a camera into their home.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, in a home video where he sat on a bed and spoke in
Spanish, addressed his father, saying: ''I don't want to go to
Cuba. ... I want to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   The video was obtained by the Spanish-language Univision
network. It was shown on ABC's ''Good Morning America,'' which had
been alerted by Univision shortly before it went on the air that
the tape was available.
</P>
<P>
   It was quickly rebroadcast on cable news networks, and prompted
a protest by the lawyer for Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
Gregory Craig called on the news media to stay away from the boy
because he ''has been exploited enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Gonzalez and only Mr. Gonzalez has the legal and moral
right to speak for Elian Gonzalez,'' Craig said. ''The news media
should know that Mr. Gonzalez has not given his permission or
approval for any journalist to interview, photograph, film or
broadcast his son.''
</P>
<P>
   The video was used in the context of explaining how the
propaganda war was escalating, said Paul Friedman, ABC's executive
vice president and managing editor of news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ABC was criticized recently for airing portions of a Diane
Sawyer interview with Elian Gonzalez, the first time he had been
made available to speak to TV journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's Miami relatives invited networks to place a camera
and microphone in their house Thursday to record any possible
attempt by the government to take the boy. ABC, which is providing
pool coverage for other networks, prepared the home for a camera in
the event of goverment activity, spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, CBS and NBC all said they would play it by ear in
determining what it would air from any footage obtained in the
family's house. Murphy said, for example, that ABC would probably
not air footage live from the house in order to review it first.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno strongly denied reports that the
government sought to have news media kept away from the streets
surrounding the Gonzalez home. ''Those rumors are wrong,'' she
said, ''flat-out wrong.''

<HEADLINE> Canada Native Group Funds OKd  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- A new treaty giving the Nisga'a aboriginal group a
homeland in British Columbia won final approval from Parliament on
Thursday and was enacted into law.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate chamber voted 52-15 with 13 abstentions to pass the
treaty, which survived a lengthy opposition filibuster in the House
of Commons last year. After the Senate vote, Gov. Gen. Adrienne
Clarkson granted royal assent to the treaty, effectively making it
law.
</P>
<P>
   Under the treaty, the 5,500 Nisga'a assume self-governing status
in an 800-square-mile territory in northwest British Columbia and
receive $173 million, along with funding for commercial fishing and
other economic ventures.
</P>
<P>
   While the treaty provides the Nisga'a a much smaller territory
than the group's claimed traditional lands and removes their
tax-exempt status, it is considered a possible model for future
agreements with other native groups seeking land and self-governing
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Royal Assent of our treaty signifies the end of the
colonial era for the Nisga'a people,'' Chief Joseph Gosnell said
outside the Senate chamber. ''Today, the Nisga'a people become
full-fledged Canadians.''
</P>
<P>
   The treaty still could face legal wrangling. Two lawsuits
challenging the constitutionality of the treaty are pending, and
some of the land granted to the Nisga'a is claimed by other native
groups in British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Affairs Minister Robert Nault says further talks would
attempt to settle any land disputes.

<HEADLINE> Soldier says loss of legs was worth it  </HEADLINE>
By HADLEY PAWLAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A 23-year-old soldier who lost his legs
trying to help a stranded couple and their 4-year-old grandchild on
the New York State Thruway Sunday called his injuries ''worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd rather lose something like legs than have a 4-year-old
lose their life,'' Spc. Dean L. Johnson of Warwick, Rhode Island
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's car was stranded in the right lane of the Thruway
during a heavy snowfall in the Columbia County town of Chatham
Sunday afternoon. Johnson said he pulled his pickup truck behind
the car and figured he could push it out of traffic and give the
motorists a ride to a gas station.
</P>
<P>
   ''I noticed the child's car seat in the back and had to stop,''
he said. ''I was going to get flares out when I looked in the
rearview mirror and saw the truck coming around the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson ran from his car and tried to dive out of the truck's
way, but the truck's trailer struck him when the vehicle jackknifed
upon slamming into Johnson's pick-up.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, I thought I was OK and I tried to get up and run
back,'' Johnson said. ''But I looked down, and my legs were gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ''So I started yelling 'Medic! Medic!' thinking the truck
slammed into the child.''
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver, 57-year-old Harold Feltt of Saratoga County
was ticketed for driving too fast, having faulty windshield wipers
and failing to keep a log book, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Following the accident, Feltt was in fair condition. The couple
and the 4-year-old escaped serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   State troopers said that if Johnson's pickup was not parked
behind the couple's car, the tractor-trailer would have hit the car
with full-force, likely killing all three occupants.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who returned to his Fort Drum base one month ago after
finishing a 9 month tour of duty in Bosnia, said the real heroes on
Sunday were the state troopers and motorists who helped him before
medics arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The soldier instructed those who stopped to help him to wrap
belts around his legs to stop the bleeding. He said a woman, who he
thinks was named Margaret, sat with him to keep him warm and talk
him through the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Schoenig, Johnson's nurse, said the soldier is ''ahead
of the grid'' in terms of how fast he's healing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told him we'd take one step at a time, so not to overwhelm
him,'' Schoenig said. ''But he said 'I don't want small steps, I
want leaps.'''
</P>
<P>
   ''My family has a big Fourth of July bash that I plan on walking
into,'' Johnson said.

<HEADLINE> More Threats at Canada Schools  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Police have charged a 14-year-old boy with
threatening bodily harm for saying in class he would bring a
machine gun to school.
</P>
<P>
   The incident Wednesday was the third in recent weeks in .
</P>
<P>
   It occurred in the run up to the first anniversary of the
Columbine high school shootings in Littleton, Colo., that killed 15
people, including the two teen-age gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   A week after the Columbine killings, a youth armed with a
semiautomatic rifle killed one student and injured another at W.R.
Myers High School in Taber, Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's threat occurred when a student interrupted his class
at Cedarbrae Collegiate school in Toronto by blurting out plans to
bring a machine gun at the end of the school year, police Const.
Devin Kealey said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's alleged this kid got up in his classroom and said: 'Wait
until the last week of school. I'm going to be different. I'm going
to come in here with a machine gun,''' Kealey said. ''The teacher
asked: 'Is this a warning?' He said 'Yes.'''
</P>
<P>
   The student cannot be identified under Canadian law.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, 11 students in the Bowmanville area east of
Toronto reported receiving threatening e-mails. Investigators were
trying to determine the source of the e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   At Oakwood Collegiate High School in Toronto, a student
organizing committee canceled a talent show planned for Friday due
to two scribbled messages found in a bathroom in recent weeks,
school spokeswoman Stephanie Bolton said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The first threat appeared March 28 on a towel dispenser and
another was found April 5 in a bathroom stall.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you thought Columbine was bad, just wait,'' the messages
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bolton said a bomb hoax on Wednesday caused students to be sent
home a half-hour early. She said school officials believed the bomb
hoax was unrelated to the earlier written threats.
</P>
<P>
   While some parents were concerned, she said, a parents' group at
the school had expressed support for the handling of the situation
by the school board and police.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they're really quite disgusted that a few people can
dictate events in the lives of so many,'' Bolton said.
</P>
<P>
   Kealey said all threats were taken seriously, but it was unclear
if anyone had reason to fear.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who knows? It could be copy cat, it could be wanting
attention,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ramsey's Lie Detector Test on Hold  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WELLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- An offer by John and Patsy Ramsey to take
a lie detector test in the slaying of their daughter is on hold as
they argue with police over who would conduct the test.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said Thursday they're waiting for the other to act.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our position is that in good faith that we have met their
conditions. We are waiting for an answer on whether they are going
to take one,'' Police Chief Mark Beckner said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am waiting to hear from him. As I see it the ball is in his
court,'' said Lin Wood, the Ramseys' lawyer, in a telephone
interview from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been arrested in the death of 6-year-old JonBenet,
who was found beaten and strangled in the basement of the family
home Dec. 26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Beckner has said the parents ''remain under the umbrella of
suspicion.'' They have denied involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said the main stumbling block over the polygraph is who
would conduct the exam. Wood objects to a police or FBI examiner
because those agencies have been involved in the probe.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anyone connected with the Ramsey investigation
... qualifies as an independent entity,'' Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   Beckner said, ''We will meet the conditions set by John Ramsey.
We can certainly find FBI examiners who know nothing about the
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys made the lie-detector offer during a recent flurry
of interviews generated by the publication of their book, ''The
Death of Innocence.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's not quite tit for tat -- rather, it's
tally for tally.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush and Gore presidential campaigns are crunching some
serious numbers as each scolds the other for ducking separate
issues: Democrat Al Gore, the media, and Republican George W. Bush,
a debate with his rival.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore today canceled a scheduled news conference, which
would have been the first in 54 days,'' declared a news release
issued by the Bush campaign Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president avoided facing reporters while campaigning in
North Carolina because he didn't want to answer questions about the
case of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, the Gore campaign acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Gore aides released their own statement
showing off some math as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''George W. Bush has managed to bob and weave away from debating
Gore for 30 days in a row,'' the release said, referring to an
e-mail challenge sent last month to the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns failed to mention the most important number: 208.
</P>
<P>
   That's how many days until Nov. 7 -- Election Day.

<HEADLINE> Social Live Help Prevent Dementia  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elderly people who live alone, have no friends or have a bad
relationship with their children are 60 percent more likely to
develop dementia than those whose social contacts are more
satisfying, a new study suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the Stockholm Gerontology Research Center at
Karolinska Institute in Sweden, whose study is published this week
in The Lancet medical journal, found that the more socially
isolated old folks were, the more likely they were to develop the
brain condition.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Suzman of the U.S. National Institute of Aging called
the research an intriguing and important extension of recent
findings that social engagement and close relationships are
powerfully associated with general health and longevity.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very good start, a very good first study,'' he said,
adding that he will remain skeptical that there is a real
protective effect of a social life until further research confirms
the findings.
</P>
<P>
   Dementia is a component of diseases such as Alzheimer's and
Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe that by 2050, the ranks of the elderly, which
will include the Baby Boomers, will swell by at least 10 times what
it is today.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Dementia) is already a large problem, but it's going to
become an enormous problem unless there are ways to intervene,''
Suzman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish researchers asked 1,200 people aged 75 or older
whether they lived alone and had no friends to speak of, and
whether they had a unsatisfying relationship with their children.
</P>
<P>
   A bad relationship with their children was not defined by how
often they saw them or spoke to them, but by the quality of the
rapport.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists then monitored them for three years to see who
developed dementia.
</P>
<P>
   The people whose lives were lacking in all three areas were
considered to have a poor social network, while those who had two
of the factors were considered to have a limited social network.
</P>
<P>
   Those two groups together had a 60 percent higher chance of
developing dementia than their counterparts who had only one
negative aspect or an extensive social network.
</P>
<P>
   When each factor was taken separately, those who lived alone
were 50 percent more likely to develop dementia, as were those who
were friendless.
</P>
<P>
   A poor relationship with their children doubled the subjects'
chances of becoming demented.
</P>
<P>
   ''Particularly alarming is the indication that risks are higher
among those having unsatisfactory contact with children than among
those having no children at all,'' said Lisa Berkman of Harvard
University's School of Public Health in a critique of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Berkman added that the sense of belonging and worthiness that
social ties bring may be an important buffer against the onset of
dementia. A diversity of relationships is critical and having one
strong bond is not enough, she hypothesized.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the study, about 176 people had developed dementia
and 300 others had died.
</P>
<P>
   Suzman said it remains unclear why social ties might protect the
elderly from dementia. He said it could be that social engagement
uses the cognitive functions of the brain, keeping it active.
</P>
<P>
   ''It might be that social networks buffer them from stress,''
Suzman said, adding that high cumulative levels of stress increase
the risk of dementia.
</P>
<P>
   The study could not tell whether mild, undiagnosed brain decline
could have prompted the people to withdraw socially.
</P>
<P>
   It also could not show how long ago those leading isolated lives
had become cut off, which would make it difficult to predict
whether intervention later in life would do any good.

<HEADLINE> 'Wild Party' A Bigger, Better Bash  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA, AP Drama Critic
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- You've got to hand it to director George C.
Wolfe. He knows how to put on a big bash with style.
</P>
<P>
   Consider his version of ''The Wild Party,'' the second of two
musicals this season based on a Jazz Age poem by Joseph Moncure
March that celebrates sin and gin and the people consumed by both.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe, composer Michael John LaChiusa and a terrific design team
have worked quite a transformation on March's hard-boiled rhythms
and rhymes. Not perfect, mind you, but with enough sizzle and snap
to make for an adult musical that satisfies the soul and the senses
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Just like it did to the earlier version of ''The Wild Party,''
the ghost of ''Chicago'' hangs over this production, which opened
Thursday at Broadway's Virginia Theater. And that's not necessarily
a bad thing, although here, the cynicism is darker and cuts deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe and set designer Robin Wagner have taken to heart the fact
that this party gathers together a group of vaudeville performers,
from stripper to ageless chanteuse to hoofer and more.
</P>
<P>
   The creators have placed the action within the confines of an
ornate Victorian proscenium arch, not unlike the framework where
many of these artists would have worked. In fact, placards on the
side of the stage announce many of the musical numbers, just as if
they were being performed in the good old days.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Wolfe's vision is anything but sweet and nostalgic. This
party serves up its drinks with more than a taste of bitters. At
the center of the sourness is the volatile relationship between
Queenie, a dancer, and Burrs, here both a clown and a singer who
dons blackface in the manner of Al Jolson.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe and LaChiusa have neatly expanded the poem's slim story
line, but it remains remarkably faithful to the original work.
LaChiusa's ambitious score artfully suggests the sound of the
1920s, without sounding as if it is a museum piece. The music pays
homage to early Ellington, Gershwin, and Cole Porter, even saluting
the master's penchant for dropping famous names of the day into his
lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   The songs couldn't be better showcased, particularly by its
three leads, Mandy Patinkin, Toni Collette and the eternally young
Eartha Kitt.
</P>
<P>
   Patinkin always has been a dangerous, possessed performer,
willing to push to the edge in portraying a character. That
fearlessness works to his advantage in ''The Wild Party,'' as he
creates a Burrs whose almost psychotic jealousy not only seems
plausible but inevitable. And the range of that voice! Whether bass
or falsetto, it commands the stage.
</P>
<P>
   As a musical-theater newcomer, Toni Collette, as the abused
Queenie, more than holds her own. She sings surprisingly well,
dances passably and most importantly, projects the right degree of
vulnerability that this confused creature should possess.
</P>
<P>
   When Wolfe needs someone to stop the show, he brings on Kitt,
who plays Dolores, a diva of indeterminate age and infinite life
experience. He wisely allows Kitt to do what the audience expects:
purr in her famous guttural growl and slink across the stage while
displaying the best legs in show business.
</P>
<P>
   Kitt also gets ''When It Ends,'' LaChiusa's sobering wakeup call
near the end of festivities, an anthem warning that no party lasts
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the off-Broadway ''Wild Party,'' Wolfe's production gives
the other guests their due. Each gets a moment center stage, making
the event seem more like a real party.
</P>
<P>
   The slight story focuses on a triangle, the arrival of Black, a
handsome gangster who is brought to the party by Kate, supposedly
Queenie's best friend. It's here that the evening falters a bit,
particularly in its depiction of Black, played with less than the
appropriate charisma by Yancey Arias.
</P>
<P>
   There's no lack of show-biz savvy displayed by Tonya Pinkins,
the jilted Kate. She sizzles, particularly in a number that pairs
her off against Queenie.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the triangle reaches its inevitable tragic conclusion
without a big musical payoff, a fact Wolfe disguises quite cleverly
with the help of Joey McKneely's evocative choreography.
</P>
<P>
   The other guests are a rich collection of the exotic and the
undone. Marc Kudisch does the spoiled, cocaine-sniffing, sexually
fluid playboy to smooth perfection. Ditto Jane Summerhays and Sally
Murphy as an aging stripper and her zonked-out girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   As a pair of black dandies, Michael McElroy and Nathan Lee
Graham strut and harmonize to some of LaChiusa's best tunes. Norm
Lewis and Leah Hocking offer a moment of poignancy as a washed-up
fighter and his equally has-been dancer-girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Grupper and Stuart Zagnit, as two bewildered businessmen,
provide some welcome humor in the midst of all the debauchery.
Innocence -- plus a clarion voice -- is provided by Brooke Sunny
Moriber as a fresh-off-the-farm ingenue, whose naivete quickly
evaporates.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe is the expert ringmaster, though, pulling all these people
together. And they look fabulous in Toni-Leslie James' costumes and
bathed in some of the best lighting on Broadway, done by Jules
Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer.
</P>
<P>
   One major disappointment: a balky sound system that muffles too
many of LaChiusa's lyrics. Considering the quality of the show,
that is a major crime indeed. This is one ''Party'' that need to be
experienced in its entirety.

<HEADLINE> Comparison of Clinton, GOP Budget  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A comparison of the $1.83 trillion,
Republican-written fiscal
2001 budget that Congress completed on Thursday, and President
Clinton's $1.84 trillion proposal. Fiscal 2001 begins next Oct. 1.
<TEXT>
<P>
   --SURPLUSES: The congressional plan sees a $170 billion surplus
next year, the biggest ever, growing to $232 billion by 2005. All
but $40 billion of the five-year total of $997 billion in projected
surpluses would come from Social Security. The entire Social
Security surplus would be used to pay down the $3.6 trillion
publicly held debt.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would also use the entire Social Security surplus for
debt reduction. He has a five-year total of $90 billion in
non-Social Security surpluses left over.
</P>
<P>
   --TAX CUTS: Republicans would cut taxes by at least $150 billion
over the next five years, and perhaps more than $200 billion.
Clinton proposed $99 billion in tax cuts plus $96 billion in tax
increases on tobacco and some corporate transactions. Details won't
be decided until later legislation, but the two sides both want to
cut taxes for education and health expenses and for many married
couples, but in different ways. Over the five-year period, the
government currently expects to collect $10.8 trillion in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   --MEDICARE, SOCIAL SECURITY: Both sides say they want to start a
new prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries.
Republicans set aside up to $40 billion through 2005, while
Clinton's would start in 2003 and is costlier. Neither side
proposes benefit cuts or tax reductions for Social Security or
Medicare that many experts say will be needed to pay for the baby
boom generation, which begins retiring in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   --OTHER SPENDING: Republicans would spend $311 billion for
defense, $5 billion more than Clinton. For other domestic programs,
the GOP wants $289 billion, about $30 billion less than Clinton
wants. Republican would increase spending over this year's levels
for education, veterans, the National Institutes of Health, and
some other programs, but unspecified other programs would face
cuts.

<HEADLINE> Cell Phone Tax Bill Clears Panel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A solution to the problem of taxing cellular
telephone calls cleared a key hurdle Thursday with approval by the
Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The measure's supporters aim to eliminate confusion over how
calls from mobile phones should be taxed, setting taxes based on a
caller's address, regardless of the call's origin. The wireless
industry and city and state officials are backing the bill, which
is sponsored by Sens. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., and Byron Dorgan,
D-N.D.
</P>
<P>
   On a unanimous vote, the committee approved the measure allowing
calls to be taxed by the state and local governments with
jurisdiction over the caller's home or office address. Similar
legislation is moving through the House.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is designed to allow carriers to collect taxes more
easily and free governments from tracking calls inside their
boundaries. Brownback said it will stimulate growth in the industry
by reducing costs, which boosts the number of minutes used by
callers.

<HEADLINE> 12 Killed by Gunmen in Algeria  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Twelve people were killed and six
injured when gunmen opened fire on a market Thursday in the
Algerian town of Attatba, 35 miles west of Algiers, residents of
the town said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said the attackers burst into the wholesale market
early in the morning as vendors were setting up stands. The
massacre, like most attacks, was not immediately confirmed by
officials.
</P>
<P>
   It was the town's second episode of mass violence in a month. On
March 15, armed Islamic militants killed 11 people there.
</P>
<P>
   The North African country has been gripped by an Islamic
insurgency since 1992, when the army canceled elections that the
now-banned Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 people have been killed in the violence since
then.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to bring about national reconciliation, President
Abdelaziz Bouteflika offered a peace plan that gave insurgents
partial amnesty if they handed in their weapons by Jan. 13 and were
not guilty of rape, murder or bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the peace bid, attacks occur almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   A planned demonstration in Algiers Thursday against Bouteflika's
peace plan failed to materialize after tight security measures
discouraged protesters. Critics say the plan isn't working and
accuse the government of leniency toward militants.

<HEADLINE> Collins holds to school construction position before blackministers  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Wearing a tie decorated with the faces of
children of different races, Assembly Speaker Jack Collins tried to
convince a crowd Thursday that his multi-billion dollar school
construction plan will help students throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   His audience was the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey, some
members of which represent churches in the state's so-called
special needs districts. Those districts would not receive 100
percent state aid for all building and renovation projects under
Collins' plan.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker's bill is competing with one advanced by Senate
President Donald DiFrancesco and supported by Gov. Christie
Whitman. That measure provides full state building aid for the 30
special needs districts, as ordered by the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Collins disagrees that the court ordered 100 percent state
funding in its May 1998 ruling. If it did, the speaker said he
believes the court committed a constitutional error by neglecting
to consider legislative input.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know that constitution, the same constitution that
protects us all from overzealous police officers,'' he told the
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   He said he will seek a formal clarification from the justices
soon, in time for a final Assembly vote on the bill in late May.
</P>
<P>
   ''I may be crazy, but I'm crazy for the constitution. I think
they overstepped their bounds,'' he said. ''Until I am convinced
that this state will not suffer from what I view as a
constitutional violation ... I will not go quietly in the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said his plan will benefit children who attend school in
towns that are just as poor or poorer than those designated as
having special needs. It sets up additional aid and no-interest
loans for other districts throughout New Jersey. The special needs
districts, meanwhile, would receive 100 percent funding for
projects that address health, safety and overcrowding concerns, but
less aid for other projects.
</P>
<P>
   It's wrong ''to allow the dominance of education money for poor
children to be focused only in one area, the urban areas. It
doesn't matter if you're in a big town or a little town, you
hurt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But ministers, who gave Collins a polite if not lukewarm
greeting, said lawmakers ought to abide by the court's order.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're for 100 percent. We've been forgotten, abused and left
out for so long that we need 100 percent just to get close to the
right level,'' said the Rev. Dwight Gill of the New Hope Baptist
Church in East Orange.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court said 100 percent. The Supreme Court ruled,'' said
the Rev. Stanley Justice of the Mount Zion A.M.E. Church in
Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, council executive director, urged
Collins, DiFrancesco and Whitman to settle their differences and
craft a compromise plan in time to meet the court's spring
deadline.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Awaits Elian's Return  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- As news trickled in about dramatic events
unfolding on the other side of the Florida Straits, Cubans
anxiously awaited the return of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the hour for this drama to end for the good of Elian and
his desperate father,'' said Leida Ruseau, a 66-year-old cleaning
woman who watched live CNN feeds of the crowds Thursday outside the
home of Elian's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Ruseau was one of a small group of Cuban workers who crowded
around a large color television at a foreign press center set up
for journalists covering a summit of leaders from developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''That great-uncle is a kidnapper who has made an entire family
and an entire nation suffer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the United States had acted with more authority in this
matter, the child would already have been back with us,'' added
Jose Ramon Montano.
</P>
<P>
   Very few Cubans have access to foreign television reports. Most
have had to rely on the Cuban government to provide them with
updates on the case during a ''round-table discussion'' on state
television at 5 p.m. daily.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most of those who had not seen the reports on American
television knew about Thursday's deadline for the Miami relatives
to turn over the child to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who
flew to the United States last week.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the current developments were reported on
government-controlled Radio Reloj and the noontime Television
Rebelde.
</P>
<P>
   On the government program in the evening, viewers were shown
video clips of everything that had transpired in the previous 24
hours: a news conference by Attorney General Janet Reno on her
order to the Miami relatives to turn Elian over to his father,
Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez defying the order, a homemade
video of Elian saying he didn't want to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Alejandro Gonzalez declined to offer
an official government reaction to Thursday's developments in the
United States. ''Today we are seeing another maneuver by the mafia
of Miami,'' was all Gonzalez would say, using a term common here to
describe the Cuban exile leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are waiting for Elian,'' 42-year-old housewife Dinalba
Labrada said as she bought government-ration rice and cooking oil
at a corner food store. ''We are hoping they will turn him over.
Hope is always the last thing a person loses. We have not lost ours
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   At the ''Esquina Caliente'' -- the ''Hot Corner'' in Old Havana's
Central Park -- the city's self-anointed baseball experts mixed
pontification on the ongoing National Baseball Series with opinions
about the Elian case.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would be afraid for Elian's father to go to Miami'' to claim
the child, said Jorge Luis Ultria, a 33-year-old construction
worker who spends several hours a day at the informal gathering of
sports fanatics. ''Those people in Miami are capable of sabotage,
even planting a bomb!''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the men were hopeful that the Miami relatives would be
obligated to give up the boy, but most were pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that this could go on for at least two or three months
-- even five months,'' said Alberto Rosales, a 42-year-old
self-employed mechanic who wore a baseball cap advertising Molson
Canadian beer.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans were far more interested in the Elian case than the
summit of leaders who gathered here this week to examine ways to
increase the power and wealth of their developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban state television also showed its obsession with the case
even as it covered the summit: Reporters tossed questions about
Elian into interviews with the visiting heads of state. Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe agreed that the child belonged with his
father. So did Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
   ''Children belong to the care of their parents,'' Mexican
Foreign Minister Rosario Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Caught up in the Elian battle, Fidel Castro's communist
government barely promoted the summit until just before it opened
on Monday. For 4{ months, the fight for Elian has been the No. 1
priority of the government, which has rallied thousands of people
in near-daily protests pressing for the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Elian does come back, I will very proud, very glad,''
Ultria said amid his clutch of wildly gesticulating baseball
experts. ''And when he comes back, we don't have to have a
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be a celebration and a pride in every Cuban
heart,'' said Ultria, ''because we will all know that he is back
where he should be.''

<HEADLINE> Fla. Wildfire Dampened By Rain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Fla. (AP) -- Heavy rains Thursday helped firefighters
gain control of a huge wildfire burning swampland in southwest
Florida and suppressed blazes elsewhere in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials said 70 percent of the fire burning between
Naples and the Big Cypress swamp was contained after it burned
about 15,500 acres since Sunday. Another fire near Naples grew to
four acres Thursday afternoon before it was doused.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had some activity with fires kicking back up, but
they've been able to control it very easily,'' said Gerry LaCavera,
a Division of Forestry spokesman on the scene of the Naples blaze.
</P>
<P>
   But mid-afternoon, areas of the biggest blaze were being hit
with driving rain, LaCavera said. The rain was not accompanied by
lightning or erratic winds, which could worsen the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Fire crews had stripped vegetation in a 20-mile fire line to
contain the blaze and were working to add three miles Thursday.
They were aided by 20 ''smoke jumpers,'' a group of specially
trained U.S. Forest Service firefighters based in North Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Battle lines unfold as Democrats seek to hold edge, gain seats inCongress  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey battle lines were drawn
Thursday in the national fight to control Congress, as candidates
filed their petitions to run.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats will work to preserve and expand their 7-6 edge in the
New Jersey delegation to the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The majority gives them some bragging rights. More importantly,
it puts them in the middle of the quest to pick up 12 seats across
the country, retake the House majority and have a Democrat swing
the gavel as Speaker of the House for the first time since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic chairman Tom Giblin said the party's chances to
make gains are best in three districts, one where a veteran
Republican is stepping down to run for U.S. Senate, and two others
where proven Democratic candidates will try to oust veteran
incumbents who can be painted as too conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the marquee race in New Jersey is for the U.S. Senate
seat being vacated by Democrat Frank Lautenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Corzine and former Gov. Jim Florio have been campaigning
since last summer to become the nominee charged with keeping that
seat in Democratic hands.
</P>
<P>
   For the Republicans, Lautenberg's departure presents an
opportunity to end two decades of Democratic monopoly over New
Jersey's seats in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP primary is a four-way contest between U.S. Rep. Bob
Franks, R-Berkeley Heights; Atlantic County state Sen. William
Gormley; Essex County executive James Treffinger; and economics
professor Murray Sabrin.
</P>
<P>
   In order to seek the Senate GOP nomination, Franks must give up
his 7th District congressional seat after eight years in office.
The district covers parts of Essex, Middlesex, Somerset and Union
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Franks' departure gives Democrats an opportunity with Union
County manager Mike Lapolla and former Fanwood mayor Maryanne
Connelly heading the race for the June 6 primary nomination. Other
Democrats seeking the nomination are Jeffrey Golkin of Warren and
Joel Farley of Westfield.
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP wants to save the seat for their party. They have
put up Assemblyman Joel Weingarten, R-Essex, and Tom Kean Jr. -- the
son of the former governor -- to compete for the Republican
nomination. The field also includes Mike Ferguson, who ran against
U.S. Rep Frank Pallone in 1998 in a different district, and
Republicans Roderick M. McNealy and Patrick Morrisey.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, Assemblyman Reed Gusciora, D-Mercer, will try to
unseat two-decade veteran U.S. Rep. Christopher Smith,
R-Robbinsville, in the 4th district, and Cherry Hill Mayor Susan
Bass Levin is challenging U.S. Rep. Jim Saxton, R-Mount Holly, in
the 3rd district.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that Reed Gusciora is probably the best candidate we
have had in many years against Chris Smith,'' Giblin said. ''And I
think our best hope is with Susan Bass Levin. She is going to get a
lot of support from women's groups in and outside that district.''
</P>
<P>
   On the defense, Democrats will try to save their one freshman,
U.S. Rep. Rush Holt, D-Hopewell, in the 12th district. Two
Republicans, Mike Pappas and Dick Zimmer, who both have held office
there in the past, will compete in the GOP primary to win their old
jobs back.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Democrats won their majority in the House delegation
when Holt upset Pappas two years ago. Zimmer had held the seat for
years before Pappas. The sprawling 12th District covers Hunterdon
County and parts of Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth and Somerset
counties.

<HEADLINE> Elian Demonstrators Claim Victory  </HEADLINE>
By IAN JAMES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Thousands of demonstrators clogging the humid,
narrow streets in Elian Gonzalez's neighborhood Thursday pumped
their fists and shouted ''Victory!'' when it became clear the
government would not immediately reunite the boy with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our miracle happened!'' Mercedes Franco shouted while raising
her hands in the air. ''That boy is a miracle. I feel like
screaming everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez took a defiant stand
against the government's 2 p.m. deadline for handing the boy over,
all but daring officials to seize Elian from the small white home
in Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters surrounded the house in hopes of preventing federal
agents from going in. They took up their usual place at the
barricade in front the home and also poured onto surrounding
streets, blocking a side entrance that they feared marshals would
use for a stealthy approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people aren't going to leave until somebody says the
boy's going to stay,'' said Maggie Hernandez, 22, a psychology
student at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd swelled as the deadline came and went with the boy
still in the house. By late afternoon, there were as many as 4,000
protesters in the area -- some on the roof a nearby house. Police
blocked off several streets.
</P>
<P>
   A radio station truck blared salsa music and updated the crowd
on the developments.
</P>
<P>
   People packed into the throng whistled, chanted ''Freedom!'' and
thrust their fists into the air. Dozens flew Cuban and American
flags; some brought Argentine and Colombian flags in a pan-Hispanic
show of unity.
</P>
<P>
   ''People here would rather die than for Elian to go to Cuba. Me
the first,'' said Ana Aguilar, 43, who came to the United States
from the communist island 26 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A plane flew overhead, trailing a banner that read: ''Liberty
and Justice for Elian.'' Protesters propped up an effigy of Fidel
Castro wearing a bra, poked it in the face and stomach with
American flags and then stomped on it and tore off its head.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's 21-year-old cousin Marisleysis, who considers herself a
mother figure for him, walked along a line of protesters, handing
them cups of water. Later, Lazaro Gonzalez went along the line,
shaking hands like a politician at a campaign stop.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, wearing baggy green shorts almost to his ankles and a
light green shirt, played in his backyard and cheerfully chatted
inside the house with his cousin and great-uncle. At times he
peeked out the window at the crowds gathered for him.
</P>
<P>
   Five little girls who left school after lunch pressed against a
fence and held signs for Elian. Second-grader Lauren Alatriste, 7,
said she didn't like hearing people saying Elian is too young to
decide whether he should live in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not like he's 3 years old and doesn't know anything,''
Lauren said.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Andy Garcia and singer Gloria Estefan, both
Cuban-Americans, also spent time in the house and with the crowd,
and Estefan later pleaded for peace. ''I know that Cubans are very
passionate and we don't want anyone to confuse loud passion for
violence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration spilled out of the neighborhood into the rest of
Little Havana by dinnertime, as drivers honked their horns and
waved Cuban flags. Hundreds of protesters stayed behind at the
house.
</P>
<P>
   In Nancy Perez's living room -- across the street and four doors
down from the Gonzalez house -- about 10 family members sat around
the TV to monitor updates.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters Perez didn't know asked for a drink of water and to
use the bathroom. Perez, 45, pointed them to the kitchen and told
them to help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all feel obligated to help the child, every Hispanic
person,'' she said. ''Our exiled community has united to help this
child.''

<HEADLINE> Hearing Becomes Stage For Elian  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Capital Hill hearing to uncover the truth
about children's rights in Cuba Thursday turned into hours of
speeches by congressmen and pro- and anti-Castro witnesses -- mostly
trying to prove whether Elian Gonzalez should stay or go.
</P>
<P>
   Seven witnesses invited to testify before the House subcommittee
on international operations and human rights didn't get a chance to
speak for nearly the first hour and a half of the hearing, as
committee members took turns making statements.
</P>
<P>
   ''Indoctrination, torture, forced labor, combat training,
murder,'' said Republican Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. ''These
are but a microcosm of the gross violations of children's rights
committed by the Castro regime -- the very same Communist
totalitarian dictatorship which calls for Elian's return to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, also spoke. She's not on the
committee, but is among representatives who have visited Elian's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, at the suburban Washington home where
he waits to get back his son.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is all we ask -- that Elian and his father be reunited.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses included author Ileana Fuentes, a survivor of
''Operation Pedro Pan,'' in which 14,000 unaccompanied children
were sent out of Cuba in the early 1960s by their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing their children would be indoctrinated into Fidel
Castro's communist system or dispatched to the countryside to teach
illiterate peasants how to read and write, desperate parents
obtained quick exit visa waivers to send their children to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''When a child is born in Cuba, he joins a family living in
state-sponsored poverty,'' Fuentes told the committee. ''A child
born in Cuba is born in a society where his fundamental human
rights ... are denied by all existing legal institutions -- the
Cuban constitution, child and youth code and penal code.''
</P>
<P>
   A different view came from the Rev. Lucius Walker, who said his
Interreligious Foundation for Community Organization, has worked in
Cuba for decades and delivered tons of humanitarian aid there.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never seen an unhealthy child in Cuba,'' Walker said.
''Children in Cuba are a wonderful combination of self-awareness,
self-esteem, respect for adults, love of country, knowledge of the
culture ..., which I wish were equally true in every part of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee chairman Christopher Smith, a New Jersey Republican,
interrupted Walker to say witnesses were allowed to speak for 10
minutes each and that he'd already gone over by 3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Chairman,'' protested Rep. Cynthia McKinney of Georgia,
''You selected six of the witnesses. ... I got to pick one ... I
would like him to have his say.''

<HEADLINE> Complaints Vs. Pinochet Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- As a court prepares hearings on lifting
Gen. Augusto Pinochet's congressional immunity so he can stand
trial on human rights charges, yet another criminal complaint was
filed Thursday against the ailing former dictator.
</P>
<P>
   The 83rd criminal complaint was filed by lawyers on behalf of
relatives of seven dissidents executed shortly after the 1973 coup
led by Pinochet for allegedly attacking a military barracks.
</P>
<P>
   The executions were officially reported at the time by the
military.
</P>
<P>
   Though he avoided extradition to Spain on human rights charges,
Pinochet is facing a growing number of criminal complaints at home
over alleged abuses during his 1973-1990 rule.
</P>
<P>
   The judge probing the complaints, Juan Guzman, has asked the
Santiago Court of Appeals to strip Pinochet of the immunity he
enjoys as a senator-for-life to try him on one of the most
emblematic cases of rights abuses, the so-called ''caravan of
death.''
</P>
<P>
   The case refers to a military unit that entered several cities
in October 1973, dragging scores of political prisoners from jail
and executing them. The official toll was 72 people killed and 19
missing.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, 84, returned home last month after 16 months confined
in London fighting extradition to Spain where a judge wanted to try
him. He was released after doctors determined he was mentally and
physically unfit to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers here sought a similar way out of Pinochet's legal
troubles, but the Court refused to consider health reasons and
confirmed the hearings on his immunity will open on Apr. 19.
</P>
<P>
   According to a government report, 3,191 people were killed or
disappeared and were never heard from again during Pinochet's
1973-90 dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Since his return, Pinochet has remained out of the public view,
except for three hospital visits for tests, and has not commented
on the avalanche of legal actions against him.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said the tests measured blood flow to Pinochet's brain
and local media said the tests confirmed that he has sustained
irreversible brain damage.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Draws 160K US Visitors in 1999  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- More than 160,000 U.S. citizens visited Cuba last
year despite tight restrictions on travel to the island, Cuban
Tourism Minister Ibrahim Ferradaz said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S citizens were a small but notable portion of the more
than 1.6 million tourists that Cuba says it drew in 1999. Ferradaz
said a booming tourism industry produced $1.3 billion in revenue --
about 53 percent of Cuba's total last year.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference, Ferradaz said about 60,000 to
70,000 people listed by Cuba as U.S. citizens visited the island
last year in addition to ''more than 100,000'' Cuban-Americans --
considered Cuban citizens under the island's laws.
</P>
<P>
   He confirmed that the two categories did not overlap.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how many of the U.S. visitors arrived legally
and how many were violating terms of the U.S. travel embargo
imposed in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government allows Cuban-Americans to make family visits
to the island. Other Americans are allowed to visit the island with
special permission from the government granted for purposes
including academic study, cultural exchanges, some sorts of
business and aid. U.S. laws forbid Americans to spend money in Cuba
for strictly tourism purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Ferradaz said Cuba has seen the number of foreign tourists grow
from 342,000 in 1990 to 1.4 million in 1998 and 1.6 million last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The government had aimed at 2 million tourists this year, but
saw only 2 to 3 percent growth in the first quarter, Ferradaz said,
saying that was due to fears of a year 2000 computer bug among New
Year travelers and the fact that the busy Easter season fell in the
first quarter last year but not this one.
</P>
<P>
   Canada is the leading source of tourists, providing 17 percent
of Cuban visitors last year. Fifty-five percent of visitors came
from European countries such as Spain, Italy, Britain and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Ferradaz said 86,000 Cubans work directly in tourism in fields
such as hotels, restaurants or transportation. He estimated that
another 300,000 jobs were created indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   According to first-quarter figures released Thursday, Cuba's
economy could surpass its target of 4 to 4.5 percent growth for the
year, Central Bank Governor Francisco Soberon said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's economy grew by a brisk 6.2 percent last year, one of the
best spurts of growth since the 1993 depression caused by the loss
of trading partners in the now-vanished Soviet bloc. Gross domestic
product fell by about 35 percent between 1989 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Soberon said the 1999-2000 sugar harvest is likely to be
''somewhat greater than 4 million (metric) tons,'' compared with
3.8 million tons last year. Officials in December had projected
output at 4.1 to 4.4 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Finish Chromosome Maps  </HEADLINE>
By JESSIE SEYFER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- In their race to blueprint the human
genome, government-sponsored scientists said Thursday they have
finished ''rough draft'' maps of three complete chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by the Walnut Creek, Calif.-based Joint Genome
Institute made it the first of five publicly funded labs --
collectively known as the Human Genome Project -- to finish its
allotted part of the mapping mission.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the California lab said it has mapped chromosomes
5, 16 and 19, which make up roughly 11 percent of the human genome
and contain vital information about kidney disease, various
cancers, hypertension and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Three chapters in the reference book of human life are nearly
complete,'' said Department of Energy Secretary Bill Richardson.
''This is big stuff and I'm really proud of these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The 23 pairs of chromosomes in the human genome are made up of
coiled strands of DNA. When stretched out, the elegant DNA
molecules look like ladders whose rungs are chemical bonds, known
as base pairs. Different arrangements of base pairs make up the
code for 100,000 known human genes.
</P>
<P>
   The genes, in turn, form a blueprint for the assembly of
proteins that guide the form and function of cells.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers believe that by identifying each gene and
determining its effect, medical science will find new ways to treat
or prevent birth defects and illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper Rine, a professor of genetics at the University of
California at Berkeley, said Thursday's announcement is ''obviously
good news.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The human genome sequence, even a rough draft, is a very
important beginning to understanding the most important historical
document of humanity,'' he said. ''Genome sequences are really a
marvelous gift to all basic sciences.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's news came a week after the private company Celera
Genomics, of Rockville, Md., announced it had already accomplished
the same goal, also in a rough form.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are in a fierce battle to complete the project
first. In contrast to Celera, the federal project is releasing to
the public the genetic sequences as they are identified.
</P>
<P>
   While the government maps produced so far are only rough
estimates of exact gene sequences, scientists said they are still
immensely useful tools.

<HEADLINE> Journalist Loses Porn Case Appeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A journalist sentenced to prison for
distributing child pornography he claimed was part of his research
lost a federal appeal Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Matthews of Silver Spring, Md., never disputed that he
traded about 160 pornographic pictures over the Internet, but said
he didn't know it was illegal. He said it was part of his research
as a freelance journalist and was protected by the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge refused to allow a First Amendment defense, and
Matthews pleaded guilty in July 1998. He was sentenced to 18 months
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews appealed based on the judge's First Amendment ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling Thursday, Judge
Diana Motz said that distribution of child pornography is a
particularly egregious crime and that the law makes no exception
for journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, based in
Arlington, Va., filed a brief in the case arguing that Matthews
should have been allowed to present a First Amendment defense.

<HEADLINE> Senator Attacks Independant Counsel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Democratic senator said Thursday it is ''the
brink of lunacy'' for Independent Counsel Robert Ray to consider
indicting President Clinton after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is happening here is too outlandish and unbelievable to
qualify anymore as literature,'' Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said on
the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Ray has said he is hiring additional staff to help him decide
whether criminal charges are warranted against the president for
his actions in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. A federal judge found
Clinton in civil contempt, concluding that he lied under oath about
his sexual relationship with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   During the Lewinsky scandal, Reid co-sponsored a censure
resolution that, in lieu of impeachment proceedings, would have
provided for the president to remain subject to criminal actions in
a court of law.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said that Clinton is being subjected to both impeachment
proceedings and criminal indictment is tantamount to double
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ''This investigation ... has drifted from prosecutorial
intemperance to the brink of lunacy,'' said Reid.

<HEADLINE> Gov't To Probe Ex-CIA Officer Case  </HEADLINE>
By C. BRYSON HULL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- The Justice Department will investigate
allegations of prosecutorial misconduct in the 1983 arms-dealing
case against former CIA officer Edwin P. Wilson, government
attorneys acknowledged in a court filing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure came in the department's response to a Wilson
motion to hold 17 current and former CIA and Justice officials in
contempt of court for allegedly hiding evidence that would have
helped his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''The allegations of this case have been referred to (the Office
of Professional Responsibility), which will conduct a thorough
investigation at the conclusion'' of Wilson's appeal, a footnote
near the end of the government's eight-page motion says.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, 71, is appealing his federal conviction for illegally
shipping 20 tons of plastic explosives to Libya from Houston's
Intercontinental Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson alleges prosecutors introduced into evidence a crucial
affidavit by then-CIA Executive Director Charles A. Briggs even
though they knew it was false.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Wilson asked U.S. District Court Judge Lynn N.
Hughes to sanction a list of people that included two federal
judges, a former CIA associate deputy director, top Justice
Department attorneys and a former independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the Justice Department response argues most of the
federal contempt statute does not apply to 16 of the 17 officials
named by Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ''The matter is being investigated by OPR, but they are holding
their investigation until the court is finished,'' Justice
Department spokesman Myron Marlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, now in a federal prison in Pennsylvania, contends
federal prosecutors knowingly presented a false affidavit swearing
he ''was neither asked or requested, directly or indirectly, to
provide any services, directly or indirectly, to the CIA,'' after
his 1971 retirement, except for one Libya-related assignment for
which he was paid $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Among the nearly 800 pages of once-classified documents are
papers showing Wilson was asked to perform several dozen services
for the CIA, including acquiring an anti-tank weapon for an agency
operation and helping relocate a Laotian general who was a valuable
CIA source.

<HEADLINE> Navy Silent on Military Exercises  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The Navy refused to confirm or deny
a report Thursday that military exercises scheduled for May on the
Puerto Rican island of Vieques have been moved elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters who have camped out on the Vieques bombing range for
a year reacted triumphantly to an article published in El Vocero
newspaper Thursday that said maneuvers by the USS George Washington
battle group scheduled for May 10-20 were being moved.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper quoted Navy spokesman Jeffrey Gordon as saying the
training would take place in the eastern United States. Gordon told
The Associated Press the article contained inaccuracies, but he
would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not aware of any decision being taken on exercises by the
George Washington battle group, and I don't want to speculate on
the matter,'' Gordon said. A spokesman at the Department of the
Navy in Washington also declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Edith Seda, news editor of El Vocero, said the newspaper stood
by its report and had received no complaints from the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the protesters trumpeted the report Thursday,
calling it a repeat of the Pentagon's decision in December to send
the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower battle group to practice in Florida
after protesters refused to budge.
</P>
<P>
   ''This cancellation ... constitutes an enormous victory for the
people of Puerto Rico and a re-vindication of the strategy of civil
disobedience,'' said Fernando Martin, vice president of the Puerto
Rican Independence Party.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters are preparing special vigils, choir performances and
a Mass next week to commemorate the April 19, 1999 bombing accident
that touched off widespread opposition to the Navy's presence on
Vieques. A civilian security guard was killed on the bombing range
and four other people injured when a U.S. Marine Corps jet dropped
two bombs off target during exercises.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has promised to order the Navy out of Vieques
by May 2003 if Vieques residents vote in a referendum to expel
them.

<HEADLINE> White House Lobbying Efforts Probed  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican opponent of permanent trade
status for China has triggered an inquiry into whether the Clinton
White House violated a law that prohibits using federal funds for
lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, is examining the administration's China Trade Relations
Working Group, a White House command center dedicated to securing
congressional approval for ''permanent normal trade relations''
status for China.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to presidential aide Mark Lindsay dated April 11,
the GAO requested interviews with White House officials, an array
of documents and detailed explanations of how the administration
didn't use federal funds for significant lobbying of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Frank R. Wolf, R-Va., said he requested the investigation
after learning about the group's ''war room,'' a command center
which could influence congressional debate before a House vote on
China's trade status during the week of May 22.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very concerned that the White House may be tilting the
playing field against such a fair fight and using federal resources
with its all-out lobbying effort,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf is a vocal critic of human rights abuses in China.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Cruise, a spokesman for the working group, said the
administration has a legitimate role in promoting its China policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are confident that our efforts have been well within the
rules for advocating administration policies, and we will cooperate
with GAO's review,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law prohibits the use of congressional appropriations to
lobby lawmakers, although the statute allows executive branch
officials to request legislation ''which they deem necessary for
the efficient conduct of the public business.''
</P>
<P>
   The ''war room'' is run by David Lane, chief of staff for
Commerce Secretary Bill Daley. Since starting in January, their
operation has expanded to eight full-time staffers and an extended
group of about 20, which includes members from the Commerce, State
and Agriculture Departments, Cruise said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Stocks Plunge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) ---- The largest stock exchange index in
South America plunged Thursday to its lowest level of the year amid
concerns that a key Supreme Court decision could dig a hole in
Brazil's public coffers.
</P>
<P>
   The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange's Bovespa Index dropped 5 percent
to close at 15,500 points, the index's largest point loss and
second-largest percentage loss of the year. The biggest percentage
fall was on Jan. 4, when it dropped 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The court was expected to rule late Thursday whether the
government must compensate workers for alleged losses incurred from
four failed economic stabilization plans. The decision could cost
the government $40 billion if it loses.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruling was delayed a month when one of the 11 court
judges asked for more time to analyze the information available.
The three judges that had already voted gave the government a
partial defeat.
</P>
<P>
   They said the government arbitrarily reduced workers'
investments when implementing the plans in 1989 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   According to the judges, the government failed to adjust
workers' savings and investments by 20 percent and 45 percent,
respectively, those years.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Film Director Honored  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL WOOLLS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALZADA DE CALATRAVA, Spain (AP) -- Pedro Almodovar's hometown
turned out in force Thursday to honor the Oscar-winning Spanish
film director, praising him as the biggest man of La Mancha since
Don Quixote himself.
</P>
<P>
   Almodovar wore an all-black outfit and dark glasses as he stood
before an adoring crowd in this one-cinema, dusty farming town of
5,000 in the plains of Castile-La Mancha, about 120 miles southeast
of Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   But Almodovar choked back tears as he held aloft the Oscar
statuette he won last month for his film ''All About My Mother,''
then pretended to offer it to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not wearing dark glasses to be coquettish or achieve a
certain look,'' he said. ''I'm wearing them because I don't want
you to see me cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Almodovar lived in Calzada de Calatrava until he was 8 years
old, when his father Antonio -- a traveling wine salesman -- moved
the family of six to the southwestern Extremadura region.
Eventually they ended up in Madrid, and Almovodar has returned here
only periodically, mostly in recent years after his late mother
Francisca started spending summers in the village.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this town considers him a native son, even naming a park
after him, and Almodovar says being back has a powerful emotional
effect on him, mainly because both of his parents are buried here.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here I don't feel like a successful filmmaker,'' Almodovar
said. ''Here, I am just the son of Antonio and Francisca. Here, I
am 8 years old again.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Almodovar left such a long time ago, few people here
know him personally and not everyone is a fan of his somewhat racy,
eccentric film style. In particular, some older residents have
little stomach for it. But Salvador Boiza, 17, says the younger set
loves it.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they showed ''All about my Mother,'' it was a sellout.
Lots of young people came,'' said Boiza.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Francisco Espinosa said the people of Calzada de Calatrava
had felt great pride as Almodovar worked his way up in the movie
world, directing 13 films and culminating in this heady year of
multiple movie honors for the 48-year-old director.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have the famous Hollywood hills in the background,''
Espinosa said at the ceremony. ''We don't live on the French
Riviera either,'' he added, ''but it is here, in your town, where
we have watched you with affection every step of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   He presented Almodovar with yet another statuette, this time a
silver-plated one of Don Quixote, and a framed parchment with a
quote from Cervantes' famed 17th-century novel. In the passage, Don
Quixote is about to set out from La Mancha region for the first
time in search of adventure with sidekick Sancho Panza, and muses
how future generations will enjoy and remember his feats.
</P>
<P>
   Of Almodovar, the mayor said: ''Your feats, Pedro, have already
been in Calzada's memory for years.''

<HEADLINE> Deal Reached on Appeals Process  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Key House and Senate negotiators said Thursday
they had reached a tentative agreement on a plan to give patients
in health plans the right to dispute treatment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Though final language has not yet been decided, the process
generally would let patients appeal the decisions to an independent
review board that would decide whether the plan should pay for the
treatment or service that was denied.
</P>
<P>
   Patients could appeal when HMOs decide not to cover
prescriptions or decide that surgery or other treatments are not
necessary. Many Americans covered by managed care organizations are
concerned that, in their quest to keep costs down, HMOs are wrongly
denying care and routinely turn down patients who take their
complaints to review boards controlled by HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a tentative agreement,'' said Sen. Don Nickles,
R-Okla., chairman of a joint committee that has been working for
more than a month to come up with a compromise between bills passed
by the House and Senate giving Americans some rights when dealing
with managed care organizations and other health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Nickles called the appeals process ''a very significant
provision'' that would let patients in ''every employer-sponsored
plan in the country'' have the right to an external review.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, review panels would be hired by health
plans according to a set of standards set by the government that
would prohibit conflicts of interest between the panel and the
health plan and bar health plans from selecting reviewers that have
been promised incentives that would lead them to make biased
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Senate aides said health plans could contract with university
medical schools that would appoint doctors to consider appeals
according to their expertise. Cancer specialists would hear appeals
of cancer treatment decisions, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal panels would have two central duties. They would
decide whether patient disputes were eligible for the appeals
process and send appeals that were approved to be reviewed by
medical experts.
</P>
<P>
   Denial of services and treatments that are not covered under
plans -- presumably things like cosmetic surgery -- could not be
appealed. But panels could decide to review denials of treatments
not covered under plan rules if patients believe they are medically
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The reviewers would make an independent medical assessment of
HMO decisions based on scientific studies and clinical evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats warned that one key aspect of the appeals process has
yet to be decided: coming up with standards that review panels
would follow in deciding whether disputes are eligible for appeal.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the committee still hasn't decided how many
Americans will be covered by a patients' bill of rights or whether
they will be allowed to sue health plans if they are not satisfied
with the outcome of the appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm mindful that we have a way to go,'' said Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass.

<HEADLINE> GE Profits Climb 20 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- General Electric Co. said Thursday its
earnings rose 20 percent in the first quarter, led by strong
performances at its industrial systems and NBC units.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings were $2.59 billion, or 78 cents per share, compared
with $2.16 billion, or 65 cents per share, in the same period a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The results beat the expectations of Wall Street analysts by a
penny, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues in the quarter rose 24 percent to $30 billion, up from
$24.17 billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   GE's industrial businesses, which includes medical, plastics,
power, appliances and aircraft engines, had revenue growth of 21
percent in the quarter. The company had double-digit growth in
operating profit in six of its seven operating segments.
</P>
<P>
   GE Medical Systems unveiled the GE Senographe 2000D, the world's
first fully digital and FDA-approved mammography system; and the
Innova 2000, the first digital cardiovascular X-ray system. They
combined for more than $50 million in orders for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   GE Silicones, part of the plastics division, completed the
acquisition of Macklanburg-Duncan and formed a new subsidiary, GE
Sealants. The unit posted revenues of $1.86 billion, up 15 percent
from the same three-month period last year.
</P>
<P>
   During the quarter NBC announced its partnership with the World
Wrestling Federation to form a new football league. The first game
of the XFL is scheduled for February 2001. The broadcasting unit
posted revenues of $1.4 billion, up 18 percent from the same period
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   GE Power Systems had $4 billion in orders, up 35 percent for its
heavy-duty gas turbines. The unit and the U.S. Department of Energy
announced the 7H System, a natural gas-fired power generation
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''In addition to delivering record first-quarter results, GE's
businesses made aggressive moves to position themselves for strong
future growth,'' GE chairman John F. Welch said.
</P>
<P>
   GE Aircraft Engines continued to win more than half of the
world's orders for passenger jet engines, and brought in roughly
the same revenue from the first quarter in 1999. The Aircraft
division posted revenues of $2.44 billion, up 1 percent from last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Connection agreed to a $2 billion deal to outfit up to 500
Bombardier Aerospace jets with CF34 engines. Boeing and GE reached
a $20 billion agreement on the 777, powered exclusively by GE
engines. Overseas, the company made a $400 million deal with the
United Arab Emirates for its fleet of 80 F-16 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   GE Power Systems continued to win more than 65 percent of the
orders for heavy-duty gas turbines in the United States, with
orders up 35 percent to $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   GE Appliances' revenues grew 15 percent in the quarter, led by
strong sales from Triton Dishwashers, Spectra Cooking products and
other new products and a partnership with Home Depot. The unit
brought in $1.38 billion in revenue, compared to $1.2 billion in
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock fell after its report, but was part of an
overall drop in the Dow Jones industrial average. GE shares fell
$6.75 to $150 in trading at 4:30 p.m. on the New York Stock
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> House Restricts Low-Power Stations  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Thursday challenged a government
move to open up the nation's airwaves to low power mini-radio
stations, saying the new stations could add unacceptable
interference on already overcrowded radio bands.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, passed 274-110, puts restrictions on a Federal
Communications Commission ruling in January that would have made
room for hundreds of new low-power FM stations offering local news,
sports and music. Similar legislation has yet to reach the Senate
floor.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, authored by Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, would keep
current interference standards in place while allowing
demonstration programs in nine markets to see what happens when
those standards are relaxed to levels sought by the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in a statement, said the administration
strongly opposed the bill. It expressed confidence the FCC could
resolve interference problems and said the House should not block
''efforts to create a new class of microradio licenses that allow
nonprofit groups like schools and churches to reach their local
communities over the airwaves.''
</P>
<P>
   FCC Chairman Bill Kennard, in a statement, said the House vote
could eliminate more than 80 percent of potential low power FM
stations and that the practical effect was to set conditions ''that
may never be met and that only serve to protect incumbent
broadcasters from competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Broadcasters has opposed the new
rules, as has National Public Radio because most public radio
stations are more tightly packed together and have restrictions on
power levels.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House Commerce
telecommunications subcommittee, said he was asking the Justice
Department to look into whether the federal agency, in lobbying
against the bill, had violated the law prohibiting agencies from
engaging in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are confident that FCC staff acted appropriately and within
the bounds of the law,'' said FCC spokesperson Linda Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FCC has moved without any consideration of fact and
without any careful scientific work,'' said Rep. John Dingell, top
Democrat on the Commerce Committee. ''They have no understanding of
whether or not or how much interference will be caused by the order
they have brought forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., said there was ample evidence that
the new stations would not cause problems for those already on the
air, and the bill ''would smother movements toward diversity on our
airwaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the original version of the Oxley bill would
have totally repealed the FCC ruling, and they had compromised by
allowing the FCC to go forward with some new licensing while
testing the more relaxed standards.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Thomas Barrett, D-Wis., and Bobby Rush, D-Ill., proposed
an amendment that would have allowed the FCC to go ahead with the
new rules after a six-month test unless Congress specifically
prohibited them, but it was defeated 245-142.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Primitive Arts Unveiled at Louvre  </HEADLINE>
By MARILYN AUGUST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French President Jacques Chirac on Thursday
inaugurated a new wing of the Louvre housing the museum's first
ever collection of primitive art objects from the world's oldest
civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   Putting some 120 statues, masks and other items from Africa,
Asia, Oceania and North and South America in the Louvre took years,
and marks a major step up for an art form long disdained by the
French art establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ''These galleries have been conceived in such a way as to allow
visitors, literally overexposed to masterpieces from other
departments, with totally different styles and materials, to
discover art works comparable to the Louvre's greatest treasures,''
Chirac said in a speech marking the opening.
</P>
<P>
   The origin of many primitive art pieces remains a major problem
for museums and private collectors worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, French officials were forced to return a statue
smuggled out of Mali. Chirac pledged to make the restitution of
fraudulently acquired pieces a priority.
</P>
<P>
   Louvre officials had long opposed displaying primitive art along
side Greek and Roman treasures, arguing that the world's greatest
museum was not meant to serve as an art ''encyclopedia.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chirac, whose passion for primitive art is well-known,
pushed the project through, authorizing state-of-the art
renovations at the Louvre to showcase the private collection of
French expert Jacques Kerchache.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got the idea to put primitive art in the Louvre when I
realized that three-quarters of humanity were being ignored,''
Kerchache told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces, some thousands of years old, are as varied as the
cultures which produced them.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights: a 19th century wood sculpture from Vanuatu
in the South Pacific, a Chupicuaro terra cotta sculpture from
Mexico dating to the seventh century BC, and a 20th century Inuit
mask of swan and whale from Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac also has given the green light for the building of a
larger museum to house existing collections of primitive art
currently on display at other Paris sites. It is expected to open
in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac said the new museum -- to be located on the Quai Branly
overlooking the Seine -- would end decades-old squabbling as to
whether primitive art should be displayed with the emphasis on
aesthetics or ethnology.
</P>
<P>
   ''Culture is the genius of its people,'' Chirac said. ''The
museum will show that there's no hierarchy among the arts, and no
hierarchy among peoples.''

Nisga'a Treaty Passes Senate
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Nisga'a leaders smiled, clapped and fought tears
as a land-claim treaty started 113 years ago by their ancestors
cleared its last Parliamentary hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed the agreement Thursday, giving the British
Columbia First Nation land, self-government powers and $253 million
in cash and economic funding.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa will kick in $255 million toward the deal that will cost
a total of $487 million.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of sometimes heated debate, senators voted 52-15 in
favor of the Treaty, with 13 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
   The first agreement of its kind in British Columbia passed into
law later in the day with Gov. Gen. Adrienne Clarkson granting
royal assent.
</P>
<P>
   The Treaty passed in the House of Commons in December and has
already been ratified by the Nisga'a and the British Columbia
government.
</P>

   In exchange for its benefits, the Nisga'a settle for a fraction
of claimed traditional lands and give up their tax-exempt status,

Hardliners Likely To Keep Pressing Bouchard To Protect French
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Language hard-liners took comfort on Thursday in
a ruling that upholds Quebec's sign law, but it won't likely stop
their calls for Premier Lucien Bouchard to do more to protect
French.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Paquet, president of the Mouvement national des
quebecois, praised the Quebec Superior Court decision. She said it
recognizes the need to maintain the predominant status of French on
outdoor signs.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we'd lost, it would have opened the way to bilingual or
English-predominant or maybe even unilingual English signs,''
Paquet said. ''It would have taken us back 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Paul-Marcel Bellavance overturned a lower court ruling,
noting that six million Francophones in Quebec share a continent
with 300 million anglophones.
</P>
<P>
   ''Quebec is in a unique linguistic situation,'' Bellavance
wrote.

Premiers To Study Health Costs To Press Ottawa For More Money
</P>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Canada's premiers will put together a
detailed report on what's driving up health costs to bolster their
case to Ottawa for restoring slashed transfer payments.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was made Thursday in a conference call of
provincial and territorial leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Provincial health officials led by Manitoba and Ontario will
conduct the study.
</P>
<P>
   Alberta Premier Ralph Klein said federal Health Minister Allan
Rock indicated last month that ''if it could be demonstrated and
there was evidence of things that are driving up costs . . . his
government would look at sustainable funding.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein said officials will refine preliminary data on how health
costs are being driven up by such factors as a growing and aging
population, inflation, salaries, new technology and capital
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Provincial health ministers will review the data at their next
meeting in May and send the report to Ottawa after that, he said.

Cancer Expected To Strike More Canadians in Years Ahead
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- The first Canadian cancer picture for the new
century and beyond is painted with hope for children, breast cancer
patients and men with lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But while death rates have declined for these three groups, the
disease remains a looming threat, suggests a report on cancer
trends released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate that between now and 2015, the total number of
new cancer cases is expected to grow by 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The society released the 12th annual report, called Canadian
Cancer Statistics 2000, in collaboration with Health Canada and
Statistics Canada.
</P>
<P>
   While heart disease is North America's top killer, cancer is the
leading cause of premature death.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there will be an estimated 132,100 new cases and
65,000 deaths. That's an increase over 1999, when there were an
estimated 129,300 new cases and a predicted 63,400 deaths (final
figures for '99 have not been compiled).

Former Premier Clark Denies He Tried To Discredit a Fast-Ferry
Critic
</P>
<P>
   VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) -- Former British Columbia
premier Glen Clark denied Thursday he tried to discredit a critic
of his government's fast-ferry project to protect himself and his
government from concerns about a nonexistent public bidding
process.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who resigned last August, testified it was his public
duty to deny the numerous concerns raised by Victoria marine
engineer Bob Ward.
</P>
<P>
   Ward's safety and technical criticisms of the fast ferries
needed to be countered publicly, said Clark.
</P>
<P>
   But Ward's lawyer, Doug Christie, suggested Clark wanted to
deflect criticisms about the absence of public tendering on the
project and counter allegations the government was about to build a
white elephant.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, I don't accept that,'' Clark responded during
cross-examination. ''Mr. Ward was not on and on about the bidding
procedure. He was on and on about not choosing his bid. I don't
remember the bidding process being the focus of Mr. Ward's
complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   The fast-ferry project was not a publicly tendered project and
the vessels were built and managed by the Crown-owned British
Columbia Ferry Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, 63, is suing Clark in British Columbia Supreme Court for
comments he made in a Vancouver newspaper article in February 1996.

<HEADLINE> NATO To Take Risks in War Suspects  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- NATO's secretary-general, Lord
Robertson, told the Yugoslav tribunal Thursday that the military
alliance is prepared to take risks to arrest war crimes suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said NATO peacekeepers in Bosnia and Kosovo ''are
willing to take the risks,'' to arrest the tribunal's most wanted
suspects, including the wartime Bosnian Serb military chief Ratko
Mladic, political strongman Radovan Karadzic and current Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fugitives will be apprehended as soon as possible,''
Robertson said after meeting the tribunal's prosecutor, Carla del
Ponte. It was the first visit by a NATO secretary general to the
U.N. tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Since Robertson joined NATO six months ago, the alliance has
arrested six war crimes suspects, the most recent being Momcilo
Krajisnik, the most senior of the nearly 40 Bosnians in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Krajisnik is accused of masterminding the ''ethnic cleansing''
campaigns that killed thousands of civilians in Bosnia in the
1992-1995 war.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thanks for the arrest,'' del Ponte said. ''But it is not
enough.''

<HEADLINE> Third World To First: Share Wealth  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES ANDERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Third World leaders met behind closed doors
Thursday to find ways to persuade the globe's economic powers to
share the wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond trying to shame industrialized nations into action with
sobering statistics on hunger, infant mortality and the widening
gap between rich and poor, leaders at the Group of 77 summit also
sought common ground among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Since its founding in 1964, the Group of 77 has grown to a
diverse group of 133 developing countries, representing 80 percent
of the world's population.
</P>
<P>
   In an animated speech, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez declared
that industrialized nations ''want us to dance to the tune they're
playing. We cannot dance to the tune they're playing in the name of
globalization. We will dance to our own tune.''
</P>
<P>
   But a draft summit declaration challenges industrialized nations
to a dialogue without provoking them, said Abelardo Moreno,
director of multilateral affairs for Cuba's foreign ministry.
Leaders ''are not looking for a confrontation with the
industrialized countries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The draft cites the need for joint strategies to relieve poverty
and foreign debts, transfer technologies and reverse declining aid
levels. A draft ''action plan'' suggests strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ''For most of us, agriculture remains the mainstay of our
economies, and the majority of our population still lives in rural
areas; globalization has passed them by,'' the declaration says.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's early debates were closed to the legions of reporters
in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   The forty foreign ministers in Havana urged the United Nations
to take a more active role in economic development and technology
transfers to poorer nations. The ministers also demanded
''democratization'' and ''transparency'' for the U.N. Security
Council -- including opening permanent council seats to developing
nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way to improve our lot as developing countries is to
ask for a fair share in the U.N.'s decision-making process,'' the
ministers, mostly from Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and
Asia, said in a document.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers also called for decision-making roles for developing
nations in key lending institutions such as the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund, which they said impose
''unachievable'' austerity conditions in exchange for aid.
</P>
<P>
   The summit came as IMF officials in Washington argued Thursday
that freer trade and greater integration of the global economy
offered the best hope of lifting millions out of poverty. Thousands
of demonstrators planned to protest globalization's impact during
IMF and World Bank meetings beginning there Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   South African President Thabo Mbeki said the protests are
evidence of a rising consciousness in the developed world of Third
World poverty. ''The people who elect the governments are beginning
to come back into the streets to say there is a problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the anti-poverty strategies presented at the summit
sometimes conflicted -- reflecting the wide-ranging ideologies and
states of development of member nations.
</P>
<P>
   They ranged from Brunei -- an Islamic sultanate of 360,000 whose
per capita gross domestic product is among Asia's highest, at
$14,800 in 1997 -- to Malawi, an impoverished southeast African
nation of 11 million where 60 percent of the people live in poverty
and where 265,000 have died from AIDS-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Cuba's Fidel Castro compared globalization's
impact on the Third World to the Holocaust, called for the
abolishment of the IMF and demanded a war crimes-type tribunal to
judge capitalist states for hunger and disease in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Other, more conciliatory speakers defended some free trade,
called for debt relief, more humanitarian aid and the sharing of
Internet and other globe-spanning technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the frenzy over Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old boy
at the center of an international custody dispute, wound its way
into the summit. With a standing ovation, delegates unanimously
approved a motion by Haitian President Rene Preval to demand
Elian's prompt return to Cuba, the Cuban Communist Party newspaper
Granma reported.

<HEADLINE> 1st-Graders Accused of Murder Plot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE STATION, Ind. (AP) -- Three first-graders accused of
plotting to kill a classmate were overcome with remorse once they
were confronted with the gravity of the plan, their parents and
counselors who evaluated them said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's not eating, she's not sleeping, she's a mess. All she's
done is cry,'' said the mother of one of the three girls at Virgil
I. Bailey Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the girls had plotted to kill a rival 7-year-old
classmate because they were jealous of her. They planned to shoot
her, but they also discussed killing her with a butcher knife or
hanging her, Lake Station police Lt. Rich Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   The three were suspended indefinitely while school officials
await results of psychological evaluations. No weapons were found
in a search of the school, but officials sent letters to parents of
Bailey's students alerting them of the plot.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief James Strine said investigators were taking the
allegations seriously, and juvenile authorities will review the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're looking at first-graders. Technically, they're still
babies, but if they shoot you you're just as dead,'' Strine said.
</P>
<P>
   The three girls admitted their involvement in the plot after a
parent alerted school officials, said Lake Station Superintendent
Charles Costa.
</P>
<P>
   Principal Michelle Friesen-Carper and counselor Nona Mackey met
Thursday with students.
</P>
<P>
   ''We talked about making mistakes that we wished we hadn't,''
Friesen-Carper told The Post-Tribune of Gary.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors: Dr. Led Double Life  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN FINUCANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLESLEY, Mass. (AP) -- Last Halloween, a well-respected
allergist took a morning stroll with his wife in the pine-needled
woods near their home. Only the doctor came out of the woods alive.
</P>
<P>
   Mabel Greineder, 58, was bludgeoned with a hammer and stabbed
with a knife.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband of 31 years, Dr. Dirk Greineder, 59, has been
charged with her murder. Authorities say he may have killed his
wife after she learned he led a secret life to indulge his desire
for pornography and prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   State officials called Greineder a threat to public health and
safety in suspending his medical license. Still, the couple's three
grown children are steadfastly supporting their father, a
distinguished doctor and resident of one of the wealthiest towns in
Massachusetts who has said he is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know him extremely well. And we know he's innocent,'' said
Britt Greineder, 27, on Wednesday. ''He would never be capable of
harming my Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Greineder appeared to be living a life of success and serenity.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Germany but raised in Lebanon, Greineder speaks at least
four languages. He was educated at Yale and received his doctorate
from Case Western Reserve University. By 1998, he had risen to
director of clinical allergy at Brigham and Women's Hospital, one
of the best-known hospitals in Boston and one of the nation's top
research facilities.
</P>
<P>
   He and his family lived for 25 years in Wellesley, which
residents describe as peaceful neighborhood and an unlikely scene
for a crime.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors say the doctor had a second identity -- using the
pseudonym Thomas Young, the name of a former Yale classmate. He
arranged hotel trysts with prostitutes, sent nude pictures of
himself over the Internet and prescribed himself Viagra,
prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   During the weekend prior to the murder, prosecutors allege,
Greineder stayed in a New Jersey hotel with a prostitute -- and he
called the same woman for sex the day after his wife was slain. He
allegedly told one prostitute his wife was ''older and soft.''
</P>
<P>
   Greineder led a life ''dedicated to prostitutes and pornography
that was unknown to all those closest to him,'' prosecutor Rick
Grundy said.
</P>
<P>
   Greineder told police he found his wife's body after the couple
became separated during their walk in the town park at Morses Pond,
only a half-mile from their four-bedroom home.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was not arrested for four months, authorities say they
suspected the doctor from the beginning: When police first arrived
at the park, Greineder had blood on his jacket, eyeglasses and
sleeves, but not on his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors believe they've found the gloves that Greineder
wore. And they say DNA tests run on a knife and hammer found in the
park strongly tie Greineder to the crime. He's being held without
bail.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent court hearing, his two daughters and son sat
shoulder to shoulder in an otherwise empty row in the gallery.
Greineder smiled at them as he walked by in handcuffs and leg
manacles.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's really quite remarkable. ... He's an amazing father. He's
always been there for us,'' Ms. Greineder.
</P>
<P>
   Greineder's attorney has railed against prosecutors for
assailing the doctor's character and sharing too much publicly
about the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect to try this case in court and not in the news media,
and we expect that at the end of the process, Dr. Greineder will be
completely vindicated,'' attorney Martin Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Greineder said she and her siblings are looking forward to
the day their father goes to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''We eagerly await the day in court. ... We stand 100 percent
behind him. We are utterly convinced of his innocence,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> UN Weapons Inspection Plan OKd  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. Security Council on Thursday
unanimously approved an organizational plan for returning weapons
inspectors to Iraq, more than a year after they were barred from
the country by Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   After only a few hours of debate, the council president, Robert
Fowler of Canada, made the announcement after the chief U.N.
weapons inspector, Hans Blix, briefed ambassadors for the first
time on his plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council created the new commission, known as
UNMOVIC, in December to replace the U.N. Special Commission, known
as UNSCOM, which was stung by allegations that U.N. inspectors
spied on Iraq on behalf of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The quick approval signals that the Security Council, which has
been deeply divided over Iraq, is united in its initial support for
Blix, the 73-year-old former head of the International Atomic
Energy Agency who was chosen to head the new U.N. Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm quite pleased with the outcome,'' Blix said after the
closed-door meeting. ''We have worked kind of hard on this
operational plan.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would begin interviews to form a ''core staff'' of
40-plus full-time professionals in New York as well as part-time
experts who can be called on for specific missions. All staff will
attend a six-week U.N. training course in the summer, he said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, UNSCOM had worked with the IAEA to oversee the
destruction of Iraq's biological, chemical and nuclear weapons and
missile programs.
</P>
<P>
   Weapons inspectors from both agencies left Iraq in Dec. 1998
ahead of U.S. and British airstrikes, launched to punish Iraq for
failing to cooperate with the inspectors -- and Baghdad barred
UNSCOM from returning.
</P>
<P>
   Top Iraqi officials have said Baghdad would not accept new U.N.
weapons inspectors, but others have left open the possibility for
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Blix said the resolution that established UNMOVIC offers the
possibility of suspending sanctions if Iraq cooperates. Previously,
a 1990 council resolution required the destruction of Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction before sanctions could be lifted, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But they will decide for themselves what they'll do,'' Blix
said. ''I do not see it as my function to persuade Iraq. ... Above
all, I do not feel that I have any authority on my part to give any
discount on the resolution. I'm not negotiating the resolution. I
implement it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Blix's plan, UNMOVIC inspectors will come from all
around the world and be paid for out of the U.N. budget -- not
volunteered by member governments or under their control, as was
the case with UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the safeguards in Blix's plan to prevent
intelligence about Iraq from filtering back to individual
countries, U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said: ''I support what
he said entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said Iraq should now cooperate fully and allow Blix's
inspectors to do their job.
</P>
<P>
   ''This charade from Baghdad really has gone on much too long,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said Moscow signed off on the
organizational plan even though it had some lingering questions
that would have to be answered.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, Russia wants to ensure that former UNSCOM employees
who ''abused their positions,'' wouldn't work for the new agency --
a reference to the espionage allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Lavrov said there's ''a good chance'' Iraq would cooperate with
the new agency if the United States and Britain stopped their
airstrikes in the no-fly zones and the U.S. ended its efforts to
undermine the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
   ''But if unilateral (actions) continue, then I don't believe the
atmospherics would be right for any hope for success,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said the United States and
Britain were enforcing the no-fly zones as a way to protect
minorities in northern and southern Iraq. The U.S. and British
planes never initiated attacks but rather responded to Iraqi fire,
he said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Official Defends Globalization  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- International Monetary Fund and Clinton
administration officials on Thursday defended their efforts to
promote freer trade and greater integration of the global economy,
contending they offered the best hope of lifting hundreds of
millions of people out of abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Globalization -- the bane of thousands of demonstrators in the
nation's capital this week who contend that global capitalism has
failed to help the poor -- has gotten a bad rap, said acting IMF
Managing Director Stanley Fischer.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators, seeking to build on their success in
disrupting World Trade Organization meetings in Seattle last year,
have vowed to form human chains and prevent delegates to the IMF
and World Bank meetings from attending Sunday's opening sessions.
</P>
<P>
   In a preview of larger protests planned this weekend, dozens of
sign-carrying demonstrators chanting ''WTO has got to go'' and
carrying a puppet labeled WTO Director General Mike Moore, marched
to the National Press Club in an effort to confront Moore, who was
giving a noontime speech.
</P>
<P>
   Five demonstrators who began shouting slogans were removed from
the press club, but police said no arrests were made.
</P>
<P>
   In another part of Washington, about 150 demonstrators marched
to a Starbucks shop to celebrate an announcement by the company
last Monday that it would begin selling ''fair trade'' coffee. A
special seal by a nonprofit organization will signify that the
coffee is grown under safe working conditions with a fair price
paid to farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said critics of the Geneva-based WTO ''are not all wrong.
We are now in the process of examining how we can be more
transparent, more efficient, more inclusive.'' He said it was
''heartbreaking'' that the Seattle events resulted in a delay in
addressing demonstrators' concerns because the 135 trade ministers
could not launch a new round of global negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Both Fischer and Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the
demonstrators were wrong in blaming global capitalism for problems
of poverty, environmental pollution and human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Greater integration of the global economy is both inevitable and
a force for improving living standards, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Globalization ''represents the only way we are going to raise
people around the world to the same level as people in
industrialized countries,'' Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Summers told reporters the United States would use this year's
IMF and World Bank meetings to continue pushing reforms to make
both institutions more accountable and open.
</P>
<P>
   In response to criticism over the handling of the selection of
Germany's Horst Koehler as the new IMF chief, Summers said the
United States would propose that both the IMF and World Bank in the
future appoint outside advisory committees to review potential
candidates to ensure that the ''views and interests of all
countries'' are considered.
</P>
<P>
   Police, who had already established a security perimeter around
both the IMF and neighboring World Bank buildings, increased
security Thursday following the Wednesday night arrests of seven
protesters and the confiscation of equipment that they allegedly
planned to use for blockades.
</P>
<P>
   Police made the arrests after stopping two vehicles filled with
''lock boxes,'' lengths of PVC pipes that demonstrators can use to
lock arms and make it difficult to break a ''human chain.'' Police
said they also confiscated chicken wire and duct tape and charged
the seven with possession of implements of crime.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, 15 protesters have been arrested, and Police Chief
Charles H. Ramsey declared that police were prepared for mass
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could make thousands, but I hope we don't have to make
any,'' Ramsey said at a news conference where the metal and plastic
pipes seized from the two vehicles were displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey estimated that policing the event would cost $2.5 million
in overtime and equipment. The department's budget is ''not set up
for that,'' he said, ''but we have to draw the money somewhere.
Right now, we just want to get through this.''
</P>
<P>
   About 50 peaceful demonstrators gathered at George Washington
University, located in the same Foggy Bottom neighborhood, to
protest the university's decision to close for the weekend and ban
students from having visitors in their dorm rooms. They carried
signs reading, ''GWU: Serve the students, not corporate greed.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank on Thursday released a new assessment of global
poverty that highlighted how the global financial crisis of 1997-98
had hurt efforts to alleviate poverty, widening the divide between
rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that while the poverty rate did decline in some
large countries, notably China, it rose in many other nations in
1998, the latest year for which data is available. Some 1.2 billion
people were forced to get by on less than $1 a day, the report
found, a figure essentially unchanged over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer, a former economics professor at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, said the demonstrations would not stop his
agency from addressing reform measures, including greater debt
relief for poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the same goal as the demonstrators. We want to reduce
poverty all over the world,'' Fischer said.

<HEADLINE> Diddley Files Lawsuit Against Nike  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- If Nike thought it could sell Bo Diddley
T-shirts without paying the guitar legend, the company might not
know Diddley.
</P>
<P>
   Diddley filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Manhattan late
Wednesday against Nike, saying the company had been marketing
T-shirts with his name, likeness and the words, ''You Don't Know
Diddley.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry that it's come to this but what's right is right,''
Diddley said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed with Diddley's real name, Ellas McDaniel,
said Nike struck a sour note with the 71-year-old rock 'n' roll
performer last year when it went ahead with the T-shirt sales even
though he never accepted the terms of a contract proposal made by
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 28,000 T-shirts were sold worldwide for more than
$200,000 after the company concluded it had an oral agreement with
Diddley, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   The T-shirt campaign was a revival of a T-shirt sold a decade
earlier when Diddley was featured in a Nike television commercial
with athlete Bo Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit sought unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   Vada Manager, Nike's director of Global Issues Management, said
the Beaverton, Ore., company was aware of the lawsuit but had not
yet seen it.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company had authorized a royalty payment of between
$10,000 and $15,000 to be paid to Diddley and was prepared to
negotiate further if that was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll respond to their suit with the facts. Hopefully with
this offer, we'll have further discussions,'' said Manager, reached
by telephone in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   John Rosenberg, a lawyer for Diddley, said he was surprised to
learn Nike was talking about settlement offers similar to those
which had already been rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no settlement discussions pending at this time.
There are no proposals on the table,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Nike meant to make a proposal through the press, I will
respond through the press and say we reject it as entirely
unacceptable,'' Rosenberg added.

<HEADLINE> Congressman: Boy Tried To Steal Car  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL TOLME, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- A congressman who alleges an 8-year-old
tried to steal his car was accused by the boy's parents Thursday of
manhandling the child.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. James Moran says the incident occurred outside an
Alexandria recreation center where he was picking up his children
April 7.
</P>
<P>
   Moran, D-Va., said he grabbed the boy after the child approached
him in the parking lot, said he had a gun in his pocket and
demanded Moran's keys. Moran took the child inside the center and
asked officials to call the police, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After Moran recounted the incident Tuesday on NBC's ''Today''
show, where he chastised the boy's parents, the child's mother and
father hired a lawyer and filed a complaint with a magistrate.
</P>
<P>
   They say Moran manhandled the boy and should be charged. They
also claim he was drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandria police spokeswoman Amy Bertsch said investigators had
failed in repeated attempts to interview the child since their
initial contact with him following the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The parents' lawyer, Ted Williams, held a news conference
Thursday and challenged Moran to take a lie detector test. Williams
said Moran had inflamed the situation by going on national
television and taking ''potshots at an 8-year-old boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams sent to reporters school transcripts showing the child
is an ''A'' student.
</P>
<P>
   Moran said he wanted the dispute to end and from the beginning
only wanted to impress upon the child the seriousness of his
actions. Moran said other people could vouch for his sobriety.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole incident illustrates dramatically why citizens
probably walk away from problems and don't get involved in dealing
with their community,'' Moran said.

<HEADLINE> 5 Charged in Child Porn Case  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN PARROTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- A federal grand jury indicted two U.S. residents,
two Indonesians and a Russian on Thursday in an alleged scheme to
distribute child pornography on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Paul Coggins said the indictments were the first
ever to ''target foreign webmasters and their corrupt
co-conspirators in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel returned a total of 87 counts against the five,
including charges of sexual exploitation of minors and distribution
of child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Named in the indictments were Thomas Reedy, 37, and his wife
Janice Reedy, 31, both of Fort Worth; R.W. Kusuma and Hanny
Ingganata, both of Indonesia, and Boris Greenberg of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Reedys' home-based business, Landslide Inc., also was
indicted.
</P>
<P>
   The Reedys were arrested Wednesday. The overseas residents are
not in custody. Coggins said he would attempt to extradite them but
would not say if authorities in Indonesia and Russia were
cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum penalty for each count is 15 years in prison and a
$250,000 fine. The business could be fined $500,000 per count and
be forced to forfeit its assets.
</P>
<P>
   The government alleges that Landslide provided a credit card
verification service that was an electronic gateway for subscribers
to access photos and movies at Web sites operated by Kusuma,
Greenberg and Ingganata. The images depicted children from ages 4
to 12 engaging in sexual acts.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Refuses To Export Tuna  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The United States has lifted its nine-year
embargo on tuna from Mexico, but the Mexican government said
Thursday that exporting tuna would be futile as long as U.S. courts
prevent their use of a ''dolphin-safe'' label.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could start exporting like crazy now if we wanted, but
nobody's going to buy tuna that doesn't have a 'dolphin-safe'
label,'' said Dalia de la Pena Wing, spokeswoman for Mexico's
Secretariat of the Environment, Natural Resources and Fisheries.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unjust that we don't have the label,'' she said. ''We'll
keep appealing until they declare it dolphin-safe.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a federal judge in San Francisco blocked the Clinton
administration's plan to loosen standards for the dolphin-safe
label and allow Mexican tuna to carry the label.
</P>
<P>
   Established by a 1990 law, the label can be used only on cans of
tuna that are not netted with dolphins. The Mexican tuna fleet, the
world's largest, catches tuna in large encircling nets that often
trap dolphins, which are then freed.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 law would allow use of the dolphin-safe label on tuna
caught with encircling nets as long as observers stationed on the
tuna boats saw no dolphins killed or harmed. The U.S. government
would also have to find that dolphins were not being harmed by
repeated captures and releases.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary Richard Daley said a year ago that there was
no significant evidence of harm to dolphins from the practice. He
planned to change labeling standards Tuesday, but was blocked by
U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said the Commerce Department had failed to conduct
tests on dolphins -- also required by the 1997 law -- and to consider
the results before deciding whether the creatures were harmed. The
department says it recently started tests at sea but has no results
yet.
</P>
<P>
   Daley announced Wednesday that the government was formally
lifting its embargo on Mexican tuna, imposed in 1991 because of
dolphin-killing. Imports cannot carry a dolphin-safe label,
however, if the tuna was caught with encircling nets.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the environmental groups that challenged the labeling
change have also sued in the U.S. Court of International Trade in
New York to preserve the Mexican embargo. The suit contends Mexico
has not fully complied with U.S. regulations intended to reduce
dolphin deaths. The court heard arguments Wednesday but has not yet
ruled.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Squatters Asked To Leave  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Zimbabwe's High Court Thursday ordered
the government to remove squatters from hundreds of white-owned
farms and the country's leadership responded by broadcasting a
radio appeal for the protesters to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal by Vice President Joseph Msika was the latest move in
Zimbabwe's land crisis: Some 50,000 squatters refuse to give up the
farms, defiance that has left farmers and opposition groups
demanding police action.
</P>
<P>
   Msika's statement sought to head off a constitutional crisis
between the judiciary and the government of President Robert
Mugabe, who is in Cuba for a summit.
</P>
<P>
   The High Court has ordered the government to evict the squatters
from more than 900 farms. The government has defied the order, with
Mugabe calling the occupations a justified protest against unfair
ownership of much of the country's productive land by 4,000 whites.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, Msika appealed to squatters to leave the farms and
said the government wanted to end the tense stalemate amicably. The
vice president stopped short of committing the government to
obeying the court order and removing the squatters.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's government has argued that police action against the
squatters -- who are armed with clubs, knives, spears and guns --
could trigger a civil war. However, the High Court said Thursday
the rule of law must be observed. It ordered the government to obey
the earlier court order to end the farm occupations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are encouraged'' by the court's ruling, said David Hasluck,
director of the Commercial Farmers' Union representing about 4,000
mostly white farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff in Zimbabwe combines elements of racial tension and
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The farm occupations, which began in early February, come in a
nation where a few whites own one-third of the productive land
while most blacks are landless and impoverished. The squatters are
led by men who claim to be veterans of the bush war that led to
this nation's independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe set up the standoff more than two months ago. Stung by
his defeat in a constitutional referendum in February, he publicly
warned that landless blacks impatient with the slow pace of land
reform would seize white farms.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, thousands of armed men occupied farms across the
country. Many of the squatters are being paid to occupy the farms,
and some said they were paid by ruling party activists.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the farm takeovers were violent. The Commercial Farmers'
Union has reported dozens of assaults on members' farms. Several
farmers have been severely beaten, and death threats have been
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Chenjerai Hunzvi, leader of the main war veterans
association, said he had received no instructions from the court or
the government to withdraw from the farms. Hunzvi, who earlier said
his followers would return to war to keep the farms, refused to say
how his group would respond to the new order and the vice
president's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Maphosa, an official of the National Constitutional
Assembly, an alliance of opposition and reform groups, said doubts
lingered over whether the police would implement the court order to
evict the squatters.
</P>
<P>
   Police have said they lack the manpower and equipment, including
tear gas, to carry out the order. On Monday, Attorney General
Patrick Chinamasa said the 20,000-strong police force would be
unable to evict an estimated 50,000 squatters.
</P>
<P>
   Police action ''would be a match that would ignite the country
into a bloody conflagration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government could seek to delay any action by appealing the
order to the Supreme Court, the nation's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   If police continue to delay, ''the courts must stand their
ground, or we will be completely finished,'' Maphosa said. ''The
order to end this must come from Mugabe himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's overwhelming majority in the parliament, where he
controls 147 of the 150 seats, gives him the power to defy the
judiciary without threat of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Welshman Ncube, a law professor at the Zimbabwe University, said
government refusal to enforce laws has created a constitutional
crisis. ''Mugabe is using state institutions to perpetuate
lawlessness and anarchy,'' Ncube said.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's declared intention to seize white-owned farms without
paying compensation has put him at odds with Western governments
such as Britain and the United States, which have pressured him to
follow the rule of law in land reform.
</P>
<P>
   But Mugabe, speaking at the South Summit in Havana on Thursday,
sounding a defiant tone.
</P>
<P>
   ''The message is simple. We Zimbabweans should leave the ...
settlers in control of our Zimbabwean land. I want to assure you
that the land will be acquired, sanctions or no sanctions,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Mugabe has used land reform as a
political tool. More than two years ago, he promised to seize white
farms as a way to appease angry war veterans. The veterans were
demonstrating against the government because corrupt officials and
their relatives had stolen millions of dollars from the veteran's
pension fund, leaving it bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Under international pressure from donor countries, Mugabe backed
off and agreed to compensate farmers for any seized property.
</P>
<P>
   But months later, when a currency crisis triggered high
inflation and food riots in Harare, Mugabe again renewed the threat
to seize land.

<HEADLINE> Marinovich Works Out With Chargers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- As another controversy involving Ryan Leaf
emerged, Todd Marinovich worked out for the San Diego Chargers on
Thursday and could soon be offered a contract.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Bobby Beathard said the staff will meet Friday
to determine whether to sign the 30-year-old Marinovich, who hasn't
played in the NFL since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers are looking to add a quarterback because of the
uncertainty over the troubled Leaf, who is still experiencing pain
from a second surgery on his throwing shoulder. Leaf visited Dr.
James Andrews in Birmingham, Ala., on Wednesday for a third
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Riley said he spoke with Leaf on Thursday and was
mostly encouraged by the results of the exam. Riley said there is
some irritation in the shoulder and doubts Leaf will throw during
the team's minicamp April 28-30.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Los Angeles Times reported that fullback Fred
McCrary criticized Leaf in the locker room after a workout about a
month ago, calling him, among other things, ''fat'' and ''out of
shape'' while imploring him to better prepare for the new season.
</P>
<P>
   An angry Leaf left the complex and hasn't returned. He's been
working out since with a personal trainer.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Bobby Beathard said the report was accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of being an athlete ... you're going to have some
run-ins. You have to accept that and come back. I think it's
important for him to understand that. Ryan needs to be here doing
his routine,'' Beathard said.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said Leaf told him he will report to the team next week to
rehab his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   As for mending the strained relationship with his teammates,
''That's between them,'' Riley said. ''He'll come back and go to
work, and that will be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley was impressed with Marinovich's accuracy and release.
</P>
<P>
   Marinovich, a backup with the Los Angeles Avengers of the Arena
Football League, also was happy with his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It felt good to throw on a big field. I've been throwing
lately on that small arena field, so it was good to throw out on
the grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Marinovich has had his own troubles. He was a first-round draft
pick of the Raiders in 1991 but was released before the 1993
season.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1998, he spent three months in jail after pleading
guilty to growing marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Marinovich said he's learned from his mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tough times I've been through have made me a stronger
person and I've moved on since then. I think that everything that
has gone on has been a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Marinovich expressed a strong interest in signing with the
Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a perfect fit. If I were to chose a place to play, this
would be it, no doubt about it.''

<HEADLINE> Mets 2, Phillies 1  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mike Piazza's tiebreaking, RBI double with
two outs in the ninth inning helped the New York Mets snap a
four-game losing streak with a 2-1 victory over the Philadelphia
Phillies on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Payton singled with one out off Scott Aldred (0-1) for his
first career three-hit game. With two outs, Piazza hit a liner to
left-center off Amaury Telemaco. Payton barely beat Mickey
Morandini's relay throw from left fielder Ron Gant to score the
winning run.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Cook (2-0) got Rico Brogna to pop out with two runners on
in the eighth. Armando Benitez pitched the ninth for his third
save.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who had lost six straight at Veterans Stadium, got a
strong outing from Rick Reed. The right-hander allowed one run and
four hits in seven innings and drove in New York's first run with a
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies tied it at 1-1 when Mike Lieberthal hit Reed's
first pitch in the seventh just over the left-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Reed's sacrifice fly scored Derek Bell to give the Mets a 1-0
lead in the fourth. Bell led off with a single. Benny Agbayani and
Rey Ordonez drew one-out walks to load the bases before Reed hit
the first pitch to center.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Wolf solidified his spot in Philadelphia's rotation with
his second straight strong outing. The left-hander allowed one run
and five hits while walking six and striking out seven in seven
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had runners on first and third with two outs in the
eighth, but pinch-hitter Todd Pratt flied out to right to end the
threat. New York stranded 11 runners.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez, who is just 1-for-24 this season, walked three times,
including a two-out walk that also loaded the bases in the second.
But Reed struck out to end that threat.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez kept the Phillies off the scoreboard with a nice play on
a sharp, one-hopper to shortstop by Rico Brogna with two outs and
runners on first and second in the sixth. Ordonez dove slightly to
his left, short-hopped the liner and forced Scott Rolen at second.
</P>
<P>
   Reed was also helped by excellent defense the previous inning as
Bell made a pair of diving catches on consecutive plays.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Todd Zeile became the first Mets runner to get thrown out
stealing when he was picked off with one out in the sixth. The Mets
had been 7-for-7. ... Rolen went 0-for-2 against Reed and is
1-for-16 against him in his career. ... Agbayani started his first
game of the season as the struggling Rickey Henderson got a day
off. He went 0-for-3 and misplayed a bloop double by Brogna in the
second. ... Melvin Mora got his second career start at third base
in place of Robin Ventura, who has been bothered by a tender right
ankle.

<HEADLINE> Penguins 7, Capitals 0  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington Capitals let the Pittsburgh
Penguins play run-and-gun. That mistake resulted in the biggest
playoff loss in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins scored on three of their first four shots -- two on
power plays and a third skating four-on-four -- as European speed
and finesse dominated North American brute in Thursday's 7-0 Game 1
victory in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Six Penguins scored, and Jaromir Jagr had four assists. Three
goals came skating four-on-four, two on five-on-four power plays
and another on a five-on-three. On every goal, Pittsburgh had
plenty of ice -- whether from an odd-man rush or just sloppy
defense. Washington tallied 27 penalty minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Janne Laukkanen, Robert Lang and Martin Straka scored in the
first period, and Jiri Slegr, Jan Hrdina and Tyler Wright scored in
the second. Laukkanen got his second goal in the third period for
the Penguins, who finally won a Game 1 against the Capitals.
Pittsburgh has won four of five playoff series against Washington
over the last decade, but the Caps won the opener each time.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-goal deficit was the biggest in 138 postseason games
for the Capitals. They've lost by six goals three times, including
a 7-1 loss to Pittsburgh in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins finished one goal shy of matching their biggest
playoff victory, an 8-0 rout of Minnesota in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Under the quirky schedule for this series, the seventh-seeded
Penguins take the 1-0 series lead home for the next two games,
Saturday and Monday. Usually the higher seed gets the first two
games at home, but the unavailability of Pittsburgh's Mellon Arena
for several days next week prompted the NHL to put the
second-seeded Capitals at home for Games 1, 4, 5 and 7.
</P>
<P>
   Washington captain Adam Oates said his team would ''have be
awake for Game 1'' because of the schedule, but the Capitals didn't
follow a single plank of their pre-series strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The Caps wanted to physically punish and wear down the flashier
Penguins without taking unnecessary penalties -- as they did when
they allowed three power-play goals in a 4-3 loss to Pittsburgh on
March 30. The Caps also wanted to pack the slot and grind out goals
on counterattacks and rebounds. They did neither.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Ken Klee had an awful night. His first error was a
scuffle he started behind the net that led to coincidental minors
for roughing. That put the Penguins in their element, skating
four-on-four. When Peter Bondra strayed too deep in Pittsburgh's
zone, the Penguins had a two-on-one break that ended with
Laukkanen's big drive through goaltender Olaf Kolzig at 2:30.
</P>
<P>
   Klee also contributed to the second Penguins goal. After skating
himself out of position on a two-on-two, Klee dislodged the net and
was whistled for delay of game. Ten seconds later, Jagr slid a
crisp pass to a wide-open Lang in front of the crease for the easy
power-play goal at 6:34.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Zettler was in the box when the third goal was scored at
11:26 by Straka, who stuffed in the box as Klee shoved him from
behind in the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr threaded a perfect pass to an unchecked Slegr for another
four-aside goal at 3:00 of the second period. Hrdina placed a
brilliant shot between Zettler's legs into the corner of the net
during yet another four-on-four at 12:03.
</P>
<P>
   The Pens made it 6-0 at 13:32 when Wright scored a two-on-none
break, the only goal to be scored with the teams skating
five-on-five.
</P>
<P>
   Laukkanen scored his second by stuffing in a rebound on a
five-on-three power play just 33 seconds into the final period. By
then, Kolzig had been mercifully pulled for Craig Billington.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Tugnutt made 32 saves for the shutout, but the credit goes
to the Pittsburgh defense. Most of Tugnutt's stops weren't clean,
but the Penguins were able to clear the puck because there was
rarely a Capitals player in front of the crease.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Automakers Join Alliance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese automakers Nissan Motor Co. and Renault SA
of France said Friday they will join an Internet parts-purchasing
company being planned by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and
DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   The planned company will give the five partners a combined
purchasing power of $300 billion, said Nissan, which is 36.8
percent owned by Renault.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to creating a single channel for the purchase of
components, the online system will help strengthen the flow of
information with suppliers, quicken product development and cut
costs, Nissan said.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to say when operations will begin or how much
each partner will invest, said Nissan spokesman Ryuji Nakayama.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler announced in February
that they will join forces in the Internet venture to handle
purchasing of raw materials, parts and office supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The planned alliance continues a trend among the world's
automakers toward partnerships or mergers. Such deals are expected
to cut the massive costs of designing and building vehicles and
developing environment-friendly engines.
</P>
<P>
   Debt-ridden Nissan has undertaken a recovery campaign since
Renault bought a stake in it for $5.4 billion early last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Chris Osgood earned his seventh career playoff
shutout and Vyacheslav Kozlov and Sergei Fedorov scored goals as
the Detroit Red Wings beat the Los Angeles Kings 2-0 in the opener
of their Western Conference series Thursday night..
</P>
<P>
   Osgood, who had six shutouts this season, made 19 saves.
</P>
<P>
   Kozlov, who scored 18 goals during the regular season, scored at
1:43 of the second period on a shot that hit Los Angeles defenseman
Jere Karalahti in the back and caromed into the net past goalie
Stephane Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   Fedorov, who had 27 goals this season, scored into an empty net
with 12.8 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset, who faced 31 shots, was pulled with 1:23 remaining, but
returned with 59.2 seconds left for a faceoff near the red line. He
reached the bench again with 41.2 seconds remaining and Fedorov
scored moments later.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 of the best-of-7 first-round series will be played
Saturday at Joe Louis Arena. Action then shifts to Los Angeles for
games Monday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Yzerman, who was expected to return from a mild knee
sprain that kept him out of the final four regular-season games,
instead sat out with a bout of the flu. Yzerman, the Red Wings
captain, was the team's leading scorer this season with 39 goals
and 44 assists for 79 points -- one more than Brendan Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   As the game unfolded, however, it looked like Yzerman was
perhaps better off watching instead of playing. The contest turned
into a hard-hitting affair that left bodies strewn all over the
ice.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit forward Darren McCarty, who missed about a third of the
season because of a contract holdout and an injury that required
surgery, delivered perhaps the Red Wings' hardest check of the
season when he slammed Garry Galley into the boards behind the
Kings' net at 2:10 of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings got some payback at 7:03 when Rob Blake's hipcheck
left Detroit forward Tomas Holmstrom face down on the ice for about
a minute. Holmstrom finally skated off with the aid of a trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Red Wings -- gunning for their third Stanley Cup
title in four years -- were skating with an intensity almost never
seen during the regular season. Detroit outshot the Kings 12-4
during the period, including three quality shots that Fiset -- who
was 2-0-1 against the Red Wings during the season -- was able to
turn away during the Red Wings' first power play.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Kozlov's fluke goal, the game might have remained
scoreless through the second period because Fiset and Osgood were
both brilliant at times. Osgood made a clutch save to rob Bryan
Smolinski who snapped off a shot from between the circles at 6:50
of the second after Fedorov had misplayed the puck.
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski was playing with a brace on the right knee, which had
kept him out of action since April 3.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset came up big again during a Detroit power play in the
third, managing somehow to get the handle of his stick on the puck
inches from the goal line after a shot by Shanahan at 8:52.
</P>
<P>
   With 5:11 remaining, Fiset held off Brent Gilchrist who skated
in alone on a breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   Just before a faceoff with 2:11 remaining, an octopus was tossed
onto the ice from the stands, an old symbol of Detroit playoff
success from the days when the NHL was a six-team league.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings went 48-24-10 during the regular season, finishing
with 108 points. Yet one of the teams that gave Detroit a lot of
trouble was the Kings. Los Angeles finished with a 39-31-12 record
and 94 points, fourth-best in franchise history and 20 points
better than in 1999. And the Kings were 2-2-1 against Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Devils 4, Panthers 3  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Scott Stevens, Petr Sykora and
Sergei Brylin scored early as the New Jersey Devils opened a
three-goal lead and then avoided another playoff embarrassment by
holding off the Florida Panthers 4-3 on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Scott Gomez also scored and Martin Brodeur made 20 saves
as the Devils took the opening game of the best-of-7 first-round
Eastern Conference playoff series. Game 2 will be played here
Sunday, with the contest marking the return of Devils defenseman
Scott Niedermayer from a 10-game suspension for hitting Florida's
Peter Worrell over the head with his stick March. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Worrell, who was booed every time he touched the puck, and Mike
Sillinger and Rob Niedermayer, Scott's brother, scored for the
Panthers, making their first playoff appearance since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to show early as Stevens, Sykora and Brylin scored
in the opening 15:28 in what seemed to be an effort to wipe out the
frustrations of three straight early exits from the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   However, the game just as quickly turned into a microcosm of New
Jersey's season.
</P>
<P>
   With things seemingly in hand, Devils lost their intensity and
spent the rest of the game trying to hold off the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer got the Panthers going a little more than a minute
after Brylin scored, capping a great 3-on-2 rush by scoring into an
empty net off a pass from Scott Mellanby.
</P>
<P>
   The play that seemed to demoralize the Devils was Worrell's goal
with 17 seconds left in the period. Moments after stepping out of
the penalty box, he took a cross-ice pass from Robert Svehla and
beat Brodeur with a unscreened 45-foot shot that the All-Star
goalie misplayed off his glove.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez gave the Devils a 4-2 lead 7:21 into the second period
after Todd Simpson and Sillinger failed to clear the puck from the
Florida zone. Gomez got the loose puck at the top of the circle and
ripped a shot that just slithered past Mike Vernon into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Sillinger made up for the mistake with 6:10 left in the period,
putting in a rebound of a point shot that Pavel Bure touched after
Brodeur made the save. Bure, who led the NHL with 58 goals, was
limited to an assist Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens opened the scoring at 1:38 beating Vernon with a slap
shot from the point after Bobby Holik won a faceoff. Sykora scored
on a backhander at 4:02 after outfighting Panthers defenseman Bret
Hedican for a loose puck.
</P>
<P>
   Brylin scored from the left circle after Panthers defenseman
Mike Wilson failed to clear a puck behind his net.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Arnott, the center on the Devils' top line, left the game
late in the second period with a wrist injury and did not return.
He was taken to a hospital for X-rays but his condition was not
immediately known.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Samoan Heads Sentenced To Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   APIA, Samoa (AP) -- Two former Cabinet ministers were sentenced
to death Thursday, after a judge confirmed a jury's findings that
the pair were guilty of murdering a rival member of Samoa's
government.
</P>
<P>
   Exercising powers to either confirm or quash a jury's guilty
verdict which was split 4-1, judge Andrew Wilson accepted the
decision against the two conspirators.
</P>
<P>
   They were then sentenced to death, the only punishment allowable
for murder. However, no convicted killer has been hanged in modern
Samoa, with sentences routinely commuted to life in prison by the
head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Former Women's Affairs Minister Leafa Vitale, 57, and
ex-Communications Minister Toi Aukuso, 68, were found guilty of
murdering Luagalau Levaula Kamu, who was shot in the back while
talking on a mobile telephone during a political gathering on July
16 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kamu was shot with an M-16 rifle by Vitale's son, Alatise, who
carried out the slaying for his father and Aukuso.
</P>
<P>
   After admitting to the assassination last year, Alatise Vitale
was sentenced to death, but his punishment was later reduced to
life imprisonment. During the trial he first testified that his
father knew nothing of the killing and then admitted he had ordered
it.
</P>
<P>
   The faces of the two accused were impassive while the findings
were read Wednesday, but Aukuso clutched tighter at the handrail of
the defendants' box, and a stunned silence fell over the Samoan
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Their trial, which began Jan. 17 and heard testimony from 65
witnesses, put government corruption in Apia under the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   A popular figure, Kamu was part of a new wave of young
politicians seeking to clean up political life. His killing was
seen as an attempt to prevent publication of reports on corruption
believed to implicate former ministers and legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also alleged the former ministers had Kamu killed
out of jealousy because he had been appointed to the Public Works
Cabinet post, a position whose holder has been known to be offered
bribes from local companies competing for government-funded
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Vitale denied ordering the hit and described Kamu as a ''very
good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   But Aukuso told the court Vitale had asked him to shoot Kamu and
Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi last year. Aukuso said
he refused to carry out the killings after Vitale failed to pay him
the agreed fee.
</P>
<P>
   The murder was Samoa's first political killing since the former
German and New Zealand territory gained independence 38 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Once known as Western Samoa, the island chain has a population
of about 164,000. The United States territory of American Samoa
comprises several islands in the same island group.

<HEADLINE> Figg-Currier, Hetherington Lead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Calif. (AP) -- Taking advantage of agreeable morning
conditions, Cindy Figg-Currier and Rachel Hetherington shot
6-under-par 66s Thursday and were tied for the first-round lead at
the LPGA Longs Drugs Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Figg-Currier, who was also tied for the first-round lead a year
ago after shooting a 68, played in the first group off at the
6,388-yard Twelve Bridges Golf Club course.
</P>
<P>
   Following a par at No. 1, Figg-Currier birdied the next three
holes. She finished with seven birdies and a lone bogey on No. 17.
</P>
<P>
   A hard rain Wednesday evening made for ideal conditions the next
morning. The course absorbed the rain with little problem and
softened the greens, which are typically a source of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   A tricky wind that gusted to 22 mph made the course tougher in
the afternoon on a day when 21 golfers shot below par, most of them
with morning tee times.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best part about the morning was there wasn't any rain,''
Figg-Currier said. ''I woke up at one in the morning and I heard
the rain coming down. I was worried about playing in a downpour.
When I saw that blue sky I was shocked. We got a real break.''
</P>
<P>
   Teeing off about two hours later, Hetherington also birdied Nos.
2 through 4. The Australian-born Hetherington caught Figg-Currier
with the last of six birdies at No. 16, making an eight-foot putt.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been wet here in the past and I can remember hitting
3-woods into some of the par-4s,'' Hetherington said. ''This course
seems to get better every year. The fairways are terrific and so
are the greens.''
</P>
<P>
   One shot behind the leaders was Michelle Bell, who had to take
the last three years off due to a serious problem with her immune
system. In the first morning group off the back nine, Bell had six
birdies. Her only bogey came when she landed in the lip of a bunker
on No. 16 and two-putted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The course played a lot longer than it did in the pro-am and
practice rounds,'' Bell said. ''The advantage was that the greens
held. You could really fire at the pins.''
</P>
<P>
   In a group at 69 were Brandie Burton, Jill McGill, Cristie Kerr,
Mhairi McKay and Carin Koch, who finished second in the 1998 Longs
Drugs Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Juli Inkster and Se Ri Pak both shot 70s.
</P>
<P>
   Annika Sorenstam rallied after playing the front side one over.
She recorded her first birdie at No. 10 and rolled in a 25-foot
putt on the par-5 12th for an eagle. She finished with a 71.
</P>
<P>
Divots: Sorenstam and her caddy had to chase a turkey off the 10th
green prior to a long birdie putt. ''It was a lucky turkey, I wish
I hadn't scared it away,'' she said. ... Colleen Walker injured her
hand and dropped out of the tournament after playing eight holes.
... Two Hall of Fame golfers struggled. Pat Bradley had a 76 and
Patty Sheehan shot a 77.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 2, Mariners 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Juan Gonzalez, making his first home start for
Detroit, hit an RBI double to break up a scoreless tie in the
eighth inning as the Tigers held off the Seattle Mariners 2-0 on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who hadn't started since the opener last week in
Oakland because of a right hamstring strain, started at designated
hitter and went 2-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Halter drew a leadoff walk off Arthur Rhodes (0-1) in the
eighth before Gonzalez scored him easily with a drive up the right
field gap.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Higginson followed with a single that moved pinch runner
Karim Garcia to third, and he scored on Dean Palmer's sacrifice
fly.
</P>
<P>
   Hideo Nomo gave up four hits and four walks in six-plus innings.
Doug Brocail (1-1) pitched one scoreless inning of relief before
Todd Jones finished for his third save.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers took two of three games in the first series in
Comerica Park.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo played escape artist throughout his first Comerica Park
start. He got out of a bases-loaded, none-out jam in the sixth en
route. His ERA after three starts is 1.28. But his only decision
was an opening night win, and the Tigers have scored just one run
for him since.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Meche went 6 1-3 shutout innings and was never in nearly as
much trouble as Nomo. Meche allowed six hits with six strikeouts
and two walks.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams squandered several chances, going a combined 0-for-9
with runners in scoring position through seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo gave up a leadoff double to David Bell in the fourth but
struck out Alex Rodriguez and got John Olerud on a popup before
Edgar Martinez grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle loaded the bases with none out in the sixth. But Olerud
flew out to short left and Higginson threw Mark McLemore out trying
to score. After a wild pitch moved runners to second and third,
second baseman Gregg Jefferies made a great play on Martinez's
grounder behind the bag and just threw him out at first.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo exited after a leadoff walk in the seventh, and the
Mariners went on to load the bases with two out before Danny
Patterson got Bell on a grounder to short.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Tigers catcher Brad Ausmus threw out both McLemore and
Rodriguez on attempted steals in the first. ... Neither Nomo nor
Meche had ever faced their respective opponents before Thursday.
... Relievers from both teams did not sit in the outfield bullpens
for the third straight day. They were allowed to warm up in batting
cages behind the dugouts before they were summoned. ... The
game-time temperature was a warmest-of-the-series 49 degrees but
dropped steadily throughout the night. ... Attendance averaged
21,093 the last two nights after 39,168 were on hand for Tuesday's
Comerica Park opener.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Marks Civil War Anniversary  </HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Lebanon on Thursday marked the 25th
anniversary of a civil war that killed 150,000 people, amid
concerns about fighting after Israel withdraws its troops from the
south of the country this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,000 people carried white roses as a symbol of peace in a
demonstration outside parliament in downtown Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   ''The war is a thing of the past. It will never return,'' former
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri told the crowd, which included several
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   The war broke out April 13, 1975 when right-wing Christian
Phalange militiamen ambushed a bus carrying Palestinians in the
Christian suburb of Ein el-Rummaneh, killing 26.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ''bus incident'' quickly plunged the entire
country in a bloody sectarian conflict that lasted 15 years and
caused, according to U.N. estimates, $25 billion worth of
destruction. The war also displaced about half a million people,
many of whom are still waiting for government funds to return to
their home areas.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers marked the anniversary by publishing pictures of the
bullet-riddled bus as a reminder of the incident that has badly
shaken Muslim-Christian coexistence. ''So We Won't Forget,'' said a
headline in the leftist As-Safir newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''Among the factors that prevent a renewal of the war is the
consciousness of the people who have drawn lessons from the war,''
Samir Franjieh, a Christian intellectual said in comments published
by As-Safir.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers published pictures and television stations played
videotapes showing scenes of high-rise buildings going up in flames
as rival Christian and Muslim militias battled with rockets, mortar
shells and machine guns in streets and residential areas on both
sides of Beirut. The fierce fighting left Beirut, a major hub for
tourism, banking and commerce, in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   The downtown area, devastated by fighting, is being rebuilt
under a multibillion dollar reconstruction plan.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-based Human Rights Watch Thursday called on the
Lebanese government to allocate adequate time and resources to
effectively investigate the cases of the missing.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after the civil war ended with a Christian-Muslim
political power-sharing agreement, the armed militias have been
dismantled but the sectarian divisions remain.
</P>
<P>
   While the conflict ended across the country, violence continued
in southern Lebanon, where Israel occupies a strip of territory
with the aim of protecting its own border from guerrilla attacks.
Israel has promised to withdraw its army by July but there are
fears in Lebanon that a pullout without an overall peace agreement
involving Lebanon, Syria and Israel could plunge that region in
fighting.

<HEADLINE> Bengals' Ki-Jana Carter Injured  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Ki-Jana Carter, the Cincinnati running back
who has missed almost half of his NFL career with injuries since
the Bengals selected him first overall in 1995, reinjured the knee
that sidelined him last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before rumors get too far out of hand, let me clear things
up,'' Carter said Thursday on his Web site, which is maintained by
California-based Broadband Sports.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, I injured my knee. But it's certainly not career- or
season-ending like people are saying,'' Carter said. ''I was just
working out, doing some jumping drills, and my kneecap popped out
and then popped back in. I felt numbness throughout my whole leg
and I knew right away what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can walk, but my knee is swollen.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, 26, told the Bengals the injury occurred Tuesday night
near his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was examined Thursday in
Miami by Dr. James Andrews, an orthopedic surgeon from Birmingham,
Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Bengals trainer Paul Sparling said the exam revealed a partially
dislocated kneecap. Carter dislocated the same kneecap in the third
game last season and missed the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he would have arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday and
would miss the Bengals' minicamp but would be ready to play this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''The procedure involves heat shrinkage of the connective tissue
around the kneecap,'' Sparling said. ''The goal is to shrink the
connective tissue so the kneecap does not (dislocate) again.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no guarantee it will be successful, but it gives
Ki-Jana his best chance of being able to play next season. The only
other options are a reconstruction of the knee, which would put him
out for the season, or to rehab without surgery, which leaves the
very real possibility that the injury would occur again.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Penn State star, originally from Westerville, Ohio,
is entering his sixth NFL season. His status could be especially
critical to the Bengals because Corey Dillon, who has rushed for
1,000 yards each of the past three seasons, says he feels
unappreciated and wants to play for another team.
</P>
<P>
   Carter missed his entire rookie season in 1995 with a torn
ligament in his left knee. He played only one game in 1998 because
of a severe wrist fracture. His season ended last year on Sept. 26
at Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ''Granted, things haven't been that fair to me on the playing
field so far, but neither my season nor my career is at all over,''
Carter said.

   ROME (AP) -- Author Giorgio Bassani, best known for his
semi-autobiographical novel ''The Garden of the Finzi-Continis''
and its elegiac depiction of Italian Jews during the rise of
Fascism, died Thursday of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. He
was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Bassani lived much of his life in the provincial town of
Ferrara, and its Jewish life was the wellspring for most of his
literary works.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Garden of the Finzi-Continis,'' published in 1962,
portrays an aristocratic Jewish family whose beautiful estate
serves as a haven -- though a temporary, illusory one -- against a
menacing world. Amid harsh anti-Semitic edicts by dictator Benito
Mussolini that set the stage for the deportation and persecution of
Italy's Jews, the characters live a cloistered and romantic life.
</P>
<P>
   The novel was made into a film by director Vittorio De Sica that
won the Academy Award for best foreign film in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Bassani had been jailed by the Fascists during the war.
</P>
<P>
   He won Italy's prestigious Strega literary award in 1956 for
''Five Stories about Ferrara.''

<P>
   COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Earl English, who was dean of the
University of Missouri School of Journalism from 1951 to 1970, died
Tuesday. He was 95.
</P>
<P>
   The school's graduate studies center was named after English in
September.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, English led an effort by the American Council on
Education for Journalism to accredit journalism schools. He also
was instrumental in raising money for the Freedom of Information
Center, a research and reference library on First Amendment issues.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Ceola, two daughters, a sister, and
four grandchildren.
Ken Peterson:
</P>
<P>
   SANTA FE (AP) -- Ken Peterson, who worked as a artist on Walt
Disney's ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' died March 29 of
cancer. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief attempt at making his own animated motion
pictures, Peterson joined the army of young artists Disney hired in
1936 for ''Snow White,'' the first feature-length animated film.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson headed the art department for many animated films,
including ''Alice in Wonderland,'' ''Lady and the Tramp'' and
''Sleeping Beauty.''
Bob Phillips:
</P>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Bob Phillips, the first assistant Joe
Paterno hired after becoming Penn State's head coach in 1966, died
Wednesday. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips retired as an assistant after the Nittany Lions'
national championship season in 1986. He continued as a volunteer
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips coached the backfield when John Cappelletti won the
1973 Heisman Trophy. He also coached tight ends, receivers, punters
and quarterbacks -- among them Todd Blackledge, who led Penn State
to its first national title in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was named to the Pennsylvania Football Coaches Hall of
Fame in 1993.

<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Bob Tamarkin, a former Chicago Daily News writer
who covered the Vietnam War and later the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, died Tuesday. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   As the Vietnam War ended and Americans were fleeing, Tamarkin
stayed in Saigon to document the chaotic evacuation of the American
Embassy, leaving on the last helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to the United States, he became an expert on
the Mercantile Exchange, making it the subject of three of his
seven books.
</P>
<P>
   Tamarkin also was Midwest bureau chief for Forbes magazine and a
writer for the Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Blazers 93, Spurs 77  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Rasheed Wallace scored 27 points to lead the
Portland Trail Blazers to a 93-77 victory Thursday night over the
San Antonio Spurs, who struggled without an injured Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers shot 56.5 percent from the field for the game,
a season high for a Spurs opponent. Portland amassed a 55-39 lead
by halftime, and added to that edge in the third period. A
3-pointer by Steve Smith put the Blazers ahead 68-47 midway through
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio, trailed 77-59 at the start of the fourth and by
double digits the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan watched from the sidelines, out with a cartilage tear in
his left knee. An MRI exam Thursday detected the tear, from when he
attempted a dunk against Sacramento on Tuesday. He's also listed as
doubtful for Saturday's key Midwest Division showdown against Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan averaged 19 points and seven rebounds in the Spurs'
previous three games against the Blazers this season. In the last
meeting, a Spurs victory on March 28, he had 36 points and 15
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   His injury is a big setback for San Antonio as the defending NBA
champion embarks on the final stretch of the regular season with
hopes of improving its playoff position to gain home-court
advantage in the first round. San Antonio is fifth in the Western
Conference, 1{ games behind the fourth-place Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Samaki Walker started in place of Duncan, scoring 13 points and
grabbing 10 rebounds before leaving with a dislocated finger in the
fourth quarter. David Robinson led the Spurs with 16 points and
added nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Grant and Arvydas Sabonis scored 13 points apiece for
Portland, while Damon Stoudamire had 11.
</P>
<P>
   Portland led 25-20 at the end of first quarter and its halftime
edge was bolstered by Wallace's 17 points and 67.6 percent
shooting.
Notes: Wallace picked up a technical foul with 26 seconds left to
play in the second quarter. That boosted his single-season-record
total to 37 technicals. ... Sean Elliott suffered slight sprains in
both ankles in the first half, but returned to play in the third
quarter. ... The Spurs shot 43 percent from the field. ... Portland
won three of the four meetings between the two teams this season.

<HEADLINE> Wizards 109, Bulls 103  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Michael Jordan would have enjoyed watching this
one.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hamilton scored a career-high 26 points, including 11 of
Washington's last 13 points, as the Wizards, Jordan's new team,
beat the Chicago Bulls, his old team, 109-103 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Four other Wizards were in double figures, including Mitch
Richmond, who was 4-of-5 from 3-point range and had 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   The loss spoiled an outstanding night for rookie Elton Brand,
who scored a career-high 44 points and grabbed 12 rebounds in
becoming the first Bull to score 40 points since Jordan had 44 on
April 18, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Brand made 14 consecutive shots to set a team record, breaking
Clem Haskins' mark of 11 in a row on Feb. 15, 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Brand's previous career high was 38 on Feb. 24 at Indiana. His
high at Duke was 33 points against Virginia on Jan. 10, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan wasn't at the United Center for the Wizards first game in
Chicago since he became a part-owner and president of basketball
operations. He -- and just about every other general manager in the
NBA -- was in Arizona for the Phoenix Desert Classic, a pre-draft
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has yet to attend an NBA game at the United Center since
his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan would have been pleased with his team's effort. The
Wizards made their first four shots of the game and never trailed,
though the Bulls made things interesting at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard King's two free throws with a second left in the third
quarter gave Washington an 88-80 lead. But Chris Anstey opened the
fourth with a short jumper, and Hersey Hawkins and Brand followed
with jumpers to cut the lead to 88-86 with 9:03 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Whitney, who finished with 17, beat the shot clock with a
3-pointer, and the Wizards were back up 93-88 with 7:31 left. But
B.J. Armstrong hit a short jumper and Hawkins stole a bad pass to
Tracy Murray and hustled for the easy layup to bring the Bulls
within 93-92 with 6:34 left.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney came right back with another 3, and the Bulls could not
get closer than two points again.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Bulls outshot the Wizards (52 percent to 48 percent),
they could never overcome falling behind at the start. Washington
also outrebounded the Bulls 38-34, grabbing 17 offensive boards.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards also made the most of their free throws, going
21-of-26 from the line.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Brand's eight field goals in the second quarter tied a
United Center record. ... Rookie Ron Artest, who sprained his ankle
Tuesday night, was on the bench in street clothes Thursday and
Bulls coach Tim Floyd said he's doubtful for Friday's game at
Boston. ... The Bulls scored 50 points in the paint. ... The
Wizards' largest lead was 11.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 5, Rangers 1  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER, AP Baseball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Orlando Hernandez shut down Texas on three
singles for eight innings and Jorge Posada hit a tiebreaking triple
with the bases loaded, leading the New York Yankees past the
Rangers 5-1 on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who have won nine straight playoff games against
Texas on their way to three World Series titles since 1996,
completed a two-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   New York made it a rough homecoming for Kenny Rogers, who gave
up eight hits in Texas' first complete game this year. Back at
Yankee Stadium for the first time since pitching in pinstripes in
1997, he walked two in the sixth to set up Posada's hit.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez (2-0) gave up a single to Royce Clayton to start the
game, a single by David Segui in the second, a single to Rafael
Palmeiro in the sixth and little else. Two Rangers reached on
errors, and a two-out misplay set up their run.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez showed the same stuff he used to beat Texas 8-0 in
Game 1 of AL division series last year. He struck out four, walked
two and lowered his ERA to 1.13 after three starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanton pitched the ninth for the Yankees, finishing the
combined four-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill, who batted just .190 against left-handers last
season, had three hits off Rogers (1-2).
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill also showed off some nifty footwork, stopping short on a
steal attempt and sneaking his cleat around second baseman Luis
Alicea's swipe tag. Bernie Williams followed with an RBI single for
a 1-0 lead in the first.
</P>
<P>
   While Hernandez was retiring 11 straight batters, Rogers stayed
out of trouble until the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill led off with a single, Williams walked and they moved up
on pinch-hitter Jim Leyritz's grounder. Rogers pitched around
Roberto Kelly and walked him, and Posada then hit a line drive
beyond the reach of center fielder Ruben Mateo for a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   With the infield playing in, Shane Spencer singled up the middle
for a 5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   An error by third baseman Alfonso Soriano scored Texas' run in
the second.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Yankees 1B Tino Martinez exited in the sixth with small
abrasions in his left eye, caused by flying dirt during batting
practice. He's expected to be OK for Friday night's game. ... The
Yankees placed LHP Andy Pettitte on the 15-day DL, retroactive to
April 8, because of a strained muscle on the left side of his back.
RHP Darrell Einertson was promoted from Triple-A Columbus for his
first stint in the majors. ... Texas LF Rusty Greer was a late
scratch because of tightness in his left hamstring and Chad Curtis
started in his place. Curtis hit two home runs to win Game 3 of the
World Series last October, and was traded to Texas in December. ...
Rangers 2B Frank Catalanotto, who left Wednesday's game with a
strained left hamstring, did not start and is day-to-day. ...
Rogers was 18-15 for the Yankees in 1996-97. ... Both teams made
two errors in the 44-degree chill. ... Cuban defector Adrian
Hernandez, who said last week he signed a four-year contract with
the Yankees, pitched a simulated game at the Yankees' minor league
camp in Tampa, Fla. ... New York moved into sole possession of
first place in the AL East.

<HEADLINE> Peruvians Celebrate Runoff  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Opposition activists were jubilant Thursday
after forcing a second round in Peru's presidential elections, but
experts warned that supporters of President Alberto Fujimori would
step up a campaign of dirty tricks and electoral fraud to hold on
to power.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, 61, known as ''The Emperor'' for his bulldozer style
of governing, fell a hair short of the majority he needed and will
face upstart challenger Alejandro Toledo, 54, an international
economist who once worked as a shoeshine boy to help out his
impoverished family.
</P>
<P>
   In an exclusive interview with The Associated Press Thursday
night, his first since the election, Fujimori said he was confident
he would win the run-off and denied the government had any
intention of sabotaging Toledo's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He said it has become a habit for opponents to blame him or his
military intelligence service for ''every problem that Peru has.''
</P>
<P>
   At ease and extremely self-assured, he seemed to ignore
completely the unflattering chants of anti-Fujimori protesters who
were demonstrating outside his office in the Plaza de Armas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm satisfied with the final tally, which gave me 49.9 percent
after 10 years governing a country with complicated problems,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But experts anticipate a second round even more tainted by
election abuses than the first round of voting.
</P>
<P>
   The runoff would bring ''more of the same or worse,'' said
political analyst Fernando Tuesta. ''It's going to be 'us or them.'
Either you're with Fujimori or you're his enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   With 97.68 percent of the ballots tallied, Fujimori had 49.84
percent compared to 40.31 percent for his challenger. Seven other
candidates split the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism of the election's fairness within and outside Peru
was so strong that if Fujimori had won a third five-year term
outright, his government would most likely have become an
international pariah and a source of instability in the region,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What the government has done yesterday is not to add up votes.
It has been a political decision to accept a second round,'' said
Rafael Roncagliolo, director of Transparencia, a private citizens'
group.
</P>
<P>
   Roncagliolo, whose organization monitored an unofficial vote
count that showed Fujimori would be forced into a runoff, said the
election tally announced Wednesday night was forced on the
government by the close scrutiny from foreign governments and
monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Stein, head of a team of monitors from the Organization
of American States, complained Thursday that Fujimori's government
was still dragging its feet in the investigation of charges that
his campaign forged more than 1 million signatures to register his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is only going to accumulate and augment the groundswell
of mistrust we saw in the first count,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But like other monitors, Stein said the announcement late
Wednesday that a runoff would take place had ended the threat of
social violence by anti-Fujimori activists.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tremendous tension that had been accumulating in the last
three days began to weaken last night,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For three days Toledo's supporters had demonstrated by the tens
of thousands in Peru's major cities. The former World Bank official
had warned that the mostly peaceful marches and rallies could turn
violent if Fujimori claimed victory.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's ombudsman, Jorge Santistevan, a sharp critic of the
government's campaign abuses, also expressed relief that there
would be a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we would like to define now is how this second round can
be better and, if possible, just the opposite of the first,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, opposition candidates accused Fujimori's
military intelligence service of using rock-throwing thugs to
disrupt political rallies, sponsoring lurid tabloid newspaper
attacks and blocking access to largely state-controlled television
and radio.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to Sunday's vote, Toledo was the target
of a smear campaign that accused him of everything from shunning an
illegitimate daughter to being an architect of a financial pyramid
scheme that impoverished thousands of Peruvians in the early 1990s.
He has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Toledo urged Fujimori to run a clean runoff
election.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the second round we demand substantially different
conditions to compete than in the first round,'' he said. ''The
international community is watching. The nation is watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, who has defended the first round of voting as fair and
clean, has made no public response since election officials
announced the runoff.

<HEADLINE> Senate Reaches Deal on Africa Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate leaders broke a long logjam
over Africa trade legislation Thursday night, tentatively agreeing
to compromise legislation that would give new trade benefits to
Africa, Central America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which had passed both chambers but in significantly
different forms, has been subject to intense negotiations since
last November.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative deal, which still must be approved formally by
negotiators from each chamber, was hammered out in a private
meeting among top House and Senate leaders, including Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., and trade leaders from both chambers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The speaker believes this is a good deal for the American
consumer,'' said John Feehery, a spokesman for Hastert. He said the
speaker hoped the compromise measure could be brought up after
Congress returns from its spring recess.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the deal were sketchy, but those close to the
negotiations said House leaders agreed to accept a more expansive
Senate version in terms of countries covered.
</P>
<P>
   The House-passed bill only dealt with the 48 countries of
sub-Saharan Africa. The Senate bill -- and now the compromise --
covers these nations, plus 24 Caribbean-Central American nations as
well.
</P>
<P>
   In another compromise, House leaders agreed to go along with
some restrictions on the volume of goods to receive duty-free
treatment while Senate leaders agreed to lower restrictions than in
the original Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the House bill would have given items of clothing
and other textile products from the covered countries duty-free
access to U.S. markets, while the Senate bill would have limited
duty-free imports to 1{ percent of all similar U.S. imports, rising
to 3 percent over six years.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise would allow duty-free imports to rise from 1{
percent to 3{ percent of all U.S. imports over six years, according
to congressional officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders, meanwhile, said they would drop a Senate-passed
requirement that African-assembled apparel use U.S. fabric and
thread, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the poorest countries in Africa would be eligible
for duty-free treatment in U.S. markets with no restrictions for
four years, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   T-shirts manufactured in Caribbean and Central American
countries would be subject to some restrictions not applied to
other apparel, however, in a nod to U.S. textile manufacturers, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreement had the support of key Democrats,
including Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Rep. Charles Rangel,
both of New York. Moynihan is the senior Democrat on the Senate
Finance Committee and Rangel the senior Democrat on the House Ways
and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good tentative agreement. Congressman Rangel was
confident that what was outlined will pass both houses,'' said
Rangel spokesman Dan Maffei.
</P>
<P>
   If enacted, it will be the first major trade bill approved since
1994, when Congress agreed to U.S. participation in the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has made the Africa bill a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   However, administration officials and congressional leaders
hoped to be able to deal with the measure before taking up an even
more contentious trade bill later in the spring, extending
permanent trade benefits to China to help ease the way for China's
entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would lower or eliminate tariffs and quotas on
products from the regions covered as well as making it easier for
American businesses to invest.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has been opposed by senators from textile
states, who contended it would harm America's garment industry, and
by labor and environmental groups that said it failed to set
standards for protecting workers and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 434.

<HEADLINE> Bolivian Congress Upholds Decree  </HEADLINE>
By PETER McFARREN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- Government negotiators reached agreement
Thursday with protesting farmers to lift remaining barricades in
exchange for the freedom of activists being held in a remote
Bolivian town.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Walter Guiteras said Thursday the deal had
been struck with Pedro Vilca, one of the leaders of the National
Farmers Confederation, to end nationwide protests after the
government releases the detainees -- including the group's top
leadership -- being held in the town of San Joaquin.
</P>
<P>
   Guiteras said he expected the release to occur sometime Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is one more step in calming eight days of
protests, roadblocks and violent confrontations that led Bolivia on
Saturday to suspend constitutional guarantees. On Thursday,
Bolivia's Congress upheld the decree.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ''state of siege'' order declared Saturday by
President Hugo Banzer, police can detain people without a warrant,
restrict travel and political activity and establish curfews.
Congress authorized the measure after a heated all-night session,
with opposition legislators condemning the government's repression
of protests.
</P>
<P>
   Banzer, a retired general and former dictator turned democrat,
said the measure was necessary because the protests were
threatening government stability.
</P>
<P>
   The decree is in force for 90 days. If Congress had rejected it,
the state of siege would have ended immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere Thursday, shops, businesses and schools reopened in
Cochabamba, the city where the protests first broke out, while a
nationwide strike to protest the state of siege fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   La Paz was calm Thursday after several hundred students clashed
with police for several hours on Wednesday. Some two thousands
buses and trucks that had been stranded around the country by
peasant-erected roadblocks began moving Wednesday. Only scattered
roadblocks remained in areas near La Paz.
</P>
<P>
   The government admitted that while the water rate hike sparked
the protests, the dire economy made them grow and spread.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economic crisis Bolivia and the region has been going
through no doubt contributed to the problems here,'' Information
Minister Ronald MacLean told The Associated Press. ''When a crisis
hits us we do not have a cushion to absorb its impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide protests eased after the government reached
agreement with organizers late Monday to reject the water rate
hikes. Under the agreement, the government canceled a contract for
a water expansion project and revised a water law to end fees for
rural well water.

<HEADLINE> Explosion Kills Soldier in Hawaii  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHOFIELD BARRACKS, Hawaii (AP) -- An explosion during a training
exercise killed one soldier and injured four others, Army officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The group was learning how to use an explosive device to cut
through concertina wire on an obstacle course at the Pohakuloa
Training Area on the island of Hawaii on Wednesday night, said Maj.
Stan Heath, a public affairs officer.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have not determined whether the device misfired or
whether another problem caused the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise involved 700 soldiers from the Army's 25th Infantry
Division, which is based at Schofield Barracks on the island of
Oahu.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the victim and the injured soldiers were withheld.
One of those injured has been released and the three who remain
hospitalized were expected to be released Friday, Heath said.
</P>
<P>
   Pohakuloa is located between the Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea
volcanoes and has been used for training since the 1940s.

<HEADLINE> From far north, Cuban exiles support Elian  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNION CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Residents of the nation's largest Cuban
community outside of Miami said Thursday the Miami family of Elian
Gonzalez should fight ''as long as possible'' to keep him in
America.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am nobody. I can't decide that, but I want him to remain in
the United States,'' said Rafael Rodriguez, 71.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez and other Cuban-Americans drank espresso in the Union
City Cafeteria while they watched Spanish-language television
coverage of the saga.
</P>
<P>
   Some called Attorney General Janet Reno ''a monster'' and ''a
sick woman'' for ordering Elian's uncle to turn the boy over to his
father, who wants to return with him to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Alonzo compared the government's plan to take Elian from
Miami to the capture of Anne Frank by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ''He would not be killed immediately, but he would be subjected
to brainwashing'' once he is returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   One sign posted on the street called President Clinton a traitor
for his administration's handling of the case. Another showed a
picture of Elian and the message ''Castro was able to kill my
mother but not me. I want to live in freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans here said Elian's Miami relatives should only
let the boy be taken from them by force.
</P>
<P>
   Many said they doubted the sincerity of Elian's father, saying
he is being controlled by the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no father in Cuba. The only father is the
government,'' Alonzo said. ''Castro is his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve-year-old Manny Hernandez said he thought Elian and his
father should both stay in the United States. If that can't happen,
he said, ''They should fight as long as possible to keep him.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,200 miles north of Miami, the fate of the 6-year-old
Cuban boy is evoking the same emotions and painful memories.
</P>
<P>
   ''The community here is as united and as militant,'' vowed
Remberto Perez, the regional director of the Cuban American
National Foundation. He said Cuban exiles in New Jersey would have
supported Elian as forcefully as the Miami protesters, who have
threatened to put their bodies between the boy and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Abel Hernandez Jr., 35, wasn't so sure, saying the Cuban
population in New Jersey is older, more spread out and has fewer
stories of treacherous trips to America.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have that power, that feeling,'' said Hernandez, of
North Bergen. ''There's some people (in Miami) who have gone on
rafts and stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 150,000 Cuban-Americans -- less than one-third of
Miami's Cuban population -- are living in Hudson County, especially
in Union City, West New York, and North Bergen, gritty,
working-class cities lined up side by side across the Hudson River
from midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Rodriguez is credited with creating the community,
becoming the first Cuban immigrant to arrive in the late 1940s from
Fomento, Cuba, after he met an Italian-American in Miami and
followed him to North Bergen.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans began to dominate towns that had once provided
blue-collar manufacturing jobs for Germans and Italians, he said,
taking jobs in northern New Jersey's embroidery industry, opening
restaurants and clothing stores.
</P>
<P>
   Their numbers have diminished in the cities over the years,
however, as many moved to outer suburbs. Union City now has a 25
percent Cuban population, but it remains the political and cultural
center of the community.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Address Indian Concerns  </HEADLINE>
CLAUDE R. MARX
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton promised Thursday night to
use the rest of his time in office and his post-presidential years
to do even more to improve the lives of American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   He told Indian donors to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee that starting next year -- when ''I have more time to work
on fewer things'' -- he would undertake projects relating to
economic development, health care and education.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the New Market Initiative, which would encourage
investment in economically struggling areas, was an important part
of his efforts to achieve these goals.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is currently pending before several congressional
committees. House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has endorsed
key provisions of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe in the potential of all people. I believe that
intelligence is equally apportioned among all races, but
opportunity isn't,'' Clinton told guests at a $10,000-a-person
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton again apologized for earlier government policies that
hurt Indians and caused the government to ''run from our own
responsibility'' to improve their health and welfare.
</P>
<P>
   In a later speech to another committee fund-raiser, he said
Congress should use ''this magic moment of possibility'' to ensure
that the current economic recovery continues.
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated his concern that Republican proposed tax cuts
would cause a return to era of big deficits. He said ''sensible''
cuts, combined with plans to protect Medicare and Social Security
would keep the current recovery going.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Group Accepts Donation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- A group raising money to build a new library at
Columbine High School said Thursday it will accept a stock donation
from a strip club owner that could be worth several hundred
thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Club owner Troy Lowrie had offered Healing of People Everywhere
600,000 shares of stock in an outdoor advertising company earlier
this month. HOPE didn't immediately accept.
</P>
<P>
   But members decided at a meeting this week to accept Lowrie's
donation toward the $3.1 million needed to tear down the old
library at Columbine and to build a new library and atrium.
</P>
<P>
   The library was the scene of the worst damage last April 20 when
two teen-agers shot and killed 12 students and a teacher before
killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   HOPE said it would accept the gift because Lowrie offered it
''from the heart.'' In a written statement, HOPE said it would not
block anyone who wants to help Columbine heal.
</P>
<P>
   Lowrie, 35, owns PT's, PT's Gold and All Stars clubs in
metropolitan Denver and seven strip clubs in other states. He
agreed to donate the stock at the request of Angela Sanders, 23, a
dancer at PT's Gold whose father, Dave Sanders, was the teacher
killed at Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   The stock is from New Millennium Media International Inc., a
Florida outdoor advertising company in which Lowrie has a 9 percent
interest. The value of the donation depends on the stock price when
it is sold.
</P>
<P>
   When Lowrie made the offer earlier this month, he said he hoped
his business dealings would not stop the group from accepting.
</P>
<P>
   ''This money is from a media company that is not related to the
adult industry. I hope they wouldn't turn it down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not immediately return a phone call Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Muzzle Awards Given Out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- The Clinton administration, New York
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Texas Gov. George W. Bush's
presidential campaign on Thursday received Jefferson Muzzles,
tongue-in-cheek awards given by a free-speech watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   The Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free
Expression awards the Muzzles annually to those who, in the opinion
of the center's board, are guilty of censorship.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush citation stems from a complaint his campaign filed last
April with the Federal Election Commission about a Web site that
satirized Bush's official site. The campaign claims computer
consultant Zack Exley should adhere to rules governing political
action committees because his Web site advocated Bush's defeat. The
FEC has not ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration received a Muzzle for continuing its
''Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy on gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who last year became the first recipient of a Lifetime
Muzzle, was on the list for the third time for trying to withdraw
city funding from the Brooklyn Museum because he was offended by
the contents of an exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Muzzles also were awarded to:
</P>
<P>
   --CBS News for electronically making a NBC billboard in Times
Square appear to be a CBS billboard in its coverage of New Year's
Eve festivities.
</P>
<P>
   --The Virginia General Assembly for prohibiting the use of a
Confederate battle flag logo on the Sons of Confederate Veterans'
specialty license plates.
</P>
<P>
   --Lorain County, Ohio, prosecutor Gregory White for bringing
criminal charges against a woman who photographed her 8-year-old
daughter taking a bath.
</P>
<P>
   --Midland, Texas, school officials for barring a student from
graduation ceremonies because the student and some friends took an
off-campus picture that embarrassed the principal.
</P>
<P>
   --Ponder, Texas, school officials for calling the sheriff after a
seventh-grader turned in a class-assigned horror story that school
officials considered threatening because it named other students.
</P>
<P>
   --The Federal Bureau of Investigation for opposing a filmmaker's
attempt to post on the Internet a fictional film suggesting the
government might seek to foment a Y2K riot at Times Square on New
Year's Eve.

<HEADLINE> Eleven Charged for Staging Crashes  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK BARTELS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Eleven people were charged Thursday
with staging car crashes to collect insurance money, including some
suspects who used their children to help fake the crashes, state
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Children as young as 7 years old were used as passengers and
trained to act injured after the crashes, said Clay Simpson, a
staff attorney for the state Insurance Department.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, four members of the ring staged crashes in
which they caused accidents that made it look as if the other
driver was at fault, Simpson said.
</P>
<P>
   The supposed ''victims'' would then settle with insurance
companies, Simpson said. Having a child or two in the crashes added
credibility that would help convince the companies that the
collisions were genuine accidents.
</P>
<P>
   But one suspect added a little realism, Simpson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the suspects physically struck one of the small
children in the head so he would have an injury ... and be able to
go to the hospital,'' Simpson said.
</P>
<P>
   An undercover Fort Smith police officer infiltrated the ring,
and Simpson said investigators, aided by the FBI, recorded audio
and video tape of the suspects bragging about collecting insurance
money.
</P>
<P>
   They face a variety of charges, including insurance fraud, theft
by deception and endangering the welfare of a minor, according to
the Insurance Department.

<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Steve Francis had 16 points, 11 rebounds and
seven assists to lead the Houston Rockets to their fifth straight
win, 111-102 over the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Williams led Houston with 21 points before being ejected
after a fourth-quarter fight with Shawn Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Cuttino Mobley contributed 20 points and Moochie Norris 19 for
the Rockets, who have won nine of 12 games. Their five-game string
is the longest current winning streak in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas saw its own five-game roll end.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Finley led Dallas with 35 points, followed by Dirk
Nowitzki with 15 and Erick Strickland with 14.
</P>
<P>
   Houston moved ahead 85-81 after a 3-pointer by Norris with 9:17
left. The Mavericks then scored seven straight to lead 88-85 with
7:39 remaining. Houston went back in front, leading 98-93 with 4:28
left, before Dallas moved to within 99-97 with 2:59 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets outscored the Mavericks 12-5 after that, with
Francis sinking a 3-pointer with 57 seconds left to give Houston a
107-99 lead that wouldn't be threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Bradley were ejected with 4:02 left, when Bradley
elbowed Williams in the head after Williams fouled Bradley on a
rebound. Williams then retaliated by punching Bradley in the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing 57-47 with 10:39 left in the third quarter, the
Mavericks chipped away at the Houston lead to get within 77-75
going into the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Houston forged a 16-10 lead with 4:07 left in the first period
after four straight points by Kenny Thomas. Dallas cut its deficit
to 23-22 going into the second quarter after Finley contributed 13
first-period points.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas led 29-25 early in the second period, before Houston
scored nine straight to lead 34-29 with 6:50 left in the half. The
Mavericks tied the score 38-38 after a 3-pointer by Finley with
3:23 left in the half. The Rockets then outscored the Mavericks
14-4 to lead 52-42 at the half.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Charles Barkley announced Thursday he plans to play in
Houston's final game of the season, at home against the Vancouver
Grizzlies next Wednesday. Barkley retired in December after
rupturing a tendon in his left leg in a game against Philadelphia.
... Mobley leads all reserves with 21 games of 20 or more points.
... Houston is 9-2 with the starting lineup of Francis, Shandon
Anderson, Williams, Thomas and Kelvin Cato. ... With one more
victory, the Mavericks (36-42) will win their most games since
1989-90, when they won 47.

<HEADLINE> Japan Cable Operators Talk Merger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Jupiter Telecommunications Co., Japan's largest
cable-TV operator, is in talks with Titus Communications Corp., a
Japanese subsidiary of Microsoft Corp., about a possible merger,
both companies said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported Friday that Jupiter and Titus
plan to merge around July. They would have a combined subscriber
base of 660,000 subscribers across Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Keiko Morita, spokeswoman for Tokyo-based Jupiter, said talks
are under way between the two companies. ''But nothing has been
decided,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Titus spokesman Yoichi Hiraoka confirmed talks were continuing
but refused to give details.
</P>
<P>
   Both Jupiter and Titus now offer broadcasting and flat-rate,
high-speed Internet access and telephone services in major cities
across Japan.
</P>
<P>
   If combined, the new company would challenge the domination of
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. in communication services in
Japan, the Nihon Keizai report said.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter is owned 60 percent by Sumitomo Corp., a major Japanese
trading company. The remaining 40 percent interest is owned by
Liberty Media Corp., a subsidiary of AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, U.S. computer software giant Microsoft
acquired a 60 percent stake in Titus. Titus is 20 percent owned by
Itochu Corp., a major trading company, and another 20 percent by
electronics maker Toshiba Corp.

<HEADLINE> Det. Police See Links To Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH ALTMAN Jr., Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- A man suspected of going from port to port
strangling women while in the Navy might have begun killing eight
years ago, and his victim total could reach 20, police said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   John Eric Armstrong, 26, is accused of killing five Detroit area
prostitutes and is suspected in at least 11 other slayings since
1992: three in the Seattle area, two in Hawaii, two in Hong Kong
and one each in North Carolina, Virginia, Thailand and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit Assistant Police Chief Marvin Winkler said victims may
total 18 to 20 worldwide, including prostitute strangulations in
Japan, Korea and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, he told us he either killed, or tried to kill,
every prostitute he'd ever had sex with,'' Winkler told The Detroit
News for its Friday editions. ''He expressed remorse several times,
and was crying like a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the cities are ports of call for the USS Nimitz, on
which police say Armstrong served for about eight years as a
fueler.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the investigation keeps going on, bodies keep popping up.
The numbers keep increasing,'' Officer Octaveious Miles said.
''There is a similar pattern that ties them all together that
creates a trail.''
</P>
<P>
   All the victims were women who were strangled, except one, a man
killed in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler said the first slaying that police think is linked to
Armstrong occurred in North Carolina in 1992. Armstrong is
originally from New Bern, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Police there said he has no criminal record and was not under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was arrested early Wednesday in an area of Detroit
frequented by prostitutes. Police have been questioning him without
an attorney present. He's cooperating and hasn't asked for a
lawyer, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's wife was questioned but uncooperative, Winkler said.
The couple has a baby boy; he is with his mother, whose whereabouts
Thursday were unknown, Winkler added.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne County Assistant Prosecutor Robert Agacinski said
Armstrong would be charged and arraigned Friday on five counts of
premeditated murder and three counts of assault with intent to
murder. The murder charges carry mandatory sentences of life in
prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy began investigating after receiving a call from the FBI
on Wednesday, Navy Lt. Cmdr. Larry Thomas said. He said they are
still trying to confirm the suspect's identity and whether he was
actually enlisted.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he could not say whether the slayings in ports of
call coincided with times the Nimitz was docked there.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect moved eight months ago to Dearborn Heights and has
worked for the past month at Detroit Metropolitan Airport as an
aircraft refueler.

Bush Meets Gay Republicans

   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush met with a dozen gay Republicans

presumptive GOP presidential nominee assured conservatives his social views were
intact, his opposition to ideas such as gay marriage unshaken by the hourlong
session at his campaign headquarters. The gays he met with, selected by his
campaign, were upbeat. ''The goal was not to change his mind. It was to start a
conversation,'' said Steve Gunderson, a former Republican congressman from

Clinton Won't Ask For Pardon

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton heatedly said Thursday ''I'm not
ashamed'' about being impeached and ''I'm not interested'' in being pardoned for
any alleged crimes in the Monica Lewinsky scandal and Whitewater investigation.
But Clinton did not say whether he would accept a pardon if it were offered by
his successor. Republicans immediately pounced on his failure to answer the
question. ''The answer is I have no interest in it. I wouldn't ask for it. I
don't think it would be necessary,'' the president told the convention of the
American Society of Newspaper Editors.

that have taken his country to war. ''If some are engaged in the business of
spreading untruths in vain efforts to find a scapegoat, we would prefer to focus
all our attention on saving lives,'' Meles told reporters in the Ethiopian
capital, Addis Ababa.
