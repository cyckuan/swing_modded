<HEADLINE> Study: One 10th TB Cases Resists Common Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- About one in 10 new cases of
tuberculosis worldwide is resistant to at least one of the common
drugs used to treat the disease, according to a new survey.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by four health agencies from 1994 to
1997. Tuberculosis bacteria were sampled in 35 countries, or
regions of countries.
</P>
<P>
TB may soon become difficult or impossible to treat, The
Washington Post said today, quoting Sally A. Shelton-Colby, an
official of the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID).
</P>
<P>
"If tuberculosis were a new disease, the world would spare no
expense to fight it," said Arata Kochi, director of TB programs
for the World Health Organization (WHO), which helped organize
the study. "Now, while we have been looking the other way..., the
germ has mutated into drug-resistant strains, making itself a more
difficult and deadly enemy to combat."
</P>
<P>
Tuberculosis is the most common serious infectious disease in
the world. About 7 million new cases, and slightly more than 2
million deaths, occur each year, the Post report said.
</P>
<P>
The study found that in Latvia, 34 percent of new cases are
resistant to at least one drug, and 14 percent are resistant to
the drugs isoniazid and rifampin. In Thailand, the resistance is
37 percent and 4 percent, respectively. And in the Dominican
Republic, it is 41 percent and 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Drug-resistant strains of the bacterium almost always arise
from strains that were survived incomplete or inadequate courses
of therapy. The survey found that among TB patients who had
undergone some treatment, the prevalence of drug-resistant
bacteria was 36 percent.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Delegate Makes Speech at UNESCO Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- China always attaches importance
to its relations with the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and wishes to continue and
develop its long-term amicable cooperation with the organization
under condition of no obstacles, said a senior Chinese official
here today.
</P>
<P>
Wei Yu, vice president of the State Education Commission of
China and head of the Chinese delegation to the 29th session of
UNESCO General Conference being held in Paris, said that the major
responsibility of UNESCO is to advance the undertakings of
education, science, culture and communication among its member
states.
</P>
<P>
She said that UNESCO must respect the sovereignty of its member
states and the principle of cultural diversity in all its
activities, and should concentrate its efforts to promoting
international intellectual cooperation in its fields of competence
rather than acting beyond its fields of competence.
</P>
<P>
She said that considering the situation of education
development in many developing countries, UNESCO has to step up
its efforts in the field of education.
</P>
<P>
"UNESCO, an organization in which education is one of its most
important fields, should make even greater efforts in this
regard," she said.
</P>
<P>
She suggested that UNESCO lay more emphasis on assisting
developing countries in implementing urgently needed education
projects, such as making rural education better serve economic and
social development and thus giving fresh impetus to education
development in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Chinese government will persist in its policy
under which economic growth should be based on giving priority to
educational development and thus improving the quality of people
and have as its driving force the advancement of science and
technology, and make more efforts to achieve integral progress of
all social services.

<HEADLINE> Water Level No Threat After Damming of Yangtze: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, October 23(Xinhua) -- The locking of the Yangtze
mainstream in November 8 will not result in a surge in its water
level, said a Chinese water conservation expert here today.
</P>
<P>
"The water level may rise only four meters even in floods that
statistically occurs once every 20 years, and will remain so until
the end of the century when the first installed generating unit
produces electric power," said the expert with the China Yangtze
River Three Gorges Project Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The river-locking in early November may lift the water level of
Yangtze by only less than one meter during dry season, from the
past 66 to 69 meters, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The water level plan for this world's biggest water control
project is in line with the three-phase construction process, he
explained, therefore the river-blocking in the coming November
will bring the water level of the reservoir behind the dam up to
82.28 meters, which will then rise to 135 meters in 2003, and 175
meters when the projects completes in 2009.
</P>
<P>
The expert continued to say that the blocking of Yangtze
mainstream will have no effect on the scenes of the Three Gorges,
which stand about 1,000 meters above the sea level.
</P>
<P>
"All the scenic spots of the Three Gorges will remain intact
until the end of the second phase construction work in 2003," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"And the rising water level will produce no negative effects on
the navigation on Yangtze after the locking of the Yangtze
mainstream," said the expert.
</P>
<P>
When the mainstream is cut off by two cofferdams in November
and changes its course, the ships will still be able to sail on a
diversion channel or through a temporary shiplock till 2003, he
added, and as of 2003, the world's biggest shiplock will go into
operation.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the project may even improve the navigation
conditions since a rise in river water level will submerge more
than 100 shoals, and the vessels will then sail on a deeper and
wider Yangtze River, he explained.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Urged to Improve Export Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's trade promotion body
Zimtrade said today the country's export and business environment
remained unattractive during the year ended June 30, 1997 due to
a lack of new export incentives to stimulate business activities.
</P>
<P>
''Zimtrade has made frequent recommendations on fiscal and
monetary policy issues which we felt are necessary if the country
is to restore macro-economic stability," Zimtrade's Chairman
Paddy Zhanda said in his report for the period.
</P>
<P>
He added, "Such suggestions, if accepted, would significantly
improve the trading and general business environment,''
</P>
<P>
The recommendations included calls to improve the
administration and efficiency in the tax system, to take trade
and other types of financing easily available and accessible at
reasonable cost and to redress the budget deficit and problems
related to it.
</P>
<P>
''To improve the trading environment and broaden the tax
base,'' Zhanda said, ''Zimtrade recommended that the value added
tax (vat) system be adopted to replace the existing sales tax
system.
</P>
<P>
''The government is, therefore, urged to involve the business
sector in the design of the vat system, followed by a thorough
educational campaign on all aspects of implementing the new
system,'' Zhanda said.
</P>
<P>
He said the trade promotion body had called for the
restructuring of the tariff regime, improvement of the existing
export incentives and the formulation of an industrial policy
founded on trade efficiency.

<HEADLINE> UK Retail Sales Fall Sharply in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in Britain recorded
its biggest one-month fall for six and a half years last month
after being hit by the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and
unseasonably warm weather.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS), retail volumes fell by 1.9 percent in September,
the biggest decline since April 1991 and much larger than what
economists had expected.
</P>
<P>
Last month's surprise fall slowed the annual growth rate from
August's 5.4 percent to 3.7 percent over the 12 months to
September.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said that sales volumes fell in all categories of
retailing during last month, but household goods stores suffered
the sharpest drop, with monthly sales volumes down 5.6 percent
compared with August.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, clothing and footwear also showed a sharp decline of
2.7 percent due to unusually warm weather.
</P>
<P>
The figures made many analysts predict that interest rates may
stay on hold next month.

<P>
LONDON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Members of the European
parliament (MEPs) today voted to force Britain to change the name
of its product "Milk Chocolate," according to a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
Apart from beef, milk chocolate is the latest British product
to suffer at the hands of Euro-MPs.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the vote, Tory Euro-MPs condemned this as "a major

</P>
<P>
With large majorities of Euro-MPs supporting key amendments
hurting British producers, the use of the term "Milk Chocolate" in
Britain is now under threat.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the vote, Tory consumer policy spokesman Caroline
Jackson warned, "Not only did considerable majorities of Euro-MPs
vote to change the name of British chocolate, they also supported
calls to set up a chocolate tasting center to decide what
chocolate is."

ADDIS ABABA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Sharif Hassan, the
assistant general counsel of the World Bank pointed out today
that the feminization of poverty is a consequence of women's
unequal access to economic opportunities.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 1.3 billion people are living in poverty,
and more than 70 percent of them are female, said Hassan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the East African Conference
on gender and the law at the United Nations Conference Center
here, Hassan called on participants to respect and protect
women's right.
</P>
<P>
He said, at worldwide 77 million girls of primary school age
are not in school, compared with 52 million boys.
</P>
<P>
"Cultural factors, early marriage, pregnancy and household
responsibilities all affect girls' enrollment," he analyzed.
</P>
<P>
Among the world's 900 million illiterate people, women
outnumber men two to one, he said, adding that in many parts of
the developing world, women do not have legal control over the
land they farm, even in female-headed households.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Kebede Taddesse, the Ethiopian minister in charge
of social and administrative sub-sectors in the prime minister's
office, also delivered a speech at the session.
</P>
<P>
He said, "it would be hard to imagine that a truly democratic
political set-up and a sustainable socio-economic system can be
established without the full participation of half the
population, i.e. participation of women.''
</P>
<P>
"Empowering women is thus not only a political agenda but also
an economic need," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
K.Y. Amoako, Executive Secretary of the United Nations
Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), told the session that
women's low status and the discrimination against them is not an
accident in most African countries.
</P>
<P>
"The causes of women's subordination and unequal gender
relations are deeply rooted in history, religion, culture, in
laws and legal systems, in political institutions and social
attitudes," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Amoako called on the meeting to contribute to a rich dialogue
and exchange of experiences, resulting in practical and
implementable options that will improve the lives of women and
men in East Africa, particularly poor women.
</P>
<P>
Anatole G. Tiendrebeogo, Assistant Secretary General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), called for improving African
women's status and taking a close look at the gender issue.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting which is organized jointly by the ECA and
the World Bank is attended by policy makers and gender experts
from East African countries.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Rejects Turkish Security Zone in N. Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today reaffirmed its full
keenness on the integrity of the territories of Iraq in the face
of designs to set up Turkish security zones on northern Iraqi
lands, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Foreign Minister Amr Moussa to
reporters here today in comment on the decision taken by Ankara to
slice off parts of Iraq's northern lands and name them Turkish
security zones.
</P>
<P>
"Anything that jeopardizes the safety of the territories of
Iraq is a matter that Egypt would not condone, sympathize with, or
agree upon," Moussa told the press.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the security zones theory is one that leads to
clashes rather than prevents them. "I do not think this is
something positive," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
But Moussa said Egypt has not yet made any contacts with the
Turkish side over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Turkey said Wednesday that its troops established a secure zone
in northern Iraq in a new bid to seal its borders from attacks by
Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad lost control of the northern Iraqi region after the
Gulf War in 1991. U.S.-led warplanes monitor a no-fly zone to keep
Iraqi troops away from the region, controlled by rival Kurdish
groups.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in Turkey's
southeast have taken advantage of the power vacuum, setting up
bases in northern Iraq to launch cross-border attacks at Turkish
targets.
</P>
<P>
The buffer zone was apparently established following Turkey's
latest military operation in northern Iraq this month in a bid to
wipe out the rebel presence.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwait Investment
Authority (KIA) announced today that it would sell in public
auction 10 million government shares in a domestic company
next month.
</P>
<P>
A KIA statement issued through Kuwait News Agency said that
the shares owned by the Kuwaiti government in the Contracting and
Marine Services Company would be sold through the Kuwait Stock
Exchange at the nominal price of 370 files (1.22 U.S. dollars) per
share.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the proposed auction is part of the
privatization program launched two years ago in the country.
So far the program has raised more than 2 billion U.S.
dollars through selling the government shares in various
companies to public subscription.
</P>
<P>
KIA, the state-owned agency overseeing the privatization
program, owns 37 million shares or 50 percent of the issued
shares of the company. The shares to be put on sale accounts for
27 percent of the shares it owns in the company.
</P>
<P>
The KIA also planned at a future date to put on sale 25
million more shares for public subscription at a suitable
price that will be fixed later, the statement said, adding
that priority would be given to small investors.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's privatization program set out to sell state-owned
stakes in some 62 companies and is due to be completed in
1998.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Red pepper growing
peasants of Meskan-Mareko district in central Ethiopia said
although they have a better red pepper harvest this year,
plummeting price has affected their living conditions.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Ethiopian News Agency today said, the
district produced 72,527 quintals of red pepper on over 6,240
hectares of land this year, compared with 43,680 quintals last
year.
</P>
<P>
Although the output has increased by two-thirds, the peasants
complained loudly about the decline of their price by about a
half.
</P>
<P>
The current price for one quintal of red pepper ranges between
95 and 100 Birr (6.8 Birr equal to one U.S. Dollar) while it used
to sell at 140 to 165 Birr, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The bumper red pepper harvest this year has been made because
more peasants were incorporated into the extension program apart
from the use of fertilizers and the favorable rainfall in,the
area.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, the decrease of selling price of red
pepper will affect more than 97,000 peasants who grow the
vegetable.

<HEADLINE> Israel Hails Ross's Visit as Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 23 (Xinhua) -- In contrary to the
Palestinian assessment, Israel today hailed the visit by
U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross as a success in fully breaking the
deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Israel Radio quoted Israeli officials as
expressing satisfaction that Israeli-Palestinian peace talks had
been resumed on all levels thanks to the intensive mediation
launched by Ross, who concluded today his five-day shuttle
mission.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Ross held several rounds of talks with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat in efforts to
bridge the differences between the sides over advancing the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ross also hosted meetings between Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy and PNA deputy head Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) and
between Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
He also participated in negotiations held on the committee
level to solve disputes mainly over the opening of the Gaza
airport and seaport.
</P>
<P>
The officials also expressed anger over the remarks made by
PNA spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeinah and Information Minister Yasser
Abed Rabbo that there had been no progress in
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations brokered by Ross.
</P>
<P>
Rudeinah even described Ross' mediation as a failure, warning
that the region could erupt into confrontation if the situation
continues.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials were apparently unsatisfied with Ross'
failure to persuade Israel to nail down an agreement on Gaza
airport and seaport, and to stop settlement activities despite
Arafat's promise to resume full security cooperation with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The PNA Cabinet called Wednesday night on the United States to
prepare well for the Levy-Mazen meeting scheduled for next week
in Washington, otherwise the peace process could be severely
harmed.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. government shared Israel's view that the
peace progress is advancing and some important steps forward had
been made during Ross' visit.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said Wednesday
that Ros had narrowed some gaps between the two sides during his
visit. Specifically, there had been progress in talks of the
interim committees on the airport and seaport, as well as the
safe passage between Gaza Strip and West Bank.
</P>
<P>
But he added that there were significant real differences
that remained to be overcome, referring to the disputes over the
security arrangements in the airport and seaport, and the
Israeli rejection to halt its settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said that the Levy-Mazen meeting, to be hosted by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, would examine ways of
moving forward to the final status talks, which will deal with
key issues such as final borders, status of Jerusalem and return
of Palestinian refugees.

ATHENS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos said today that he could not rule out the
possibility of a "major incident" between Greece and Turkey in the
Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the United States was exerting pressure

Addressing a closed-doors meeting of the Greek Parliamentary
Committee for Defense and Foreign Affairs, Tsohatzopoulos
expressed concern over Turkey's "provocative stance" and the
continuous infringements of Greece's flight information region
(FIR) and airspace violations by Turkish warplanes.

<HEADLINE> Cameroon's Biya Won in Presidential Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, Octobe 23 (Xinhua) -- Cameroon's incumbent President
Paul Biya won re-election today with 92.57 percent of the votes
cast on October 12, announced the Supreme Court acting as
Constitutional Council in the country.
</P>
<P>
Biya who won a seven-year term this time has six rivals, all
minor politicians. The three main opposition parties did not put
up any candidates because they decided to boycott the election.
</P>
<P>
The president's nearest rival was Henri Hogbe Nlend of the
Union of Cameroonian Peoples who scored a meager 2.5 percent of
votes cast. Samuel Eboua of the Movement for Democracy and
Progress won 2.44 percent.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon's three main opposition parties which between them
won 56 percent of the vote in the 1992 presidential polls
boycotted the election mainly because of the lack of an
independent watchdog.
</P>
<P>
Although voters were called upon to stay away from the poll,
most of the registered voters honored their civic duties.
</P>
<P>
According to the Supreme Court, 81.35 percent of registered
voters -- 3.4 million out of a possible 4.2 million -- took part
in the poll.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition earlier denounced the poll as rigged and
dismissed similar figures given by officials of the Biya
administration.
</P>
<P>
Biya, 64, took over in 1982 from President Ahmadou Ahidjo and
won 1984 and 1988 elections as sole candidate and 1992
multi-party elections.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon embraced multi-party politics in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The Social Democratic Front, the National Union for Democracy
and Progress and Cameroon Democratic Union all won seats in
Parliamentary election in May.
</P>
<P>
They urged their militants to stage peaceful protests to
coincide with proclamation of results to mark what they called "a
day of shame".

<P>
LUSAKA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambia and Namibia here today
signed two bilateral road and transport agreements to facilitate
trade and free movement of goods and people between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Dawson Lupunga, Zambian
minister of communications and transport, said the agreements
indicate the mutual desire of the two countries in enhancing
their socio-economic relationship.
</P>
<P>
"This occasion marks the forging of even stronger ties between
the peoples of Namibia and Zambia and their two economies," said
Lupunga.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the road transport agreement is in line with
the general spirit of regional integration of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
The SADC, which has 14 members including Zambia and Namibia,
aims to promote regional economic integration toward a fully
developed common market.
</P>
<P>
Lupunga added that ever since the demise of Zambia Airways in
1994 when the national airline reduced its regional routes and
entered liquidation the next year due to heavy financial losses,
newly-formed private airways in Zambia have been unable to
provide services to reciprocate the services provided by Air
Namibia.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that with signing of the agreement, a Zambian airline
and freight operators will take up the challenge to commerce
operations to Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Hampie Plickta, Namibian minister of works, transport and
communication, said on the occasion that the agreements can only
promote bilateral relations between the two neighbors who share a
common border.

<HEADLINE> Houston Voters to Decide on Affirmative Action Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Voters in Houston, Texas,
will decide on November 4 whether to wipe out their affirmative
action programs, something Californians did last year.
</P>
<P>
If the measure passes, Houston will be the first U.S. city to
eliminate affirmative action -- a formal effort to provide
increased employment opportunities for women and ethnic
minorities, to overcome past patterns of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's eyes are on Houston," The Associated Press quoted
Lenoria Walker, who runs the city 's program, as saying. "If
Houston is overtaken, then that will be a trend for the rest of
the state to do the same thing."
</P>
<P>
Houston's program, which began in 1984, requires that 20
percent of city contracts go to women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
The measure to end preferences has received a cooler reception
than the one in California, which passed 55 percent to 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
A poll released on October 2 by the Houston Chronicle and
KHOU-TV said 29 percent of voters want to abolish the program and
56 percent want to keep it or expand it. The rest were undecided.
</P>
<P>
Four of the five leading candidates in this fall's mayoral race
said they would vote against the measure.
</P>
<P>
Legislators in about 20 states have tried to pass similar
measures, said Carl E. Anderson of the American Contract
Compliance Association, a trade organization for affirmative
action officers. Those efforts have failed.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 21 percent of the nearly 1 billion dollars in contracts
Houston gave out in fiscal 1997 were to businesses owned by
non-whites and women, up from 16.4 percent during the previous
decade. The city is 58 percent white, 18 percent black and 21
percent Hispanic.

<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, October 23 (Xinhua)-- Prolonged shootings from light
arms and an outburst of civilian demonstrations from various
parts of the capital Thursday evening greeted the outcome of the
the meeting between the ECOWAS committee of five and
representatives from the military junta in Sierra Leone which
ended in Conakry, Guinea today.
</P>
<P>
When the news reached the capital, crowds chanting the "war is
over, we now have peace" came from spontanous demonstrations with
people holding makeshift placards, some of which reads, " Sierra
Leone has been saved from doom," "no more Alfa jets" and " Kabbah
has made Sierra Leone peaceful again."
</P>
<P>
From state house, guards left their security posts and shook
hands with passers by and Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
combatants stopped their trucks to hug anyone in sight.
</P>
<P>
From the Wilberforce garrison, one of the main military bases
in the country, soldiers dropped their guns to hug and kiss their
collegaues.
</P>
<P>
One soldier said, "I am happy because I can now talk openly to
my collegaues in the Nigerian contigent at Jui. We are no longer
enemies."
</P>
<P>
Residents near Jui reported that many Nigerian soldiers left
their trenches to venture into the open to wave at Sierra Leone
soldiers perched in a hill top some half a mile away.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate reaction from head of state, major
Johnny Paul Koroma to the developments in Guinea but observers
said the open jubilation over the outcome of the talks will
demonstrate to the junta leaders that all Sierra Leoneans were
yearning for peace and to resume normal life which was disrupted
since the May 25 coup.

MAPUTO, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Niassa Province in northern
Mozambique has held a meeting recently to discuss how to
formulate policy and take measures against possible drought
caused by El Nino in the 1997/98 agricultural year, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting attended by agriculture and fishery technical
personnel, non-governmental organizations and humanitarian bodies
decided to launch a publicity campaign to make people familiar
with El Nino and its possible effects and mobilize farmers to
expand area under cultivation and plant anti-drought crops.
</P>
<P>
According to the Mozambique Information Agency, some counties
of Niassa Province, such as Metarica, Nipepe, Maua, Marrupa and
Mecanhelas, might be affected by drought because of their
geographical position.

<HEADLINE> German Army Hit by New Neo-Nazi Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 23 (Xinhua) -- German Defense Minister Volker
Ruehe today issued a statement condemning the neo-Nazi conduct of
some German soldiers which was recorded on a video made by his own
troops.
</P>
<P>
The video reportedly includes scenes depicting anti-Semitic and
anti-American statements, racist slogans and Nazi salutes made by
eight soldiers of Germany's 571st Mountain Infantry battalion.
</P>
<P>
There are also scenes showing burning ovens which are
apparently meant to depict the burning of Jews.
</P>
<P>
The video, reportedly made by members of the battalion three
years ago, was given to the Defense Ministry by the German SAT 1
television network which plans to broadcast it later today.
</P>
<P>
Describing the recorded scenes as "horrible performances,"
Ruehe said he would take swift disciplinary measures and seek
criminal proceedings against the soldiers involved.
</P>
<P>
Members of the same battalion based in the eastern German state
of Saxony gave rise to another scandal in July this year when a
video was aired on television showing seven soldiers carrying out
simulated executions and rapes.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Plunge Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Stocks plunged worldwide today
after a market panic in Hong Kong aggravated fears about
deteriorating business conditions in major Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 177 points in the
first hour of trading, and was down about 207 points at its
lowest after 1:30 pm. It began to rise a bit afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock measures also slid more than 2 percent initially,
and declining issues outnumbered advancers by more than a 5-to-1
margin in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The damage was heavier on overseas markets. Tokyo's Nikkei
stock average fell 3 percent, Frankfurt's DAX index fell 4.7
percent and London's FT-SE 100 fell 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Treasury bonds shot higher, helping cushion the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
The worldwide downturn was triggered by a shocking 10.41
percent tumble by the Hang Seng index of Hong Kong today that
deepened fears about the profits of American companies whose
business is closely linked in the Asian market.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Host Child Care Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
opened a day-long conference on child care today, saying he hoped
it would "spur us on to find ways to help parents -- all parents
-- afford safe, affordable, high quality child care."
</P>
<P>
Clinton joined first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton today in
hosting the first-ever White House Conference on Child Care.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "Too often child care is unaffordable,
inaccessible, and sometimes even unsafe.... And government
assistance meets just about a quarter of the need."
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said, "Child care is
exceedingly important with respect to the health of our economy."
</P>
<P>
He urged more public-private partnerships to provide better
care, claiming it will increase worker productivity of an
estimated 20 million U.S. families with working parents, 8 million
with kids under the age of five.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called the issue "America's next great frontier" and
said that while federal assistance has increased by 70 percent
since 1993, more should be done.
</P>
<P>
Officials acknowledged additional strain is being caused by
last year's welfare reform law, which included only 4 billion
dollars over the next six years for states to help parents forced
into the workplace.
</P>
<P>
Clinton promised to develop a plan by his next State of the
Union speech.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Protests Greek Harassment of Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Ministry today
lodged a protest against the alleged harassment of a Turkish
submarine by a Greek minesweeper in the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
Counselor of the Greek Embassy in Ankara Alexander Couyou was
summoned to the ministry to hear the protest, the Anatolia News
Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Greek minesweeper Monday tried to sail over a Turkish
submarine in the international waters of the Aegean and then
collided with a Turkish patrol boat nearby, causing light damage
to both vessels.
</P>
<P>
The two Turkish warships were conducting routine exercises in
the high seas, the foreign ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Chief of General Staff Ismail Hakki Karadayi also
criticized the provocative action by the Greek minesweeper,
describing it as "a very serious one."
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to refrain from provocations and to transform
the Aegean peaceful waters, but sometimes such incidents take
place," Karadayi said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Greek Defense Ministry has reportedly denied the
harassment charges, saying the collision was caused due to
Turkish warships' "dangerous actions."
</P>
<P>
The Greek and Turkish relations have been worsening since the
Cypriot government announced that it would not give up the
controversial plan to buy S-300 missiles from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Greece is an ally of the Greek Cypriots and Turkey one of the
Turkish Cypriots in Cyprus. Cyprus has remained divided into the
Greeck Cypriot-ruled south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled
north since 1974 when Turkey landed troops and took the northern
third of the island following a coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Greek and Greek Cypriot troops held joint exercises,
code-named "Victory '97", from October 10 to 14 in the Greek
Cypriot-controlled area, while Turkish forces and Turkish Cypriot
national guards responded with planned joint military drills for
early next month.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, have long been at odds over a number of issues,
including the mineral resources under the Aegean, airspace
division as well as the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The two countries came to the brink of war early last
year over an uninhabited islet in the Aegean.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta to Hand Over Next April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The military junta in Sierra
Leone that overthrew the legitimate government in the May 25 coup
today agreed to hand over power to the ousted president Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah on April 22 next year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, all the people, including the junta leader major
Johnny Paul Koroma, who are involved in the coup will be granted
amnesty at the end of the six-month transition period.
</P>
<P>
These are the highlights of a communique issued at end of the
talks between the junta's delegation and a sub-regional committee
of five foreign ministers in Conakry, capital of Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The communique also demanded that Kabbah government, when
restored, shall be all embracing, implying that all parties
concerned in the political crisis may have a place in the
government.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, from Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Cote d'ivoire and
Liberia, are mandated by the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) to handle the crisis in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Both ECOWAS and the United Nations are imposing sanctions
against the junta.
</P>
<P>
Since initial dialogue broke down last July when the junta
said it would stay in power until 2001, there has been a state of
virtual war between ECOWAS peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG and
the junta forces.
</P>
<P>
According to a document of the meeting, which started last
night, there should be a cessation of hostilities throughout
Sierra Leone with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG force commander major-general Victor Malu, who is in
Conakry attending the talks, has declared immediate ceasefire
starting from the time the communique was issued this afternoon,
the British Broadcasting Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nigerian foreign minister Tom Ikimi, who is the
Chairman of the ECOWAS committee of five, has agreed that rebel
leader Foday Sankoh "is a vital part of the peace process" in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh who has been in detention in Nigeria since March this
year is expected to be back in Sierra Leone to help promote the
peace process and stability of the country.
</P>
<P>
In Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, jubilant people are out
to the streets, singing and dancing for there will be no military
intervention in the country.
</P>
<P>
But ousted president Kabbah, who is in Edinburgh, Scotland to
participate in the Commonwealth Summit scheduled to open
tomorrow, refused to make comment on the communique.
</P>
<P>
He said he had nothing to say until he was briefed of the
meeting in Conakry.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi was confident that the agreement will hold.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have the ability to manage it," he said, quoted by
the BBC.

<HEADLINE> Preparation of Food Security Program Finalized in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The nationwide preparation
of the food security program which is believed to guarantee food
security and bring about sustainable economic development has
been finalized, the Ministry of Agriculture of Ethiopia said
today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, Belay Ejigu, head of
Extension Program Department in the ministry underlined the need
to produce sufficient food grains and strengthen the purchasing
power of the public and its maintenance if food security is to be
achieved.
</P>
<P>
He said at a meeting here that there is no belief that the
extension program now is full-swing with particular emphasis on
small holders alone could guarantee food security be it at the
family or national level.
</P>
<P>
The production in the previous year has seen surplus over the
national need, but it is impossible to say food security for all
has been achieved, he added.
</P>
<P>
Practical measures are now being taken to regularize the
extension program on the plots of all farmers, he said, adding
that the number of farmers incorporated in the package has now
reached over 650,000 against 33,000 two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an official from the Disaster Prevention and
Preparedness Commission said at the meeting that his commission
has begun preparations to compile a document on drought prone
areas and the major reasons behind the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, failure of rains this year has
exposed about 3.4 million people to food shortage and the country
has so far distributed over half of the 307,000 metric tons of
the food reserve it had.

<HEADLINE> Trading Standard on UK Used Car Market Appalling: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The trading standard on
Britain's used car market is nothing less than "appalling" as tens
of thousands of consumers are cheated each year, according to a
report on the trade by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT).
</P>
<P>
The report said that each year some 8.2 million used cars are
bought and last year these purchases led to 84,479 complaints to
trading standards offices, more than for any other consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that one in six buyers encounters a problem
within six months. Some 28,000 cars written off by insurers are
repaired by unscrupulous traders and put back on sale, and many of
the 500,000 cars stolen each year are resold to unsuspecting
drivers.
</P>
<P>
The report added that one in seven cars sold was also found to
have outstanding hire purchase or other debt attached to them and
some cars were in such bad condition that lives were put at risk.
</P>
<P>
The OFT called for new legislation aimed at eliminating some of
the worst abuses of the used car trade to be enacted which will
give trading standards officers powers to make on-the-spot
investigations of cars for sale and to detailed vehicle
decumentation.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Won't Expel Nigeria: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth of nations will
not expel Nigeria but may impose new sanctions on it, the
organization's secretary-general, Chief Emeka Anyaoku said in
London today.
</P>
<P>
"The exclusion of Nigeria is not on the table. It is not one
of the recommendations of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action
Groups (CMAG)," he was quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku's comment came on the eve of the Commonwealth summit
of heads of state in Edinburgh, Scotland, on Friday, which is to
decide on Nigeria's membership of the 54-nation body.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth suspended Nigeria's membership in November
1995 after its government executed author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight
other minority activists on charges of murder.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth then directed the CMAG to investigate and
monitor Nigeria's human rights record so that it can decide at
its next summit two years later whether Nigeria should be
expelled for good.
</P>
<P>
As the deadline draws near and consultations between CMAG and
Nigeria seem to have yielded no positive results, there is a fear
among some Nigerians that their country might be expelled after
all.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku explained that the decision not to expel Nigeria was
taken in the light of the local government elections on
multi-party basis last March, which has been generally regarded
as free and fair.
</P>
<P>
He, however, said the Edinburgh summit may impose new
sanctions on Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that both Britain and Canada have been
pressing for further sanctions on Nigeria, insisting that the
country is not doing enough to improve its human rights record
and that its military government is not sticking to its
transition to civil rule program.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Builds More Clinics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- A total of 164 new
clinics had been built in the first nine months of the year,
compared with 44 in the same period last year, the South African
Press Association quoted a Health Department official as saying
today.
</P>
<P>
Other 39 clinics were upgraded, Director Yogan Pillay told a
national health consultative forum in Pretoria. In addition, he
said, 51 mobile clinics had been delivered.
</P>
<P>
Other objectives realized by the department in the social
sector included abortion services in all provinces, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months since South Africa adopted abortion
law in February, nearly 13,000 legal abortions were performed,
according to a survey by the Reproductive Rights Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The new legislation allows state-funded pregnancy termination
in demand for all women over the age of 16 in the first 12 weeks
of pregnancy. Abortions for further eight weeks were subjected to
certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
On birth control, Pillay said the department was trying to
promote the use of condoms in high schools to reduce an 8 percent
birth rate among teenagers below the age of 16.
</P>
<P>
Other achievements include the distribution of more
wheelchairs and hearing aids and more surgery to remove eye
cataracts, the department said.

<P>
TUNIS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian President Zine
Al-Abidine Ben Ali held talks here today with visiting South
African President Nelson Mandela on bilateral relations as well
as regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisian news agency quotes a Tunisian presidential
spokesman as saying that the two presidents reviewed the bonds of
friendship and cooperation between Tunisia and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
They expressed interest in promoting bilateral relations,
particularly at the level of businessmen, and intensifying trade
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisian spokesman said that the two presidents reaffirmed
the need to enhance political consultations on regional and
international issues, particularly those relating to Africa, and
maintain such exchanges periodically.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, the two presidents also discussed the
Middle East peace process, the spokesman said. The Tunisian
president renewed Tunisia's adherence to the process and the
necessity of prompting international efforts to save it from a
freeze due to the Israeli government's intransigence and denial
of its obligations toward the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In a statement after the meeting, Mandela said that the Middle
East peace process was one of the most important issues he
discussed with the Tunisian president.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret that the Palestinians and Israelis have
not reached a settlement and established the cherished peace.
</P>
<P>
Mandela called upon both sides to return to the negotiating
table and to achieve actual progress toward peace on the basis
of respect for mutual rights.
</P>
<P>
After a short visit here, Mandela left this afternoon for
Morocco to complete his four-nation north Africa tour which
earlier took him to Egypt and Libya.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese President Promises A Stronger Army to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar
Al-Bashir said today that the military forces will be beefed up to
effectively repel aggressors and clear rebels.
</P>
<P>
Bashir was addressing army officers and national service
recruits in the artillery corps at the city of Atbara in the North
Sudanese Nile River State.
</P>
<P>
Sudan will recruit more to the ranks and put every able
person on military training program, he said.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made after John Garang, the rebel leader in
south Sudan, has threatened an offensive against key economic and
military targets in an attempt to gain bargaining chips at the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the Sudanese government and Garang's
Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) are due to be held in the
Kenyan capital of Nairobi on October 28.
</P>
<P>
Over a million people have died in violence since 1983 when the
southern rebels took up arms for greater autonomy from the Islamic
north for the Christian and animist south.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Bashir also renewed his accusations about
Eritrean troop mobilization along Sudan's east borders in support
of the rebels -- despite Eritrea's denials of such attempt.
</P>
<P>
Bashir said that Sudan will not abandon its endeavors to end
the civil war in southern Sudan and that the amassing of troops
will raise the country's strength and determination to establish
comprehensive peace and economic development programs.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government has called upon the Armed Forces to
observe full alert in order to confront any offensive on the part
of foreign quarters and the southern Sudanese rebel movement on
the eve of negotiations between the government and the John Garang
rebel movement.

<HEADLINE> Israel Blasts Hamas Leaders for Inciting More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Israel today strongly
accused Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin of inciting
more violence and attacks against Israel, while stressing that
Israel will continue its determined war against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry made the accusation in a statement
issued here in its strong reaction to the tough speeches made by
Yassin and Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement) political leader
Abdul Aziz Rantisi at a rally in Gaza Wednesday, in which they
called on Palestinian students to be ready to die for the fight
against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The statement expressed "shock and revulsion" over the Hamas
leaders' remarks, saying their action made it clear that Hamas
does not want peace and coexistence with Israel. It said that
inciters of terror and violence against Israel do not have right
to take part in the peace process, they will harm Palestinian
people too.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that Israel will continue fighting
against terrorism, and will call on international community to
denounce theses anti-peace actions.
</P>
<P>
It also demanded Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to "take
determined and consistent action against terrorists and their
infrastructure in the self-rule areas in order that the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks will continue in the positive
direction."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to 5,000 students in the Islamic University Wednesday
night, Yassin said the world only understands the language of
force and the Palestinians must fight to resist Israel until they
have their rights.
</P>
<P>
Noting that "a nation without a holy war is a nation without
purpose," Yassin declared that "we'll continue our holy war
against our enemy (Israel)."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same rally, Rantisi called on Palestinian
students to follow Yassin's footsteps and be prepared to die for
the cause. He said he wants to tell the U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who labeled Hamas as enemy of the U.S., that
Hamas has a commitment to God to follow up on the holy war against
"Zionist terrorism."
</P>
<P>
This is the toughest speech that Yassin has ever made since he
was released from Israeli jail and returned to his home in Gaza
early this month.
</P>
<P>
In past speeches, the 61-year-old, wheel chair-bound and
charismatic Hamas leader softened his tone, leading to speculation
that he might consider having a cease-fire with Israel and joining
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has been standing firm against making peace with
Israel. The militant group has gained fame through launching a
relentless violent campaign against Israel by repeatedly sending
suicide bombers to blow up Israeli buses and markets.
</P>
<P>
In the latest two operations, five Hamas suicide bombers blew
up themselves in Jerusalem's two central markets, killing 20
Israelis and wounded more than 300 others, rendering heavy blows
to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel is demanding the PNA to launch an all-out war against
Hamas and other militant groups so to advance the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Warn Against Demolition of Holy Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian religious and
resistance organizations warned today against any Israeli attempt
to "repair" or "demolish" the holy Muslim shrine Aqsa Mosque in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Council of Palestine said the destruction of any
parts of the Aqsa Mosque would violate the conventions protecting
civil rights under occupation and such results would be massive
destruction in the entire region, according to the Jerusalem Media
and Communication Center (JMCC).
</P>
<P>
Israel announced earlier this week that it was ready to
"repair" the Aqsa Mosque.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Council said it would carry out the restoration of
the Islamic holy site itself, and would not accept interference
from anyone else.
</P>
<P>
A group of Jewish extremists tried to enter the Aqsa Mosque
Monday to lay a corner stone in the destructed Jewish Temple in
the holy Muslim shrine, but were blocked by the Palestinian guards.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another Palestinian resistance movement Islamic
Jihad said today that "the Aqsa Mosque is a red line, the
Jerusalem is a red line, and all things related to our religion
and honor are red lines" that could never be crossed.
</P>
<P>
It compared the Palestinians to volcanos that might erupt
whenever their feelings, honor, holy sites and religion were
offended.
</P>
<P>
The movement called on all Muslims and Arabs to protect the
Aqsa Mosque and Palestine.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Decision on MENA Conference to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's final say on whether it
will attend Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference
(MENA) will be announced within a few days, presidential political
adviser Osama el-Baz said today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters here, Baz explained that Egypt's stance on
the conference stemmed from whether it would serve peace,
stability and regional cooperation in the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Baz's remarks appeared a bit confused with those by Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak who told the London-based Arabic daily
Al-Hayat that Egypt will only announce its decision on the Doha
conference just three to four days before its opening.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, it risks being accused of making decision hastily
and prodding others not to attend, Wednesday's Al-Hayat quoted
Mubarak as saying.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has invited 92 countries and organizations and expects
some 2,500 foreign participants to the annual gathering, which is
to be held on November 16-18.
</P>
<P>
"If no progress was made in the peace process, it would be
difficult to envisage how the Doha (Qatar) conference could be of
any use," Baz said and speculated an ensuing slim representation
at the conference.
</P>
<P>
In this case, it would fall short of realizing its original
target of buttressing regional cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
A number of Arab countries like Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates as well as the Palestinian National
Authority have threatened to boycott the Israeli-attending
conference in protest against Israel's hardline policy towards the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
More other Arab countries hesitate in announcing their
intentions, demanding a softened Israeli stance towards peace
process.

<HEADLINE> Sino-US Cooperation in Petrochemicals Has Wide Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The China Petrochemical
Corporation hopes to expand cooperation with US partners in the
trade, science, technology and investment areas.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Huaren, general manager of the corporation, said his
company sincerly hopes that the government of the United States
will support and encourage US companies to export more new
high-tech technology and increase investments in China. He also
urged the US government to grant preferential loans to enterprises
engaged in cooperation, and make grant permanency to China's Most
Favored Nation (MFN) trading status in order to deepen bilateral
cooperation in the petrochemical sector.
</P>
<P>
The petrochemical sector is regarded as a pillar in China's
rapid and sustained economic growth, said Sheng, adding that
related bilateral cooperation should help to improve and develop
relations between the two countries, "China and the United States
should look at President Jiang Zemin's upcoming state visit to the
US as an opportunity to raise bilateral cooperation in the
petrochemical sector to a new level."
</P>
<P>
Sheng noted the remarkable progress in bilateral cooperation in
the petrochemical sector, and said that China introduced some 600
types of technology from abroad between 1973-1997. He said that at
least half of the imported technology came from the United States,
and noted that China will continue to introduce technology and
equipment from the US. Sheng noted that China will import some one
million tons of crude oil from Alaska.
</P>
<P>
Sheng pointed to China's vast potential market, and said the
petrochemical sector has a solid foundation and technology and is
staffed by well-trained technicians and management personnel. He
also noted that US companies offer advanced technologies, and
high-level international management and marketing experience.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the China Petrochemical Corporation and its
US counterparts is based on equality, mutual benefit,
complementary advantages, long-term collaboration and common
development, said Sheng. "The prospects for cooperation are very
broad."
</P>
<P>
Sheng also underlined that US-based Arco and Phillips companies
held their boards of directors meetings in China in 1996 and 1997
respectively, thereby indicating keen interest and confidence in
expanding their businesses in China.
</P>
<P>
The China Petrochemical Corporation, established in 1983, has
founded 10-odd joint ventures with US companies over the past few
years. The company currently refines 80 percent of oil, and
produces 75 percent of the nation's ethylene.
</P>
<P>
Sheng said that his company and US-based Exxon are currently
discussing plans invest three billion US dollars to set up a
refinery in east China's Fujian province, and is also conducting
feasibility studies with Dow Chemicals for a large ethylene
project in Tianjin valued at 2.5 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The China Petrochemical Corp. and Phillips are negotiating two
petrochemical projects in Shanghai and Lanzhou, with related
investments expected to exceed two billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China Petrochemical has also cooperated with other US
companies, including Du Pont, Lubrizol, Hercules and Englhard.

HANOI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
met here today with Vietnamese Communist Party and state leaders
to discuss ways to further promote relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
On the second day of his three-day stay here, Wu talked with
Vietnamese Communist Party leader Do Muoi and the country's
newly-elected President Tram Duc Luong.
</P>
<P>
Do Muoi told Wu that many existing conditions in Vietnam and
China are favorable for cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Do Muoi expressed his belief that the two countries will score
new achievements as they work together in politics, economy,
trade, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Wu said the Chinese government attaches great
importance to its relations with Vietnam and wishes to further
develop the friendly relations into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
While meeting Tram Duc Luong, Wu said China and Vietnam,
economically complementary, could bring their economic and trade
cooperation to a higher level through joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
Tram Duc Luong said the meeting of Chinese and Vietnamese
leaders on an annual basis serves as a guidance for the smooth
development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Wu has also met with Vietnam's Permanent Deputy Prime Minister
Nguyen Tan Dung.
</P>
<P>
He told Nguyen Tan Dung that good neighborly, mutually
beneficial and cooperative Sino-Vietnamese relations are in the
fundamental interest of both countries, and are conducive to
regional as well as world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
In general, the Chinese vice-premier noted, economic
cooperation and trade between the two countries are still at a low
level, and that there exists vast potential for their further
development.
</P>
<P>
China hopes to further bring forward its economic cooperation
and trade with Vietnam by diversifying the forms of cooperation on
the basis of equality and mutual benefit, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Tan Dung agreed with Wu and said the two sides will
discuss and turn the consensus reached earlier by senior leaders
of the two countries into practical cooperation programs.
</P>
<P>
He wished Wu's visit, the first by a Chinese vice-premier in
charge of economic affairs since the two neighboring countries
fully normalized relations in 1991, will be successful.
</P>
<P>
Also today, with Wu and Nguyen Tan Dung's presence, Chinese and
Vietnamese officials signed two documents on China's provision of
loans and aid to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is the second leg of Wu's tour across Asia, which has
already brought him to Bangladesh and will further bring him to
Laos, Myanmar and Thailand.

<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- China's Vice-Foreign Minister
Li Zhaoxing said today at a reception for UN Day 1997 that the
issue of UN reforms, which was discussed at the 52nd session of
the UN General Assembly, has an important bearing on every member
state.
</P>
<P>
The reforms should not be dictated by a few countries and
should not be allowed to serve only their interests, he
stressed. What is needed is to give democracy free rein, with
extensive discussions conducted on an equal footing, an extensive
airing of all views, particularly those of developing countries,
he said, and the reforms should be acceptable to all member states.
</P>
<P>
The reforms should highlight the role of development in UN
activities, together with that of peace, Li said, noting that they
should help preserve the diversity of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the Security Council should be enlarged
in accordance with the principle of equitable geographical
distribution and should ensure a proper balance between developing
and developed countries so that it will become more representative.
</P>
<P>
Arthur N. Holcombe, resident coordinator of UN Operational
Activities in China, also spoke at the reception, discussing UN's
operations and difficulties as well as the UN-China relations.

<HEADLINE> HK Determined to Deal with Youth Crime and Drug Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government is
determined to deal with the problem of youth crime and drug abuse,
with the support of the community and law enforcement agencies, a
senior official of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) of China said here today.
</P>
<P>
The SAR's Chief Secretary for Administration Anson Chan, who is
 also chairwoman of the Fight Crime Committee (FCC), told a
reception held today by the FCC that the government will continue
to accord top priority to tackling the problem of youth crime and
steering youths away from crime and drugs.
</P>
<P>
"Although the first nine months of 1997 saw a drop of seven
percent for juvenile offenders (aged between 16 and 20) arrested
for crime when compared with the same period in 1996, we must not
be complacent," Chan said at the reception, which was aimed to
further strengthen the committee's ties with the 18 District Fight
Crime Committees (DFCCs).
</P>
<P>
Chan noted that in the first half of this year, drug abuse for
those aged under 21 was down by 17 percent and she attributed the
drop of youth crime and drug abuses to the constant vigilance by
the excellent police force and the support by the community.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she said, the government will strengthen police
intelligence and detection capabilities in tackling complex
syndicated and organized crime.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will also cooperate with law enforcement agencies and
security forces in the southeastern Chinese province of Guangdong
to tackle increasingly sophisticated trans-boundary crimes.
</P>
<P>
"The district fight crime committees, in particular, have
played a key role in fostering close cooperation between the
police force and the local community in our fight against crime,"
she said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank to Borrow for Higher Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines, is planning to borrow 500 million U.S. dollars from
the international capital market in a bid to boost its dollar
reserves and refinance its short-term liabilities, local
television reports said.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the central bank were quoted as saying the bank
was considering an offer from ING bank in Hong Kong, which had
earlier put a 500-million-dollar deposit in the central bank to
increase its foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
But they said the central bank this time will likely use its
reverse repurchase agreements (RRPs) to back up the loan.
</P>
<P>
RRPs, one effective tool of managing money supply, are
government securities held by the central bank and issued to banks
in exchange for hard currencies with a promise to buy them back in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the Philippine Central Bank Gabriel Singson earlier
confirmed that the bank is contemplating borrowing an initial
tranche of 500 million dollars with five-year to 10-year maturity.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the bank is thinking of raising funds not through
acceptance of deposits, which are short-term in nature, but
through medium-term borrowings.
</P>
<P>
A committee has been tasked to study several proposals from
different investment houses for a possible bond float for the
central bank, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The gross international reserves (GIR) held by the central bank
reduced sharply to less than 10 billion dollars in July due to the
heavy intervention by the bank in the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
The GIR rose to 10.9 billion dollars as of end-September after
the central bank received about 1 billion dollars in loan from the
International Monetary Fund and other financial bodies.
</P>
<P>
But the GIR dropped anew to 10.5 billion dollars this week
after the central bank stepped in the local currency exchange
again.
</P>
<P>
The GIR refers to foreign exchange denominated assets held by
the central bank such as gold, foreign investments, foreign
currencies and government securities.
</P>
<P>
The central bank wants a higher GIR position since it indicates
the ability of the government to finance its imports and meet its
foreign obligations.

TOKYO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Tokyo Motor Show opened today
to showcase 771 vehicles and motorcycles sent in by 38 Japanese,
South Korean, U.S. and European manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The biannual event, currently the 32nd, is taking place at the
Makuhari Messe convention center near the city of Chiba, southeast
of Tokyo, and was scheduled to last 13 days.
</P>
<P>
While representatives of 330 automakers from 14 countries were
at the opening ceremony, visitors, mostly Japanese, are expected
to total 1.5 million throughout the show.
</P>
<P>
The Japan Motor Industrial Federation (JMIF), the organizer,
took the chance to highlight the industry's trend -- innovation
for environmentally friendly cars.
</P>
<P>
"The Earth demands that we treasure ... the environment, and
cleverly use its limited resources with loving care," the JMIF
said in a statement to the press.
</P>
<P>
The show was opened five weeks before Japan is to host an
international conference on global warming, which stems partly
from carbon dioxide emissions.
</P>
<P>
What many automakers want visitors to notice are their latest
models' high "fuel efficiency" and "compactness," which enable
smaller and cleaner emissions.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Contenders of Philippine Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Six presidential contenders of
the Philippine ruling Lakas-NUCD party today signed a unity
covenant, vowing to abide by the result of the nomination process
and support a common candidate in the 1998 general elections.
</P>
<P>
But a crack among the party has already emerged as another
presidential aspirant former presidential economic adviser Emilio
"Lito" Osmena failed to attend the signing ceremony held in the
presidential palace this morning.
</P>
<P>
Osmena, who has urged President Fidel Ramos to abandon the
anointment system to keep the party's solidarity, vowed earlier to
run for presidency in the May 1998 national polls with or without
the endorsement of Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Osmena, a founding member of the governing party led by Ramos,
is reportedly planning to join another party as its presidential
bet. A failure to sign the covenant meant Osmena's effective
withdrawal from the nomination contest.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the covenant was designed to prevent the
emergence of another Ramos. During the 1992 national polls, Ramos
failed to be nominated by the then ruling party, but he set up the
Lakas party and won the polls with the endorsement of former
president Corazon Aquino.
</P>
<P>
Among the six signatories were Finance Secretary Roberto de
Ocampo, Speaker of the House of Representatives Jose de Venecia
and former Defense Secretary Renato de Villa.
</P>
<P>
Of them, De Venecia, the party's secretary-general, and De
Villa, a retired general with a similar experience like Ramos,
have been widely viewed as top runners during the contest for
Ramos' endorsement, equal to an estimated 4 million votes.
</P>
<P>
Senator Leticia Ramos-Shahani, Ramos' sister, did not sign the
covenant because she had retreated from the contest and opted to
run for vice president.
</P>
<P>
The administration party will begin a series of nationwide
consultations on November 9 among the party's members gauge their
sentiments on the choice of the party's standard-bearer.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who will choose his successor based on the results of
the consultations, is expected to announce his choice before
November 27 when the united opposition, the Fight of Patriotic
Filipino Masses party, declared its candidate.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party will hold a national convention in January to
confirm, ratify and officially proclaim Ramos' choice.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, whose single six year term will expire in June 1998, is
ineligible to run for a second term under the country's 1987
constitution.

<HEADLINE> Korea Provides Loan to Philippine Airport Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Korea will provide a 25 million
U.S. dollar loan to an airport project in the southern
Philippines, the Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The loan, which will finance the proposed Laguindingan
International Airport in Mindanao, has a payable time of 30 years,
including a grace period of 10 years, at a 2.5 percent interest
rate.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon and Korean
Ambassador to Manila Chang Choon-Lee Thursday exchanged note on
the implementation of the airport project, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be disbursed over 48 months from the date of
signing of the loan agreement to ensure speedy implementation of
the project. The agreement signing date will be arranged soon by
the Department of Finance and the Korean embassy in Manila.
</P>
<P>
The Laquindingan International Airport will be constructed on a
300-hectare area within the Zone of Peace and Development in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
It is envisioned to serve the transportation needs of around
three million people in five provinces and expand the
transportation and communications network in the region.
</P>
<P>
The airport is designed to provide obstruction-free aviation
operations, reduce incidence of water-related flight cancellations
and allow the handling of A-300 and similar wide-bodied aircraft
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The project is also expected to stimulate business and
investment growth and contribute further to the economic
development and promotion of peace and stability in Southern
Philippines.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A Swiss bank has issued a
certification that Philippine President Fidel Ramos has no bank
account or any relationship deposits with the bank, a news release
from the Philippine Presidential Palace said today.
</P>
<P>
In the same certification, the Swiss Bank Julius Baer &AMP; Co.
Ltd. also said that the Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC) has
no bank account or relationship with it.
</P>
<P>
The certification was conveyed by the bank to the American
lawyer of the Philippine Government, Stephen Bomse.
</P>
<P>
Ramos earlier authorized the bank to disclose, if any bank
account or any bank relationship, under a waiver that he and PNOC
signed in order that the bank secrecy may not be invoked.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers of the victims of human right abuses in former
President Ferdinand Marcos' time earlier insinuated that Ramos
maintains an account in the Swiss bank.
</P>
<P>
They claimed that Ramos has transferred some of the fabled
1,241 tons of Marcos' gold deposited in Swiss banks to a bank
account owned by himself in the Swiss bank.
</P>
<P>
Ramos has dismissed the claims for several times, saying that
he has no bank deposit in Switzerland.

<P>
SHANGHAI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The project to get water from
the upper reaches of the Huangpu River for Shanghai, the country's
largest industrial city, is going smoothly, according to Municipal
Environmental Protection Bureau officials.
</P>
<P>
It is part of the municipality's drinking-water improvement
project that began in July 1994, that is expected to cost 2.66
billion yuan, with the help of 110 million US dollars in World
Bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to supply of 5.4 million cu.m. of water
daily and is scheduled to be completed by 1998. The water will be
supplied to Shanghai water plants through a 40-km channel.
</P>
<P>
The Huangpu River, which is the city's No.1 water resource,
provides an average of 55 billion cubic meters annually, and the
city needs six billion cu.m.
</P>
<P>
The decline in water quality standards in the Huangpu River has
been a major problem for local residents and local industrial and
agricultural production. So, in recent years, Shanghai has adopted
a series of measures to improve its environment, including a
number of waste water treatment projects.

<HEADLINE> India Develops Technology to Turn Vegetable Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Indian scientists have
developed an indigenous biochemical technology to recycle
vegetable wastes into bioenergy, a government official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The new technology can not only reduce the mounting garbage
heaps that pollute cities but also leads to the generation of
energy-rich fuel.
</P>
<P>
Vegetable wastes are first solubilized into a slurry, which is
then subjected to fermentation and "anaerobic" digestion in the
presence of methane, producing bacteria which converts the waste
into gas and an effluent.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 70 percent of the gas obtained is methane which can be
used as bio-gas fuel. The nutrient rich, odourless effluent can be
used as fertilizer and as an animal feed.

<P>
HONG KONG, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of
China, returned here today after paying a visit to Brussels and
London.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the airport, Tung told reporters that his
visit was fruitful.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Tung met with political leaders of Belgium
and Britain, leaders of the European Union (EU), members of the
European Parliament and people of the industrial and commercial
community in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Tung said he had briefed these people on Hong Kong's situation
after its return to China and all the people he had met extended
their congratulations on Hong Kong's smooth return to the
motherland and expressed their confidence in the future of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said he had briefed leaders of the EU and Britain on Hong
Kong's development prospects.
</P>
<P>
"The EU and Britain are very important for Hong Kong's economic
development and we would like to strengthen the cooperation
between Hong Kong and Europe," Tung added.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in London, Tung held meetings with British
Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who
said Britain attaches great importance to the relations between
Britain and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong can serve as a bridge for the Sino-British relations,
which will benefit Britain, China and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the fluctuation of the stock market, Tung said the
SAR government is determined to maintain the Hong Kong dollar's
peg to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>

speculation might affect Hong Kong's stock market in the short
term, but can not succeed in the long run.

<HEADLINE> Beijing To Renovate Housing in Muslim District </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Aunt Bai, a Muslim woman who
has lived on Niujie Street in Beijing for most of her life, is
going to fulfill her lifelong dream of living in well-equipped
modern housing, thanks to a new project launched recently by the
municipal government.
</P>
<P>
Niujie Street in central Xuanwu District in southern Beijing is
mainly a Muslim region. More than 30,000 Muslims live along the
street, once important for Islamic activities.
</P>
<P>
The Niujie district long has been a part of the old city
proper. More than 7,500 families have been living here in poor
housing conditions for decades, sparking the municipal government
to give the district a facelift.
</P>
<P>
The renovation project will require 35.91 hectares of land and
300 million yuan (about 36 million US dollars), according to an
executive of the Xuanwu District Real Estate Company. The project,
when finished, will cover an area of 800,000 square meters,
including 370,000 square meters of housing and 430,000 square
meters of public buildings.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 26,000 residents will have to move and 175
enterprises and government agencies will be relocated.
</P>
<P>
"The architectural forms of these buildings will be of Islamic
style, considering the residents' religious passion and ethnic
customs," the executive said. A shopping mall of distinctive
ethnic features will also be built in the district, he said.

<HEADLINE> HK Shares Sharply Rebound After Four-day Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong shares rebounded
largely in closing trade today with a rise of 718.04 points, after
a continuing four-day drop which sent share markets reeling around
the world.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng index, the key indicator of Hong Kong's blue
chips, stood at 11,144.34 points, against Thursday's close of
10,426.30. On Wednesday, the index closed at 11,637. It lost 630
and 567 points on Monday and Tuesday, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Today's sharp rise came after the monetary authorities of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) took a package of
measures Thursday to fight speculative attacks on the Hong Kong
dollar and to stabilize the local stock market.
</P>
<P>
As the first step, the SAR monetary authorities used foreign
currency reserves to defend the Hong Kong dollar. This forced a
huge rise in interbank interest rates, to 300 percent at one
point, triggering panic selling on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
Then the SAR's biggest firms poured millions of dollars in the
local bourse to buy their own shares.
</P>
<P>
"We have really very good professional management who responded
very quickly to the speculative attacks," Chief Executive of the
SAR Tung Chee Hwa told reporters at the airport earlier today on
his return from his European trip.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The result of that is an increase in interest rate.
And so there is a temporary setback in the stock market, but I
believe this will be short lived."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the stability of the Hong Kong dollar
lies at the very heart of the SAR's economic stability and the
linked exchange rate is maintained.

impact of falls in European, American and Asian stock markets.

Henderson Charlton Jones broker Stuart Smith said market
bellwether BHP's bullish recovery from a low of 13.46 Australian

The interest rate-sensitive banking sector slumped 159.6 points

<HEADLINE> Macao Investors Urged to Stay Calm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A well-known local economist said
that the financial market fluctuations in Hong Kong will not have
much effect on the stability of Macao's financial system and that
investors should stay calm.
</P>
<P>
Lao Pun-Lap, secretary-general of the Macao Society of
Economics Study, told the "Macao Daily News" that investors need
not worry too much about the market fluctuations in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said that interest rates rise in Hong Kong would only have
a short-term negative effect on the economic growth, especially, the
real estate sector. But he said the rates will drop when the Hong
Kong dollar is stabilized.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has a sound financial management system," he said.
"It also has plenty of treasury and foreign currency reserves. The
government intervention will help stabilize the Hong Kong dollar
very soon, and (the fluctuations) will have little impact on
Macao."
</P>
<P>
Lao said that investors need not panic at what happened in the
stock market as Hong Kong economic growth will be maintained and
most listed companies are reporting profits.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that investors stay calm and not sell out their
stocks in panic, otherwise they will suffer greater losses. They
should keep at hands shares of those companies that have great
development potential.

<HEADLINE> Macao Raises Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Macao banks raised interest rates
by 0.75-0.95 percent today following a similar move in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Daily News reported today that after the announcement
of interest rates rise in Hong Kong on Thursday as a way to
maintain the exchange rate of Hong Kong dollar, most Macao bankers
decided to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
They began to add 0.75 percent to 0.95 percent to the original
preferential interest rates today. Whether bank deposit interest
rates will be raised is to be decided by bankers later today.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, many local banks have raised their
interest rates for fixed deposits of one to three months by about
1 percent. The rates now stand at 7-8 percent for one to three
month fixed deposits.
</P>
<P>
Local financiers said that the higher interest rates may last
quite some time, adding that further lifting of rates is possible.
</P>
<P>
The rates rise means a blow to the real estate business, which
has been slowly recovering after an over-two-year slump, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vitor Pessoa, secretary for economy and
coordination, said that the Macao currency, pataca, will remain
pegged to the Hong Kong dollar to avoid possible fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
One Hong Kong dollar equals to about 1.03 patacas at present.
The local currency is now connected with the U.S. dollar indirectly
via the Hong Kong dollar.
</P>
<P>
He said the Macao currency will remain stable so long as it is
pegged to the Hong Kong dollar, adding that the pataca is not a
possible target of speculators as Macao is only a tiny place.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Hits New Low as Hang Seng Tumbles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar today
plunged below 70 U.S. cents to a level not seen since January
1994, reacting to the fall in Hong Kong's Hang Seng index and the
potential fall-out for related economies.
</P>
<P>
Overnight the Australian dollar received a hammering from
offshore investors, plummeting to 69.75 U.S. cents, a new
three-year low.
</P>
<P>
However during trading over the day, the local currency jumped
nearly one U.S. cent higher to close just a little weaker on the
day.
</P>
<P>
Traders said heavy buying by U.S. funds short of Australian
dollars as well as partial retracements of the main stock index in
the Hong Kong share market helped the unit recover.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 70.58 U.S. cents, from 70.68
U.S. cents locally late yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Traders breathed a sigh of relief as the currency took on a
more positive hue following the wide price dips of the past three
sessions sparked by the currency and economic crisis in South East
Asia.
</P>
<P>
At close tonight, the Australian dollar was at 85.45 yen from
85.89 yesterday, and against the Deutsch mark it was at 1.2531,
from 1.2639.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rebound Slightly on Philippine Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine stock market
today reversed a sharp decline at early trading and rebounded
slightly thanks to "good news" from the Hong Kong market, traders
said.
</P>
<P>
The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index (Phisix), the
benchmark index for the bourse, plunged nearly 70 points within
one hour after trading opened today.
</P>
<P>
But it arrested the sharp downturn and moved upward due to a
big rebound in the Hong Kong market, which opened later than the
local exchange. The Phisix closed at 1,847.78 points, up 14.87
from Thursday's close.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Phisix nose-dived to a four-year low of
1,832.91 after losing 96.06 points or nearly 5 percent due to a
crash at the Hong Kong market. Due to widespread worries over an
expanded and prolonged regional currency turmoil, the Phisix had
been falling since Monday.
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed today's upswing to a technical rebound,
which they doubted can be sustained next week.
</P>
<P>
They said after investors will shift their attention from Hong
Kong to Thailand next week and what will happen in Thailand will
affect the region's sentiments.
</P>
<P>
Investors are now keeping a wary eye on Thailand where the
government has been urged to resign to take the blame for the
current protracted financial crisis, which has been hounding the
country since early this year.
</P>
<P>
All subindices ended today in the positive territory, with the
mining and property sectors posting the biggest gains of 43.98
points and 27.54 points, respectively, to end at 3,045.82 and
851.08.
</P>
<P>
Value turnover improved slightly on Thursday's close, reaching
1.12 billion pesos (32.4 million U.S. dollars), with a total of
1.7 billion shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Declines outnumbered advances, 59 to 53, while 39 others of the
151 traded issues remained standstill.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- World Boxing Council heavyweight
champion Lennox Lewis was considering a title defence against
Americans James Douglas or Lou Savarese, the Briton's manager
Frank Maloney said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Douglas or Savarese could challenge Lewis on February 21 in Las

winner of the November 8 Evander Holyfield-Michael Moorer bout.
</P>
<P>
Douglas, who jumped to fame by knocking out Mike Tyson in Tokyo
in 1990, has clinched six straight wins since he returned from a
six-year absence.
</P>
<P>
Savarese, who lost a split decision earlier this year to George
Foreman, had a style which suited Lewis, Maloney said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Macao's exports in the first
eight months of the year reached 11.3 billion patacas (about 1.43
billion US dollars), up 12.2 percent from the same period last

85.1 percent of all exports, showing a 19.9 percent increase from
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The export of non-textile products dropped 5.5 percent. They
include machinery, equipment, footwear and cement.
</P>
<P>
Most of the exports went to the United States and the European

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Says Overseas Intellectual Resources Important </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said
today that China places a great deal of importance on overseas
intellectual resources and has been active in using these
resources.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at the final day of the Third
Sino-U.S. Technology and Engineering Conference in Beijing's Great
Hall of the Peop1e, where he told participants that learning from
foreign countries' advanced technology and management techniques
as well as other achievements of their civilization to speed up
China's development is an important part of its opening up drive.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the foreign experts have made many good suggestions
on improving engineering technology and management in China,s
enterprises during the conferences, and have helped promote
Sino-U.S. exchanges and co-operation. These experiences should be
summarized and new areas and channels of co-operation be opened,
he said.
</P>
<P>
talented personnel are one of the most important resources in
scientific and technological progress and social and economic
development, and intellectual resources are needed to increase
knowledge. China's reform and modernization drive needs large
numbers of outstanding intellectuals who have the pioneering and
creative spirit, but who are also good at learning from others,
Jiang emphasized. This is the major intellectual backing of the
country's socialist cause, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called on departments in charge of foreign experts work
to provide better working and living conditions for those working
in China and encourage them to make full use of their
talent. Their intellectual property rights and other rights must
also be protected in keeping with China's law and international
practices, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The five-day conference focused on solving engineering and
technological problems and using domestic and external resources
to promote technical innovation in enterprises.

<HEADLINE> HK Chief Executive: Speculators to Be Defeated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of
China, said today that speculators against the Hong Kong dollar
would inevitably be defeated.
</P>
<P>
"We will make sure that they do not succeed in whatever they
are trying to do," he told reporters at the airport on his return
from a trip to Europe today, a day after the Hong Kong stock
market suffered its biggest ever one-day fall on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tung said speculators had "decided to have a go" in Hong Kong
after successful attacks on other regional currencies, but his
government is committed to maintaining the Hong Kong dollar's peg
to the U.S. dollar, or the linked exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is different from Southeast Asian nations because its
economic fundamentals are very good, it has the third largest
foreign exchange reserves in the world in addition to its huge
fiscal reserves and a large budget surplus and its economy
continues expanding, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Most of the listed companies in Hong Kong will enjoy a
double-digit growth, he added.
</P>
<P>
He praised SAR Financial Secretary Donald Tsang for his
management of this particular situation to defend the HK dollar.
</P>
<P>
The stability of the HK dollar lies in Hong Kong's economic
stability, Tung said. "As we move forward to make sure that the
linked exchange rate is to be maintained, we try to stop the
speculative attack on the HK dollar and we have really very good
professional management which responds very quickly to the attack.
The result of that is the increase in interest rates," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tung said the central government in Beijing had pledged support
for his government's efforts if necessary, but his government has
taken a series of measures which are effective in curbing
the speculation.

BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Norway's King Harald V and
Queen Sonja attended a ceremony for the Chinese publication of
"Green Globe Yearbook 1997", a Sino-Norwegian effort, here today.
</P>
<P>
The King said Norway attaches great importance to co-operation
with China in the field of environmental protection. He said that
China's efforts in coping with the great challenges to the
environment like climate changes, the ozone layer, and
biodiversity protection will have a decisive impact on the earth's
future.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of China's State Bureau of Environmental
Protection, said the Sino-Norwegian environmental protection
co-operation has been going on in an encouraging direction since
it started and has been very fruitful. China will mainly rely on
its own efforts to protect the environment, he said, but that it
needs assistance from the international community in finances,
technology and management.
</P>
<P>
He said that the King's and Queen's visit will enhance
Sino-Norwegian environmental co-operation.
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Environmental Protection signed an
agreement with Norway's Ministry of the Environment on
co-operation today.

<P>
SINGAPORE, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Senior Minister Lee
Kuan Yew called for a stronger link between the United States and
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries,
which he said will benefit both sides.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the Fortune 500 Forum in Boston, which was
also distributed here today, Lee Kuan Yew said that a stronger
U.S.-ASEAN linkage will ensure that there will be no major
East-West divide down the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Such a split, he warned, could come about if the United States
were to have free trade agreements or FTAs only with the Americas
at a time when East Asian countries were growing fast and
increasing trade between themselves.
</P>
<P>
He hopes to see the U.S. conclude FTAs with the ASEAN countries
to provide the framework to develop deep and broad economic links.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the currency turmoil in Southeast Asia, Lee said the
governments need to be disciplined in their macroeconomic policies
to win back investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
He is confident that those governments that have the political
strength to do the unpleasant quickly and thoroughly will reap the
best rewards.

</P>
<P>
The Times:

<HEADLINE> Chinese Military Denies Selling Human Organs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese military
officer today denied a US television report that some People's
Liberation Army (PLA) hospitals are selling the organs of convicts
who are sentenced to death, calling the ABC documentary a "pure
fabrication".
</P>
<P>
A thorough investigation has shown that the footages used in
the documentary, with the exception of a few shots of entrances to
medical centers in south China that are open to foreigners, are
"fabrications" that have nothing to do with PLA hospitals.
</P>
<P>
"Surgeons appearing in the documentary are not PLA medical
personnel and the evidence they presented in no way conforms to
reality," the officer said, pointing out that Henry Wu, who
participated in the plot, made up similar stories two years ago.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, he and a BBC reporter made a TV documentary about
China in which they showed some tombs and described them as tombs
of convicts sentenced to death. But the inscriptions on the
tombstone indicated that they were graves of departed local
residents.
</P>
<P>
They pretended to be a husband and wife team and shot footage
of a heart surgery during a visit to a Chinese hospital, then
claimed it was an organ transplant operation using an organ taken
from an executed convict.
</P>
<P>
Wu later admitted that he had been asked to help make an
anti-Chinese documentary and made it by substituting some scenes
for others.
</P>
<P>
The PLA officer pointed out that the Chinese government
strictly bans the sale of human organs, and, as is the case
elsewhere, a very few PLA hospitals that have approval, can do
organ transplants.
</P>
<P>
These are done in accordance with the law and the organs are
donated voluntarily and handled according to special procedures.
</P>
<P>
"There has never been a single case involving the sale of
organs of executed convicts," the officer stated, and pointed out
that ABC was using a lie at a time when relations between China
and the United States are showing signs of improvement, but that
anyone with a good sense can see their real intention.

<HEADLINE> Johannesburg Stock Tumbles After Hong Kong Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Johannesburg
Stock Exchange (JSE) Thursday suffered its biggest one-day loss in six
years after a 10 percent crash in Hong Kong's stock market, local
media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The JSE all share index lost 326 points or 4.4 percent to 7,094.2,
the biggest percentage fall since August 1991. It was four point short
of the 330-point fall in the wake of the "Black Monday" crash on Wall
Street in October 1987.
</P>
<P>
Industrial stocks fell 355 points or 3.9 percent to 8,682, while
the financial index shed 467 points or 4.4 percent to 10,201.2.
</P>
<P>
The fall wiped almost 10 billion Rand (2.1 billion U.S. dollars)
off the market capitalization of the JSE's two largest stocks, De
Beers and Anglo American Corporation. De Beers's 15.20 Rand (3.2
dollars) loss to 124.60 (26.5 dollars) was sparked by fears that the
Asian crisis would dampen that region's hunger for diamonds, dragging
associate Anglo American down 17.20 Rand (3.7 dollars) to 235.40 Rand
(50 dollars).
</P>
<P>
De Beers is the world's largest diamond company.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong crisis also sparked a heavy losses in the South
African futures market, where a record 3.7 billion Rand (800 million
dollar) worth of futures contracts changed hands.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's bond market came under attack as foreign investors
lost their appetite for emerging markets in the wake of the turbulence
in the east.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index shed 10 percent to close at 10,426 on
interest rate hikes sparked by a speculative attack on its currency.
</P>
<P>
The crash caused panic in other Asian markets and had repercussions
in Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Markets in Indonesia, Taiwan, the Philippines and Malaysia recorded
losses ranging from 1.7 to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Europe, exchanges in France and Britain fell by more than 3
percent and Germany's DAX lost 4.66 percent. In the United States, the
Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 186.88 points to 7,847.77 points.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's inflation
rate dropped to eight percent in September, the lowest level in a
year, according to the Central Statistical Service.
</P>
<P>
Local daily The Star today quoted economists as saying that
the drop from August's 8.7 percent was expected and the capital
market showed limited reaction to a figure that had largedly been
discounted before Thursday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
"Owing to high bases in the second half of last year, the
inflation rate should continue on its steep downward path for the
remainder of the year," economist Chantal Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate in December last year registered 11.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Friedman forecast inflation to drop below 7.5 percent in
October and November, with inflation "significantly below seven
percent at year-end".
</P>
<P>
She calculated the average inflation rate for this year at 8.7
percent and for next year at six percent.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Manufacturing Sector Recovers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' manufacturing
industry sustained its recovery in August, with its value and
volume indices both rising considerably from the year-ago levels,
the National Statistics Office said today.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the same period last year, the sector's value of
production index (VPI) went up 5.7 percent in August to 485.5 and
its volume of production index (VoPI) grew 3.9 percent to 162.11,
according to figures released by the office.
</P>
<P>
On a month-on-month comparison, the VPI registered an increase
of 2.9 percent from 471.7 in July.
</P>
<P>
Every month, the statistics office conducts a survey of 442 key
enterprises in the manufacturing sector to determine their
performance that will show the industry's contribution to the
country's gross national product (GNP).
</P>
<P>
Annual increases in the VPI were observed in nine out of the 16
major sectors covered by the survey, with electrical machinery
leading all sectors with a 54.9 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
Electrical machinery contributed 70.1 percent to the overall
annual growth of the manufacturing VPI during the period in
review. The sharp growth in this subsector was attributed to the
gains in the production of microcircuits.
</P>
<P>
On a monthly basis, the electrical machinery sector also
registered the highest increase of 12.1 percent, contributing 28.9
percent to the monthly VPI growth of the whole manufacturing
industry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the VoPI increased by 2.6 percent from 157.9 in
July. The VoPI is a measure of change in volume net of inflation.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector, representing nearly 23 percent of the
country's GNP, registered poor performance during the first
quarter. But it began to pick up in May.

<HEADLINE> Court Date Set for Goldenberg Corruption Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Goldenberg corruption
case, which has been cited by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) as the biggest obstacle for resumption of its huge loan to
Kenya, will be heard on a daily basis from December 3.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Attorney-General Amos Wako, when declaring the date
Thursday, denied any delay intention by the government.
</P>
<P>
"A case of this magnitude, even in the United Kingdom, does
not take less than six or seven years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Golderberg scandal exposed a series of deals which caused
the loss of more than 12 billion Shillings (some 200 million U.S.
Dollars) in the form of export compensation.
</P>
<P>
The accused in the case are famous tycoon Kamlesh Pattni,
former Treasury Permanent Secretary Wilfred Koinange, former
Central Bank Deputy Governor Eliphaz Riungu and his colleague
Michael Wanjihia Onesmus.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, IMF announced the suspension of a 205-million-Dollar
key aid package to Kenya, blaming the Kenyan government for
failing to take enough measures to set up financial
accountability with the Goldenberg scandal as the most serious
sample.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers then took advantage of IMF remarks to claim a
mistrial, noting the IMF had prejudiced the case by sending out a
clear message that anything short of a conviction of the accused
would mean no aid would be forthcoming to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
However, Nairobi Chief Magistrate Uniter Pamella Kidullah has
dismissed the application to terminate the hearing of the case.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A seminar on "Modern Norway"
co-sponsored by the Development Research Center under the State
Council and the Norwegian Embassy in Beijing was held here today.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 participants from the two countries were briefed
on Norwegian society -- the role of its press and media, equality
and Norway's mixed economy.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Norwegian King Harald V and Chinese State Councillor
Li Guixian attended the opening ceremony and delivered speeches.
</P>
<P>
Harald V briefly explained Norwegian society, politics and
economy, and said that the seminar would enable the two sides to
exchange opinions and share Norway's experience in its transition
period.
</P>
<P>
Li said Norway is one of the earliest western countries to
establish diplomatic ties with China, and there is a firm basis
for bilateral friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
Entering the 1990s, Li said, Sino-Norwegian relations have
further improved and developed, and the growth of bilateral
economic and trade cooperation is especially noticeable with
bilateral trade volume in the first half of this year up 133
percent compared with the same 1996 period.
</P>
<P>
He cited the great potential and promising prospects for
bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The experience of Norway's mixed-market economy and social
insurance system has drawn the interest of Chinese economists and
researchers, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that this seminar will make positive
contributions to Sino-Norwegian mutual understanding.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- China will hold its
International Week of Science and Peace on Nov. 9-16 to promote
scientific and technological development and world peace.
</P>
<P>
The theme of this week will focus on population, environment,
resources and sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
At today's news conference, Chen Yixiong, secretary-general of
the China Organizing Committee of the International Week of
Science and Peace, said that China has made this an annual event
since 1989.
</P>
<P>
This year's activities will include scientific and
technological fairs, academic lectures, exhibitions and film week,

declared International Week of Science and Peace. During that
time, the member countries should hold activities propagating the
important role science and technology plays in the maintenance of
world peace and social development.

<HEADLINE> Berger Describes U.S.-China Summit As Milestone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official said
here today that the summit next week between Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton will be a "milestone".
</P>
<P>
"I have said to our people in preparation for the summit that
we should consider the summit to be a milestone, but not a
millstone," Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security assistant,
told a White House briefing.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the summit is a milestone "in the sense that
we can use the summit to try to make progress on a number of
areas, but we ought not to see the summit as an artificial
deadline."
</P>
<P>
The week-long state visit by Jiang to the United States, which
starts on October 26, will be the first one ever paid by a Chinese
head of state since 1985.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will discuss their "strategic relationship,"
cooperation in keeping stability and peace and issues concerning
security and economy, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
Berger thought that regular summits between the United States
and China are generally a good thing.
</P>
<P>
The United States does not seek to contain China or treat China
as enemy, said the assistant. "We want to engage with China to
expand areas of cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Berger said the United States shares "a very wide-range of
interests" with China, stressing that the differences between the
two countries should be handled in a "face to face" way and the
summit should not be seen as an artificial deadline.

<HEADLINE> Once Exhausted Fishery Rejuvenated in Zhejiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Zhoushan Fishery in
eastern China's Zhejiang Province has been revived by the rapid
growth of deep-water fishing and the commercial fish-breeding
industries.
</P>
<P>
Located on the East China Sea, Zhoushan has a marine
area of more than 20,000 square kilometers, the largest in China
and one of the world's top four fisheries.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Zhoushan's aquatic output topped 1.05 million tons,
twice the figure in 1990, and accounted for 10 percent of the
country's total.
</P>
<P>
When fishing season comes, hundreds of thousands of fishing
boats converge around Zhoushan from other coastal provinces of
China, even from other countries.
</P>
<P>
However, due to over-fishing in the 1970s and 1980s, the
Zhoushan Fishery showed signs of resources depletion in the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
The government in Zhoushan City then decided to control
inshore fishing and promote the development of deep-sea fishing
and fish-breeding.
</P>
<P>
Zhoushan now has long-term cooperative agreements with fishing
organizations in more than 30 countries, including Japan,
Australia, the Republic of Korea and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city's fishing fleet brought back a catch of
100,000 tons of deep-water fish and its output from breeding
amounted to 30,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Local fishermen have obtained an awareness that the costing
deep-water fishing requires cooperation with overseas investors
and the introduction of compensated trade.
</P>
<P>
Apart from tapping marine resources, the city in recent years
has focused on protecting the marine ecology. For the past two
years, millions of shrimp, groupers and jellyfish have been
planted each year.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Under Control in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The cholera epidemic, which
killed more than 200 in Kenya's southwestern province of Nyanza
in the past three months, has been put under control, a Kenyan
health official said.
</P>
<P>
No cholera-related deaths had been reported within the past 24
hours, an indication that the disease had been controlled, said
Daily Nation newspaper today quoting Provincial Medical Officer
Richard Otieno Muga.
</P>
<P>
"Reports reaching me from the affected areas indicate that the
situation is getting better but I am urging medical officers
involved in the campaign not to slacken because we cannot rule
out chances of a re-emergence of the disease," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kisumu District Hospital, which teemed with cholera
victims last week, had only four victims by Thursday, he added.
</P>
<P>
The number of cholera patients at the Homa Bay District
Hospital had reduced from 46 to 28 within two days. Homa Bay and
Kisumu are among the worst-hit areas by cholera.
</P>
<P>
"Other areas like Muhoroni and Ahero have also reported few
admissions following a massive campaign," Muga said.
</P>
<P>
He assured the public that drugs had been supplied to all
health centers in the affected areas and called on them to report
to the institutions immediately they developed cholera symptoms.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the public must also continue to maintain high
standards of hygiene and disposal of waste must never be taken
for granted again," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kisumu District Hospital's medical superintendent, George
Ogonji, said the hospital had discharged most cholera patients
and had dispatched medical personnel to treat their relatives to
prevent fresh outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry declared an all-out war against cholera
last week and offered fresh supplies of drugs worth nine million
Kenyan Shillings (about 150,000 U.S. Dollars) Saturday in Kisumu,
the third-largest city in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Health officials also launched public health campaign to
improve hygienic standards in the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
However, given the forecast of upcoming rains in the next two
weeks, top medical officials warned that the rains which have
been pounding some parts of Nyanza Province could exacerbate the
cholera situation in the lowland areas of the regions.

<HEADLINE> Book Fair Displays Publications on Tibet, Religion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Readers are amazed at piles of
religious books and books about Tibet at the "Golden Autumn" Book
Fair held at the Tao Fen Book Center of the SDX Joint Publishing
Company in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the China International Cultural Association, the
Chinese Publishers' Association and the SDX Joint Publishing
Company, the fair displays about 500 kinds of books about
religion and 600 titles about Tibet, among its total of 5,000
titles of academic and cultural books.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Chinese scholars have stepped up studies of
world religion. They have also translated some foreign works on
religion, including "Talking About the Bible", "Common Knowledge
About the Bible", "Christian Stories" and "Biblical Aphorisms".
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to see such books in bookstores in western
countries, for publishing such books often means lossing
money," said a Chinese scholar on the history of world
religion. "It reflects China's respect for religious beliefs
of its citizens."
</P>
<P>
The fair also highlights the publications on tibet and Tibet
studies, with a variety of books on Tibet's history, folk customs,
population, language, art, water conservancy, soil, vegetation,
medicine and science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jiu, director of the Tibetan People's Publishing House,
said that in the spirit of "inheriting and developing the
Tibetan culture," his publishing house has published one
collection of translated works on Tibetan studies a year since
1989. Meanwhile it also publishes foreign books on Tibetan studies
and now 12 such collections have been published.
</P>
<P>
Among the publications, "The Collection of Chinese Language
Literature on Tibetan Studies" by the Tibetan Academy of Social
Sciences has the first-hand material on Tibetan questions from the
early Qing Dynasty to the early years of the Republic of
China (1912-1949).
</P>
<P>
An old overseas Chinese man was overjoyed to find "A
comprehensive Bibliography of Tibet Studies" at the
fair. According to him, the book was the first of its kind in the
world and scholars on Tibetan studies in the world value it very
much.
</P>
<P>
"Over several decades, those who advocate the independence of
Tibet haven't published even one quality book on Tibet's culture
and religion except political pamphlets against China," he said.
</P>
<P>
The book fair will run through December 1.

ZHENGZHOU, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan
Province will renovate a 600-year-old government office in Yexian
County, local officials say.
</P>
<P>
The county government office compound was built in 1369 and is
still standing even after several hundred years of warfare. Most
of the 53 rooms in the 12,000-sq.m. space are still intact.
</P>
<P>
The building is the sole survivor of the North China
architectural tradition of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
Because the large-scale renovation that was needed in recent
decades wasn't done, many structures decayed and collapsed. To
preserve the cultural site, local relics protection organizations
decided on the restoration project to use it as a museum.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Resigns With the Bulls for Another Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- NBA defending champion
Chicago Bulls and their six-time rebounding king Dennis Rodman
have re-signed for one more year, the Bulls announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
There were no further details on the deal, which was announced
shortly after a deadline set by the Bulls for Rodman to give his
final response.
</P>
<P>
On October 8, the two sides had agreed to a deal reportedly
worth 4.5 million dollars in base salary plus a similar amount in
incentives tied to Chicago Bulls victories.
</P>
<P>
But Rodman had balked at signing and threatened to retire
after complaining about what he saw as an unfair incentive-laden
contract.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Rodman was not able to complete a physical at
the time due to a case of bronchitis. He finally passed the
physical over the weekend and met with general manager Jerry
Krause.
</P>
<P>
Rodman made 10 million dollars last season and helped the Bulls
win a fifth NBA title in seven years. Enditerm

<HEADLINE> G-15 Trade Ministers to Discuss WTO-Related Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Trade and economic
ministers of the Group of 15 (G-15) developing countries will meet
here on October 31 to discuss issues related to the World Trade
Organization (WTO), Malaysian International Trade and Industry
Minister Rafidah Aziz said today.
</P>
<P>
The issues include the implementation of WTO obligations and
on-going work on the built-in agenda, she told a briefing on the
G-15 trade and economic ministers' meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We will also review the status of the discussions being
undertaken by the various WTO Working Groups in the areas of trade
and investment, competition policy as well as transparency in
government procurement," she said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers' meeting, ahead of the G-15 leaders' summit on
November 3-5 here, will seek possible joint approaches in dealing
with multilateral trade issues ahead of the WTO Ministerial
Meeting in Geneva in May next year, she said.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 members at the pervious WTO Ministerial Meeting in
Singapore in 1996 agreed to reject extraneous issues in the WTO
such as the social clause and labor standards. They were also
united in the principle of progressive liberalization based on the
level of development.
</P>
<P>
The meeting next week would reinforce the common stance,
Rafidah said, adding that WTO Director General Renarto Ruggiero
would have a dialogue with the G-15 ministers to update them on
what is happening in the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Carlos Fortini is also scheduled to
have a dialogue with the ministers, she said.
</P>
<P>
Besides reviewing developments in the multilateral trading
system, the G-15 ministers would also focus on G-15 members'
cooperation in trade and investment and possible private sector
participation in the group, she said.
</P>
<P>
She added that the ministers would discuss trade and investment
facilitation measures such as information exchange, mobility of
business people and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to Rafidah, the G-15 ministerial meeting would be
independent of the leaders' summit.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 spans three continents and the present members are
Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, India, Indonesia,
Jamaica, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Senegal, Venezuela and
Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Army Officers From Southern Africa Simulate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 40 senior army,
police and civil servants from the southern African region who
attended a peace-keeping course in Zimbabwe simulated a
peacekeeping operation in Nyanga on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The senior officers were drawn from Zimbabwe, Mauritius, South
Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Malawi, Tanzania and Botswana.
</P>
<P>
They had been on a two-week peacekeeping course in Harare, and
went to Nyanga Thursday for their last practical lessons.
</P>
<P>
As part of the southern African regional peacekeeping efforts,
Zimbabwe was mandated in 1995 to coordinate peacekeeping training
courses for military and non-military personnel in preparation
for deployment to conflict areas.
</P>
<P>
The first regional peacekeeping commanders' course was held in
1995, with the second one last year and the third being the one
which ends today.
</P>
<P>
Commandant of the Zimbabwe Staff College Brigadier Hapton
Bonyongwe said the aim of the course, which started on October
13, was to teach senior officers the theory and practice of peace
support operations sponsored by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary-general of the Organization of
African Unity, will officially close the course code-named
"Operation Blue Rhino", in Harare today.
</P>
<P>
Course Director Colonel Richman Ncube said the intention was
to expose the senior officers to situations they were likely to
encounter when on peace keeping missions.
</P>
<P>
"While on peace missions," he said, "the soldiers must avoid a
situation in which they find themselves as part of the problem
instead of being a means to a solution."

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Construction is in full swing
on a new first-class international airport to relieve air traffic
congestion in Shanghai, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
The gigantic project on the eastern edge of Shanghai, covering
an area of 32 square kilometers and designed to contain four
runways and four terminal buildings, will be able to handle 70
million passengers and 5 million tons of goods when completed.
</P>
<P>
The first-phase construction, scheduled to be completed in
1999, includes a 4,000-meter runway and a 280,000-square-meter
terminal building able to accommodate 20 million passengers and
750,000 tons of freight. The first-phase construction is expected
to cost 12 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The new airport will augment Hongqiao International Airport on
the western edge of Shanghai which handled 12.35 million
passengers last year, far exceeding its designed capacity of 9.6
million.
</P>
<P>
The new project is being built under designs provided by Paris
Airport Company of France, which was awarded the bid over 29 other
international competitors.
</P>
<P>
"The designs take into consideration Shanghai as an
international financial, trade and economic center in the 21st
century," one spokesman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Export-oriented farming in
Heihe, a city in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, is
experiencing vigorous growth because of its natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Heihe exported about 9.4 million kilograms of vegetable and
fruits to neighboring Russia between January and May of this year.
</P>
<P>
Great demand for vegetables and fruits by the east part of
Russia has provided opportunities for the city to develop
export-oriented agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The city has brought 37,500 square meters of agricultural land
on line to produce vegetable seedlings, 160,000 square meters for
hot-houses and 6,000 hectares for planting vegetable and
fruits. The annual output of these fields is 150 million kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The city has built the largest storehouse in northeast China
for fresh vegetables. Storage capacity exceeds 1.3 million
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 20 kinds of agricultural products such as
beans and livestock have been exported to Russia. The city's
annual export volume is estimated at 715 million yuan (89 million
U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Teleconference Makes Long-Distance Medical Care Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- China's first wireless
long-distance consultation system, similar to a teleconference,
now makes it possible for a patient to stay at home and still
receive a doctor's treatment.
</P>
<P>
This long-distance medical care system has been instituted by
Shanghai Medicine University (SMU).
</P>
<P>
SMU has used the system to provide long-distance medical
consultation services in the No. 1 People's Hospital in Jingjiang,
a city in Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The wireless system can transmit 15 to 18 pictures per
minute. Experts can see each other on the screen, and give advice
on a specific illness. X-rays, electrocardiograms and ultrasound
photos can be shown on the screen if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The wireless system offers many advantages for residents of
remote areas of China. Tianjin and other areas in southern China's
Hainan Province have asked SMU to extend the service.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Ag-Science Companies Popular at Chinese Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A Ukrainian economic affairs
councilor in China, speaking at the China Jiangbei International
Agricultural Technological Fair in Qingdao, said that agricultural
machinery co-operation between the two countries has a good future.
</P>
<P>
The fair was held recently by the Ministry of Agriculture, the
State Science and Technology Commission, and the Qingdao Municipal
government as the only regularly-held agricultural fair at state
level. It attracted 14 agronomy institutes and companies from the
US, Japan, Germany and the Republic of Korea (ROK), and a group of
10 big Ukrainian agronomy institutes.
</P>
<P>
The official said that some Ukrainian businessmen think that,
since China still relies on manual labor for large-scale corn
harvesting, the market potential for the type of machinery on
display at the event is great. Also included were new foreign
agricultural products, high-quality seeds, fertilizer, irrigation
technology, and chemical products.
</P>
<P>
ROK's LG showed cultivation machinery that was well-received by
Chinese farmers. The Alaska 2000-type greenhouse and irrigation
equipment and technology of an Israeli and a US company also were
welcomed.
</P>
<P>
Farmers flocked to one of the exhibits that featured vegetable,
flower, and plant seeds from Germany's Agricultural Machinery and
Transportation Technological Trade Corp. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Chinese firms and foreign companies did a total of 90 million
US dollars worth of new technology and product deals. The
councilor says that, because of the fair's success he hopes to
establish a special institute to explore China's agro-technology
market.
</P>
<P>
Some agricultural officials from foreign embassies of developed
countries in China have contacted fair organizers to get
additional information.

<HEADLINE> England's World Cup Proposal Meets Setback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

CANBERRA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- FIFA general secretary Sepp
Blatter said on Friday that the ideal of hosting matches in Wales
and Scotland, which is included in the plan of England's bid for
the 2006 World Cup, would be evaluated by the world ruling body.
</P>
<P>
According to the FIFA regulations, the host country should
stage all matches within its borders. And England, Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland are four independent ruling bodies of FIFA.
</P>
<P>
So a match in Glasgow or Wales would be outside the area
controlled by England's Football Association.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said lawyers would evaluated the proposal, if it was
included in England's bid, to determine whether it violated FIFA
rules for staging the 32-team tournament.
</P>
<P>
Besides England, Germany, South Africa, Morocco, Argentina and
Brazil are also in the bid roster. The official bid plan must be
submitted in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Customs Office Helps Develop Export-Led Economy in Shanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Local customs officials in
northern Shanxi Province have played a big role in promoting the
development of an export-oriented economy in this land-locked
province, one of the major energy producers in China.
</P>
<P>
Since it opened in 1987, the Taiyuan Customs Office has helped
the province develop economic ties with other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
The customs office has taken measures to lower the cost of
imports and exports for local enterprises, also an inducement for
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
These efforts have paid off. To date, Shanxi has established
trade ties with 100 foreign countries and regions. In 1996, Shanxi
handled 1.21 billion U.S. dollars in imports and exports, nearly
six times the total for 1987.
</P>
<P>
The province now has 1,500 overseas-funded enterprises, with a
total investment of nearly two billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province's export and import processing was
valued at 240 million U.S. dollars, one-fifth of its total foreign
trade.
</P>
<P>
Local products selling well abroad include minerals, metals,
rolled steel, electronic and mechanical products, chemicals and
textiles.
</P>
<P>
With the help of customs officials, the province has begun
direct charter passenger flights to Hong Kong and charter cargo
flights to Russia.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, when the Taiyuan Port of Entry opened, customs made
further efforts to simplify the clearance procedure to make
imports and exports more efficient.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Meets Agricultural Minister of Netherlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Sino-Netherlands agricultural
cooperation has broad development prospects, Chinese Vice-Premier
Jiang Chunyun told Minister of Agriculture of the Netherlands
J.J. Van Aartsen here today.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting in Zhongnanhai, headquarters of the
central government, Jiang said that as a big agricultural country
China has made great progress. However, he said prospects are even
brighter for development because the country's farming potential
has not been fully exploited.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands has a well-developed agricultural base, Jiang
said, boasting advanced farming technology and management
expertise.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China will further open up its agricultural
sector to the outside world by stepping up exchanges and
cooperation with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Van Aartsen said the two countries have had successful
cooperation in the field of agriculture. The completion of two
jointly built training and demonstration centers in Beijing and
Shanghai showed the fruitfulness and smooth process of bilateral
cooperation in agriculture, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that the two countries will strengthen
cooperation in research and the training of management personnel.
</P>
<P>
Van Aartsen and his entourage attended the inauguration
ceremony of the Animal Husbandry Training and Demonstration Center
in Beijing on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They will attend the opening ceremony of a training and
demonstration center in Shanghai on Oct. 27.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Agriculture Minister Liu Jiang attended today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Van Aartsen arrived in Beijing today as Liu Jiang's guest.

<HEADLINE> Stocks of China Telecom (HK) Float in HK, NY </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- China Telecom (Hong Kong)
Co. Ltd. became China's largest fundraiser through stocks after it
successfully raised 4 billion U.S. dollars on overseas stock
markets.
</P>
<P>
Telecom's stocks began trading this week on exchanges in Hong
Kong and New York.
</P>
<P>
In its initial public offering, Telecom made a public offering
of 2.6 billion shares at an issue price of 11.8 Hong Kong dollars,
raising 30.6 billion Hong Kong dollars (about 4 billion
U.S. dollars), 27.5 times its price-earnings ratio.
</P>
<P>
The public offering, which closed Oct. 16, was over-subscribed
by a factor of 30.
</P>
<P>
"The successful listing represents an important step for
China's highly state-monopolized telecommunications sector,"
market analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Founded in March of this year, China Telecom underwent a
reorganization last month, absorbing the mobile phone assets in
Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces, thus pushing its total assets to
19 billion yuan (about 2.3 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Unlike other state telecommunication businesses, China Telecom
is an overseas-listed company incorporated strictly according to
international standards, though the state will hold 77.6 percent
of its total stakes with the rest owned by international
institutional investors and retail investors.

<P>
LONDON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
all extended Wednesday's losses and ended sharply lower as
shockwaves from Hong Kong's plunge rocked the markets.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index had dropped 222 points at one stage
early today before closing at 4,991.50 points, down 3.06 percent
or 157.3 points.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that Wall Street's relative stability in the face
of global stock market turmoil saved London prices from disaster.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that market movements were also exaggerated by the
new SETs trading system the London market adopted on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that more than 28 billion pounds (45.7 billion
US dollars) were wiped off the value of UK's leading stock index
and shares of companies that do business in Asia were among the
hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
Shares prices in Frankfurt also slid, with the DAX-30 index
closing at 3,977.26, down 194.19 points or 4.66 percent, once
again below the key 4,000-point level, as the plunge in Hong Kong
hurt sentiment.
</P>
<P>
A trader said that "while there is no real reason for us to
react so strongly to what goes on in Southeast Asia, the losses
are having a psychological influence".
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC-40 index followed the whole world and ended
101.19 points lower at 2,856.87.

<HEADLINE> Greece Comes to Standstill Due to General Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Greece was almost brought to a
standstill today as a 24-hour general strike nationwide was called
by the General Confederation of Greek Workers (GSEE), the largest
labour union in the country.
</P>
<P>
Striking workers throughout the country held rallies and
marched to the streets in demand for higher wages, a 35-hour
working hour and no cuts in social security benefits.
</P>
<P>
Banks and many shops remained closed all day while transport
were disrupted for several hours due to stoppages.
</P>
<P>
Ministries closed down for several hours as the civil servants
union staged a four-hour stoppage in support of the GSEE strike.
</P>
<P>
Several flights were delayed due to stoppages by Olympic
Airways employees and air traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
Several minor electricity blackouts were caused by a 48-hour
strike of the Public power company employees which started
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the northern Greek port city of Thessaloniki, striking
workers holding red and black banners staged a rally today in
front of the city's labour center. They also presented a
resolution calling for real wages increases in 1998 to the General
Secretary George Lyssarides of the Ministry of Macedonia-Thrace.
</P>
<P>
In the cities of Piraeus and Patras, striking workers also held
similar rallies.
</P>
<P>
Trade union official described today's strike as "a success"
with a 70 percent rate of participation in public utilities and as
much as 80 percent in parts of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally in Athens today, GSEE President Christos
Polyzogopoulos said that the large participation in the strike
sent a warning that contemplated restrictions in social insurance
rights would not pass, and measures were needed against
unemployment, with the establishment of a 35-hour week at the
forefront.
</P>
<P>
After the rally, striking workers marched to the Greek
Parliament and handed a petition to Parliament President Apostolos
Kaklamanis.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Searching for New Habitats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Chilai Doje, a 58-year-old
Tibetan farmer, has begun a new life with his family in Gama
Gyitang, a village on Yarlung Zangbo River in Tibet Autonomous
Region. Six years ago Gama Gyitang was barren land, covered by
stones and overgrown with weeds.
</P>
<P>
Doje said about 30 families of Tibetan farmers or herdsmen now
live at the village as part of a poverty-relief project launched
by the local government of Gyaca County.
</P>
<P>
With an investment of more than 1 million yuan (about 120,000
U.S. dollars), the local government of Gyaca has brought some 467
hectares of land under cultivation and relocated more than 1,000
Tibetans from remote mountains to flat land with rich soil.
</P>
<P>
Doje said he was uneasy at first after moving out of the
mountains, but that he now approves of the project.
</P>
<P>
"We now have enough food and fresh vegetables," he said.
</P>
<P>
Doje and his family farm on 1.5 hectares of land designated by
the local government. They plant crops such as highland barley and
wheat, and vegetables such as hot peppers, cabbage and garlic.
</P>
<P>
This year they have reaped 2,500 kilograms of grain and raised
70 head of cattles and goats.
</P>
<P>
"There is only a little land for farming in the mountains with
no irrigation system. In the past we often had to live on state
relief funds when the harvest was poor due to natural disaster,"
Doje said.
</P>
<P>
Soinam Chagba, Doje's neighbor, is also satisfied with the
quality of life after migration.
</P>
<P>
"The living conditions here are far better than that in the
mountains," she said. "Besides the high-grain-yielding rich soil,
the nearby road also provides us convenient transportation."
</P>
<P>
Chagba and her husband are making money by trading in local
products and raising herds. They plan to move into a new house
this year.
</P>
<P>
With 1,500 hectares of farmland and a population of 17,000,
Gyaca long has been one of the 18 most impoverished counties in
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
According to the comprehensive economic standards released by
the regional government, the village has risen above the poverty
level. Another 1,000 Tibetans are expected to emigrate from the
mountains, according to local sources.

<HEADLINE> EPA Agrees to Bury Nuke Waste in New Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, October 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Environment Protection
Agency(EPA) today preliminarily agreed with a plan to bury nuclear
waste in Southeastern New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The decision sets the stage for the so-called Waste Isolation
Pilot Plant, completed in 1988 at a cost of 1.8 billion U.S.
dollars, to open after two decades of heated debate.
</P>
<P>
The EPA said the final ruling will be made public next Spring
and the public has four months to comment on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have raised questions over many years about
the safety of the repository, such as curently drilling in the
area and hauling radioactive waste hundedss of miles to the
repository.
</P>
<P>
According to reports coming from New Mexico, the EPA promised
the respository would prevent human radiation doses higher than
the equivalenty of about 2 chest X-rays per year, and markers
would be placed around the site to discourage future generations
from mining or drilling in the area.
</P>
<P>
The repository would receive about 37,700 waste shipments over
the next 35 years. The waste shipments would largely come from
defense industry in 10 states, including California, Colorado,
Idahoalenty, Illinois, Nevada and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
The project is considered a part of a strategy for cleaning up
government nuclear wast sites.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Plunge on Asian Market Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
all extended Wednesday's losses and ended sharply lower as
shockwaves from Hong Kong's plunge rocked the markets.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index had dropped 222 points at one stage
early today before closing at 4,991.50 points, down 3.06 percent
or 157.3 points.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that Wall Street's relative stability in the face
of global stock market turmoil saved London prices from disaster.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that market movements were also exaggerated by the
new SETs trading system the London market adopted on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that more than 28 billion pounds (45.7 billion
US dollars) were wiped off the value of UK's leading stock index
and shares of companies that do business in Asia were among the
hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
Shares prices in Frankfurt also slid, with the DAX-30 index
closing at 3,977.26, down 194.19 points or 4.66 percent, once
again below the key 4,000-point level, as the plunge in Hong Kong
hurt sentiment.
</P>
<P>
A trader said that "while there is no real reason for us to
react so strongly to what goes on in Southeast Asia, the losses
are having a psychological influence".
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC-40 index followed the whole world and ended
101.19 points lower at 2,856.87.

XIAOLANGDI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Experts say the Xiaolangdi
Dam and reservoir will efficiently mitigate water shortages in the Yellow
River Valleys.
</P>
<P>
Water shortages along the river, China's second longest, are
caused by arid climate, diversion of water for industrial and
agricultural purposes and a lack of major water conservation
projects in the lower reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
Xiaolangdi Dam, being built in the middle reaches of the Yellow
River, is the second largest in China only after the Three Gorges
Dam under construction on the Yanytze.
</P>
<P>
Once in operation, the Xiaolangdi reservoir will supply 4
billion cubic meters more of water than the river does at present
to its lower reaches in spring and summer, when water supply is in
shortage.
</P>
<P>
The multipurpose project has a storage capacity of 12.6 billion
cubic meters, a level substantially higher than that of most of
China's reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
The amount of water used in the upper and middle reaches of the
Yellow River is increasing but the annual growth rate in water
consumption is dropping, experts say. Therefore, they add,
Xiaolangdi should provide ample water for irrigation, drinking and
power generation for many years.
</P>
<P>
Water shortages along the Yellow River lasted for 150 days last
year and 190 days this year.
</P>
<P>
Experts say careful use of water by residents and industrial
enterprises can mitigate the seriousness of water shortages.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai GM Announces Big Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Chinese trade
delegation witnessed here today another expensive signing in which
the Shanghai GM will purchase vehicle component sets worth 200
million U.S. dollars from General Motors Corporation (GM).
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai GM is partly a baby company of GM, the largest
auto maker in the world. It is an equally divided joint venture
launched formally in June this year in the booming Pudong New Area
of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for General Motors to export up to 18,000
component sets for a Buick mid-luxury car and its derivatives to
support pre-launch and start-up activities.
</P>
<P>
Singing the agreement were Hu Maoyuan, president of the
Shanghai GM, and Louis Hughes, executive vice president of General
Motors and president of GM's International Operations.
</P>
<P>
Hu said, "Approval of this agreement is an indication of the
significance of Shanghai GM. By enabling General Motors to export
a significant number of vehicle subassemblies into China, the
Chinese government is demonstrating their backing to expedite the
Shanghai GM project."
</P>
<P>
The 200 million U.S. dollars will be shared by both sides of
the investors, apart from the 1.5 billion U.S. dollars initially
agreed for building up the joint venture, according to Hu.
</P>
<P>
Hughes said that "We are pleased to provide the pre-launched
production support of Shanghai GM. The success of the Shanghai GM
is critical to our global strategies, in addition to providing an
excellent export opportunity from North America to China."
</P>
<P>
Shanghai GM was set up between the Shanghai Automotive Industry
Corporation and the General Motors. The new company is GM's 18th
venture in China. It is planned to manufacture and sell passenger
vehicles in China and for export.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that since the contract of the joint venture was signed
in Beijing in March 25, everything has been going on smoothly. He
said the two sides put up the signing ahead of schedule mainly
because the company is in urgent need of the components. The plant
is expected to roll out sample cars by the end of 1998. Official
production will start in April, 1999, according to the president
of the Shanghai GM.
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials attending the signing ceremony included Zeng
Peiyan, Vice Chairman of the State Planning Commission; Sun
Zhenyu, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation;
and Lu Fuyuan, Vice Minister of the Machine Building Industry.

<HEADLINE> China to Buy U.S. Wheat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Despite good harvests in
recent years in China, this country is prepared to buy wheat from
the United States, as a way of reducing trade deficit on the U.S.
side, a high ranking Chinese official announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Chinese Economic and Trade Delegation is going to make
an order for the commodity with an amount of 700,000 tons,
delegation head and Vice Chairman of the State Planning Commission
Zeng Peiyan said in an interview with Xinhua and local media.
</P>
<P>
"The move shows that China has been taking active measures to
solve the trade deficit problem and we want the U.S. side to
understand this practical attitude on the Chinese part," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said during the visit the delegation will make broad
contacts with the U.S. business community and try to lay foundation
for further cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The contracts worth as much as four billion U.S. dollars that
will be signed during the visit include also the purchase by China
of Boeing airplanes worth between two to three billion dollars, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, there are also other contracts expected to be signed
after the delegation comes back to China, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sun Zhenyu, deputy head of the delegation and Vice Minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation who joined Zeng in the
interview, said China is taking measures beneficial to foreign
exporters.
</P>
<P>
From October 1, China reduced tariffs from an average of 23
percent to 17 percent and by 2000 it will further reduce to the
average level of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Both China and the U.S. should make efforts to address trade
deficit, he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. enterprises should be more competitive against Europeans
and Japanese in terms of commodity prices and technologies and the
U.S. government should provide financial support including loans
on favorable terms to exporters and loosen restrictions on
high-tech exports, he continued.
</P>
<P>
Both Zeng and Sun expressed their conviction that the
forthcoming state visit by President Jiang Zemin to the U.S. will
produce positive results in promoting Sino-U.S. economic ties.
</P>
<P>
The discussions between him and President Bill Clinton late
this month are expected to cover bilateral cooperation in the
fields of energy (including nuclear energy), environment
protection and aerospace, said Zeng. He expressed hope that both
sides will reach agreements to create better conditions for the
cooperation between businesses of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The delegation arrived in New York on Tuesday after touring
Los Angles.

<HEADLINE> CPAFFC Bridges Sino-US Friendship (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Sister city relationships have
flourished since China and the United States established
diplomatic ties in 1979, Qi Huaiyuan, president of the Chinese
People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries
(CPAFFC), said this in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the CPAFFC, 28 pairs of provinces and states
and 89 pairs of cities of the two countries have established
sister city relationships, covering nearly every Chinese province
and medium-to-large city, he said.
</P>
<P>
Examples include ties between Beijing and Washington, D.C.,
Shanghai and San Francisco, and Guangzhou and Los Angeles, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The friendly relations among provinces, states and cities have
opened an important channel for semi-official and non-governmental
exchanges between the U.S. and China, Qi said, adding that the
sister city relationships have had a positive impact on the growth
of Sino-U.S. ties.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of CPAFFC's efforts is to increase mutual
understanding and friendship between China and the U.S., Qi
said. Because of this, he added, CPAFFC receives many visitors
from all walks of life in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, CPAFFC's guests from the United States have
included Brent Scowcroft, former U.S Assistant to the President
for National Security Affairs; Kentucky Gov. Paul Patton;
California Gov. Pete Wilson; San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown; and
Gary Locke, the first Chinese-American governor of Washington
state, he recalled.

<HEADLINE> Dow Tumbles in Global Selloff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average tumbled almost 200 points Thursday as a big selloff in
Hong Kong influenced other major markets, triggering a global
stock slide.
</P>
<P>
The Dow, an index of 30 multinational companies whose profits
have already been pinched by the mounting economic turmoil in
Southeast Asia, fell 186.88 to 7,847.77.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock measures also sank by about 2 percent, slightly
less than the 2.3 percent loss suffered by the Dow, which still
boasts a 21.7 percent gain for the year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's main stock index plunged 10 percent Thursday,
took an even heavier toll on other overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei stock average fell 3.0 percent in Japan, which
exports heavily to Southeast Asia. The FT-SE 100 fell 3.1 percent
in Britain. And in Germany, the DAX index fell 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
But once the investors pulled all that money out of stocks,
they put it onto the U.S. Treasury bonds. The sudden worldwide
demand sent bond prices soaring, and yields declined to 6.34
percent.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index has tumbled 25 percent this
week, which has deepened fears about weakening profits for
companies that depend on Asian markets for some of their profits.
</P>
<P>
Decliners outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-1 margin on the New
York Stock Exchange and by more than a 3-to-1 margin on the Nasdaq
Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume totaled 669.32 million shares as against the third
largest tally ever, and Nasdaq volume totaled 818.87 million
shares, the seventh busiest day ever.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 17.80 to 950.69, the
NYSE composite index fell 9.31 to 499.49, and the Nasdaq composite
index fell 36.83 to 1,671.25.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 8.89 to 449.36,
and the small-company dominated American Stock Exchange composite
index fell 10.35 to 703.39.

<P>
CPAFFC also has organized Chinese groups from such sectors as
economy and trade, urban development, environmental protection and
culture to visit the United States, the CPAFFC president said.
</P>
<P>
Qi, a veteran diplomat, told Xinhua that in recent years
exchanges between the two countries have reached a much greater
dimension than ever before. He said these exchanges are
encouraging for improved bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
As two of the biggest and most influential countries in the
world, China and the U.S. should establish a new cooperative
relationship oriented to the 21st century. This new relationship
should be based on mutual understanding and trust, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, many people in the political community and
non-government sectors of the U.S. either misunderstand or have a
biased view of China, Qi said, adding that CPAFFC still has much
to do to change these perceptions.
</P>
<P>
So that more people in the U.S. can learn more about China,
CPAFFC has encouraged exchanges between the young people of both
countries. Last year, jazz bands from Yale University and a
U.S. middle school performed in Beijing and Shanghai. Members of
the jazz bands also met with Chinese students in Qinghua
University in Beijing, Qi recalled.
</P>
<P>
To mark the signing of the Shanghai communique 25 years ago,
CPAFFC invited 85 students from 22 states in the U.S. to Shanghai
for talks with their Chinese counterparts, Qi said.
</P>
<P>
Qi said he believes that exchanges between the young people of
the two countries has laid a foundation for developing long-term
friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
CPAFFC has also established links with non-governmental
organizations in the educational, cultural, business and religious
sectors in the U.S. These organizations include the U.S.-China
People's Friendship Association, Harvard University, Yale
University, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Walt
Disney Group, the U.S. Press Editors Association and Time-Warner
Communications.
</P>
<P>
On the pending state visit by President Jiang Zemin to the US,
Qi said that Jiang's state visit will surely add to the great
impetus created by CPAFFC's work with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that CPAFFC will make more friends in the
political, entrepreneurial and press communities of the U.S. to
consolidate and expand the invaluable friendship between the
people of the two countries. He hopes that these friends will do
more things beneficial to the friendship between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
"In one word, we play a role of bridge and go-between for
Sino-U.S. friendship," he said.

<P>
WUHAN, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Shennongjia State Reserve in
central China's Hubei Province has become a hot spot for
scientific researchers from China and abroad who are intrigued by
its abundant geological resources and unique primeval forest.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jinxing, who has lived in the reserve for four years, is
fascinated by the mystery of its primitive inhabitants.

TAIYUAN, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Taiyuan, capital of Shanxi

<HEADLINE> US Homeownership Reaches A Record 66 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The homeownership rate in
the United States reached a record 66 percent during the third
quarter due in large part to the strong economy, Vice President Al
Gore said here today.
</P>
<P>
Gore said the new rate of homeownership, which was up from
65.7 percent in the second quarter of this year, broke the record
of 65.8 percent set during the third quarter of 1980.
</P>
<P>
It means that 66.7 million American families now own their own
homes, also the highest number in the U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
Gore told reporters in Washington that, while the economy was a
major contributor to the increases, the growth resulted in part
from the Clinton administration's fiscal policies, investment
priorities and overseas market openings.
</P>
<P>
Homeownership grew by 5.8 million families since Clinton took

<HEADLINE> Dow Tumbles in Global Selloff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average tumbled almost 200 points Thursday as a big selloff in
Hong Kong influenced other major markets, triggering a global
stock slide.
</P>
<P>
The Dow, an index of 30 multinational companies whose profits
have already been pinched by the mounting economic turmoil in
Southeast Asia, fell 186.88 to 7,847.77.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock measures also sank by about 2 percent, slightly
less than the 2.3 percent loss suffered by the Dow, which still
boasts a 21.7 percent gain for the year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's main stock index plunged 10 percent Thursday,
took an even heavier toll on other overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei stock average fell 3.0 percent in Japan, which
exports heavily to Southeast Asia. The FT-SE 100 fell 3.1 percent
in Britain. And in Germany, the DAX index fell 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
But once the investors pulled all that money out of stocks,
they put it onto the U.S. Treasury bonds. The sudden worldwide
demand sent bond prices soaring, and yields declined to 6.34
percent.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index has tumbled 25 percent this
week, which has deepened fears about weakening profits for
companies that depend on Asian markets for some of their profits.
</P>
<P>
Decliners outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-1 margin on the New
York Stock Exchange and by more than a 3-to-1 margin on the Nasdaq
Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume totaled 669.32 million shares as against the third
largest tally ever, and Nasdaq volume totaled 818.87 million
shares, the seventh busiest day ever.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 17.80 to 950.69, the
NYSE composite index fell 9.31 to 499.49, and the Nasdaq composite
index fell 36.83 to 1,671.25.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 8.89 to 449.36,
and the small-company dominated American Stock Exchange composite
index fell 10.35 to 703.39.

<HEADLINE> China to Buy U.S. Wheat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Despite good harvests in
recent years in China, this country is prepared to buy wheat from
the United States, as a way of reducing trade deficit on the U.S.
side, a high ranking Chinese official announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Chinese Economic and Trade Delegation is going to make
an order for the commodity with an amount of 700,000 tons,
delegation head and Vice Chairman of the State Planning Commission
Zeng Peiyan said in an interview with Xinhua and local media.
</P>
<P>
"The move shows that China has been taking active measures to
solve the trade deficit problem and we want the U.S. side to
understand this practical attitude on the Chinese part," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said during the visit the delegation will make broad
contacts with the U.S. business community and try to lay foundation
for further cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The contracts worth as much as four billion U.S. dollars that
will be signed during the visit include also the purchase by China
of Boeing airplanes worth between two to three billion dollars, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, there are also other contracts expected to be signed
after the delegation comes back to China, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sun Zhenyu, deputy head of the delegation and Vice Minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation who joined Zeng in the
interview, said China is taking measures beneficial to foreign
exporters.
</P>
<P>
From October 1, China reduced tariffs from an average of 23
percent to 17 percent and by 2000 it will further reduce to the
average level of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Both China and the U.S. should make efforts to address trade
deficit, he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. enterprises should be more competitive against Europeans
and Japanese in terms of commodity prices and technologies and the
U.S. government should provide financial support including loans
on favorable terms to exporters and loosen restrictions on
high-tech exports, he continued.
</P>
<P>
Both Zeng and Sun expressed their conviction that the
forthcoming state visit by President Jiang Zemin to the U.S. will
produce positive results in promoting Sino-U.S. economic ties.
</P>
<P>
The discussions between him and President Bill Clinton late
this month are expected to cover bilateral cooperation in the
fields of energy (including nuclear energy), environment
protection and aerospace, said Zeng. He expressed hope that both
sides will reach agreements to create better conditions for the
cooperation between businesses of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The delegation arrived in New York on Tuesday after touring
Los Angles.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai GM Announces Big Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Chinese trade
delegation witnessed here today another expensive signing in which
the Shanghai GM will purchase vehicle component sets worth 200
million U.S. dollars from General Motors Corporation (GM).
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai GM is partly a baby company of GM, the largest
auto maker in the world. It is an equally divided joint venture
launched formally in June this year in the booming Pudong New Area
of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for General Motors to export up to 18,000
component sets for a Buick mid-luxury car and its derivatives to
support pre-launch and start-up activities.
</P>
<P>
Singing the agreement were Hu Maoyuan, president of the
Shanghai GM, and Louis Hughes, executive vice president of General
Motors and president of GM's International Operations.
</P>
<P>
Hu said, "Approval of this agreement is an indication of the
significance of Shanghai GM. By enabling General Motors to export
a significant number of vehicle subassemblies into China, the
Chinese government is demonstrating their backing to expedite the
Shanghai GM project."
</P>
<P>
The 200 million U.S. dollars will be shared by both sides of
the investors, apart from the 1.5 billion U.S. dollars initially
agreed for building up the joint venture, according to Hu.
</P>
<P>
Hughes said that "We are pleased to provide the pre-launched
production support of Shanghai GM. The success of the Shanghai GM
is critical to our global strategies, in addition to providing an
excellent export opportunity from North America to China."
</P>
<P>
Shanghai GM was set up between the Shanghai Automotive Industry
Corporation and the General Motors. The new company is GM's 18th
venture in China. It is planned to manufacture and sell passenger
vehicles in China and for export.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that since the contract of the joint venture was signed
in Beijing in March 25, everything has been going on smoothly. He
said the two sides put up the signing ahead of schedule mainly
because the company is in urgent need of the components. The plant
is expected to roll out sample cars by the end of 1998. Official
production will start in April, 1999, according to the president
of the Shanghai GM.
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials attending the signing ceremony included Zeng
Peiyan, Vice Chairman of the State Planning Commission; Sun
Zhenyu, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation;
and Lu Fuyuan, Vice Minister of the Machine Building Industry.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Plunge on Asian Market Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
all extended Wednesday's losses and ended sharply lower as
shockwaves from Hong Kong's plunge rocked the markets.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index had dropped 222 points at one stage
early today before closing at 4,991.50 points, down 3.06 percent
or 157.3 points.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that Wall Street's relative stability in the face
of global stock market turmoil saved London prices from disaster.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that market movements were also exaggerated by the
new SETs trading system the London market adopted on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that more than 28 billion pounds (45.7 billion
US dollars) were wiped off the value of UK's leading stock index
and shares of companies that do business in Asia were among the
hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
Shares prices in Frankfurt also slid, with the DAX-30 index
closing at 3,977.26, down 194.19 points or 4.66 percent, once
again below the key 4,000-point level, as the plunge in Hong Kong
hurt sentiment.
</P>
<P>
A trader said that "while there is no real reason for us to
react so strongly to what goes on in Southeast Asia, the losses
are having a psychological influence".
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC-40 index followed the whole world and ended
101.19 points lower at 2,856.87.

<HEADLINE> Greece Comes to Standstill Due to General Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Greece was almost brought to a
standstill today as a 24-hour general strike nationwide was called
by the General Confederation of Greek Workers (GSEE), the largest
labour union in the country.
</P>
<P>
Striking workers throughout the country held rallies and
marched to the streets in demand for higher wages, a 35-hour
working hour and no cuts in social security benefits.
</P>
<P>
Banks and many shops remained closed all day while transport
were disrupted for several hours due to stoppages.
</P>
<P>
Ministries closed down for several hours as the civil servants
union staged a four-hour stoppage in support of the GSEE strike.
</P>
<P>
Several flights were delayed due to stoppages by Olympic
Airways employees and air traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
Several minor electricity blackouts were caused by a 48-hour
strike of the Public power company employees which started
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the northern Greek port city of Thessaloniki, striking
workers holding red and black banners staged a rally today in
front of the city's labour center. They also presented a
resolution calling for real wages increases in 1998 to the General
Secretary George Lyssarides of the Ministry of Macedonia-Thrace.
</P>
<P>
In the cities of Piraeus and Patras, striking workers also held
similar rallies.
</P>
<P>
Trade union official described today's strike as "a success"
with a 70 percent rate of participation in public utilities and as
much as 80 percent in parts of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally in Athens today, GSEE President Christos
Polyzogopoulos said that the large participation in the strike
sent a warning that contemplated restrictions in social insurance
rights would not pass, and measures were needed against
unemployment, with the establishment of a 35-hour week at the
forefront.
</P>
<P>
After the rally, striking workers marched to the Greek
Parliament and handed a petition to Parliament President Apostolos
Kaklamanis.

<P>
COLOMBO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- An attempt by Tamil rebels to
shoot down a Sri Lankan military helicopter carrying 35 soldiers
was aborted Thursday off the Mullaitivu coast in the northeast of
the country, security sources said today.
</P>

The rebels had targeted the helicopter from a sea craft but an
Mi-24 helicopter went quickly into action and destroyed the craft,
killing all the rebels on board.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the speedy action of the Mi-24 enabled the
transport helicopter to avert a major disaster.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the attack, the helicopter was moving troops
from Anuradhapura in North Central Province to a military camp in
Elephant Pass, Northern Province.
</P>
<P>
Though it was hit on one side of its tail, the chopper was able
to proceed to its destination.
</P>
<P>

their own in the north and east of the country for 14 years.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Fisheries and
Aquatic Resources Development Ministry has launched a special
program to develop the inland fishery sector, a ministry official
said today.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to net in 50,000 metric tons of fish annually
by year 2000 and to stop import of canned fish.
</P>
<P>
As an initial step, the ministry plans to provide houses for
inland fishermen near tanks and reservoirs where they are already
engaged in fishing. Each house builder will be granted 25,000
Rupees (424 U.S. dollars) under the program.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, such subsidy was only available for coastal fishermen.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has strengthened management in three fish breeding
centers in inland areas. A new center will be operative on
November 1, the official said.

<HEADLINE> EPA Agrees to Bury Nuke Waste in New Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, October 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Environment Protection
Agency(EPA) today preliminarily agreed with a plan to bury nuclear
waste in Southeastern New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The decision sets the stage for the so-called Waste Isolation
Pilot Plant, completed in 1988 at a cost of 1.8 billion U.S.
dollars, to open after two decades of heated debate.
</P>
<P>
The EPA said the final ruling will be made public next Spring
and the public has four months to comment on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have raised questions over many years about
the safety of the repository, such as curently drilling in the
area and hauling radioactive waste hundedss of miles to the
repository.
</P>
<P>
According to reports coming from New Mexico, the EPA promised
the respository would prevent human radiation doses higher than
the equivalenty of about 2 chest X-rays per year, and markers
would be placed around the site to discourage future generations
from mining or drilling in the area.
</P>
<P>
The repository would receive about 37,700 waste shipments over
the next 35 years. The waste shipments would largely come from
defense industry in 10 states, including California, Colorado,
Idahoalenty, Illinois, Nevada and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
The project is considered a part of a strategy for cleaning up
government nuclear wast sites.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Economic Zones' Exports Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Export earnings generated by the
Philippines' economic zones reached 7.3 billion U.S. dollars for
the first eight months of this year, rising nearly 83 percent from
the year-ago level of 4 billion dollars, local press reports said
today.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the export receipts came from special economic
zones, whose earnings grew by a whopping 193 percent to 4.4
billion dollars from 1.5 billion dollars of the same period last
year, said the reports, citing data from the Philippine Economic
Zone Authority (PEZA).
</P>
<P>
Among the special economic zones, the Laguna Technopark Inc.,
which houses Toshiba Information Equipment, posted the highest
revenues with 1.97 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Export earnings from the regular economic zones or those
managed by the government also registered slight improvement
during the period.
</P>
<P>
As of August, the four government-controlled economic
processing zones gained export receipts of 2.9 billion dollars, up
18 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
PEZA officials were quoted as explaining that the surge in
export earnings was due to the rising number of economic zones in
the country which attracted a large number of export-oriented
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
There are 54 economic zones or industrial estates in the
country, which have been a major foreign exchange earner for the
government in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the economic zones' export earnings hit 6.5 billion
dollars, accounting for one-third of the country's total export
income that year. The PEZA expected these zones to earn 10 billion
dollars in export income for the whole of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rice Production to Decline This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jakarta, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's production of
unhusked rice will drop to only 49 million tons, 4 percent lower
than the 51 million tons of 1996, a cabinet minister said.
</P>
<P>
"However, this should not cause too much worry because the
national rice stock remains stable thanks to last year's harvest,
which was quite successful," Minister of Agriculture Sjarifudin
Baharsjah said in Cirebon, West Java, reports reaching here today
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed the decline of rice production to the
prolonged dry season in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Logistic Agency, the national rice
stock is 3 million tons, enough for four to five months to come.
</P>
<P>
Baharsjah said that judging from past experiences, it is likely
that the coming harvest season will also be successful because
droughts are usually followed by good harvests.
</P>
<P>
He said next year's rice output may reach around 52 million
tons. He also called on farmers to use quality seeds to carry out
early planting to ensure a good harvest.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government also planned to increase rice fields
by 500,000 to 1 million hectares next year to boost production.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, formerly the biggest rice importer in the world,
became self-sufficient in rice production in 1984.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Upbeat on IMF Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian government officials
remain optimistic about talks with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) on an assistance package aimed at restoring confidence in
the country's financial markets.
</P>
<P>
"The talks continue and we are making progress. Yes, I am
optimistic," Trade and Industry Minister Tunky Ariwibowo said here
last night after meeting President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, Indonesia would not compromise on its national
car program, under which a private company is to manufacture
sedans in collaboration with Kia Motors of South Korea, official
sources today quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts have said scrapping the program may form part of
the discussions with the IMF.
</P>
<P>
"What we are discussing is how to synchronize our program,"
Tunky said. "Our program, such as the national car and
deregulation, will continue to be developed."
</P>
<P>
At a seminar on Wednesday, Charles Harinowo, director of the
central bank's Money Market Department, said the talks are
proceeding well and are at a final stage.
</P>
<P>
Neither Tunky nor Harinowo would say when the talks would be
concluded or what size the package might be.
</P>
<P>
However, they denied a report that the IMF team had concluded
its discussions and that details of any package would be announced
after an IMF board meeting in Washington at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia said on October 8 that it was approaching the IMF,
the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank for assistance in
restoring confidence in the markets and stabilizing the rupiah
which has depreciated by about 50 percent against the U.S. dollar
since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
State Secretary Moerdiono had said earlier that the IMF team
was in the final stage of discussions with Indonesian authorities
and that the talks could be over by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
World Bank officials have said the package is expected to
include financial and technical support for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has stabilized against the U.S. dollar as the market
is waiting for the announcement of the much talked-about financial
package from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the rupiah closed firmer against the U.S. dollar
at 3,560/90 compared to the opening of 3,610/30 in the morning
session after it reached its lowest level of 3,680 in midday
trading when the central bank stepped in with a small amount of
dollars, dealers said today.
</P>
<P>
As the rupiah stabilized, share prices on the Jakarta Stock
Exchange declined sharply with the main price gauge plunging below
500 points on regional market losses, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
The composite index closed 2.2 percent, or 11.09 points, lower
to 494.13 Thursday with a total 658 million shares changing hands
in the regular market valued at 136.85 million dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Civil Aviation
Ministry is to announce a fresh package of measures soon to allow
private sector airline operations, ministry sources said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The package is also expected to withdraw guidelines which force
airlines to operate on uneconomic routes and end the government's
monopoly on air traffic control services.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will retain the existing restrictions on
participation of foreign airlines in the domestic sector. Foreign
investors will be allowed to invest up to 40 percent in domestic
airlines while non-resident Indians/overseas corporate bodies will
be allowed to acquire stakes of up to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new policy will also allow domestic airlines to fly certain
international routes, though the first right of refusal will be
given to Air India/Indian Airlines.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Further Support Ukraine's Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States will give more
support to Ukraine's economic reform, Russia's Interfax news
agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. representative made the remark during the third meeting
of the economic cooperation committee of the Ukrainian-U.S. Joint
Commission, which ended here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The joint commission was set up in February, 1992, when
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma visited the United States. Its
last meeting was held in May in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Tigipko, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister in charge of
economic affairs and chief representative for the meeting, told a
press conference after the meeting that his country has so far
received more than one billion U.S. dollars in technological aid
since 1992, which surpassed all other countries in this field.
</P>
<P>
The United States has assisted Ukraine in hundreds of projects,
with investments totaling over 1.5 billion dollars, said another
senior Ukrainian representative.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides also stressed the importance
of maintaining the stability of the macro-economy in Ukraine and
the necessity of keeping the taxation reform, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to hold the next committee meeting in the
Spring of 1998 in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Further Devalues Taka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi currency taka
will be further devalued against the U.S. dollar by 0.89 percent
in buying and 1.11 percent in selling, the country's central bank,
the Bangladesh Bank, said today.
</P>
<P>
The buying and selling rates of the dollar will be 44.85 and
45.15 taka respectively from Sunday, compared to the present rates
of 44.45 and 44.65 taka.
</P>
<P>
The resultant change in the middle rate will be from 44.55 to
45.00 taka per dollar, according to a release issued by the bank.
</P>
<P>
This will be the 10th devaluation of the taka since the Awami
League government took power on June 23, 1996. The taka's value
has depreciated by a total of 8.61 percent in the last 14 months.
</P>
<P>
In earlier devaluations, the adjustment range in the buying and
selling rates was similar. But this time, the gap between the
buying and selling rates is widened from 0.2 to 0.3 taka per
dollar. This was done to encourage dealers to access the interbank
market rather than the central bank for their funds procurement
and disposal, the release added.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation will benefit the central bank and other
authorized dealers (banks) as they will buy dollars at lower
prices and sell it at higher prices, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Exporters will be affected as they will have to buy dollars at
a higher rate by paying 0.1 taka more for each dollar while
receiving 0.1 taka less for each dollar in their export bills.
</P>
<P>
The latest downward adjustment will also sensitize the foreign
exchange market. The price of the dollar, which is now traded at
more than 46 taka in the market, will increase further, observers
here said.

Bangladesh's efforts toward the construction of the Ganges
barrage, the minister said, adding that the Netherlands, Britain,

<P>
COLOMBO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Tourists continue to visit Sri
Lanka despite the October 15 bomb blast in Colombo which caused
great casualties and seriously damaged the downtown business
center, a senior official of the Ceylon Tourist Board said today.
</P>
<P>
During the first week after the blast, more than 7,000 tourists
arrived in Sri Lanka, statistics from the board said.
</P>
<P>
The official said that on October 16, the day after the
bombing, there were 1,150 tourist arrivals. However, Tourism
Minister Dharmasiri Senanayake said at a presidential news
conference last week that only 494 tourists arrived in the Sri
Lankan capital that day.
</P>
<P>
There were 288,000 arrivals from January 1 to October 21,
representing a 20-percent increase over the same period last year,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Total arrivals in 1996 suffered a 25-percent decline from
403,000 in 1995 to 302,265.

<P>
The Association of Group Tour Agents said that so far only
around 200 tourists had canceled their trip to this country due to

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb, French Military Leaders Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chief of the General Staff
of Bosnian Serb Forces, Pero Colic, today reiterated his army's
determination to abide by the Bosnian peace agreement (the Dayton
Peace Agreement).
</P>
<P>
Meeting with Zak Filip Duen, visiting chief of staff of the
French armed forces, in Pale, the capital of the Bosnian Serb
Republic (Srpska), Colic said the Bosnian Serb Forces will
contribute to regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton Peace Agreement, signed in December 1995 by
representatives from the three warring factions in Bosnia-
Herzegovina and international mediators, led to an end of the 3.5
years of war in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, Colic said the international community has been
pursuing a discriminatory policy towards Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
He is hopeful that the international community will treat the
different parties in Bosnia equally and without discrimination in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Duen said during the talks that the key way out of the current
crisis in the Republic of Srpska is to hold simultaneously the
presidential and parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Biljana Plavsic, who was elected president of the Republic of
Srpska in September 1996, is not getting along well with the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic declared on July 3 that the national assembly was
dissolved, but the Charter Court ruled on August 15 that Plavsic's
decision was invalid.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the political crisis has escalated. Plavsic called
for early parliamentary elections, which were supported by
Western countries including the United States, but the General
Staff of the Bosnian Serb Forces disagreed.
</P>
<P>
In September, President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
Slobodan Milosevic visited the Republic of Srpska for mediation
and proposed to hold simultaneously the presidential and
parliamentary elections.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Bund Mirrors Double-Faced Images to World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Strolling along the Shanghai
Bund of Huangpu River, every conscious man will slow down his pace
unconsciously at the striking images mirrored in the ripples of
its tireless waves.
</P>
<P>
Decades ago, the Shanghai Bund was awashed by the monotonous
waves but the tides finally turn into a harmonious chorus as the
Chinese people strike forward in quick paces with their strong
heartbeats.
</P>
<P>
Along the west side of the river, the chimes of the former
British Customs are in silence, while the neon lights of the
Oriental Pearl TV Tower flash out the shines in the east bank
throughout the night.
</P>
<P>
After decades of humiliation for the Chinese people, the
Shanghai Bund embraces the waves as a generous host to welcome all
the investors at home and abroad since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Once known as Paris of the East, Shanghai fell asleep into its
hibernation as flocks of foreign powers stamped their feet upon
the land, tagged as a fairyland for the Western venturers.
</P>
<P>
After the 1840 Opium War, the Britons circled out their first
international settlements in 1848 and the Bund became stink under
the footsteps of the American, the French, the German, the Czech
and the Japanese later, to cite a few.
</P>
<P>
The tides flow eastwards in their own rhythm, but Shanghai is
awakened eventually with the prosperity of Pudong at the east bank
of the Huangpu river.
</P>
<P>
Against the buildings with colonial colors in the west side,
modern skyscrapers surge upwards in queues in the east bank, with
the Oriental Pearl TV Tower as the symbol for Shanghai in new
breath.
</P>
<P>
The Western conquerers prohibited the Chinese from entering
their settlements along the Bund, while the Chinese people are
extending their arms to warmly welcome all the friends around the
world.
</P>
<P>
The boom in the 1930s was a hypocrisy, studded with evils and
disasters as the local poor were frozen to death along the streets
while the foreign rich threw their coats to warm their engines.
</P>
<P>
Nowsdays, investors from over 60 countries and regions have
since put their capitals of 23.07 billion U.S. dollars upon the land
of 350 square kilometers, which attracts 72 of the top 500
companies in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Oriental Pearl TV Power, the highest in Asia, received over
600,000 visitors in its first six months, and a 94-story 460-meter
skyscraper was already under construction on August 29 as the
Shanghai World Financial Center is on its way to become the
world's tallest building.
</P>
<P>
To erase the colonial stink, China embraced Hong Kong to its
arms on July 1, 1997, restoring the national pride for 1.2 billion
people.
</P>
<P>
Now, two cable-hanging bridges fly across the Huangpu river to
link the west and the east as Shanghai is pacing ahead from an
ancient fishing outpost to a modern metropolitan with greatest
success.

<HEADLINE> China to Establish Insurance System for Rural Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- China is working on improving
its social insurance system for old people in the countryside in
response to its aging rural population, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Civil Affairs said an improved
social old-age insurance security system will be established in
the country's rural areas by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, China's citizens aged 60 or older will account for
10.71 percent of the country's total population. And nearly all
Chinese farmers have to work their farmlands till they loss their
ability to do physical labor.
</P>
<P>
China started experimenting with a rural social old-age
insurance system in 1991, first in Yantai city of Shangdong
Province. It has expanded to cover more than 2,000 counties in 30
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The ministry officials said more than 82 million Chinese
farmers have so far joined the rural social old-age insurance
program, which offers a total of 12 billion yuan (about 1.45
billion US dollars) in insurance funds. China has rural population
of at least 900 million.
</P>
<P>
Under the current practice, farmers buy old-age insurance when
they are 20 years old. They pay annual premiums till they are 60
years old.
</P>
<P>
When they reach 60, the farmers will get a monthly insurance
payment of 100 yuan (about 12 US dollars) to 600 yuan (about 72 US
dollars) to support them in their remaining years.

<HEADLINE> Italy Trade Surplus - 20 B in First 8 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Italy's foreign trade continues to
improve with an estimated surplus of 36 trillion lire (about 20
billion U.S. dollars) in the first eight months of this year, the
Italian Foreign Exchange said here today.
</P>
<P>
The latest surplus resulted from exports worth 253 trillion
lire (14.2 billion U.S. dollars) and imports worth 217 trillion
(12.7 billion dollars), covering all operations, including
transactions less than 20 million lire, the office declared.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed a large increase in the surplus with the
U.S., which was up from six to eight billion dollars in the first
eight months.
</P>
<P>
According to the office, engineering and textile products are
still the strongest engine driving Italy's export success. Since
the country is lacking in energy resources, energy imports created
the largest deficits, costing more than 19 trillion lire (11
billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Province of China Still Powerful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
province remains a powerhouse in terms of talent, labour and
resources, although Chongqing Municipality has been seperated from
it.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by leading officials of the Sichuan
provincial government here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On March 14, China's legislative body -- the National People's
Congress -- approved a resolution on the establishment of
Chongqing Municipality. With three cities and one
prefecture, Chongqing Municipality now is the fourth and the
largest in China.
</P>
<P>
By losing Chongqing, Sichuan lost more than one-quarter of its
arable land, population and economic indexes.
</P>
<P>
However, Sichuan is still the country's third most populous
province with a population of 83.57 million, accounting for 6.8
percent of China's total.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the gross domestic product (GDP) of Sichuan, without
taking into consideration Chongqing's three cities and one
prefecture, was 298.5 billion yuan (36 billion US dollars),
ranking eighth in Chin.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Sichuan's live pig output ranked first in China and
its grain output ranked third. The output value of its
agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fisheries ranked sixth.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan's water resources total 140 million kilowatts, ranking
first in the country.
</P>
<P>
In Sichuan's Pangxi region, an average of 2.86 million kilowatt
hours of electricity can be generated per square kilometer.
</P>
<P>
Based on this output, the region is very likely to become
China's largest hydropower base.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan's reserves of 11 kinds of minerals rank first in China.
They include vanadium, titanium, lithium and silver. Its vanadium
and titanium account for 69 percent and 91 percent of China's
total respectively.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan abounds in tourist resources. Of China's seven scenic
spots included in the List of World Heritages of the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, three
are in Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
To cope with Sichuan's new situation after Chongqing became a
municipality, Sichuan has formulated a new development strategy
for its national economy at the turn of the century.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rate Cut Benefits State Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists and
enterpreneurs hailed yesterday's interest rate cut as an important
measure to reduce the debt burden on State-owned enterprises,
reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
China yesterday reduced the interest rates on deposits and
loans by an average of 1.1 and 1.5 percentage points respectively
after lowering the rates twice last year.
</P>
<P>
As more than 80 percent of the State banks' six trillion yuan
(722.89 billion US dollars) of loans flow to State-owned
enterprises, said an official with the Bank of China, the latest
rate cut means that the interest charges to these companies can be
reduced by 50 billion yuan (six billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to Huang Jinhe, vice-president of the State-owned
China First Automobile Group Co., his companies technical
renovation fund, capital investment and working capital fund
mainly rely on bank loans.
</P>
<P>
He said, the interest rate cut will save the company more than
100 million yuan (12 million US dollars) in interest, from the
total 120 million US dollars in interest annually.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Zhongwei, an official with China Huaneng Group, said 75
percent of the investment for his company's power plants come from
bank loans. The rate cut means the company can save 27 million
dollars in interest costs annually.
</P>
<P>
Dong Chen, a researcher with China Securities Co. Ltd, said the
rate cut will help build staying power for the country's sustained
economic growth by stimulating consumption and investment.
</P>
<P>
The rate cut would also result in a strong push for the
securities market, which will create a sound environment for
State-owned firms' transformation into joint stock companies, said
the economists.

<HEADLINE> UN Mission To Assess DPRK Food Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 23 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations delegation left
here today for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to
assess this year's harvest and evaluate food aid needed in that
country.
</P>
<P>
The mission, mounted jointly by the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) and the World Food program (WFP), is the latest
in a series to go to the DPRK since its agriculture was devastated
by floods in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The mission will estimate this year's harvest and evaluate the
country's food import requirements including food aid for the
coming year.
</P>
<P>
This year, serious drought hit the country in the crucial
growing months from June to August, and Typhoon Winnie breached
sea defenses and caused damaging floods later.
</P>
<P>
The last joint FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission,
which visited the DPRK in August, advocated urgent international
assistance in the form of food, agricultural rehabilitation and
vital inputs of seed and fertilizers.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Eighth Chinese National
Games has proved to be a world-class sports meet as quite a few
world and Asian records were broken with all the competitions
concluded here Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the weightlifting competitions, the first world
record was surpassed in the swimming pool when the 16-year-old
Chen Yan broke the 15-year-old world record in the women's 400
meters individual medley by clocking four minutes and 34.79
secoinds.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yanyan, 19, followed suit to beat the women's 200m
individual medley with a time of 2:09.72.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese swimmers also bettered nine Asian records and 12
national marks. And 10 gold medalists clocked the year-best times
in the women's events.
</P>
<P>
The men swimmers also made striking progresses by entering the
world top ten in five events.
</P>
<P>
In the track competitions, three women athletes surpassed the
world mark in the heats and two bettered the newly-established
record in the finals of the women's 5,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Bo clocked 14:28.09 and her teammate Dong Yongmei ran in
14:29.82 for a one-two finish for Liaoning province, their timings
all shattered the new record of 14:31.27 set by Dong in the heats.
</P>
<P>
The original mark of 14:36.45 was set up by Fernanda Ribeiro of
Portugal in Hechtel, Belgium on July 22, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Early, Jiang Bo won the women's 1,500m in 3:50.98, only 0.52
second shy of the world record.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Yanling, 29, won the women's discus title with a throw of
70 meters, the best result over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Li Xuemei, 20, broke the 11 seconds barrier in the women's 100
meters, claiming the gold medal in 10.79 seconds, the year's
second best time.
</P>
<P>
Chinese strongwomen displayed their dominance by breaking all
the world records in their nine categories while their man peers
also surpassed six world marks in their 10-class competitions.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese athletes were encouraged by the sports
officials to keep training for top forms in the world arena, as
the competitive atmosphere abroad will be more tough.

<HEADLINE> Czech Foreign Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Czech Foreign Minister Josef
Zieleniec Thursday resigned unexpectedly, saying that he found it
difficult to carry out his duties.
</P>
<P>
President Vaclav Havel accepted Zieleniec's resignation after
consulting with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
</P>
<P>
Zieleniec, 51, who has been the foreign minister since January
1993, told a news conference that he was also quitting as deputy
chairman of the ruling Civic Democratic Party (ODS) headed by
Klaus.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on his resignation, Zieleniec said his power in
decision making on major policies of the ODS was limited, and that
gave him little choice but to resign.
</P>
<P>
The resignation, which showed the intensity of internal
conflicts in the ODS, was responsible for a slight devaluation of
the country's koruna, which moved from 18.55 koruny against one
Deutsche Mark to 18.64.
</P>
<P>
Jaroslav Sedivy, Ambassador to Belgium and the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO), will reportedly assume the post of
foreign minister.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Lifts Price Controls on Cabbage (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is to lift price
controls on Chinese cabbage tomorrow to put this staple vegetable
under market controls, the municipal government has announced
recently.
</P>
<P>
The cabbage is the only item from the grocer's shelf still
under government controls in the capital, so the new measure will
completely free Beijing's vegetables from the controls of the
planned economy.
</P>
<P>
The end of autumn marks the time for China's northerners to
start stocking up on cabbages because of the vegetable shortages
in winter. More than 100 kg. of cabbage are usually needed to get a
family through the winter, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Although the demand for cabbage has declined in recent years,
people still cart it home in large quantities when the season
comes this year.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen thousand hectares of cabbage have been planted in
Beijing this year, and the cabbage will be on the market at
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The city is prepared for the price control removal,
according to Tao Zhiqiang, a city government official. With a
large variety of vegetables to choose from in winter, he said,
cabbage's status as the main family dish is in decline.
</P>
<P>
Cabbages now account for only one fifth of the vegetable sales
on the Beijing market.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Lefts Price Controls on Chinese Cabbage  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing has 40,000 hectares of land under vegetables, half of
which was developed after 1994, and it is increasing that amount
by 1,300 hectares annually. Better production and a large influx
of food from other parts of the country allow Beijing residents to
buy fresh vegetables like cucumbers, tomatoes, and celery
everywhere, even in winter.
</P>
<P>
As late as in the early 1990s, the selection was still limited to
cabbage, potatoes and carrots. The cabbage used to play a major role
in controling vegetable prices, because it was cheap and
plentiful, Tao noted.
</P>
<P>
State-owned vegetable market in Beijing sold some 100 million
kg of cabbage at 0.26 yuan (about 0.03 US dollars) a kg last
year. That was only one tenth of the price of tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
This year's cabbage price has not yet been revealed. However,
some residents said that a rise in price is inevitable. They said
"We'll treat it normally."
</P>
<P>
The municipal government will provide a subsidy of ten yuan to
residents who live below the poverty line to soften the blow of
the new policy on poor families.
</P>
<P>
"About 20,000 residents will receive the money before the end
of this month," said Ding Changli, a Municipal Bureau of Civil
Affairs official.

<HEADLINE> Red Tide Leaves 89 Tons of Dead Fish in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The red tide affecting the
Gulf coasts of Tamaulipas state have caused the death of some 89
tons of fish, Carlos Castro, Health secretary of the state said
today.
</P>
<P>
The official explained the most affected zones by the red tide
measuring some 420 kilometers (262 miles), from Matamoros to the
Almada village, in Tamaulipas.
</P>
<P>
Castro said the phenomenon has caused the death of dozens of
marine birds, such as seagulls and pelicans, and to prevent that
sanitary fills were created in the region.
</P>
<P>
Environment, Natural Resources, and Fishing Ministry sources
said that a state of alert continues taking effect in the zone and
a temporary ban on the capture of scale species was decreed.
</P>
<P>
The red tide appeared for the first time the first days of this
month in some areas of the Gulf of Mexico and disappeared a little
afterwards, but reappeared October 14 with more strength.
</P>
<P>
The red tide appears at the time of algae reproduction, that
thrive in the region diminishing the oxygen content of the water,
which in turn kills many marine species, mainly fish and birds
that feed on them.
</P>
<P>
This has prompted the decree of temporary interdictions,
because if some fish affected by the phenomenon are consumed by
humans, it can cause them intoxications.
</P>
<P>
The presence of the red tide in Tamaulipas coastal waters was
termed alarming, so the Navy Ministry and the Mexican Navy are
patrolling to prevent the capture of fish during the
interdiction.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Sees Lower Lending Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines has expressed confidence that banks' prime lending
rates would progressively go down to below 20 percent by the end
of the year, the local newspaper Manila Standard said today.
</P>
<P>
Central bank Governor Gabriel Singson was quoted as saying
Thursday that banks' lending rates are expected to drop as banks'
liquidity situation returns to normal with a two-percentage-point
reduction in liquidity reserves.
</P>
<P>
At the height of the currency crisis last month, the central
bank boosted banks' liquidity reserves requirement to a record
high of 8 percent in a bid to siphon off excess money from the
financial system.
</P>
<P>
But the move catapulted banks' lending rates, particularly
inter-bank call loan rates which once jumped to as high as 170
percent last month.
</P>
<P>
The central bank earlier decided to reduce the liquidity
reserves requirement to 6 percent, one percentage point down on
October 15 and another point on November 15.
</P>
<P>
Singson said banks would liquefy the special series government
securities they had earlier purchased from the central bank to
meet the hiked liquidity reserves requirement.
</P>
<P>
This is expected to immediately ease the pressure on the
inter-bank market and, consequently, lending rates, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He also assured the public that the country's banking system
remains in a relatively good shape given the present abnormal
market conditions.

<HEADLINE> State- and Non-State-Run Schools to Have Same Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Students of non-government-run
schools have finally had their student cards declared legal
documents, allowing them to enjoy various ticket discounts,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Teachers and students in non-government-run schools should
enjoy the same rights as their counterparts in State-run schools,
according to the Regulations for Non-government-run Schools which
took effect on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Students and teachers of these non-government-run schools have
even more reason to be happy: greater government support and
improved management supervision promises healthy development of
their schools.
</P>
<P>
The regulations will standardize this practice of equality and
push it forward, said Huang Rao, director of the Department for
Adult Education under the State Education Commission (SEC).
</P>
<P>
The regulations say that non-government-run schools are part of
the overall educational system.
</P>
<P>
The attractiveness of non-government-run schools will be
heightened for potential student and teacher applicants, said Liu
Xiaodong, an official from the National Association of Vocational
Education of China.
</P>
<P>
Delegates called for the establishment of a committee to bridge
the information gap between executive departments and school
operators. Statistics last year indicated that China had more than
50,000 non-government-run educational institutions, staffed by
400,000 teachers and serving 9.8 million students.

UNITED NATIONS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations today adopted a resolution demanding Iraq to
cooperate fully with the UN Special Commission in accordance with
relevant resolutions, which constitute the governing standard of
Iraq compliance.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was adopted with 10 votes for and 5 votes of
abstention, which are Russia, France, China, Egypt and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The Council has demanded in particular that Iraq without delay
allow the Special Commission inspection teams immediate,
unconditional and unrestricted access to any and all areas,
facilities, equipment, records and means of transportation.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Iraq's foreign minister Mohammed Said
Al-Sahaf on Thursday denounced the UN decision to consider
additional sanctions against Baghdad at any time.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahaf said the vote reflected a decision by Britain and the
United States "to impose their own sick motives and norms on the
Security Council."
</P>
<P>
"It is to our leadership and to the Iraqi people to decide what
are the alternatives, in order to protect our country against this
flagrant preparation to impose more injustices on our country and
our people," said the foreign minister.

<HEADLINE> Unravelling Mystery Of Old Tibetan Court Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A recent performance of
300-year-old court music in Tibet presented music that had to be
deciphered by a Tibetan musician.
</P>
<P>
Guengdui Pagya, a 44-year-old assistant professor at Tibet
University, began to work on a collection of court music five
years ago that was the only Tibetan court music in existence. He
has done a fifth of the pieces in the collection, which date back
to the period of the fifth Dalai Lama, more than 300 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Scholars explain that traditional Tibetan music includes folk
music, Buddhist music, and court music. During the life of the
fifth Dalai Lama court music reached its highest point. In 1688,
the local governments brought a group of folk artists to Lhasa to
collect court music.
</P>
<P>
The music scores were in Tibetan and some have been
lost. Others were handed down orally, and have greatly changed in
style and content in the 300-year period.
</P>
<P>
So, what does the original court music sound like? This
question has puzzled musicians for years.
</P>
<P>
The music tells maily of history and religion. There are also
some drinking songs. Scholars say that these versions that have
the same title as oral versions, are simpler, more lively, and
unsophisticated, and some have a Nepali flavor or an Islamic
influence.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Army Attracts More College Graduates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Forty-three percent of China's
low-ranking army officers have college diplomas, nearly 54 times
the number of 1979.
</P>
<P>
In the early years of China's reform, more than 71 percent of
the junior officers of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) had only
a secondary school education, according to statistics released
today.
</P>
<P>
The Central Military Commission ordered in 1980 that junior
officers should receive higher education in military academies.
</P>
<P>
In the past 17 years, 260,000 low-ranking officers graduated
from cadet training.
</P>
<P>
Correspondence and self-study programs also boosted the
education level for officers. Of the 260,000 officers who
graduated, 20 percent took correspondence courses to gain college
diplomas.
</P>
<P>
The central military authorities have ordered that
cadet-trained officers would comprise 70 percent of the whole
force by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, Chairman of the Central Military Commission, said
the PLA should train a great number of junior and senior officers
in technology, tactics and strategy.
</P>
<P>
Civilian college graduates have also been encouraged to join
the PLA if trained in military academies.
</P>
<P>
Chinese army officers historically were from rural and poor
families, especially before 1949.

<HEADLINE> Why It Is Difficult to Buy Clothes for Kids in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- While women always enjoy
shopping, Chinese mothers in large cities less do so when hunting
clothes for their children.
</P>
<P>
It is not rare they have to look into one department store after
another, but still fail to have the right choice for their "little
emperors."
</P>
<P>
It is certainly not the matter of shortage since colorful
children's wears are packed on stores' shelves as well as the
show-windows.
</P>
<P>
In analyzing the worry, an article in "China Business Daily,"
organ of the Ministry of Internal Trade, pointed out that one
problem lies in the style of the children's wear.
</P>
<P>
"Too many children's clothes are too fashion-conscious and too
redundant in designs," it noted.
</P>
<P>
Another shortfall is the lack of specifications. "Children are
growing faster and fatter, but the market does not respond to this
change quickly enough," experts concluded.
</P>
<P>
The high pricing is also a reason to shun away buyers. In a
department store, one can easily find high-priced foreign
brand-names make a bulk of the children's wear market.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cave Dweller Becomes Entrepreneur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese farmer left the cave he
lived in, in China's Shandong province and, through a long process
became a successful businessman and is now taking courses in
business management at Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jiakun's story starts in 1984. That was when the then
27-year-od farmer in Jiujianpeng village left the isolation of
Longshan Mountain where he was born and had grown up. A year
later, he returned to his village, with his eyes open wider and
with more ambition and a determination to help other villagers
improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
He began with a road improvement program to help the isoated
people get in contact with the outside world he had seen. Three
years of hard labor resulted in a better road, a stone products
factory, and a farm for breeding animals. People's lives improved
considerably, and by 1990, Liu had become a role model and his
village became known for its successful struggle against adverse
conditions.
</P>
<P>
But the real challenge came in 1991 when Chinese farmers were
given greater freedom to participate in market competition, and
Liu began to see that there would be no market if they stayed in
the mountains.
</P>
<P>
So, he set his sights on urban areas. With county government's
approval, the village set up a granite processing plant in the
county seat, and two quarries. It also opened a machinery parts
factory together with one of China's major industrial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
By 1996, Jiujianpeng Industries Co., with Liu as general
manager, had more than 1.4 million yuan in profits. The poorly
dressed cave dweller now wears a neat Western suit. "It's the
reform policy that has offered us opportunities to improve our
lot," he said.
</P>
<P>
Now about half of the villagers have moved down to the county
proper and work in village-run businesses, while the others
work on acreage that all can use. Most by now live in
multi-story buildings. Some even have motor cycles or cars.
</P>
<P>
And the mobile phone, address book, and economics books in
Liu's handbag aren't there just for the fun of it but for
practical use. "Our business is expanding rapidly, we're making
more friends, and we have a lot to learn," he said.
</P>
<P>
While he is away studying, his assistants look after the
business. "Ours are township enterprises, but are developing
fast. We must try to follow advanced production and management
technology," he said.

<HEADLINE> Number of AIDS Patients to Triple in Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The number of Ukrainians infected
with the HIV virus is expected to triple by the end of 1998 and
continue to increase for decades, officials from the National AIDS
Prevention Committee said today.
</P>
<P>
"The AIDS epidemic will continue to spread rapidly for another
20 years or so," said head of the committee Valery Ivasyuk at a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said even if the government steps up its AIDS awareness and
prevention campaigns, an improvement in results might not be seen
for many year considering Ukraine's living standards.
</P>
<P>
In Switzerland, the AIDS rate has started to go down after 15
years' of active campaigning.
</P>
<P>
The number of AIDS patients is increasing by 1,500 per month in
Ukraine. Most of the victims are young drug addicts between the
ages of 15-29. At the beginning of 1995, the number of registered
AIDS patients in the country reached 25,000.
</P>
<P>
Lev Khodakevytch, advisor to a U.N. AIDS program in Ukraine,
Belarus and Moldova, suggested the Ukraine focus on educating its
population in order to guard against infection rather than merely
monitor those who have already contracted the disease.
</P>
<P>
When AIDS began to spread among intravenous drug users in 1995
in southern Ukrainian cities, the government initiated a program
to combat it by equipping blood donor centers with modern AIDS
testing systems, training doctors and educating high-risk groups.
</P>
<P>
However, the program languished due to a lack of funds. In the
first eight months of 1997, the National AIDS Prevention Committee
received only 42 percent of the total needed funds, and received
60 percent and 18 percent of the needed funds in 1995 and 1996.

HAIKOU, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The economy of Haikou, the
capital of China's Hainan province, has been growing at an
accelerated pace this year, and is greater than for any comparable
period since 1993, said Leng Xiaoming, deputy mayor in charge of
economic work.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that Haikou's municipal GDP was 6.9
billion yuan (about 830 million US dollars) during the
January-September period, with 4.8 billion yuan in industrial
output value.
</P>
<P>
Haikou's state-owned industrial sector grew 14.1 percent in the
first nine months and the collective-owned industry a large 37
percent.
</P>
<P>
Leng said that Haikou's economic quality has also improved,
with state-owned enterprises getting more than 12 million yuan in
profits in the eight months to August, compared with over 70
million yuan in losses for the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months, Haikou put 2.2 billion yuan into
fixed assets, according to Leng, and he predicts that the annual
figure will reach 6.6 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> NZ Dollar Sinks to Three-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand dollar has
been on a drastic decline in trading with the American dollar in
the past two days, sinking to a three-year low at yesterday's
close.
</P>
<P>
The Kiwi closed at 0.6253 U.S. dollars Wednesday, after
plunging more than 1 U.S. cent on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fall was triggered off by heavy selling of the Kiwi
following negative news about the impact of weak Asian economies
on Australia and New Zealand, both large traders with Asia.
</P>
<P>
A dealer said there were talks in the financial market of one
sell order by a North American institution of about 1 billion NZ
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers' views about the Kiwi's prospects varied, with one
forecasting that the currency would fall to as low as 60 U.S.
cents in the next three to six months. But most of them seem to
believe that it would not go higher.
</P>
<P>
The investment company Goldman Sachs said recent difficulties
in Southeast Asia were likely to be an economic shock for
Australia and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The Asian currency devaluations would slash import demand from
the Asian region, which took 52 percent of Australian exports and
26 percent of New Zealand exports.
</P>
<P>
However, the NZ Manufacturers' Federation sees the decline in
the Kiwi as a two-edged sword for manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
On one hand, said federation chief executive Simon Arnold, weak
currencies, weak consumer demand and infrastructural problems in
Southeast Asian countries could reduce sales for NZ manufacturers
exporting to the region.
</P>
<P>
On the other, he said, a weaker NZ dollar would allow exporters
to boost their ability to compete in Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
It would benefit exporters by increasing their overall
competitiveness in international markets, he argued.

<HEADLINE> Dow Tumbles in Global Selloff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average tumbled almost 200 points Thursday as a big selloff in
Hong Kong influenced other major markets, triggering a global
stock slide.
</P>
<P>
The Dow, an index of 30 multinational companies whose profits
have already been pinched by the mounting economic turmoil in
Southeast Asia, fell 186.88 to 7,847.77.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock measures also sank by about 2 percent, slightly
less than the 2.3 percent loss suffered by the Dow, which still
boasts a 21.7 percent gain for the year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's main stock index plunged 10 percent Thursday,
took an even heavier toll on other overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei stock average fell 3.0 percent in Japan, which
exports heavily to Southeast Asia. The FT-SE 100 fell 3.1 percent
in Britain. And in Germany, the DAX index fell 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
But once the investors pulled all that money out of stocks,
they put it onto the U.S. Treasury bonds. The sudden worldwide
demand sent bond prices soaring, and yields declined to 6.34
percent.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index has tumbled 25 percent this
week, which has deepened fears about weakening profits for
companies that depend on Asian markets for some of their profits.
</P>
<P>
Decliners outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-1 margin on the New
York Stock Exchange and by more than a 3-to-1 margin on the Nasdaq
Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume totaled 669.32 million shares as against the third
largest tally ever, and Nasdaq volume totaled 818.87 million
shares, the seventh busiest day ever.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 17.80 to 950.69, the
NYSE composite index fell 9.31 to 499.49, and the Nasdaq composite
index fell 36.83 to 1,671.25.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 8.89 to 449.36,
and the small-company dominated American Stock Exchange composite
index fell 10.35 to 703.39.

<HEADLINE> China to Buy U.S. Wheat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Despite good harvests in
recent years in China, this country is prepared to buy wheat from
the United States, as a way of reducing trade deficit on the U.S.
side, a high ranking Chinese official announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Chinese Economic and Trade Delegation is going to make
an order for the commodity with an amount of 700,000 tons,
delegation head and Vice Chairman of the State Planning Commission
Zeng Peiyan said in an interview with Xinhua and local media.
</P>
<P>
"The move shows that China has been taking active measures to
solve the trade deficit problem and we want the U.S. side to
understand this practical attitude on the Chinese part," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said during the visit the delegation will make broad
contacts with the U.S. business community and try to lay foundation
for further cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The contracts worth as much as four billion U.S. dollars that
will be signed during the visit include also the purchase by China
of Boeing airplanes worth between two to three billion dollars, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, there are also other contracts expected to be signed
after the delegation comes back to China, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sun Zhenyu, deputy head of the delegation and Vice Minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation who joined Zeng in the
interview, said China is taking measures beneficial to foreign
exporters.
</P>
<P>
From October 1, China reduced tariffs from an average of 23
percent to 17 percent and by 2000 it will further reduce to the
average level of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Both China and the U.S. should make efforts to address trade
deficit, he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. enterprises should be more competitive against Europeans
and Japanese in terms of commodity prices and technologies and the
U.S. government should provide financial support including loans
on favorable terms to exporters and loosen restrictions on
high-tech exports, he continued.
</P>
<P>
Both Zeng and Sun expressed their conviction that the
forthcoming state visit by President Jiang Zemin to the U.S. will
produce positive results in promoting Sino-U.S. economic ties.
</P>
<P>
The discussions between him and President Bill Clinton late
this month are expected to cover bilateral cooperation in the
fields of energy (including nuclear energy), environment
protection and aerospace, said Zeng. He expressed hope that both
sides will reach agreements to create better conditions for the
cooperation between businesses of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The delegation arrived in New York on Tuesday after touring
Los Angles.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai GM Announces Big Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Chinese trade
delegation witnessed here today another expensive signing in which
the Shanghai GM will purchase vehicle component sets worth 200
million U.S. dollars from General Motors Corporation (GM).
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai GM is partly a baby company of GM, the largest
auto maker in the world. It is an equally divided joint venture
launched formally in June this year in the booming Pudong New Area
of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for General Motors to export up to 18,000
component sets for a Buick mid-luxury car and its derivatives to
support pre-launch and start-up activities.
</P>
<P>
Singing the agreement were Hu Maoyuan, president of the
Shanghai GM, and Louis Hughes, executive vice president of General
Motors and president of GM's International Operations.
</P>
<P>
Hu said, "Approval of this agreement is an indication of the
significance of Shanghai GM. By enabling General Motors to export
a significant number of vehicle subassemblies into China, the
Chinese government is demonstrating their backing to expedite the
Shanghai GM project."
</P>
<P>
The 200 million U.S. dollars will be shared by both sides of
the investors, apart from the 1.5 billion U.S. dollars initially
agreed for building up the joint venture, according to Hu.
</P>
<P>
Hughes said that "We are pleased to provide the pre-launched
production support of Shanghai GM. The success of the Shanghai GM
is critical to our global strategies, in addition to providing an
excellent export opportunity from North America to China."
</P>
<P>
Shanghai GM was set up between the Shanghai Automotive Industry
Corporation and the General Motors. The new company is GM's 18th
venture in China. It is planned to manufacture and sell passenger
vehicles in China and for export.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that since the contract of the joint venture was signed
in Beijing in March 25, everything has been going on smoothly. He
said the two sides put up the signing ahead of schedule mainly
because the company is in urgent need of the components. The plant
is expected to roll out sample cars by the end of 1998. Official
production will start in April, 1999, according to the president
of the Shanghai GM.
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials attending the signing ceremony included Zeng
Peiyan, Vice Chairman of the State Planning Commission; Sun
Zhenyu, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation;
and Lu Fuyuan, Vice Minister of the Machine Building Industry.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Plunge on Asian Market Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
all extended Wednesday's losses and ended sharply lower as
shockwaves from Hong Kong's plunge rocked the markets.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index had dropped 222 points at one stage
early today before closing at 4,991.50 points, down 3.06 percent
or 157.3 points.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that Wall Street's relative stability in the face
of global stock market turmoil saved London prices from disaster.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that market movements were also exaggerated by the
new SETs trading system the London market adopted on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that more than 28 billion pounds (45.7 billion
US dollars) were wiped off the value of UK's leading stock index
and shares of companies that do business in Asia were among the
hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
Shares prices in Frankfurt also slid, with the DAX-30 index
closing at 3,977.26, down 194.19 points or 4.66 percent, once
again below the key 4,000-point level, as the plunge in Hong Kong
hurt sentiment.
</P>
<P>
A trader said that "while there is no real reason for us to
react so strongly to what goes on in Southeast Asia, the losses
are having a psychological influence".
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC-40 index followed the whole world and ended
101.19 points lower at 2,856.87.

<HEADLINE> Greece Comes to Standstill Due to General Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Greece was almost brought to a
standstill today as a 24-hour general strike nationwide was called
by the General Confederation of Greek Workers (GSEE), the largest
labour union in the country.
</P>
<P>
Striking workers throughout the country held rallies and
marched to the streets in demand for higher wages, a 35-hour
working hour and no cuts in social security benefits.
</P>
<P>
Banks and many shops remained closed all day while transport
were disrupted for several hours due to stoppages.
</P>
<P>
Ministries closed down for several hours as the civil servants
union staged a four-hour stoppage in support of the GSEE strike.
</P>
<P>
Several flights were delayed due to stoppages by Olympic
Airways employees and air traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
Several minor electricity blackouts were caused by a 48-hour
strike of the Public power company employees which started
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the northern Greek port city of Thessaloniki, striking
workers holding red and black banners staged a rally today in
front of the city's labour center. They also presented a
resolution calling for real wages increases in 1998 to the General
Secretary George Lyssarides of the Ministry of Macedonia-Thrace.
</P>
<P>
In the cities of Piraeus and Patras, striking workers also held
similar rallies.
</P>
<P>
Trade union official described today's strike as "a success"
with a 70 percent rate of participation in public utilities and as
much as 80 percent in parts of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally in Athens today, GSEE President Christos
Polyzogopoulos said that the large participation in the strike
sent a warning that contemplated restrictions in social insurance
rights would not pass, and measures were needed against
unemployment, with the establishment of a 35-hour week at the
forefront.
</P>
<P>
After the rally, striking workers marched to the Greek
Parliament and handed a petition to Parliament President Apostolos
Kaklamanis.

<HEADLINE> EPA Agrees to Bury Nuke Waste in New Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, October 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Environment Protection
Agency(EPA) today preliminarily agreed with a plan to bury nuclear
waste in Southeastern New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The decision sets the stage for the so-called Waste Isolation
Pilot Plant, completed in 1988 at a cost of 1.8 billion U.S.
dollars, to open after two decades of heated debate.
</P>
<P>
The EPA said the final ruling will be made public next Spring
and the public has four months to comment on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have raised questions over many years about
the safety of the repository, such as curently drilling in the
area and hauling radioactive waste hundedss of miles to the
repository.
</P>
<P>
According to reports coming from New Mexico, the EPA promised
the respository would prevent human radiation doses higher than
the equivalenty of about 2 chest X-rays per year, and markers
would be placed around the site to discourage future generations
from mining or drilling in the area.
</P>
<P>
The repository would receive about 37,700 waste shipments over
the next 35 years. The waste shipments would largely come from
defense industry in 10 states, including California, Colorado,
Idahoalenty, Illinois, Nevada and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
The project is considered a part of a strategy for cleaning up
government nuclear wast sites.
