<HEADLINE> Britain's Labor Government to Set Up People's Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Labor government is
planning to set up a 5,000-strong "people's panel" to test public
reaction to the government's policies and to the performance of
public services.
</P>
<P>
British government officials were quoted by local press reports
as saying that the initiative, the first in the world, is expected
to be fully operational by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Government ministers agreed that the brand-new project was
aimed at keeping the government in tune with public opinion
between elections, they said.
</P>
<P>
Peter Kilfoyle, the public service minister, said that it was
also an important way of addressing the gulf between politicians
and voters.
</P>
<P>
"Too often the assumption is made that Whitehall knows best. We
think it is a good idea to consult people regularly rather than
waiting until once every five years to find out if we are right,"
Kilfoyle said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Cabinet Office proposals, members of the panel would
be asked their opinions on the level and quality of service
provided by utility companies -- gas, water and electricity -- and
of public transport.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Warns Palestinians Over Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binaymin
Netanyahu spelt out today a stern warning to the Palestinians that
they would pay a heavy price if the violence in Hebron worsens.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the first cabinet meeting since the reshuffle last
week, Netanyahu said the first and foremost cause for the current
crisis was because the Palestinians failed to live with the
current government which was different from the previous Labor
government.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Labor government continued handing over assets
to the Palesitnian National Auhtority (PNA) in spite of terrorist
attacks over a year ago, Netanyahu stressed his government is not
prepared to go the way as the Labor government on issues of
terrorism, Jerusalem and the return to 1967 borders.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to reach a deal, but not at any price," Netanyahu
said, adding that the basis for ending the current crisis and
renewing diplomatic negotiations was that the PNA must fulfill its
commitments on protecting Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is to prevent worsening of the situation, but if
there is worsening of situation on the other side, it will carry a
very heavy price," Netanyahu warned.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, Army Chief of Staff Amnon
Shahak and other security officials briefed the cabinet on the
current security situation in the Palestinian territories, where
clashes between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers continued
escalating.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said that despite the current situation, Israeli
people enjoyed a greater level of security than they did a year
ago. He believed that the PNA was still making efforts to prevent
terrorist attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Both Mordechai and Foreign Minister David Levy denied that
there were any diplomatic constraints on the Israeli troops'
operations in controlling the Palestinian violence. Mordechai said
the soldiers were given freedom of operation, though the firing
orders have not been changed.
</P>
<P>
Levy pointed out that there was a chance for all to return to
diplomatic negotiations: it is within the context of Israeli
insistence on demands that the PNA should prevent terrorism and
violence.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister added Israel has repeatedly stressed to
the PNA that the prevention of terrorism and violence was the
basic law for renewing negotiations, and the PNA should not wish
to achieve what it had hoped for during the term of the previous
Labor government.
</P>
<P>
Outside the Prime Minister's Office building, dozens of
settlers from Hebron held a demonstration to demand the
government take tougher measures to end the Palestinian violence.
</P>
<P>
In Hebron, the daily scene of violent clashes between
Palestinian youths and Israeli soldiers continued. A dozen of
Palestinians, and five reporters employed by foreign news
organizations, were injured by Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers erected huge concrete barriers in an attempt
to prevent Palestinian protesters getting near the Jewish
quarter, but failing to put an end to the violence. Palestinian
youths threw stones and firebombs at Israeli soldiers, who
responded with plastic bullets.

on Sunday to become the first two gold medal winners at the Eighth
Pan-Arab Games here.
</P>
<P>
Mansouri registered two hours, 28 minutes and 19 seconds, a
result making him the first athlete to successfully defend his or
her title at these games.
</P>
<P>
Mostafa Seleiman from Egypt won the silver at 2:30:46.
</P>
<P>
Mayal, 34, clocked 1:26:41 in the women's half marathon,
followed by Thania Askoum of Tunis in the second place with
1:28:13 and Jordan's Amari Mutari in the third at 1:29:08.
</P>
<P>
The games, attended by thousands of athletes from 19 Arab
countries, were officially opened on Saturday night but
competition began on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic
Committee who is currently in Beirut to attend the opening
ceremony of the games, spoke highly of the organization works
carried out by Lebanon in order to make the games successful.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference here, Samaranch said Asia is the best
region of the world in organizing sports events, and he believed
Lebanon will successfully host the Asian Cup football tournament
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Apparent alluding to an exclusion of Iraq from the games,
Samaranch underlined the importance of separating politics from
sports.
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid a boycott by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia,
Lebanese authorities refused the entry of 95 Iraqi athletes to
participate in the games, forcing the Iraqis to return to their
home country after waiting for two days on the Syrian-Lebanese
border.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Expects to Win Southeast Asian Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela, who is visiting Southeast Asia, is likely to
promote South Africa's trade with Indonesia and Thailand, trading
sources has predicted.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and Thailand, Asia's two economic tigers Mandela is
visiting this week, have an import shopping list for 1997
estimated at over 20 billion U.S. Dollars, according to Reed
Business Information South Africa (RBISA).
</P>
<P>
"That adds up to vast opportunities for South African
enterprises wanting to take export advantage of the spending
power of these two countries at U.S. dollar rates, RBISA
spokesman Paresh Pandya said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's fruit and wine industries regard Thailand as a
new market, Pandya said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the food processing field, Pandya said, Indonesia
was planning to spend 415 million U.S. Dollars on equipment to
expand its food processing and packaging industries.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's shopping list was even greater at nearly 700
million Dollars for food processing equipment and machinery, and
488 million Dollars for packaging machinery, he said.
</P>
<P>
South African suppliers of construction and building equipment
and products could also find market in the two countries, where
huge investments were being made in airports, dams, hydropower
and coal-fired power stations, roads, bridges and hotels, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to arms sale, Pandya said, Mandela could perhaps
raise interest in the South African-designed gunship "Rooivalk"
project in Thailand, saying the royal Thai airforce was upgrading
its forces with an investment of 3.2 billion U.S. Dollars in a
five-year program.
</P>
<P>
Mandela today arrived in Bali, Indonesia, to start his
five-day visit to the country. During his visit, Mandela will
have talks with his Indonesian counterpart Suharto, Vice
President Try Sutrisno and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has said it expects economic and
trade relations to dominate the talks.
</P>
<P>
Mandela visited Indonesia in 1990 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
Following his visit in Indonesia, Mandela will head to
Thailand before returning home.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: UN Sanctions Policy Needs Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior Egyptian Foreign Ministry
official today called on the United Nations to review its
sanctions policy to avoid eternalizing an embargo once it is
applied.
</P>
<P>
"Imposing sanctions has to be tied to a date and a specific
period of time, and their renewal has to come through a
resolution," Assistant to the Foreign Minister Sayed Qassem
el-Masri said in an interview with the Egyptian MENA news agency.
</P>
<P>
Under the present policy, it is very difficult to have the
sanctions scrapped once they are imposed, since a new resolution
required for their lifting will be challenged by many obstacles,
such as the veto, consensus and others, he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the renewal of sanctions on Libya for the 16th
time, el Masri said that despite the lack of change in the
Council's position towards Libya, the matter was "well tackled" at
the last review last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council retained sanctions against Libya in a
periodic 120-day review Saturday though African envoys argued for a
compromise on the location of a possible trial of suspects in the
1988 Lockerbie bombing.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating, he said the last review of the sanctions discussed
the proposals by Libya, the Arab League and Organization of African
Unity on solving the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council will discuss the issue again in
October. "This time in a more profound manner," he added.
</P>
<P>
The council appears at an impasse in forcing Libya to extradite
to Britain or the U.S. two alleged intelligence agents on charges
of planting a bomb aboard a Pan Am Flight which exploded over
Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
African and Asian nations were urging the Lockerbie trial be
held outside these two countries, by Scottish judges under
Scottish law at the World Court in the Hague or in a neutral
country.
</P>
<P>
Many Council members demanded the U.N. to allay the sufferings
of Libyans under the five-year-old sanctions which include an air
and arms embargo, the downgrading of diplomatic relations, a
freeze on Libyan assets abroad and a ban on equipment used in oil
terminals and refineries.

<HEADLINE> Russia, US Divergent Over Baltic States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian differs from the United
States on the position over Baltic states, Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov told reporters in St. Petesburg today
after talking with his U.S. counterparter, Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said at the Pulkovo airport that Russia opposes the
Baltic states' admission to NATO, and emphasized that "the Russian
position does not change depending on momentary interests."
</P>
<P>
A system guaranteeing the Baltic states' security, independence
and sovereignty must be created, the Russian minister noted. "Such
a system might be based on Russia's guarantees, or on joint
guarantees," he added.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, the creation of such a system might also be
guaranteed by the West. "At the same time," Primakov said, "we do
not oppose those countries' admission to European organizations."
</P>
<P>
Talking about the issues of the Middle East, Primakov noted
that both Russia and the U.S. agreed that there is necessity to
unblock the peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He said the peace process which is blocked and undermined by
external actions must be put back on track.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the U.S. have decided to take advantage of their
influence upon the confronting parties and act as two co-sponsors
of the peace process initiated in Madrid, Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
In his view, both sides must "apply the maximum effort to
ensure that the achievements be not wasted." "If a roll-back
occurs, everything will have to be started from scratch, which is
no easy task," he said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said, "The U.S. and Russia intend to act
energetically, holding consultations with one another. Both sides
are aware of the necessity of joint actions."
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived in St. Petersburg Saturday on Primakov's
invitation. They held closed-door talks which lasted for more than
three hours.
</P>
<P>
According to a source in the Russian Foreign Ministry, the
talks were held on commission from Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Albright left for Vilnius, capital of Lithuania, on a brief
visit this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Hebron Mayor Holds Israel Responsible For Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Mayor of
Hebron, Mustafa Natsche, today sternly condemned the Israeli
authorities for fanning violent flames in the divided West Bank
city, according to a report of the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Inspecting the area where clashes took place today, the mayor
told reporters that the situation is becoming from bad to
worse.
</P>
<P>
He accused Israel of provoking the Palestinians by offensive
posters distributing Prophet Muhammad as a pig.
</P>
<P>
Natsche dismissed an allegation that the Palestinian National
Authority had encouraged the violence. "It is a natural response
from the Palestinian youths to the frustration and the worsening
situation in the city," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Israel's threat to close down more Palestinian
shops and make life more difficult for the Palestinian residents
in the center of the city, the mayor said that if they do
so, it will mean that the Palestinians will continue their
response by throwing stones and show their refusal to the
serious Israeli measures.
</P>
<P>
Natsche said bitterly: "We ask the Israeli government several
times to help us restore to normal (the life) in the city. They
did not even implement what they ought to do according to the
Hebron accords."
</P>
<P>
At least 15 Palestinians, including five journalists, were
wounded by Israeli live ammunition and rubber bullets. The
Israeli army sealed off a passage way between the Jewish
settlement enclave and Palestinian self-rule area in the city
this morning.
</P>
<P>
However, it failed to prevent downtown street from becoming a
battle ground. More than 30 petrol bombs were thrown at Israeli
security forces during intermittent clashes throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
The army also closed a number of Palestinian stores and
blocked off a number of entrances between the Palestinian and
Jewish sections of the city.
</P>
<P>
Uzi Dayan, head of the Central Command of the Israel
Defense Forces, threatened that there would be more frustrations
for the Palestinians if violence continues.

<HEADLINE> Male Illiteracy in Kuwait Less Than One Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Minister of Education
and Higher Education Abdallah Al-Ghuneim said today that
illiteracy among Kuwaiti males did not exceed one percent, marking
a great achievement in eliminating illiteracy during the years.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks before leaving for Germany to
take part in an international conference on education
</P>
<P>
He recalled that illiteracy in Kuwait was set at 57 percent in
1965 including 42 percent among men and 72 percent among women.
</P>
<P>
He said shortly after the state started a campaign to
eliminate illiteracy in 1981, the illiteracy rate was reduced
to some 32 percent among men and 52 percent among women.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of illiteracy among men in Kuwait was reduced
to less than one percent by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
But no figures of illiterate women in the country were
available. Unofficial sources indicated that the number of

<HEADLINE> AL Chief Raps Lebanon for Bashing Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid today blamed Lebanon's lack of resolute decision for
the last-minute expulsion of Iraq from a pan-Arab sport event as a
way to avoid enraging some Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
In statements on his return from a four-day visit to Beirut
where he attended the opening of the 8th Arab Sports Tournament,
the AL chief said the Lebanese government should have adopted a
clear stance in its previous contacts on Iraq's participation in
the tournament.
</P>
<P>
However, on the other hand, Meguid described the absence of
Iraqi athletes as a choice of a lesser evil.
</P>
<P>
"If Iraq took part in the games, a number of Arab countries
would have boycotted the event," he said, pointing out that
Lebanon's stance in this respect was one of sovereignty and had to
be respected by all parties.
</P>
<P>
The crisis erupted when Iraqi athletic delegation was denied
entry visa to Lebanon despite the fact that they were invited to
the Tournament which opened in Beirut on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
After their participation in the event was made impossible, the
98-member Iraqi mission today left Al Masnaa checkpoint on the
Lebanese-Syrian borders where they had been halted for two days.
</P>
<P>
Several Arab countries have threatened to boycott the event if
it includes Iraq which has been largely frowned upon since its 1991
invasion of its Arab neighbor Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, Meguid had talks with Lebanese President Elias
Hrawi, the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister but failed in
his last-minute attempt to dissipate the row.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Supply Electricity to Kenyan Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania Electric Supply
Company (TANESCO) will soon start to supply electricity to the
north-west border town of Isebania in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
TANESCO Managing Director, Mr. Baruanyi Luhanga said this over
the weekend when he was addressing Isebanian leaders after
touring the town for market evaluation and work assessment.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Luhanga assured the leaders, including John Egesa, the
district commissioner for Kurya, where the Kenyan town Isebania
is located, that supply of electricity would begin immediately
after problems such as way clearing, the taxation of the
electrical materials and equipment are sorted out.
</P>
<P>
The directive to TANESCO to electrify Isebania was given by
President Benjamin Mkapa in Sirari, the border town in Tanzania's
Mara Region when he joined Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi in
inaugurating the portion of the road from Sirari in Tanzania to
Migori in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The electrification of border towns is one of the issues
underscored last year when the presidents of Tanzania, Kenya and
Uganda met to discuss the revival of the defunct East African
Community.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed that residents of the Kenyan border town should
be supplied with electricity from the nearest power station at
the same price as Tanzanian locals.

ALGIERS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Algerian government has
appointed a committee to compensate farmers affected by drought
and help them tide over present difficulties, it was announced
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries said the committee
will work closely with the Algerian Bank for Rural Development,
professional associations and syndicates to prepare ground rules
for financing peasants during next cultivation seasons.
</P>

The severe drought has hit about 65 percent of the cultivated
land in Algeria, inflicting heavy losses to some 800,000 farmers
and 3.5 million hectares of cereals.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said it has been prompted to make three decisions
- regulate barley in order to protect cattle feed in pastoral
areas, support uninsured farmers to secure loans next year, and
call upon insurance companies to give compensation to farmers.

PARIS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Jean-Marie le Chevallier, the mayor
of the southern city Toulon who was elected from the ultra-right
National Front (FN) party, today banned a celebration planned by
anti-FN groups in his city on the July 14 national day.
</P>
<P>
Le Chevallier said that the celebration, to be held on a
central square of Toulon by the SOS Racism and "Toulon, It Is
Also Ours" anti-FN groups, risks to disrupt public order and his
city does not have enough security force to deal with public
disorder.
</P>
<P>
The plan, called "July 14 of Liberties," has won support from
the European Union and Minister of Culture and Communication
Catherine Trautmann, who welcomed it as an anti-racism
demonstration.

JOHANNESBURG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A five-day French
Technologies '97 Exhibition ended today in Johannesburg with
export contracts worth more than 22 million U.S. dollars
concluded at the show.
</P>
<P>
More businesses between the two countries were likely to
result from the exhibition, Economic and Commercial Councilor of
France in South Africa Marc Bouteiller said.
</P>
<P>
Bouteiller said a week ago 125 French companies were involved
in South Africa, but now the figure has increased dramatically
following the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that once all agreements are in place, the number
of French firms in South Africa could exceed 200, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The French trade Commission also held a series of round tables
between French and South African companies during the show and no
fewer than 450 local companies participated in the discussions,
with topics ranging from transport to medicine and packaging,
according to informed sources.
</P>
<P>
During the show several French companies received South
African Bureau of Standards certificates for their products, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The transfer of technological skills and know-how from France
could turn out to be the most significant benefit resulting from
French technologies, Bouteiller noted.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sudan Pledges to Implement Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government pledged
today to continue implementing the Khartoum peace accord signed
between the government and four small southern rebel factions in
April.
</P>
<P>
The assurance was made in a cabinet meeting chaired by
President Omar al-Bashir, despite John Garang, leader of Sudan's
largest anti-government group, the Sudan People's Liberation Army
(SPLA), has not join the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government intends to issue the 14th
constitutional decree to push forward the peace march.
</P>
<P>
The decree, which will be enacted after the approval of the
National Assembly (parliament), stipulates a four-year
transitional period, during which a coordination council composed
of government officials and representatives of the four factions
will take charge of affairs in the south.
</P>
<P>
After the transition period, citizens in the south will decide
by ballot whether they will stay in or to separate from the
country.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir briefed the cabinet on the
outcome of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and
Development (IGADD) summit, which was held last week in the
Kenyan capital of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The IGADD groups Sudan, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea,
Djibouti and Somali.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese delegation at the summit accepted the IGADD's
declaration of principles of 1994 for resolving the southern Sudan
question an agenda in future negotiations with Garang.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government had earlier rejected the declaration
of principles which call for separating religion from politics
and upholding political pluralism in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The about-turn attitude of the Khartoum government at the
IGADD summit was explained as a result of changes in the wake of
last April's peace accord signed between the government and the
four rebel factions.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said they have accepted the declaration
of principles to become part of the negotiating agenda with the
rebel movement of Garang, but not a basic condition for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's rebels in the south have fought the government since
1983, seeking a greater say in Sudan's affairs.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Welcomes Hun Sen's Proposal for Cambodia Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today welcomed a
proposal by Cambodia's Second Prime Minister Hun Sen for free and
fair elections in Cambodia, saying it would pave the way for the
formation of a government of the people's choice in the
strife-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Foreign Minister Datuk Badawi said Hun Sen's proposal
was one of the best solutions to the present political crisis in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian National News Agency quoted Badawi as telling
parliament today, "We certainly would like to see that (an
election) happening in Cambodia. After the election, we will see
the emergence or the setting up of the government of the people's
choice."
</P>
<P>
Badawi said free and fair elections would provide Cambodians
with a chance to decide on the country's ruling party and their
representatives for the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Badawi, also chairman of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) Standing Committee, said the regional grouping
would play a role if asked to.
</P>
<P>
He said ASEAN would be ready to offer assistance in the form of
providing courses for electoral officials in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN would also study specific requests from Cambodia for
other forms of assistance for the proposed election, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Cambodia's readiness for an election now would provide
a speedier solution to the present crisis.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether an imminent election would hasten Cambodia's
entry into the ASEAN fold, Badawi said, "The timing (of an
election) was not an issue when we made the decision. All that we
wanted to see is that the fighting stops immediately and there is
stability in that country and there is going to be a democratic
government."
</P>
<P>
ASEAN foreign ministers decided at a special meeting here on
July 10 to defer Cambodia's entry into the regional grouping in
view of the political unrest there. Cambodia's entry had been
agreed on May 31 along with that of Myanmar and Laos, whose
admission will go ahead as planned on July 24.
</P>
<P>
Badawi said that pending an election, ASEAN insisted that the
Cambodian government should be a coalition; the National Assembly
should not be dissolved; and the Paris Peace Accord, which ended
the civil war in Cambodia in 1991, and the Constitution should be
upheld.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that Hun Sen had written to Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad, but he could not reveal the letter's
full content, only saying that Hun Sen was obviously explaining
his position.

PARIS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today vowed to fight racist and xenophobic policies promoted by

<P>
JAKARTA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said here today he was still waiting for the schedule
arranged for him to meet Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk for
talks on resolving of Cambodia's internal conflict.
</P>
<P>
"I am still waiting for confirmation of the meeting one to
three days from now," the minister said after reporting to
President Soeharto on the result of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) foreign ministers special meeting last
Thursday in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
He said he was also waiting for the schedule arranged for him
to meet Cambodian First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh
and Second Prime Minister, Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Alatas was appointed by ASEAN foreign ministers to meet with
Sihanouk, Hun Sen and Ranariddh respectively for talks on the
Cambodian crisis and its peaceful resolution.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN foreign ministers decided at the end of May to admit
Cambodia as a member, but last week they decided to defer its
admission because of the political unrest in the country.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said the decision was taken to dispel any image that
ASEAN was taking sides with a particular group.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN does not have any intention of interfering or making a
judgement on any side in Cambodia", he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the country's planned admission was
postponed, its status as observer to ASEAN would remain and it
could attend the ASEAN meeting in Kuala Lumpur on July 21-29.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The formation of a high-powered
bilateral committee between the business communities of Hong Kong
and Europe was announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement by Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC)
said that the Hong Kong-European Union and European Union-Hong
Kong Business Cooperation Committees will open an important new
channel for private-sector dialogue between the two regions on
increased trade, investment and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, which has top-level support from the Government
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and the
European Commission, was spearheaded by the TDC, which will also
serve as a secretariat, according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
At the inaugural meeting today of the Hong Kong committee, a
message of support was received from Tung Chee Hwa, the Chief
Executive of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Tung said the timing for the initiative is auspicious. "Coming
soon after the establishment of the HKSAR, the birth of the two
committees is a testament to the confidence in the business
prospects and opportunities of the two places."
</P>
<P>
"At this important time as the people of Hong Kong assume the
solemn responsibility of managing our own affairs and as Hong Kong
moves forward with pride and confidence as a Special
Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, I
congratulate the TDC, Hong Kong's business community, and their
counterparts in Europe for establishing this high-level forum for
business exchanges," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prominent business leaders from the industrial and services
sectors will serve on the two committees, which will meet
alternate years in Hong Kong and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Some 250 European firms already have their regional
headquarters in Hong Kong and are engaged in almost every
sector. More than 50,000 European Union citizens are in Hong Kong,
which is a larger European Union expatriate community than in any
other Asian city.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is Hong Kong's third largest trading
partner, behind China's inland areas and the United States, with
total trade topping 378 billion HK dollars (48.5 billion

<HEADLINE> Japan to Support Romania's Plan to Develop Market Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Japan today pledged to support
Romania's efforts to expand its market-driven economy, the Kyodo
News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto made the pledge in a
meeting with visiting Romanian President Emil Constantinescu,
Kyodo quoted a Foreign Ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
During their one-hour meeting, the Romanian president urged
Japan to invest in Romania, saying his government especially needs
assistance for projects to transform its military industry into
private-sector civilian industries fit for a market economy.
</P>
<P>
"Romania today can offer a broad array of advantages for
foreign investment," Constantinescu said. Romania was a prime
example of an emerging market offering exciting returns for
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Romania's reformist government, which took power last November,
has been striving to meet reform targets and secure the confidence
of Western lenders and investors.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto expressed Japan's readiness to support the Romanian
government's plan to develop infrastructure and urged the country
to improve its investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda
and his Romanian counterpart Adrian Severin agreed on Japan's
first government-to-government low-interest loans to Romania.
</P>
<P>
The nearly 22 billion yen (194 million U.S. dollars) in loans
was for infrastructure projects, with 12.8 billion yen (113
million dollars) for building a new container terminal in the
eastern port of Constanta and 9.19 billion yen (81.3 million
dollars) for road building in southern and western regions of the
country, Kyodo said.

<HEADLINE> Harassment Against Int'l Personnel Reported in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The international organizations
in Bosnia reported today that there was a "low level harassment"
against their branches and staff members in the Serb entity
following NATO's operation to arrest war crime indictees.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
said in a statement that one of its cars was blasted Sunday
evening in front of the Hotel Drina, Zvornik, where the OSCE's
branch for the town is located.
</P>
<P>
The explosives, believed to be weighed two kilograms, were
placed underneath the engine of the Nissan pickup and debris from
the explosion was scattered over an area of 10 to 15 meters, said
the OSCE, which is organizing local elections in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Although no one was hurt in the incident, the blast shattered
windows of the OSCE and other international organizations' offices
in the hotel and damaged several other cars parked nearby.
</P>
<P>
International Police Task Force (IPTF) spokesman Alexander
Ivanko said that the explosion was just one of a number of
incidents over the weekend which he described as "low level
harassment" against international personnel in Zvornik.
</P>
<P>
The other incidents included verbal abuses, bottle throwing and
threats against the landlord of a UN police monitor.
</P>
<P>
Ivanko said that following these incidents, the IPTF advised
its members to travel with caution in the Serb republic.
</P>
<P>
Although there was no evidence of the blast being perpetrated
by Serbs and the IPTF was currently conducting an investigation, a
spokesman for the Office of High Representative suggested that
media reports in the Serb entity following the NATO operation
"have created a situation in which these actions may be perceived
as being reasonable."
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR) launched the
first operation since its deployment to catch persons indicted for
war crimes, killing one and arresting another in the
Serb-controlled town of Prijedor.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Aims for Constructive Cohabitation with Jospin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Six weeks into his cohabitation with
a leftist government, right-wing French President Jacques Chirac
said today he did not regret his decision to call an early
election which resulted in victory for his opponents.
</P>
<P>
"I think that this was the best solution. The crisis was not
political, but it threatened to become a crisis of immobility,"
said Chirac of his decision to call early elections in April.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, speaking in a television interview on Bastille Day,
also hoped for a "constructive" cohabitation with Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin, and for a continuing leftist majority in parliament
for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Jospin have succeeded in playing tandem in a series
of key international events, including the Amsterdam European
Union summit, the Denver G-8 summit and the NATO Madrid summit,
since cohabitation began.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said his objectives were to strengthen France's national
cohesion and modernize the country. If these were also the
objectives of the Socialist government, there would be no problem,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of his working relationship with Jospin, Chirca said,
"He will do it in his manner, with his convictions and his
differences. In this hypothesis, this would be a constructive
cohabitation."
</P>
<P>
According to latest opinion polls, support for Chirac and
Jospin has risen considerably during the first month of
cohabitation.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that he would not interfere in detailed decisions
on economic and social problems by the government, but would
exercise his duty as the keeper of France's national interest, in
areas such as the country's position in the world, its security,
and its expansion in world markets.
</P>
<P>
He said he also reserved the right to be the "judge" of
decisions made by the government, while staying above
partisanship.

<HEADLINE> US to Offer Access to Foreign Banks, Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- In a new effort to spur global
financial services talks, the U.S. plans to offer the allure of
its vast market to foreign banks and securities and insurance
firms in exchange for equivalent access by U.S. companies to
overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
The new offer could be made as early as today in Geneva, The
Wall Street Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government is making the latest offer in the hope that
the world's trading nations will complete a financial services
agreement by the deadline of December 12.
</P>
<P>
Negotiation on the pact bogged down two years ago when the U.S.
held back offering full access to its market, citing the
inadequacy of market-opening promise by many other nations.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that an agreement of financial services,
along with the pacts of telecommunications and information
technology reached earlier this year, would complete the triad of
crucial trade and commerce agreements for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In a statement scheduled for release today, Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin and U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
also said, "It is crucial that our trading partners, especially
the key emerging markets, submit significantly improved offers
that establish a level playing fields for U.S. firms to compete
effectively."
</P>
<P>
Assets of U.S. banks, securities firms and other financial
institutions total about 26.5 trillion dollars and the insurance
industry, measured by premiums, totals 624 billion dollars.

TIANJIN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Temperatures from July 8 to 14
were as high as 37 degrees Centigrade in Tianjin, China's fourth
largest metropolis, in the north.
</P>
<P>
According to the city's meteorology department, the highest
temperature, on July 13, was 39.9 degrees, an extremely rare
occurrence. The city's previous record high was 39.7 in 1972.

A warm high pressure system and weak cold air from the northern
region has caused the high temperatures and there has been little
precipitation since mid-June.

In the evening, large groups of residents are forced to go to
parks or the banks of the Haihe River to enjoy the cool. Many
don't return home until the small hours of the morning.

<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China's fishing areas produced
9.12 million tons of aquatic products in the first five months of
this year, 930,000 tons, or 11.3 percent, more than for the same
period of last year, the Ministry of Agriculture announced today.
</P>
<P>
Production in the first five months was characterized by an

At present, the country has an ample supply of fries and young
prawns, turtles, and crabs to meet the needs of sustainable
production.
</P>
<P>
China imported 730,000 tons of aquatic products valued at 580
million US dollars in the first five months, while exports grew 11
percent at 310,000 tons. But the export value dropped 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
A leading Fishery Department official under the Ministry of
Agriculture said that general trends in China's fishery production
are good, but problems like decreased economic results and slow
growth in exports still exist.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today once again voiced support to the Palestinian
and Lebanese people in their struggle against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said "helping to resolve the problems of the
countries being on the forefront of struggle against the Zionist
regime is the duty of all Islamic countries and Iran is ready to
fulfill its task more vehemently than ever before."
</P>
<P>
He stressed Iran's commitment to Islamic and humane principles
and declared "Tehran supports the legitimate rights of the
Palestinian people and the stands of Lebanon vis-a-vis usurpers".
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Fuad Siniora, the special envoy of the
Lebanese president, the 64-year-old president said "Tehran-Beirut
ties will enter a new stage through exchange of political
missions.
</P>
<P>
However, Rafsanjani expressed regret over the problems which
have been imposed on the Lebanese and Palestinian peoples due
to the expansionist policies of Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The Iranian nation and government are interested in the
destiny of the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and it is
painful to them to witness parts of Lebanon being kept under
occupation contrary to all international laws," Rafsanjani was

MANILA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today called on all political parties in Cambodia to work together
in the spirit of national reconciliation and unity to preserve the
fruits of the Cambodian peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, President Ramos expressed the hope that peace
and order in Cambodia, the lives and property of the Khmer people
and the Constitution and the coalition government would be
protected under King Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
He also called for "free and fair" national elections due next
year to be held on schedule and said he looked forward to
Cambodia's eventual admission to the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Cambodia was set to join ASEAN this month, but the group agreed
last week to postpone its entry after recent fightings in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen threatened to withdraw its application to join ASEAN if
it didn't stop interfering in Cambodian affairs.
</P>
<P>
But President Ramos stressed Manila's support for a moderating
and supportive role for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) in the process of consolidating peace and progress in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
He said the Philippines looked forward to Cambodia's eventual
admission to ASEAN, which groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The boday will
admit Burma and Laos as planned later this month.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Labor announced
today that Chinese youngsters must be trained professionally
before being allowed to go to work.
</P>
<P>
A Ministry spokesman told a press conference today that
secondary school graduates who are not admitted to higher levels
of schooling (including high schools and universities) must
receive one to three years' professional training to obtain
employment certificates.
</P>
<P>
For decades the Chinese government has had a policy of
providing jobs for all urban citizens, but that old method will be
challenged if the new method is adopted. "The new labor reserve
system is an important reform of China's labor system," the
spokesman explained.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ministry has chosen 36 major cities to
spearhead an experiment with the reform, which will be applied
full-scale in April of next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ministry sources say that over the next several years some 21
million young people will not be able to enter schools at a higher
level, and because most will go right to work, a serious lack of
professional skills will threaten China's economic growth.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Chipmakers to Cut Output to Curb Price Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korean semiconductor producers
have agreed to slash output of microchips to prevent a further
slide in international prices which have already fallen by a third
over the last three months.
</P>
<P>
But the move is likely to exacerbate the country's widening
trade deficit, since chips account for around 15 percent of the
country's total exports.
</P>
<P>
The price of a 16 mega-dram chip has fallen from 10
U.S. dollars in April to 6.67 dollars this month, the Finance and
Economy Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
To try and stem the drop, South Korea's biggest chipmakers,
including Hyundai, Samsung and LG, are giving their workers an
extended holiday at the end of this month which will cut regular
chip production by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, officials are worried that chip prices on the world
market won't recover immediately because Taiwan is likely to
continue to flood the market with chips, causing a further slide
in prices in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
They are also concerned about the effect of the producers'
cutback on attempts to narrow the country's trade deficit.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 14, (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Foreign Minister
Gohar Ayub Khan today expressed his hope that the stepped-up
shuttle diplomacy would prove successful in bringing about a
negotiated settlement between warring Afghan groups for peace in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has now established contacts with all the groups
including the Islamic Taliban militia and the rival northern
alliance, Gohar told the media today.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that they will reconcile on their demands for the
restoration of peace in Afghanistan," he said.

Over the past few days, a Pakistani delegation led by
Additional Secretary Iftikhar Murshed held extensive talks
respectively with Taliban and its rivals in which both sides
expressed their willingness to begin a political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Gohar, who embarks on a tour of two Central Asian Republics
Tuesday, said Pakistan has mustered support of neighboring
countries on hosting an intra-Afghan dialogue under the UN
auspices.
</P>
<P>
"Russia, Iran and Central Asian Republics have appreciated our
initiatives for holding an intra-Afghan dialogue to ensure peace
in Afghanistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
The immediate neighbors of Afghanistan including Iran,
Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, China and Pakistan will
participate in the subsequent conference with the U.S. and Russian
Federation attending as guarantors, he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said Pakistan is not countering the UN but
cooperating with the world body.
</P>
<P>
Gohar said he has held two meetings with UN Secretary General
Kofi Annan in New York and Hong Kong respectively and "discussed
cooperation for peace in Afghanistan".
</P>
<P>
The UN secretary general, he said, has appreciated Pakistan's
initiatives and offered to partly fund the holding of conference

countries and for Sino-Vietnamese good-neighborly friendship and
co-operation that is more stable, healthier, and more effective in
the next century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang recalled with pleasure the relations between the two
parties and the two countries and their last meeting in Beijing
since November, 1995. During this period, he said, there has been
new progress in developing friendship and cooperation and that
leaders on the two sides have maintained close contacts and
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
There have also been frequent bilateral personnel exchanges in
various fields and strengthened cooperation, Jiang noted, and that
bilateral economic and trade relations have also developed rather
rapidly and the sphere of bilateral co-operation has continued to
expand.
</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to say that the two sides have had comprehensive
and in-depth exchanges on the reforms, opening-up, and government
administration, and pointed out that these have brought benefits
to the two countries and their peoples, which is conducive to
regional and world peace, stability and development, and to the
progress of mankind.
</P>
<P>
On certain remaining historical matters, Jiang said, the
continued development of friendly and co-operative relations
between the two parties and the two countries has provided
favorable conditions for solving these matters.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that these matters can be properly settled at an
early date through the great efforts of leaders of the two sides,
as long as the two sides take the general situation into
consideration in a far-sighted way, understand each other, and
conduct friendly consultations in a fair and reasonable way.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the CPC and Chinese government place great
importance on safeguarding and developing relations with the CPV
and Vietnam, and that on the eve of a new century, the CPC and
Chinese government are willing to join hands with the CPV and
Vietnamese government to continue to push the development of the
good-neighborly friendship and mutually beneficial co-operation
between the two parties and the two countries forward on the basis
of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence and the four
principles guiding the relations between parties.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Break out Between Kenyan Police, Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of stone-armed Kenyan
students, demanding constitutional reforms, clashed with riot
police firing tear-gas and rubber bullets in downtown Nairobi at
noon today, leaving at least three injured.
</P>
<P>
Tension is still quite high in the heart of the capital in the
afternoon although the polytechnic students have been driven back
to the campus, a part of which now is seized by the police, said
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
It is said that two people passing by were seriously injured
and a Reuters photographer was hit by a policeman on the back of
the head during more than three-hour riots.
</P>
<P>
The students blocked almost the entire Haile Selassie Avenue,
a key road through the city center, with burning tyres and
makeshift barricades, said the witnesses.
</P>
<P>
In minutes hundreds of riot police moved in, cleared students
off the avenue and entered the polytechnic campus.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan students have reportedly been angered by a drafted
parliamentary bill requiring the expulsion of students who fail
to pay their fees.
</P>
<P>
The riot came four days after the University of Nairobi was
closed due to several days of students' demonstration after
Kenya's worst political turmoil since 1990 between the government
and the opposition parties broke out on July 7.
</P>
<P>
The unrest on July 7 claimed 14 lives around the eastern
African country.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties have been putting pressures on
President Daniel arap Moi to conduct constitutional reforms
before the forthcoming general elections, while Moi insists he
only do that after the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Under the current constitution, any candidate, if he wins no
less than 25 percent of votes respectively in five of the eight
provinces of Kenya, he can be qualified as a legal president.
</P>
<P>
Now the opposition leaders urged to change the clause,
demanding the future president get more than 50 percent of the
total votes nationwide otherwise form a coalition government with
other parties.
</P>
<P>
Moi, 73 and in power for 19 years, warned on Friday he would
take actions against any attempts to bring chaos to the country
and challenged the opposition to take the debate on reforms to
the parliament, where his ruling party has a majority.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan governmental forces banned and broke up the first
two rallies of opposition parties in May.

<HEADLINE> Strict Regulation on Promotion or Dismissal of Cadres Issued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A strict regulation was issued in
Beijing today asking Communist Party members to observe discipline
in promotions or dismissals of cadres.
</P>
<P>
Issued by the General Office of the Central Committee of the
Chinese Communist Party, the regulation says that promotions and
dismissals can be done only after being discussed by a Party
committee instead of being decided by a small number of
people. Those who violate the regulation will be criticized or
punished, it adds.
</P>
<P>
If a Party committee member promotes or dismisses a cadre
because of personal feelings, or changes the committee's
collective decisions, and if the case is serious enough, he or she
will be dismissed from his or her Party position, the regulation
says.
</P>
<P>
It stipulates that Party officials who promote spouses,
children, or relatives will be criticized or dismissed from their
own positions, as will Party committee members and other workers
who leak information about promotions or dismissals.
</P>
<P>
Party officials who violate a citizen's right to vote or to
stand for election will be criticized, and if illegal means like
threats, briberies, or cheating during the election process are
used, the maximum penalty will be expulsion from the Party,
according to the regulation.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials can not accept bribes when choosing or
promoting cadres, and Party members can not seek higher position
by bribing superiors, it says.
</P>
<P>
The General Office says that the circular is intended to
strengthen Party discipline and guarantee the implementation of
the Party's policies.

<HEADLINE> Key Aviation Projects In China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Nearly all Chinese provincial
capitals will improve their airports or build new ones by the end
of the century, according to Bao Peide, deputy director of the
Civil Aviation Administration of China.
</P>
<P>
The years 1996 to 2000 will be the peak of airport construction
in the country, he said, and the "key-in-key" project is the
expansion of Beijing's Capital Airport.
</P>
<P>
Work on eight airports will also be completed during that time,
while the work of six projects will continue, and the work on
another six will start. Most projects will be in provincial
capitals.
</P>
<P>
"Construction work on key projects is well under way," Bao told
journalists from major Beijing press organizations, and major
structures for the Beijing Capital Airport expansion have been
built.
</P>
<P>
This key project in the Chinese government's Ninth Five-Year
Plan (1996-2000) cost a total of 9.2 billion yuan and is second
only to the Three Gorges project in 1996-2000. The expanded
airport will open by October 1 of 1999, with a 268,000-sq.m.
terminal building and 480,000 sq.m. of runways.
</P>
<P>
Guiyang's Longdongbao Airport, Fuzhou's Changle, and Nanjing's
Lukou have already gone into operation.
</P>
<P>
The major parts of Xinzheng Airport in Zhengzhou, Hedong
Airport in Yinchuan, Luogang Airport in Hefei, and Wuyu Airport in
Nanning have been built, while the enlargement of Baita Airport in
Huhhot has passed initial appraisal, Bao said.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Trade Delegation Postpones Visit to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today announced that its
trade delegation has decided to postpone a planned visit to
Lebanon, according to the Iraqi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
A Trade Ministry spokesman made the announcement without giving
any further explanation, according to the news agency.
</P>
<P>
However, it is seen here as apparent reaction to the Lebanese
authorities' denial of entrance visa to an Iraqi sport delegation
to take part in the 8th Arab Games, which opened in Beirut last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi sport delegation arrived at the Syrian-Lebanese
border on Friday; and after being denied entry at a checkpoint the
athletes staged a sit-in. It was reported that Lebanon took this
move under pressure from Kuwait, which sponsored the games.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon severed its diplomatic relations with Iraq after the
1994 assassination of an Iraqi dissident in Beirut. Baghdad has
denied any involvement in the killing.
</P>
<P>
Beirut recently tried to revive ties with Baghdad, starting
with the release and expulsion in January of three Iraqi
diplomats imprisoned in connection with the 1994 murder.
</P>
<P>
In the past three months, the two countries have exchanged
trade teams and their officials have hinted that they were
willing to resume political and economic ties.
</P>
<P>
But diplomats here doubt there will be any resumption of
relations until a similar move being taken by Syria, which
dominates Lebanon politically and whose ties with Iraq were
severed in 1980 for its support to Iran in the Iran-Iraq War.

<P>
China's civil aviation industry has developed rapidly in recent
years, and the sharp increase in the number of air travelers has
caused problems for terminals, Bao explained.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the expansion of Harbin's Yanjiagang Airport
will soon be completed, and the terminal building at Xiamen's
Gaoqi has been built. The expanded runway at Urumqi's Diwopu has
been completed.
</P>
<P>
Haikou's Meilan Airport has finished the runway area and
terminal projects, and Nanchang's Changbei has completed stone and
earth moving for the runway, Bao said.
</P>
<P>
The six new projects include Shanghai's Pudong International
Airport, expansion of Shuangliu Airport in Chengdu, Zhongchuan
Airport in Lanzhou, Wujiabei Airport in Kunming, the
Tianjin-Beijing oil supply project, and the Beijing air control
center. Construction work on Lanzhou's airport has begun.
</P>
<P>
A majority of China's airports were built in the '60s and '70s,
but airports have a life cycle of about 20 to 30 years, meaning
that China urgently needs to rebuild or improve airports.
</P>
<P>
Airport construction work was backed by the state in the past,
but now various new methods have been tried, such as getting local
investment, issuing stock, or utilizing foreign funds, Bao
noted. In using overseas investment, the Chinese side will be the
major share-holder, and the overseas side will not hold more than
49 percent, he explained.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Foreign Minister on New York Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides has said that a better climate was created between the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides during their direct talks near New
York, though common ground has not been found.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides made the remark today to the Greek Cypriot
journalists in New York while referring to the U.N.-sponsored
four-day negotiations on the Cyprus issue, between President
Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, held
from July 9-12 at Troutbeck, north of New York, according to
Cyprus News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said he could not say whether progress was made
during the negotiations, in the sense that there was no change
in the positions of the Turkish Cypriot side on the
fundamental aspects of the Cyprus problem, but added that
"nobody can claim that the talks have failed."
</P>
<P>
There was a pleasant atmosphere, Kasoulides said, adding that
President Clerides and Denktash made "spontaneous decision" to
have second round of talks, scheduled for August 11 to 16,
near Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Minister refrained from speculating on the outcome
of the second round of direct talks, but said that both sides
believe that "the U.N. Secretariat should know certain of their
positions before any documents are discussed."
</P>
<P>
He also noted that all fundamental aspects of the Cyprus
question will be discussed in Geneva and said the National
Council, the top advisory body to the President on the Cyprus
issue, will decided whether the Greek Cypriot side will
participate.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides stressed, however, that President Clerides believes
"it would be extremely difficult for our side to refuse to
go to Geneva."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the methodology of the direct talks, Kasoulides
said that once the two sides submit their positions on the
fundamental aspects of the Cyprus problem by the end of
December, a joint statement on these issues should be prepared.
</P>
<P>
"After Geneva (talks) we will proceed with the preparation of a
draft constitution and the legal instruments such as the
constitutional and territorial issues, as mentioned in a document
submitted by the U.N. Secretary-General's special advisor, Diego
Cordovez, during the New York talks, Kasoulides explained.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue has remained unresolved since 1974 when
the island was divided following Turkish troops took over the
northern third in reaction to a coup in Nicosia backed by
the junta then ruling Greece.

BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The world amateur boxing body AIBA
said in a newsletter on Monday that the original verdict for a
Mediterranean Games boxing match must stand despite the games'
organizers overturned it citing computer problems.
</P>
<P>
AIBA said in its July newsletter that the original verdict gave
a 3-2 victory in a heavyweight bout to Italy's Giacobbe Fragomeni
but the organizers later reversed the ruling.
</P>
<P>
Fragomeni's Algerian opponent Mohammed Benguesmia was awarded
the gold medal instead and Fragomeni the silver.
</P>
<P>
The Games' International Committee said there had been a
"flagrant malfunction of the computerised result."
</P>
<P>
AIBA said the Games' organizers had misunderstood how the
computerised scoring system works, and hence took a decision which
contradicts the rules of AIBA.
</P>
<P>
The computerised scoring system was first introduced at Olympic
level in 1992 in Barcelona.

<HEADLINE> Indian Coalition Party Warns of Partner's Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Tamil Maanila Congress
(TMC), a party in the Indian coalition government, said today that
the announcement by the regional party Davida Munnetra Kazhagam
(DMK) to withdraw from the United Front (UF) government would have
serious consequences.
</P>
<P>
"It is another crisis for the UF, which is already facing a
crisis due to Bihar Chief Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav's coming out
of the Janata Dal, the major constituent of the UF, and forming
Rashtriya Janata Dal on July 5," TMC President G.K. Moopanar told
reporters at TMC headquarters in Chennai, capital of Tamil Nadu.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, DMK President K. Karunanidhi announced in
Chennai, also headquarters of the DMK, that his party would
withdraw its ministers from the UF government but to support it
from outside.
</P>
<P>
K. Karunanidhi said his party is being used by some UF members
"as a channel to settle their personal scores."
</P>
<P>
"It is a serious matter as Mr. Karunanidhi is one of the
founding fathers of the UF. This will certainly have its impact on
the UF government," Moopanar added.
</P>
<P>
Since the split of the Janata Dal, UF members have been widely
divided over whether to allow the newly formed Rashtriya Janata
Dal to enter the UF, a coalition formed last year comprising 13
regional parties.
</P>
<P>
While the DMK expressed support for Rashtriya Janata Dal's
entry, some other UF members have been strongly against it.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today expressed its concern
over a report that the European Commission had agreed in principle
to open European Union (EU) membership talks with six countries
but Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly news briefing, Turkish Foreign Ministry
deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli said that Turkey is closely
following the developments.
</P>
<P>
Noting that what the Foreign Ministry has acquired is only
press reports, Atacanli said that the EU has not made a final
decision on the prospective membership talks.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the Turkish government regard this matter
"very seriously", adding Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz had met with
other senior government officials to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, whose minority coalition government won a crucial
vote of confidence in the parliament last Saturday, had stressed
in his government program that Turkey's full EU membership would
be one of the most important tasks facing the new government.
</P>
<P>
On the issue whether Ankara will withdraw from the customs
union and if it will be kept outside the EU membership
negotiations, Atacanli said that Turkey is closely following with
the EU enlargement process and then decides what measures it
should take.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been striving for a full EU membership in a bid to
give a big push to the country's economy, but failed to achieve
this goal due to some controversial issues with the EU.
</P>
<P>
European nations have cited the Muslim nation's weak economy
and human rights record as hurdles for its membership.

ADDIS ABABA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's 10,000 meters world
record holder Haile Gebrselassie announced here on Monday he would
not participate in the coming world athletics championships.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic 10,000 meters gold medalist said the reason behind
his decision was because the track for the Athens event next month
was too hard.
</P>
<P>
He said he had suffered great injuries at the Atlanta Olympics
with blood flowing from his soles and it took him a long time to
recover from that injury.
</P>
<P>
"I do not want to undergo similar sufferings," he added.
</P>
<P>
Gebrselassie said he decided to pull out after hearing the
Athens track was similar to the one used at the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
He broke the world 10,000 meters record with a time of 26
minutes 31.32 seconds at the Bislett Games grand prix in Oslo,

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Envoy Protests Japan's New Territorial Boundary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Ambassador to Japan
today lodged a protest with Japan for unilaterally imposing new
territorial waterlines and demanded the immediate release of South
Korean fishermen being held by Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Kim Tae Zhee's protest to Japan's Vice Foreign Minister Shunji
Yanai came in the wake of the Maritime Safety Agency's (MSA)
seizure of five South Korean fishing boats over the last month for
violating the new waterlines.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador urged Tokyo to rescind its new waterline and
refrain from seizing any more South Korean boats. He also
demanded that two trawler captains, the last remaining fishermen
being held by the MSA, be released immediately.
</P>
<P>
Kim said Japan's newly drawn waterlines, which expanded Japan's
territorial waters, violated international law.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot recognize the new waterlines, which were drawn up
without advance consultation with South Korea," Kim was quoted as
telling the Japanese minister.
</P>
<P>
Kim said that South Korea will freeze talks on new fisheries
agreements until Tokyo resolves the issue, Kyodo news service
quoted a Foreign Ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Seoul and Tokyo are negotiating a new fisheries accord but have
yet made no substantial progress because of a territorial dispute
over a small group of islands in the Sea of Japan, known as
Takeshima in Japan and Tokto in South Korea.

<HEADLINE> 100 Children Die in Eastern Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- At least 100 children died in
eastern Uganda in the past two and a half months due to malaria
and a looming famine, a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with "The New Vision", Richard Othieno, the
district Medical Officer in Mbale said that an estimated 100 to
200 children under the age of five had died of malaria and famine
during the period from April to mid-June.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of malaria was caused by unsanitarian condition
and aggravated by famine, Othieno said.
</P>
<P>
A report from Kumi District said some 34 percent of population
was under the threat of famine.
</P>
<P>
Alfred Opiede Onyait, the acting district field extension
worker, told the members of parliament inspecting eastern Uganda
that 15,000 of 44,000 families in the district are seriously
affected by the famine.
</P>
<P>
Famine affecting 19 of total 45 Ugandan districts caused by a
drought from May this year. But some reports said that in some
areas, the drought began as early as from last November.

<HEADLINE> Ecotourism Project on Mt Everest To Reduce Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- An ecotourism project of the
Chinese government and the United Nations Development Program will
be started on the world's highest mountain to help people there
get out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
The project is to generate income and protect the ecology and
biodiversity in the Qomolangma Nature Preserve (QNP) on
Mt. Qomolangma (Mt. Everest), on the border with Nepal. It is
known for its picturesque high mountain scenery, cultural sites,
and Tibetan traditions, but remains one of the poorest areas in
China.
</P>
<P>
In Dinggye and Tinggri, people earn less than 300 yuan annually.
</P>
<P>
Initial work on the project has already begun, with a master
plan having been worked out by a Sino-foreign experts group and
approved at a UNDP-Chinese government joint meeting held in Lhasa
in early July.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP will approve an additional 300,000 to 400,000 US
dollars for the project soon, mainly to help co-ordinate the
ecotourism master plan and get local governments to attract more
investment, said Arthur N. Holcombe, UNDP resident representative
in China, in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
During the first phrase of its poverty reduction program, UNDP
put nearly 1.2 million US dollars into the activities.
</P>
<P>
A high rate of population growth has put great pressure on the
fragile mountain ecosystem there, making the need for ecotourism
all the more urgent, according to Li Bosheng, a leading botanist
with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP is aiming even higher. Holcombe expressed the hope
that the ecotourism project in the QNP will give the UNDP a wealth
of experience in its work on poverty alleviation in mountainous
areas around the world.
</P>
<P>
"And we also hope that the tourism master plan, together with
demonstration activities and micro-finance, may serve as a
superior model for future activities in other counties in Tibet,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> "Sugar Daddy" Blamed for AIDS Infection Among </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Some older men in Zambia are
accused of singling out young girls believed to be "AIDS free"
for sexual favor, thereby worsening the HIV/AIDS infection among
girls of 15 to 19 years old.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint report by the Zambian government and the
United Nations Children's Fund on "girl-child education", this
practice, commonly known as the "sugar daddy syndrome", is
responsible for the increased rate of infection among girls of
this age group.
</P>
<P>
The report said the rate of HIV/AIDS infection among girls is
six times higher than that of boys of the same age group.
</P>
<P>
The HIV/AIDS prevalence in the adult population in Zambia is
currently estimated at over 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said the issues concerning sexuality and sex
education are largely absent from the Zambian school curricula
and classroom discussions, thereby worsening the situation.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, 400 to 500 people are infected every
day in the country with a population of nine million.
</P>
<P>
Some 50,000 children are understood to be HIV positive and
that parental transmission is understood to account for 75
percent of all AIDS cases, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The population of AIDS orphans will be increased to a
projected 600,000 in the year 2000 from an estimated 80,000 in
1991, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Presently some 37 percent of all households are caring for at
least one AIDS orphan and seven percent of the children in the
country will be orphans, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Capital Airport Expansion Going Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The 9.2-billion-yuan expansion
project of the Beijing Capital Airport, one of the major programs
following the Three Gorges project during the Chinese government's
Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), is well under way.
</P>
<P>
So far, the major structures have been finished at the new
H-shaped airport, which faces east, and is connected with the
present terminal building, which faces south.
</P>
<P>
A quarter of the investment has been spent on the
project. "Work is entering the key phase," Kong Dong, general
commander of the project, told journalists of the major
Beijing-based press organizations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the enlarged airport will be operational by
October 1, 1999, marking the 50th anniversary of the founding of
the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Included in the project will be a new terminal building with a
floor space of 268,000 sq m, a parking garage which can
accommodate more than 5,000 cars and has a combined area of
167,000 sq m, a cargo transport station of 22,000 sq m, as well as
aprons covering an area of 480,000 sq m.
</P>
<P>
Kong said that the new airport can handle the estimated
passenger and cargo flow of Beijing in 2005: 35 million travelers
and 780,000 tons of cargo and mail.
</P>
<P>
The terminal is the size of 15 football fields -- the
equivalent of four present terminals -- and also the largest in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The parking garage has the most berths of any of Asia's
airports. It is divided into five floors, four of which are
underground, and has a subway passage.
</P>
<P>
The terminal area needs more than 230 meters of bridges and
nearly 2,300 meters of roads to be complete, Kong said.
</P>
<P>
"The existing airport cannot cater to the growing demand for air
transport of passengers and cargoes," he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the 78,000-sq-m terminal accommodates over 170 air
routes of 54 overseas and domestic airlines, which provides more
than 1,100 flights each week. Over the past five years, aircraft
landings and take-offs rose by more than 20 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Beijing Capital Airport handled more than 16
million passengers, far exceeding the designed capacity of three
million.

complex and subtle?

<HEADLINE> Japan Concerned About Australia's Coal Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Japanese trade and
industry minister expressed concern today about Australia's
reliability as its major coal supplier as a strike at a mine of
mining giant Rio Tinto is about to enter its sixth week.
</P>
<P>
After talks in Sydney with Australian officials, Japan's
International Trade and Industry Minister Shinji Sato said both
sides confirmed the importance of a continued supply of coal from
Australia to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the current strike at Rio Tinto's huge Hunter
Valley No.1 mine, Sato told reporters that "if such a dispute
would undermine the stability of supply to Japan, that's not
something I would like to see happen in Australia."
</P>
<P>
Australian coal now accounts for more than half of Japan's coal
import.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard last week criticized the
Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union for advising the
Hunter Valley mine's Asian customers to buy coal from other
Australian suppliers as the strike could go on indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 strikers will consider their next step at a mass
meeting near the mine tomorrow when the stoppage enters its sixth
week.
</P>
<P>
The dispute began on June 10 when talks between management and
labor broke down over the company's attempts to end
union-controlled work practices and introduce individual work
contracts.

<HEADLINE> Economic Crimes in S.Africa on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Office for Serious
Economic Offenses (OSEO) of South Africa are investigating 36
cases involving a total of 12 billion Rand (about 2.67 billion US
Dollars ).
</P>
<P>
OSEO Director Jan Swanepoel said at the weekend that the 36
cases under investigation were "a drop in the ocean" compared
with commercial crime cases reported to the police.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that 54,846 cases involving 851 million US
Dollars had been reported to the commercial crime unit last year
alone, compared with 51,117 cases involving 622 million US
Dollars in 1995 and 53,441 cases totaling 1.04 billion US
Dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
During 1995/96, investigations involving more than 46 million
US Dollars had been initiated, while those finalized and referred
to the attorney-general involved about 445 million US Dollars,
according to the statistics.
</P>
<P>
Swanepoel said the OSEO's capacity to investigate economic
crimes had been seriously undermined by staff shortages. It had
had to place a moratorium on fresh investigations while clearing
a backlog of cases.
</P>
<P>
The most common commercial crime is fraud, about 80 percent
of the total, followed by forgery and uttering and theft, said he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- India's regional party Dravida
Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) declared today it would withdraw its
ministers from the United Front (UF) government and extend support
to it from outside.
</P>
<P>
"The DMK is not willing to go along with parties which are
functioning with minimal plans and with persons trying to fulfill
their personal ambitions," DMK President M. Karunanidhi said in a
statement in Chennai, capital of Tamil Nadu, where the party is
based.
</P>
<P>
Since the split of the Janata Dal, the major constituent of the
UF, on July 5 this year, UF leaders have been widely divided over
the newly formed Rashtriya Janata Dal headed by Bihar State Chief
Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav.
</P>
<P>
Yadav has time and again expressed his party's continuous
support to the UF. But some UF leaders, especially Laloo Prasad's
rival -- new Janata Dal President Sharad Yadav, have been strongly
against the entry of Laloo's party into the UF. The DMK chief,
however, has expressed his support for the entry of Laloo's new
party into the UF.
</P>
<P>
"Some members of the UF are making use of it as a channel to
settle their personal scores and the front has weakened now," the
DMK chief said.
</P>
<P>
Karunanidhi said his party, to which the minister of industry
belongs, intended to withdraw its representatives from the
ministry and support the UF government from outside in order to
curtail the "suicidal tendency" that had cropped up among some
front partners and to chalk out the future course of action.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Leaves for Spain for Official Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri left here this afternoon for Madrid for a three-day
official visit to Spain, after which Hariri is to visit Britain.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's visit to Spain comes in response to an invitation from
his Spanish counterpart Jose Maria Aznar and he is scheduled to
meet King Juan Carlos I.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Spanish News Agency on the eve of the
visit, the Lebanese prime minister said that the aim of his visit
to Spain is to strengthen bilateral relations, clarify Lebanon's
position on the peace process and request Spain's support in the
implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 425 calls for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal
from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hariri reiterated that the current stalemate in the Middle East
peace process "will not affect the process of reconstruction in
Lebanon," which is considered by many Lebanese as a base of
Hariri's domestic policies.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the regional security situation, the premier ruled
out the possibility of an Israeli attack on Lebanon, but was not
optimistic about progress in the peace process in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"If the Israeli government continues with its policy, then I
suppose negotiations will remain stagnant," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hariri is accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and Interior
Minister Michel Al-Murr, Minister of State for Financial Affairs
Fuad Sinyoura, Trade Minister Yassin Jaber and Information
Minister Bassem Al-Sabaa.
</P>
<P>
On the second day of the visit, Hariri will meet a delegation
of Spanish businessmen, while a meeting between the Lebanese and
Spanish ministers of trade will focus on financial cooperation and
the signing of loan agreements.
</P>
<P>
"We want to encourage Spanish businessmen to come to Lebanon
and to invest in all sectors, especially in the fields of industry,
tourism and construction," the Lebanese prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese diplomatic sources said the visit is of great
political, economic and cultural importance.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Spain signed two cooperation agreements last year,
one regarding technical and vocational education and the other for
encouraging and guaranteeing investments.
</P>
<P>
Hariri will leave Spain for Britain Thursday to meet with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG to Set Up New Army for Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping force
known as ECOMOG has pledged to establish a new Liberian army and
police before leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG Force Commander Victor Malu, who made the
pledge on Sunday in Monrovia, capital of Liberia, said the two
security establishments would take over the provision of security
for Liberians from the peacekeeeping force.
</P>
<P>
The force was sent by the Economic Community of West African
States to Monrovia in 1990 in the heat of the Liberian crisis to
restore peace and reconcile the warring factions. It has
succeeded in disarming and demobilizing the warring factions.
</P>
<P>
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled on July
19 and the new government is to be inaugurated early next month.
And the multinational peacekeeping force is reported to leave the
country half year after the installation of the elected
government.
</P>
<P>
To allay fears that many of the former warlords might go back
to the bush to start another armed conflict if they lost the
election, Malu said whoever tried such would be doing so at his
own peril.
</P>
<P>
A substantial quantity of arms had been recovered from the
former factional fighters even after the formal disarmament, he
said, adding that exercise was going to continue through "cordon
and search operations".
</P>
<P>
Malu also said the Liberian elections would be "one of the
most observed" by the international community.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the United Nations observation mission in
Liberia, the International Foundation for Election Support, the
European Union and many other bodies have been observing
preparations for the elections and will witness how elections
will be conducted.
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide broadcast to Liberians as the polls drew
close, Malu said "I wish to assure you that the election will be
very free and fair and we shall do everything possible to prevent
any malpractices and cheating."

States are strongly complementary and there exist huge potentials
for bilateral cooperation. People and businesses of both countries
would benefit from such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jordan said that Westinghouse would continue its effort to
expand its cooperation and investment in China. Westinghouse would
actively strive to cooperate with China in its effort to
nationalize the production of nuclear power equipment, and to
support the efforts to abolish the sanction against China in
nuclear trading.

The two sides exchanged heavy artillery fires, while the
ECOMOG fired about 30 missiles at the Sierra Leonean police
headquarters, killing six police officers, including two
policewomen, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Ali Camara, spokesman of the ruling Armed Forces
Revolutionary Council of Sierra Leone, in an interview with BBC
on Sunday, accused the ECOMOG of starting the fighting.
</P>
<P>
He refused to reveal the number of casualties but confirmed
that there have been casualties on both sides.
</P>
<P>
The two sides were also in fierce fighting on Wednesday and
early Thursday near the Lungi International Airport to the north
of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leonean troops reportedly attacked the airport to
silence the radio station of ousted president Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah, which they believe is located within the airport under
the control of the ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The fightings since Wednesday have reportedly killed more than
100 people, most of them being civilians.

<HEADLINE> Mine Workers ln S.Africa Face Retrenchment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- About 100,000 mine workers
are facing retrenchment following gold price crash to below 320
U.S. Dollars an ounce in global market early this month, South
Africa's National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) has said.
</P>
<P>
The retrenchments mean that the union would be faced with
severe financial crisis, NUM President James Motlatsi said over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"About 52 percent of the workers facing retrenchment are NUM
members. At 10 Rand (2.2 U.S. Dollars) a month in union
subscriptions, we will be losing six million to seven million
Rand (1.3 million to 1.6 million U.S. Dollars)," Motlatsi said.
</P>
<P>
The retrenchment will apparently exacerbate the unemployment
problem in South Africa. At present, the number of formally
unemployed in South Africa is estimated at four million by the
Labor Ministry. However, economic analysts say the figure is
close to 15 million.
</P>
<P>
Motlatsi said the NUM and the Chamber of Mines had reached an
agreement to increase annual gold production in an effort to
preserve present levels of employment in the industry.
</P>
<P>
In addition to South Africa, the neighboring Lesotho is
believed to be hardest hit by the gold slump. It is estimated
that the country has 80,000 people working on South African
mines. These miners account for 50 percent of the kingdom's Gross
Domestic Product and are its chief export.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho would not be able to absorb workers who were
retrenched and returned to their homeland, a Pretoria-based envoy
said.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique, bordering with South Africa, will also be hit by
any retrenchments as it has between 40,000 and 45,000 workers on
South Africa's mines, the industrial sources said.

<P>
HONG KONG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A big surge on the first trading
day of this week pushed the Hong Kong stocks up to a record high
close.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng Index, the key indicator of 33 blue chips listed
on the Hong Kong bourse, picked up 145.65 points or 0.96 percent
today to close at a new high of 15,370.94 points.
</P>
<P>
Strong gaining momentum swept the Hong Kong stock market late
last week, creating a record high close of 15,225.29 points on
Friday with healthy turnover of 18.5 billion HK dollars (2.4
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Total turnover today rose to about 19 billion HK dollars (2.45
billion U.S. dollars). Utilities and finance stocks took the lead
to go up 334 points and 251 points respectively.
</P>
<P>
Securities analysts said that earlier gloomy forecast on the
properties market was reversed as private developers volunteered
to cut housing prices before the government would take any
regulatory measure.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the currency chaos plaguing some Southeastern Asian
countries could bring more money into Hong Kong. After a short
period of correction, China-affiliated corporations, known as the
red chips, regained its momentum.

PARIS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Spain was overwhelmed by anger and sadness after Miguel
Angel Blanco, a 29-year-old regional deputy, was executed by the
Basque separatist movement ETA after being held hostage for 48
hours. Hundreds of thousands of Spaniards demonstrated on Sunday
across the country to condemn the "terrorist violence" committed
by ETA.

Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The military parade celebrating the July 14 national day was
to be held today in Paris. But beyond the military parade, July
14 is also an affirmation by a people who wish to live together
and share common values. To be a Frenchman is not only to have
family allowances or unemployment compensations. It could be, one
day, to give one's life for the country.

<HEADLINE> Fujitsu Sets up Regional Headquarters in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Japanese information technology
giant Fujitsu today named Canberra as the site of its new
Asia-Pacific regional headquarters, enticed by incentive packages
from Australian federal and local governments.
</P>
<P>
Canberra won the 7.4 million U.S. dollar Asia-Pacific Desktop
Support Center over Singapore, Hong Kong, and Australia's four
major cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
Fujitsu Australia managing director Neville Roach said Canberra
won because of a "long and affectionate relationship" with
Fujitsu, its pool of highly qualified people, the high degree of
professionalism and the attractive government package.
</P>
<P>
The chance of lucrative federal government information
technology outsourcing was an added bonus, and Fujitsu would
launch strong campaigns to win outsourcing contracts, Roach said.
</P>
<P>
The incentive package from Canberra, or the Australian Capital
Territory, offered deferral of payroll tax, rent assistance, and a
training package at the Canberra Institute of Technology, provided
the jobs were forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
Australian Science Minister Peter McGauran said outsourcing of
information technology work was a significant boost to the
industry.
</P>
<P>
"The decision made by the federal government in April to
outsource information technologies, whether it be in the drafting
of software, the maintenance of the hardware and so on, is the
greatest spur to information industries, if it's not an idle
boast, in decades," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The federal Regional Headquarters Program offers tax
deductibility for the costs of setting up regional headquarters,
streamlined immigration, and tax exemption for imported computer
equipment.

<HEADLINE> Counterfeit Ugandan Currency on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Forging Uganda Shilling notes are
on the rise and are widely accepted in some neighboring
countries, the local daily ''The New Vision'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Policemen as saying that the counterfeit
Uganda Shilling notes are widely accepted in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) and other neighbouring countries where
the notes are used for various trade.
</P>
<P>
A police criminal investigation official said that in the DRC,
" the counterfeits are accepted by the population as legal tender
even knowingly.''
</P>
<P>
The Uganda Shilling is the most stable currency in east Africa
and the Great Lakes Region.
</P>
<P>
One U.S.Dollar equals to between 1,200 Uganda Shillings and
1,000 shillings during the last six years.
</P>
<P>
The official who preferred anonymity said that the increasing
business between the DRC and Uganda has helped to " fuel the
illicit trade.''
</P>
<P>
He said forging Uganda Shillings are also used in Rwanda and
Burundi and only a limited amount is used in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The state-owened Bank of Uganda, in a statement last week,
said the counterfeit Ugandan notes in circulation are in the
denominations of 1,000, 5,000 and 10,000 shillings and can be
distinguished from genuine notes because of the poor texture of
the paper, the missing water mark, images of the crane and
security thread.
</P>
<P>
Last week police arrested 10 suspected counterfeit currency
makers among whom were three Nigerians and a Kenyan financial
management consultant.

<HEADLINE> Leaving Chinese Chief of Sino-Portuguese JLG Urges Quicker Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Guo Jiading, who is leaving the post
as chief representative of the Chinese side of the Sino-Portuguese
Joint Liaison Group (JLG) very soon, said here today that the
transitional process in Macao should be quickened.
</P>
<P>
"Time is urgent but the task is arduous," he told about 400
guests attending a reception on his leaving today. "The JLG should
pick up speed in the handling of the localization of the civil
service, the localization of law and the use of Chinese as an
official language, as well as the transfer of archives and
government assets."
</P>
<P>
The 66-year-old ambassador is retiring, leaving the post to Han
Zhaokang, who co-headed several working panels of the JLG. Han is
expected to come from Beijing at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Guo said that both China and Portugal should start from a
strategic point of view and make greater efforts in handling
transitional issues.
</P>
<P>
The second chief representative of the Chinese side of the JLG,
Guo came to Macao in April 1993. He said he felt "proud" as the
JLG reached consensus on a wide range of issues over the past four
years.
</P>
<P>
China and Portugal reached agreement on the establishment and
operation of the Macao International Airport, which was
inaugurated in November 1995. They also agreed on the note-issuing
by the Bank of China Macao Branch in the same year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, two of the five leading laws in Macao -- the
criminal code and the code of criminal procedure -- have been
localized after being reviewed by the JLG.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also signed agreements not long ago on the
handling of the Orient Foundation, which is accused by local
people as siphoning money from Macao to Lisbon, on the revision of
the casino contract and the establishment of a new foundation,
all of which had haunted the JLG for years.
</P>
<P>
"These fruits represent the friendly cooperation between China
and Portugal on the basis of the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Declaration," the ambassador said. "They have laid favorable
conditions for future work of the JLG."
</P>
<P>
Guo was Chinese ambassador to Portugal before he became the
chief representative of the Chinese side of the JLG. He was bid
farewell today by officials of the Macao Government, Xinhua News
Agency Macao Branch, top executives of Chinese firms in Macao, and
other local celebrities.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan to Fight Population Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan will take measures to
fight a crisis of slowing population growth and shortening life
span, said a report released at a population conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The average life span of the Kazakh people decreased by 4.7
years to 64.9 in 1995 from 1990, and the natural population growth
rate dropped to 5.3 persons per thousand in 1996 from 13 persons
per thousand in 1991, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the birth giving rate of women was declining while
the infant mortality rate increased. The education level of
children also went down, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the government and non-governmental organizations
attributed the current situation to the slow development of the
country's economy, deteriorating environment and poor education
and health conditions.
</P>
<P>
The conference urged government institutions and
non-governmental organizations to promote economic development and
establish a new social security system, so as to solve the
nation's population crisis.

<P>
DHAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The authority of Bangladesh's
largest port Chittagong has made a special arrangement for
round-the-clock operations to expedite cargo handling to ease
vessel jam.
</P>
<P>
Under the arrangement, the port will operate 24 hours a day
even on holidays to clear the backlog caused by a strike early
this month, said port sources.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which took place at the port from July 3 to 8 over
working rights of two groups of stevedores, has caused a serious
cargo and container congestion, which was made worse by incessant
rain since July 9.
</P>
<P>
Up till today, as many as 30 cargo vessels are waiting at the
berth and outer anchorage of Chittagong for unloading.
</P>
<P>
Chittagong Port Traffic Director Sanwar Hossain said that a
control room had been set up to deal with any problem of the port
users.
</P>
<P>
The traffic director expressed the hope that the serious jam at
the port would soon be cleared with the special arrangement.

DAR ES SALAAM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Repatriation of the Congolese
refugees from Kigoma camps in western Tanzania has been
suspended as Tanzania awaits an official statement from the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here over the weekend by the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees said that the Tanzanian
authorities and the UNHCR would like to see the refugees go back
home.
</P>
<P>
However, humanitarian sources said Tanzania is waiting for
getting an official statement whether the Congo would welcome
back the refugees.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR statement also proposed an immediate meeting between
Tanzania,the DRC and the UNHCR to discuss security and
operational issues, adding that some of the refugees fear to
return to their country because they are not sure of their
security.
</P>
<P>
The statement suggested that if the Congolese government shows
welcome and assures their safety, it would encourage the refugees
to go home.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 6,500 former Zairean refugees in Tanzania
have gone back home.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran declared today that it is
determined to broaden its cooperation with Africa in a bid to
promote development in Iran and the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani expressed the hope
to continue Iran's cooperation with the African continent while
meeting with a group of experts on Africa, who are taking part in
a two-day international seminar on African affairs which opened
here today.
</P>
<P>
The president, who is expected to step down on August 3 after
his two-term in office, urged the seminar participants to find
practical ways for the expansion of the cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Specialists and scholars from Zimbabwe, Tanzania, South Africa,
Sierra Leone, Senegal, Spain, France, Germany and the U.S. take
part in the seminar.
</P>
<P>
"What has kept away Africa from prosperity, is the domination
of foreign powers that have created havoc for African people," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"We are interested in working with Africa, without a view to
gain economic profit from this cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last September, Rafsanjani launched his six-nation African tour
of Kenya, Uganda, Sudan, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and South Africa with
an aim to thwart political isolation and economic sanction imposed
on Iran by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati is currently on a
16-African nation-tour with invitation messages from Rafsanjani
to his counterparts of African countries for the Organization of
Islamic Conference (OIC) summit in Tehran in coming December.
</P>
<P>
Iran has sought to deepen political relations with a number of
African countries including Egypt, South Africa, Morocco, Senegal
and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Abdollah Kashani Movahhed, director of international affairs of
ministry of industries, said at the meeting that Iran and African
countries have paved the way for cooperation in many areas.
</P>
<P>
"Necessary agreements have been reached for expansion of
cooperation and trade relation. Postal and telecommunication
agreements have been inked and cooperation between Iranian and
African chambers of commerce have increased," he said.

<P>
LUSAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) --The Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines
(ZCCM) has been stripped of its special status and will from now
on pay taxes promptly like any others, "Times of Zambia" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA)
acting commissioner general Abraham Geevarghese as saying on
Sunday that in view of the on-going privatization of ZCCM, the
ZRA has made it a policy to treat the conglomerate like any other
companies and will demand from the ZCCM immediate settlement of
taxes.
</P>
<P>
He said previously ZCCM was given a longer period to pay its
taxes because of the size and nature of the company.
</P>
<P>
"Now with the privatization of ZCCM, we are asking them to pay
both tax and duty promptly like anybody else, they will no longer
enjoy any privileges or special treatment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA) recently estimated the ZCCM
debt at two billion Kwacha (about 1.5 million U.S. Dollars),
while the ZCCM earns the country 80 percent of its foreign
exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Military Considering Ceasefire Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The military is contemplating
whether to extend a unilateral ceasefire with Muslim rebels in the
southern Philippines, an army official said today.
</P>
<P>
Noel Detoyato, spokesman of the Army's Sixth Infantry Division
in Maguindanao province, said that the military will appraise the
peace condition in the past few days and study the need for the
second renewal of the ceasefire which is expiring at 6 a.m.
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will still assess if there is a need to extend the
ceasefire," Detoyato said, adding that all indication shows there
is a very good chance the ceasefire will be extended anew.
</P>
<P>
The army division first implemented a 48-hour unilateral
ceasefire on July 9 and extended it for another 96 hours starting
July 11, citing improved conditions in the battlefronts in
Cotabato and Maguindanao provinces.
</P>
<P>
"Our gauge for peace and order is the highway linking Cotabato
and Davao cities," explained Detoyato.
</P>
<P>
"If it remains open, it is relatively peaceful. It has been
open for the past few days. Our decision will be known tomorrow,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The military declared a temporary ceasefire after killing
dozens of Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels in an
all-out war launched against MILF rebels who engaged in
kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a 12,000-member separatist group which rejected the
peace agreement signed last year by the mainstream rebel group,
the Moro National Liberation Front, with the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar lost more
than half a U.S. cent today, closing at its lowest level for 18
months, as market players focused on the potential for a cut to
the official interest rate.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 73.83 U.S. cents, down from
Friday's close of 74.44.
</P>
<P>
MMS analyst Glenn Bull said the local unit was last seen at
current level in January 1996, and recorded a slightly lower
reading of 73.75 cents on January 29 that year.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said international traders had caused today's selldown,
but exporters had provided the currency with support at 73.80 U.S.
cents.
</P>
<P>
Market players expect the Reserve Bank of Australia to cut its
official cash rate some time after next week's release of June
quarter consumer price index data and average weekly earnings data
for May.
</P>
<P>
Australia's official cash rate of 5.5 percent, achieved on May

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, July 14 (Xinhua) -- An 18-month old boy is in good
condition after undergoing an operation to dilate his esophagus
performed at the Central Hospital of Chaozhou in south China's
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Young Huang Zengkai was born with a 1.5-cm-long stenosis, or
abnormal narrowness, of the esophagus, and vomited each time he
tried to swallow solid food.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the hospital decided to perform the surgery, the
first of the kind in the country, when they realized the infant
could not keep down liquids either, and was in danger of starving.
</P>
<P>
To do the surgery, a small scope, which is rarely used in
China, was inserted into the boy's esophagus for examination and
dilation.
</P>
<P>
Huang recovered quickly, and before his discharge from the
hospital, he was able to nibble his first bite of solid food --
steamed bread.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The owners of the Royal Jomtien
Resort Hotel will be among those held responsible for the deaths
of at least 90 people in Friday's tragic fire at the five-star
hotel, said Deputy Police Director General Salang Bunnag on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Investigation showed that guests could not escape the blaze
because the fire exits were either locked or blocked with chairs
to prevent guests from leaving the hotel without paying the bills.
</P>
<P>
The hotel did not have adequate fire safety measures, with
faulty fire escape and fire alarm systems and cooking gas
containers stored inside its kitchen.
</P>
<P>
As an emergency measure, Pattaya city has given all hotels,
condominiums and department stores in Pattaya a week to make sure
their fire safety equipment and emergency exits are in order.
</P>
<P>
The city has authority to close buildings which do not have
adequate fire safety equipment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry's Permanent Secretary
Chuwongse Chayabutra has issued orders to all provinces to
strictly enforce fire safety standards.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is amending ministerial regulations to empower
local authorities to order building owners to install fire alarms
and sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also wants to enlarge the minimum area of all new
building rooftops from six-by-six meters to 10-by-10 meters to
allow helicopters to land in an emergency and to require adequate
access from the street for fire-fighting vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Authority of Thailand has also urged hotels to
improve their safety standards.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the tragic fire has had a negative impact
on the country's tourism industry, at a time when Thailand's
economy is slowing down.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
said here today Turkey hopes that an atmosphere for peace and
cooperation should be established in this region together with a
strong and stable Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Demirel made the remarks at Ankara Esenboga Airport before his
departure for his one-day state visit to Georgia at the
invitation of his Georgian counterpart Eduard Shevardnadze.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that he and Shevardnadze will hold talks on the
common issues which Turkey and Georgia are closely following and
the important regional problems.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish president added that he will also study the
possibilities of the development of the economic and trade ties
between Turkey and Georgia and the development of the cooperation
in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that "I believe that my visit will make important
contributions to the brotherly solidarity between Georgia and
Turkey and to the further development of cooperation and
relations between our two countries."
</P>
<P>
Several agreements will be signed between the two countries to
enhance their cooperation in various fields, said Demirel.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Demirel will also meet Georgian Speaker of
the National Assembly Zurab Zhvaniya and deliver a speech at the
Turkish-Georgian Joint Business Council.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Daily News reported earlier that Demirel's tour
to Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, also aims to mediate between
the Georgian government and Abkhazia local authorities which has
been seeking for independence from the former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
Georgia has offered Abkhazia a federal status with a large
degree of local autonomy. However, Abkhazia rejected the solution
and declared independence.
</P>
<P>
Following its independence from former Soviet Union in 1991,
the Georgian government intended to abolish the autonomy of
Abkhazia, thus triggering off armed conflicts in 1992.

<HEADLINE> PNA Warns of Hebron Tension Spreading Elsewhere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Escalating tension in the West Bank
town of Hebron overshadows conditions in other Palestinian lands,
Palestinian Minister of Economy and Trade Maher Al Masri said
today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Voice of Arabs Radio, Al Masri said
recent confrontations against the Israeli forces in Hebron tend to
spread to the Palestinian lands to counter the policies adopted by
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
In the past three months, clashes have become almost a daily
scene of Hebron, a place of pilgrimage for Christians, Jews and
Muslims alike, split between Palestinians and Israeli settlers
under a deal reached in January.
</P>
<P>
Al Masri warned that the continuation of Israeli presence is
turning Hebron into a center of clashes between the Palestinians
and Israeli troops, who are stationed to protect the 450 Jewish
settlers who live on 20 percent of the volatile town.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 16 Palestinians, including five journalist were
wounded in confrontations that erupted anew Sunday between
Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli forces there.
</P>
<P>
Masri laid focus on the Palestinian stance calling upon the
Israel to abide by the signed agreements and halt settlement
construction in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the Har Homa neighborhood since March has
sparked violent protests in the Palestinian occupied territories
and stranded the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks for over three
months.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) wants a halt to the
Jewish settlement drive to revive the talks, but the Netanyahu
government insists on going ahead with the project while demanding
the resumption of security cooperation with the Palestinian side.

<HEADLINE> France Confident In Hong Kong's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A French diplomat said here
today that the future of Hong Kong is filled with tremendous
opportunities as 1997 ushers in a new era.
</P>
<P>
In a message marking the Bastille Day, the National Day of
France, which falls on July 14, Thierry Dana, Consul-General of
France in Hong Kong wrote: "1997 is the beginning of a new era for
Hong Kong. The challenge for the people of Hong Kong is
tremendous. I am convinced that they will take it up with
success."
</P>
<P>
The Consul-General pledged to make every endeavor to enhance
the French presence in Hong Kong, a city of vitality and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
According to a special report carried on today's South China
Morning Post, more than 5,000 French people now live in Hong Kong,
making it the largest French community in Asia. Over the past
decade the number of French firms based in Hong Kong has
multiplied five-fold to around 600, and today over 18,000 staffs
work in French businesses, ranging from sale of aircraft to
infrastructure, banking services, fashions and wines.
</P>
<P>
A recent poll of French companies in Hong Kong found that over
95 percent were bullish about the future of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region and were strengthening their ties with
China.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Leaves for Georgia for Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
said here today Turkey hopes that an atmosphere for peace and
cooperation should be established in this region together with a
strong and stable Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Demirel made the remarks at Ankara Esenboga Airport before his
departure for his one-day state visit to Georgia at the
invitation of his Georgian counterpart Eduard Shevardnadze.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that he and Shevardnadze will hold talks on the
common issues which Turkey and Georgia are closely following and
the important regional problems.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish president added that he will also study the
possibilities of the development of the economic and trade ties
between Turkey and Georgia and the development of the cooperation
in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that "I believe that my visit will make important
contributions to the brotherly solidarity between Georgia and
Turkey and to the further development of cooperation and
relations between our two countries."
</P>
<P>
Several agreements will be signed between the two countries to
enhance their cooperation in various fields, said Demirel.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Demirel will also meet Georgian Speaker of
the National Assembly Zurab Zhvaniya and deliver a speech at the
Turkish-Georgian Joint Business Council.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Daily News reported earlier that Demirel's tour
to Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, also aims to mediate between
the Georgian government and Abkhazia local authorities which has
been seeking for independence from the former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
Georgia has offered Abkhazia a federal status with a large
degree of local autonomy. However, Abkhazia rejected the solution
and declared independence.
</P>
<P>
Following its independence from former Soviet Union in 1991,
the Georgian government intended to abolish the autonomy of
Abkhazia, thus triggering off armed conflicts in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Press Voices Concern Over New Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian press today voiced
grave concern over the policies by the Turkish new coalition
government of Mesut Yilmaz which vowed loyalty to secularism.
</P>
<P>
The English daily Tehran Times noted in its editorial that
Turkish "army generals' decision to outlaw the Islamist Refah
Party will be suicidal for the generals."
</P>
<P>
At a February National Security Council Meeting, the Turkish
military pushed the previous government led by Necmettin Erbakan
to take tough measures against the fast expanding fundamentalism
in the secular country.
</P>
<P>
The Persian language daily Jumhuri Islami voiced its support to
the former Islamist prime minister, applausing Erbakan's defiance
of the army generals.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan resigned nearly a month ago under the pressure from the
military and some opposition parties for his failure to curb the
expanding fundamentalist influence.
</P>
<P>
President Suleyman Demirel then appointed and approved Yilmaz's
government which won a vote of confidence in the parliament last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Iran Daily noted that Yilmaz's policies favoring secularism
means war on the Islamists.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Iranian-Turkish relations, the Tehran Times
said, they will remain cordial despite of the change of power in
Ankara when "common interests are always there."
</P>
<P>
A tension between the two neighbors arose in February after
Iranian ambassador to Ankara Mohammad Reza Baqeri called on Turks
to establish an Islamic government, resulting in the downgrading
of the full diplomatic ties to the level of charge d'affaires

<HEADLINE> Kenya Seeks End to Tanzania's Halt of COMESA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is seeking a review of a
recent suspension announced by Tanzania of the preferential
tariffs of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA) on all imports from all member states.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kenyan Minister for Trade Joshua Angatia discussed
the issue with his Tanzanian counterpart William Shija and other
top Tanzanian officials when attending the 21st Dar es Salaam
International Trade Fair, "The East African" newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Further bilateral consultations and meetings between Kenya and
Tanzania are expected to be held under the East African
Cooperation (EAC) banner.
</P>
<P>
During the recent budget, Tanzanian halted the application of
COMESA tariffs for Kenyan goods, adding that all COMESA tariffs
will be subject to bilateral agreements between each member state
and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The new taxes render Kenyan goods more expensive, which will
tilt the market in favor of other exporters, particularly South
Africa, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Among products expected to be affected heavily by the move are
beers manufactured by Kenyan Breweries Ltd., which now controls
more than 15 percent of the Tanzanian beer market.
</P>
<P>
Other would-be affected Kenyan goods include motor vehicle
spare parts and accessories, textile, cosmetics, chemical
products, food and drinks, household, steel products, cigarettes,
leather and leather products, and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
The suspension is seen as a significant drawback in endeavors
by the COMESA and EAC member states to eliminate all tariff and
non-tariff barriers by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kenyan trade minister said that he has "already
received an assurance from the Tanzanian authorities that this
measure is only temporary until the current rationalization of
the country's fiscal policies and taxation is complete."
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has explained that the measure is aimed at
eradicating weaknesses in its tax collection structure which has
led to an abuse of the system.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tanzanian side has accused Kenyan manufacturers
of abusing the preferential tax arrangement through re-packing
their products or undervaluing goods.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania Revenue Authority initially decided to suspend
preferential tariffs on all steel products from Kenya, charging
that most Kenyan steel manufacturers imported raw materials from
non-COMESA countries, in breach of the COMESA agreement on rules
of origin.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has firmly denied the accusation but the
ban still remains and has reportedly made the Kenyan steel
industry lost a substantial portion of their Tanzanian market.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade between Kenya and Tanzania has shot up
from 34.5 million U.S. Dollars in 1993 to 292 million Dollars
last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Tanzania took about 13 percent of all merchandise
exports from Kenya, replacing Britain as Kenya's second largest
export destination.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has also become a significant supplier of foods,
fish, electric transformers, tyres, cigarettes, cotton seed cake
and other industrial inputs to Kenya.

<HEADLINE> S. Africans Urged to Protect Water Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will face water
crisis within 30 years if there is no proper management of water
resources, a Water Affairs Department official has warned.
</P>
<P>
Local daily "The Star" today quoted Johann Van Rooyen, Project
Planning Director of the department, as saying that water
supplies for future development in the country would be exhausted
in three decades unless scarce resources are properly managed in
an integrated manner.
</P>
<P>
Rooyen urged coordinated and collective consideration of the
existing and proposed industrial developments in Northern
Province, and the ecological requirements of the Kruger National
Park.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, rich in mineral resources, is short of water.
Over-consumption of water resources in mines and man-made water
pollution have worsened the water shortage in the country.
</P>
<P>
Water Affairs Minister Kader Asmal has warned that if South
Africa did not change its approach to the management of its
scarce water resources, the country would simply run out of
water.
</P>
<P>
Asmal said his ministry would implement a new water policy
which would ensure that South Africa would survive and thrive
well into the future.
</P>
<P>
He said mines and individuals would be prosecuted in the
future for water pollution.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Proves to be Rich Source of Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has secured its
position as one of the world's largest sources of foreign direct
investment, a local English paper today quoted a study by the UN
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) as saying.
</P>
<P>
Today's South China Morning Post reported that Hong Kong pumped
27 billion US dollars in outward investment in 1996, accounting
for three fifths of the total overseas investment by Asian
developing economies.
</P>
<P>
The outward investment from Hong Kong mainly flew into the
inland areas of China, which remained the leading receipt of
foreign direct investment in Asia, and the second largest in the
world behind the United States, according to the UNCTAD study.
</P>
<P>
The investment flowing into the Chinese inland areas hit 42
billion US dollars last year, a considerable rise from 37.5
billion US dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the UNCTAD study, David Dodwell, said that the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) would continue to
play the role of a "mediator of foreign investment".

<HEADLINE> Village Pulses With Times (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- For the past two decades, villagers
in Yichegashan have relied on word-of-mouth to spread the talk of
the town among the 11 ethnic groups living there.
</P>
<P>
And Sun Zhongjian, the village Party secretary of the
3,000-member village in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, said
the most-talked topics are considered "frontpage news".
</P>
<P>
"Though such information cannot be broadcast or televised," Sun
said. "it has been passed on orally, and every piece of the news
has been closely connected with the country's major
policies. Villagers learn the tricks of working for a better life
by passing on the news."
</P>
<P>
Minorities living in the village include the Xibo, Uygur,
Kazak, the Han, the Hui, Mongolia, Daur and several others.
</P>
<P>
Yichegashan, which means "new village" in the Xibo language,
was covered with reed marshes 40 years ago. Now it is thick with
lush greenery.
</P>
<P>
Song and other villagers believe their tradition of oral
history leaves behind a rich chronicle of events for the village's
younger generations to learn from.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, the biggest news was that three students went to
college. This was the second year China offered the national
entrance exam for higher learning, which allowed ethnic minority
students whose grades are much lower than average to enroll in
university.
</P>
<P>
One of the three students was the son of Wasiga, a Daur
farmer. "Just think, scores of villagers saw him off at that
time, beating drums and gongs. But now, my granddaughter went to
college alone, carrying a suitcase all by herself," the
66-year-old man said.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 students from the village have gone to college in
the past two decades and most have found jobs in cities.
</P>
<P>
A couple of years later, upgraded living conditions became the
hot topics. For years, villagers had difficulty obtaining drinking
water in winter and had to carry ice packed in gunnysacks carried
by donkey-drawn carts. Bumpy roads were a hazard to incoming
trucks, which got stuck easily and had to be pulled out by tractor.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the local government spent nearly a million yuan to
provide clean water and improve the roads.

<TEXT>
<P>
The most important news came in 1984 when China adopted the
household contract responsibility system in rural areas. This is
news that never gets old, as people still benefit from the system
now. At that time, the village's per-capita income was 500 yuan;
last year it topped 2,100 yuan.
</P>
<P>
A third of the families earn more than 30,000 yuan annually,
and many of them operate their own business.
</P>
<P>
Two other newsworthy events happened that year: The village
built a mosque for its Muslims, and the village primary school
began offering Xibo language courses. At the same time, the
National People's Congress approved a law of regional national
autonomy, which guaranteed various rights and interests for ethnic
minorities.
</P>
<P>
Other newsmakers were villagers who made good money using
advanced technology. A villager surnamed Liang bought a farm-use
truck, and took in four ethnic minority apprentices, who later
trained their own assistants. As a result, the village's farm work
is now mostly done by machines.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Jiangxi Province Tries to Find More Storage Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Jiangxi Province, one of China's
leading rice-growing areas, will face not only a record harvest
of summer grain but also the problem of what to do with an excess
supply.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi Province lacks storage capacity for 2.5 billion
kilograms. In response, the province's Governor Shu Shengyou has
urged all counties to build additional grain depots.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has already put aside 40 million yuan
(4.82 million US dollars) for makeshift storehouse construction,
according to officials.
</P>
<P>
They said the storage capacity will meet all necessary
requirements before this summer harvest.
</P>
<P>
Among the 8.5 billion kilograms of in-stock rice, early rice
accounts for about seven billion kilograms, including that which
has been in storage for four years.
</P>
<P>
Traditional early rice is not appealing to rice consumers who
don't like the taste.
</P>
<P>
"To basically solve the problem of overstock, we must readjust
the mix of farm produce," Shu said.
</P>
<P>
He said farmers should be permitted to plant whatever
they like as long as they don't destroy high-yield areas needed
for tree planting or fish breeding.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China is making progress in
carrying out its sustainable development strategy in 14 major
social and economic areas, according to a recent government report.
</P>
<P>
The report Chinese Government presented to the UN Conference on
Environment and Development shows that the natural growth of
China's population in 1995 dropped 3.84 per thousand,
compared with the figure five years earlier.
</P>

The drop indicate that China's birth rate is apparently lower
than the average birth rate of other developing countries, and
the excessive birth increase has been brought under control.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Chinese people are beginning to have
better educational opportunities.
</P>
<P>
China has placed special emphasis on development-oriented
poverty relief in a move to enhance poor people's ability to help
themselves. As a result, its poor population has dropped from 80
million in 1993 to 58 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
It has also increased efforts to improve the living environment
and residential conditions.
</P>
<P>
Varied achievements have been scored in the agriculture and
rural economy, industry, energy and consumer goods production,
land resources, forest resources, water resources, marine
resources, disaster prevention and reduction, atmosphere
protection, solid waste disposal, and biological diversification
protection, the report said.

LUSAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) --A senior official of the Common

organization's member states against withdrawing their
governments' involvment in economic activities.
</P>
<P>
Joe Mwencha, the Acting Secretary General of COMESA, warned that
economies of the COMESA will face a danger of collapse if the
private sectors are left alone in generating national economic
opportunies, the local daily Times of Zambia quoted as reporting

There has never been an example of a developed country whose
economy is enhanced by the private sector alone without the most
important role of government, Mwencha said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "While privatization is an engine for growth, it must
not bring about the government's complete withdrawal from
building its own economy."
</P>
<P>
He cited Mauritius as an example of the importance of
government role in an economy within the COMESA region, saying
that the government has been covering the expenses of their
private sectors economic potential exploration.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The museum dedicated to the
August 1 "Nanchang Uprising" in this capital of east China's
Jiangxi Province has been renovated to mark the 70th anniversary
of the event and also the founding of the People's Liberation Army
(PLA).
</P>
<P>
It has been the largest scale makeover of the museum since it
was built in 1957 to commemorate the first shot fired by the
Chinese Communist Party against the Kuomintang reactionaries in
Nanchang, which took place on August 1, 1927. This battle marked
the beginning of the Chinese Communist Party's independent
leadership over revolutionary wars.
</P>
<P>
In 1933, the Central Democratic Government of Workers and
Farmers designated August 1 as the birthday of the PLA, China's
armed forces, and celebrated the day for the first time.
</P>
<P>
A room in memory of the leaders of and some participants in the
uprising has opened as part of the renovation, and a multi-media
presentation combining film and television programs has been added
to the section of the museum where historic pictures, cultural
relics, maps, paintings and sculptures about the uprising are on
display.
</P>

MANILA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) is experiencing a leadership problem as the rebel group has
split into two factions, a senior military official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Nestor Castillo, civil relations service chief of the Armed
Forces of the Philippines, said he has been informed by field
reports that the MILF has split into the hard liners and the
moderates.
</P>
<P>
Castillo said the moderates favored the government effort to
make peace and wanted the MILF to negotiate with the government
while the hard liners preferred war.
</P>
<P>
"This is the start of the end of the MILF," he said, adding the
MILF's problem is deeply rooted and couldn't be patched up easily.
</P>
<P>
Castillo quoted Raul Urgello, chief of the army's Sixth
Infantry Division, as saying that the rift within the MILF was
caused by the problem on command and control over their field
commanders.
</P>
<P>
Government troops have been fighting MILF rebels since earlier
last month, killing dozens of rebels. At present, the two sides
are observing a ceasefire and trying to reopen their stalled peace

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Copper Output Rises in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Consolidated Copper
Mines (ZCCM) yielded 25,422 tons of finished copper products in
May, the second month of the 1997/98 financial year.
</P>
<P>
The May figure was 322 tons above target and over 4,000 tons
better than the previous month's which stood at 21,380 tons,
according to the latest issue of the Mining Mirror, organ of the
state-owned copper conglomerate ZCCM.
</P>
<P>
The output increase was attributed to the good performance of
the smelters in three of the company's divisions -- Mufulira,
Luanshya and Nchanga -- following the resolution of the heavy
fuel oil problems the company previously experienced.
</P>
<P>
However, the company produced only 301 tons of cobalt in May,
76 tons below the estimated target.
</P>
<P>
The ZCCM is the major foreign exchange earner of Zambia whose
over 80 percent foreign exchange is from the export of copper
products.

<HEADLINE> Political Violence Still Claims Lives in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- At least 1,070 people were
killed in South Africa's political violence in the past three
years, local daily the Citizen reported today.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the deaths occurred in bloody political feuding
between the ruling African National Congress (ANC) and the
Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), a regional political organization in
Kwazulu Natal Province.
</P>
<P>
The rest of killings took place in other provinces and for
different reasons.
</P>
<P>
The non-government Human Rights Committee (HRC) said violence
which took place in areas like the Gauteng industrial heartland,
Eastern Cape and Northern Province since the abolition of
apartheid in 1994, was related to frustration at slow delivery of
housing and other basic services by the local government.
</P>
<P>
Although political killings remain in South Africa, HRC
officials stressed that violence resulted from political
differences had dropped markedly.
</P>
<P>
Paul Pereira, spokesman for the South African Institute of
Race Relations, pointed out that the first non-racial general
elections in 1994 had defused much of the tension which led to
nearly 3,800 political killings in 1993.
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest factors in cooling things down since 1994
is the fact that "the current government is accepted and
structures like the security forces and courts are accepted as
ligitimate," he added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that senior leaders of the ANC and the IFP
have held almost one year of secret talks to eliminate difference
of opinions so as to pave the way to stem the violence.
</P>
<P>
IFP, the biggest black opposition party in South Africa, has
been demanding for devolution of administrative power to
provinces.
</P>
<P>
"We feel it is necessary that we devolve downwards as much as
possible the administrative capacity of central government
departments," IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said early this
month.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the IFP stood firm on principles of
non-violence and passive resistance, saying his party honestly
believed in peace.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lifter Claims Last World Record at Asian Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGZHOU, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Wang Yanmei of China claimed the
last world record on the final day of the 10th women's and 19th
men's Asian weightlifting championships here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wang snatched 112.5 kilograms to beat the previous world mark
of 109 kg held by compatriot Ding Meiyuan.
</P>
<P>
Wang then skipped her third and final attempt in snatch to save
energy for the clean and jerk events.
</P>
<P>
But she was eventually beaten in the jerk event by Chen
Hsiao-Lien of Chinese Taipei who lifted 140kg. Wang also lifted
140kg but she had to settle for the second place.
</P>
<P>
Wang managed to win the overall gold with a total of
252.5kg. Chen finished second with 250kg.
</P>
<P>
The women's 83kg category was dominated by Zhang Xiaoli of
China. She took the category's three golds, but her winning
results were quite modest compared with the world records.
</P>
<P>
In the men's section, Cui Wenhua of China met no challenge from
his opponents.
</P>
<P>
Cui took the snatch gold with 185kg, beating his solo opponent
Hironobo Asada of Japan by 35 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The clean and jerk gold medal also went to Cui after he lifted
200kg in his second attempt. That also gave him a winning total of
385 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The men's over-108kg class was won by Khalilovi of Uzbekistan
who snatched 17kg, jerked 210kg and garnered a 380kg total for a
clean sweep.

<HEADLINE> Hangzhou Scholar Develops New Way to Learn Spoken Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A scholar from Hangzhou
University has worked out an easy way to learn the standard spoken
Chinese language, which will benefit both local Chinese and
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The project, named "Study on The Rhythm of the Chinese
Language," was financed by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jiemin, director of Oral and Written Language Application
Research Center of Hangzhou University based in this capital of
Zhejiang Province, has spent eight years studying the rhythm of
the Chinese language and discovered its regular pattern.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wu summed up seven types of rhythm in the Chinese
language and invented special symbols to instruct people in the
proper speed, pronunciation and tones to be used when speaking
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
So far, dozens of schools of all levels have adopted such
symbols in language teaching and have produced notable
results. Even children in kindergartens can include the pauses,
stresses, intonation and rhythm when reading an article after
being taught the symbols.
</P>
<P>
These symbols are especially useful for foreigners to correct
their odd-sounding tones while speaking Chinese. "Reading a new
text used to be very difficult for me," a student from Japan said,
"But when I followed the symbols added by Professor Wu, I found it
much easier, just like singing."

<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, chief of general staff
of the People's Liberation Army of China met here today with Amorn
Naewmalee, Thai air commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
Extending welcome to Naewmalee, Fu said that China and Thailand
are friendly neighbors whose people and armed forces have enjoyed
traditional friendship.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation of the two sides in political, economic and
cultural fields has continued to grow since they forged diplomatic
relations more than 20 years ago, Fu said.
</P>
<P>
There are frequent contacts between the senior leaders of the
two sides, including those of the two armed forces, Fu said,
adding that this has played an important role in increasing the
friendship of the two countries and their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Fu noted that the armed forces of the two countries also learn
from each other's experiences, and work together to build their
military systems and provide the support of the military in the
national economic construction.
</P>
<P>
Fu said he believes that Naewmalee's visit will play a positive
role in expanding the contacts and cooperation between the two
militaries.
</P>
<P>
Naewmalee said that the People's Liberation Army is a great
military force, and that its quality and role in national politics
and economic construction has become the focus of world attention.
</P>
<P>
The Thai armed forces hope to strengthen exchanges and
cooperation with the PLA in areas of personnel training and
technical equipment, Naewmalee added.
</P>
<P>

meeting.

<HEADLINE> Yellow River Runs Dry in Shandong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Yellow River, which runs
through most of north China, has dried up on its lower reaches in
Shandong Province since late June, leaving a serious drought in
its wake.
</P>
<P>
Beginning at the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the second-longest
river in the country flows across eight provinces before emptying
into the Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
Hydrologists in the province said the dry-up occured on June 23
and has extended beyond its border to neighboring Henan Province,
creating the lengthiest dry bed the river has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Yellow River has had more frequent dry-ups
on its lower reaches, caused by less rainfall on the river's upper
and middle parts and increased water consumption in the region,
according to hydrologists.
</P>
<P>
The drought-stricken areas have reported an annual loss
estimated at about 1.4 billion yuan in agriculture and industrial
production.
</P>
<P>
Some species of fish are facing extinction and the expanding
dry areas make the region more prone to disasters caused by
sandstorms and windstorms.
</P>
<P>
Hydrologists also cautioned that the shrinking river course would
reduce the river's discharge capacity during flood season.
</P>
<P>
The seriousness of this year's dry-river spell has grabbed the
attention of government officials and experts who are working full
force to alleviate the situation.

<HEADLINE> Four Policemen Acquitted in Bangladesh Rape Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Four policemen accused of raping a
garment worker, Shima Chowdhury, who later died in jail, were
acquitted Sunday by a Chittagong court, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Syed Enayetullah, judge of the Special Tribunal Against
Repression on Child and Women, gave the verdict in a packed court,
claiming the sensational Shima Case is a case without evidence or
proof.
</P>
<P>
However, Public Prosecutor Advocate Nurus Safa Talukder said
that they would think about appeal to the High Court after getting
the copy of the judgment.
</P>
<P>
The government filed a case against four police constables
early this year on charge of raping Shima Chowdhury, who was
arrested on October 8 last year and died at Chittagong Jail
custody on February 7 this year.
</P>
<P>
Shima's death in the jail provoked nationwide condemnation and
protest by various organizations, who strongly demanded the
investigation of the case and punishment to the culprits.
</P>
<P>
According to the prosecution story, Shima was picked up by
policemen while going to her village home in Raozan county along
with her boyfriend, Abdul Hafiz, on October 8 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Police then took her to Raozan county where she was allegedly
raped by policemen in the temporary custody at midnight on October
9.
</P>
<P>
A case was filed with Raozan county against five policemen.
Later, Shima was sent to a Chittagong district jail for safe
custody where she died mysteriously on February 7 this year.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, the Home Ministry formed a probe body to inquire
into the mysterious death of the girl. A parliamentary committee
headed by Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad was also formed to
investigate the case and the investigation is still in progress.

<HEADLINE> Flood Toll Rises to 79 in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- With the reports of at least 22
fresh deaths coming here today, the death toll rose to 79 so far
in the current flood, which has inundated one third of
Bangladesh's land area and caused millions of people homeless.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, nine people were killed in southern Chittagong
district, seven in Cox's Bazar, four in Rangamati and two in
northwestern Manikganj, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the flood situation on Sunday marked slight
improvement in the eastern and southeastern regions while further
deterioration in the northern districts, according to the Flood
Information Center.
</P>
<P>
Road communications between the capital Dhaka and 16 northern
districts remained suspended in the absence of ferry service
across the Jamuna river, and Dhaka-Sylhet and Sylhet-Comilla
roadlinks snapped Sunday morning due to a bridge collapse.
</P>
<P>
In the northern districts, more areas in the worst-hit
districts went under water and some parts were devoured by the
swelling rivers. Standing crops on thousands of acres of land were
damaged while hundreds of thousands of people remained marooned in
the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
A weather export said that the monsoon rains triggering floods
in 22 districts are on the wane after washing the country with a
fury that had been unusual this season.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Finland: No Joint Border Defense With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari today restated his country's refusal to build joint
border defense with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari said this at the country's Turku airport after a
two-day working visit to Russia on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Border defense was a matter of each country of its own, and
joint defense would not work, he said.
</P>
<P>
Before Ahtisaari's arrival in Russia, Russian President Boris
Yeltsin proposed that Russia and Finland build joint border
defense to cut expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Each country had the right to decide on its defense issues, and
Finland would closely cooperate with NATO despite Russia's
continuous opposition to NATO's eastward expansion, Ahtisaari
said.

<P>
KATHMANDU, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The meeting of the Nepal-India
Joint Working Group on Border Management is to be held here on
July 16, a Nepali newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting will work out ways to curb border
crossing between the two countries by undesirable elements and to
regulate movements across the border, the national Kathmandu Post
reported quoting a government source.
</P>
<P>
It said the meeting is expected to be exploratory in nature
with both sides suggesting acceptable measures to regulate the
over 1,000 kilometer long open border between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
But on the agenda could also be the identification of Indian
nationals at the border area which has been identified as
"troubled area", since they do not have citizenship certificates
like Nepalese, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was desired by Nepali Prime Minister Lokendra

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The current drought in Indonesia
has affected at least 50,571 hectares of rice fields, of which
4,133 are declared totally damaged, Agriculture Minister
Sjarifudin Baharsjah said.
</P>
<P>
Though the affected rice fields reached over 50,000 hectares,
the rice production in 1997 would not be disturbed, the minister
told a meeting here, Antara news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the most-affected
rice fields were located in West Sumatra, reaching 14,054 hectares
with 947 hectares of land declared unusable.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the widest rice plantations which were totally
damaged were located in West Nusa Tenggara, covering 2,895
hectares.
</P>
<P>
In Java alone which constituted the country's rice barn and
contributed some 60 percent of the national rice production, the
affected rice fields covered 6,461 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Other rice-producing provinces outside Java, whose rice fields
are affected by drought, including Aceh, West Sumatra, South
Sulawesi.
</P>
<P>
The acreage of rice fields to be affected by drought and those
to be declared unusable are expected to increase because the
current drought is still going on, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's rice production in 1996 stood at 51.8 million tons
of unhasked rice.
</P>
<P>
Sjarifudin said that food production target in 1997 would be
achieved although this year's drought will be longer.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Ministry projected that this year's paddy
planting areas are 11.249 million hectares with estimated paddy
production of 52.19 million tons equivalent to 34 million of rice.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Dollar Reserve Shrinks to 10 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' foreign exchange
reserve has shrunk to 10 billion from 12 billion U.S dollars in
the past 10 days due to the Central Bank's heavy selling of dollar
to protect the peso, Central Bank governor Singson said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Singson said in an interview that the bank intervened by
selling more dollars to stabilize the peso which had been under
speculative attacks after the floating of the Thai baht.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the country's foreign exchange reserve fell to 10
billion dollars prior to the bank's announcement to allow the peso
to move in a wider range since Friday, he said.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the bank reset its dollar reserve target for
the year from 13 billion to 10 billion while reiterating that it
is closely guarding the outflow of the country's dollar reserve.
</P>
<P>
However, Singson said the Central Bank is always ready to lose
more dollars once the situation in the country's exchange market
gets out of hand.
</P>
<P>
He urged the public not to panic, saying the peso-dollar
exchange rate is expected to stabilize this week.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Puts Inflation at 6 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's inflation will rise by
about 6 percent this year as a result of the baht's depreciation,
according to the Bangkok Post today quoting the Bank of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's estimate contrasts with other analysts'
predictions of as much as 10 percent, which are based on the fact
that imports will be more expensive, and most of the country's
manufactured exports rely on high import content.
</P>
<P>
Central bank governor Rerngchai Marakanond said the consumer
price index was estimated to reach an annualized rate of 8 percent
in the second half of this year, compared with 4.5 percent for the
first six months.
</P>
<P>
The central bank is using high interest rates to curb
speculation on the baht. It requires financial institutions to
borrow from the central bank's bond repurchase window at high
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The interbank rate soared to 20 percent last week, with the
overnight repurchase rate at 17 percent, and the interfinance rate
as high as 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Rerngchai said the public has to understand that there would be
pain on the road to stability.

<P>
HANGZHOU, June 14 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
has enacted a set of new regulations to protect investors from
Taiwan and has listed categories of preferential treatment for
Taiwan investors.
</P>
<P>
The Regulations of Zhejiang Province on Protecting Investment
by Taiwan Compatriots, adopted by the provincial legislature on
June 28, went into effect on July 8.
</P>
<P>
Coastal Zhejiang Province is north of Fujian Province, which is
separated from Taiwan by the Taiwan Strait. Zhejiang is one of the
top five province-level areas which receive the most investment
from Taiwan, after Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangsu and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
To date, Taiwan business people have set up more than 2,500
enterprises in Zhejiang with investment totaling 4.2 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The regulations, based on a national law on protecting Taiwan
investment, are designed to encourage Taiwan business people to
become further involved in economic cooperation with this
province, said Qiu Mingfa, deputy director of the Provincial
Office on Taiwan Affairs.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, Taiwan investors have multiple
choices in investing in the province, such as joint ventures,
co-operation or exclusive investment. They may either conduct
compensation trade and processing trade, purchase, merge, rent or
contract to run enterprises, or buy stocks, securities and house
property, and engage in developing land, the regulations stipulate.
</P>
<P>
Preferential treatment for Taiwan investors listed in the
regulations includes priority in providing water, electricity, gas
and other production conditions, and exemption of local taxes
under certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
To halt illicit fee collections in some places, the regulations
forbid any organizations or individuals to collect fees from
Taiwan-funded businesses.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan investors, their families and employees from Taiwan will
also be treated the same as local residents when it comes to
buying houses, lodging, medical care, travel, transportation,
telecommunications and education for their children, the
regulations state.

PRAGUE, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Ivo Kosatik, major of the Czech

</P>
<P>
Olomouc was hit recently by heavy floods rarely seen in
history, suffering enormous economic and personal losses.
</P>
<P>
At a time when he was badly needed to lead his people to fight

<P>
Kosatik has been strongly condemned after what he has done is
disclosed by the press.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus immediately said Kosatik's
behaviour is "unimaginable," while Jiri Vlach, vice-chairman of
the Chamber of Deputies, said, it "is an absurdity, which is
totally against the principles as a human being."
</P>
<P>
"He is not qualified to be our mayor as he deserted us when we
were in the most difficult moment," said an Olomouc resident,
representing locals who are considering a motion to expel Kosatik
from the ruling Civic Democratic Party, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Will Continue Enlargement: Albright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright assured the three Baltic Foreign Ministers that NATO
enlargement will continue after the Madrid summit, according to
Itar-Tass reports from Vilnius, capital of Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference of foreign ministers from
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, Albright, who just arrived in
Vilnius from a working visit in St. Petersburg, stated that NATO's
door will remain open to all applicants if they are ready for
admission.
</P>
<P>
In response to the question on how to guarantee the Baltic
states' security, voiced by Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov in St. Petersburg today, Albright said joint (Russia and
the West) guarantees are basically possible.
</P>
<P>
However, all countries, including Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia, have an inseparable right to independent choice of its
security and stability, she added.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that her meetings with the Lithuanian leaders and
the foreign ministers focused on results of the NATO Madrid summit
and prospects for the Baltic states membership in the alliance.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, they also reviewed the draft charter
"USA-Baltics" developed in Washington and US plans on cooperation,
security and stability in the Baltic region, Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers all expressed satisfaction with the
Madrid summit results and hailed the invitation to Poland, Hungary
and the Czech Republic to start negotiations on NATO membership.

<HEADLINE> China to Build More Sugar Mills for Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China and Myanmar signed a contract
 here today on building two more new sugar mills in the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract between the China National Heavy Machinery
Corporation and state-run Myanmar Sugarcane Enterprise, the
Chinese firm will build the two sugar factories, each with a
capacity of 2,000 tons of sugarcane per day.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Minister for Agriculture and Irrigation Lt-Gen Myint
Aung and Chinese Charge d'Affaires Yu Tiegen attended the
signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the China National Complete Plant Import and
Export (Yunnan) Corporation signed a contract with Myanmar to
build two sugar mills in the country.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is rich in sugarcane resources, but sugar is still in
great demand. The country's sugar output in the 1996-97 fiscal
year ended in March was 76,000 tons with a per capita consumption
of only 1.6 kilograms, according to official statistics.

<HEADLINE> Railway Tourism Booming in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region, and Shaanxi and Gansu provinces have made
concerted efforts to develop tourism along the Baoji-Zhongwei
Railway connecting the three areas.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 scenic spots have been developed along the 489-km
railway line from Baoji City in Shaanxi to Zhongwei City in
Ningxia. Tourists worldwide have flocked to see the natural
scenery and historical relics there, such as ancient towns and
tombs, the Taoist "holy land," sandy hills, and the culture of the
famous "Silk Road."
</P>
<P>
Experts agree that the railway has helped to form a "tourism
corridor" for the three areas.
</P>
<P>
To further promote tourism, Ningxia has planned to build ten
tourism tourism zones over the next three years, and Baoji City
has decided to invest 450 million yuan in developing four tourism
projects including the Tiantai Mountains Forest Park by the end of
the century.

<HEADLINE> Moratorium of Fishing Succeeding in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China's moratorium on offshore
fishing, which is set from July 1 to October 31, has been
enforced again this year to conserve offshore fishing resources,
today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
This is the third year the moratorium is being enforced,
according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
From July 1 to August 31, offshore fishing is suspended between
27 degrees 35 degrees north latitude, from the northern past of
the East China Sea to the southern Yellow Sea. And from September
1 to October 31, fishing is only allowed beyond 30 nautical miles
offshore in those areas, according to the moratorium.
</P>
<P>
The moratorium limits the proportion of immature fish caught to
no more than 25 percent of each catch. Rampant catching of
immature fish during the September-October period in 1995 caused a
sharp decrease in last year's marine harvest.
</P>
<P>
This year the ministry will work with the State Administration for
Industry and Commerce, an industrial watchdog, to supervise
fishing during the September-October period.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will extend the duration of the moratorium and
expand the areas affected in the East China, Yellow and Bohai seas
starting next year, the fishing bureau reported.

Henan Province, who feel that the government is working to protect
their interests and thus are encouraged to cultivate more grain.
</P>
<P>
 "Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- China has made initial success in its experimentation with
management of enterprises. The experimental enterprises scored a
total annual profit of over 4.2 billion yuan (about 500 million US
dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
-- The spread of science and technology has helped Henan's
summer grain production hit a record high of about 24 billion kg,
an increase of 3.2 billion kg over last year. More than 40 percent
of the increased grain production is attributed to the use of
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
"China Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- China has achieved substantial results in a battle against
nature to try to control the erosion of soil by water and
wind. Thanks to the implementation of its first Water and Soil
Erosion-Control Law, hundreds of thousands of square kilometers of
eroded land has been controlled.
</P>
<P>
-- China's industrial and commercial tax revenues maintained a
rapid growth during the first six months this year and
accomplished more than half of the year's tax target, the State
Administration of Taxation (SAT) said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
-- Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, speaking to a two-day meeting on
grain purchase and sales on Friday, urged government offices
nationwide to strictly implement the State grain purchase policy
that requires local governments to buy grain at protective prices
from growers.

<HEADLINE> China's Tax Revenue Maintains Fast Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China's industrial and commercial
tax revenue maintained a fast growth during the first six months
this year and accomplished more than half of the year's tax
target, today's China Daily quoted the State Administration of
Taxation (SAT) as saying.
</P>
<P>
Through June, China levied about 358 billion yuan ($43
billion), up 19.5 percent from the same period last year, Xiang
Huaicheng, SAT's deputy director, said at a national taxation
conference in Weifang, Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
China's tax revenue during the period fulfilled 51.5 percent of
the annual tax plan.
</P>
<P>
Taxes collected by the central government in the first half of
this year climbed 20.8 percent to 198 billion yuan while those
going to local governments went up 17.9 percent to 160 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The consumption tax and the value-added tax (VAT), two major
parts of China's tax regime, rose 13.3 percent to 192 billion yuan
by the end of June, reaching 47 percent of the year's target.
</P>
<P>
Despite the increase in tax yield in the first half this year,
"the tasks for the second half are still arduous," Xiang said.
</P>
<P>
He urged taxation departments at the various levels to step up
efforts to ensure that this year's tax target will be attained.
</P>
<P>
Taxes in arrears, for example, is one of the major obstacles to
normal taxation. Xiang called for stronger management efforts to
eliminate tax defaulters.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will also be made to fortify audits to prevent tax
evasion, especially checking those enterprises that report
abnormal VAT accounts.
</P>
<P>
Xiang promised harsher penalty to those deceiving taxation
authorities.
</P>
<P>
He also asked authorities to focus on budget management to
guarantee timely payment by some key taxpayers. Meanwhile, proper
taxation of smaller sources should not be ignored, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, Xiang also urged taxation authorities to
enhance the collection and inspection of VAT, individual income
tax and taxes from private sectors, through ways including
fortifying the deduction system on individual income taxes,
promoting tax registration and account establishment for
privately-owned businesses.

<HEADLINE> Erosion Control Working </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved substantial
results in a battle against Nature to try to control the erosion
of soil by water and wind, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the implementation of its first Water And Soil
Erosion-Control Law, the soil defenders have so far succeeded in
controling hundreds of thousands of square kilometers of eroded
land.
</P>
<P>
China still faces a difficult erosion-control
situation. Victory is coming neither cheaply nor quickly. The
control process is slow, particularly when compared to the
country's recent rapid economic development and
urbanization. While the government heals decades-old erosions,
man-made activities create new causes of erosion.
</P>
<P>
In the last six years, local regulations under the
erosion-control law have been issued in more than two-third of
China's provinces and autonomous regions, said Zhang Chunyuan, the
vice-minister of Water Resources.
</P>
<P>
The national law has helped local governments check and approve
more than 182,600 water and soil conservation programs and
projects, including a number of key State developments. Some
36,000 serious erosion cases have been dealt with by local
governments, which charged 320 million yuan in fees to control
erosion or compensate for it, Zhang noted.
</P>
<P>
To prevent new, man-made erosion caused by construction, the
law prescribes that no project will be approved by the pertinent
government authorities without a well-drafted, practical
erosion-control plan.
</P>
<P>
Under such an enforcement and supervisory system, a record 1.8
billion yuan has been collected from builders to pay to prevent or
control erosion caused during construction.
</P>
<P>
"A tentative conservation law-enforcement system composed of
more than 62,000 professionals and part-time inspectors in more
than 1,100 counties is shaping up," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that erosion, particularly erosion caused by
human activities, has worsened despite the unremitting efforts
made to combat it.
</P>
<P>
Although China has basically controlled about 700,000 square
kilometers of eroded land in the last four decades, water-eroded
land has increased from 150,000 square kilometers in the 1950s to
180,000 square kilometers today.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account another 180,000 square kilometers of
wind-eroded land, 3.6 million square kilometers -- 38 percent of
China's land mass -- has been under the threat of serious erosion.
</P>
<P>
One of the most serious issued that remained unchanged was the
tendency in some localities toward ignoring soil-and
water-conservation while pursuing economic development, Zhang
said. He pledged that his ministry will strictly enforce the law
to halt such thoughtless damage.
</P>
<P>
Zhang and other experts urged that public awareness of China's
erosion-controls be heightened. It is one of the four fundamental
State policies along with family planning, environmental
protection and conservation of arable land.

<HEADLINE> State Steel Sector Prioritizes Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of China's steel industry
believe it's time to make a reputation for quality in spite its
long-time fame for quantity, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English newspaper quotes Wang Chengyong,
deputy director of the quality supervision department of the
Ministry of Metallurgical Industry as saying that China cannot be
called as a steel power because quality and varieties don not
match the title.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's largest steel maker, with production
topping 100 million tons in 1996. As part of new quality-control
plan, 90 percent of China's rolled steel will meet international
standards by the year 2000, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
China will meet 95 percent of its domestic rolled steel demand
and 70-80 percent of the demand for technology-intensive and high
value-added steel products by 2000.
</P>
<P>
In the coming years, the metallurgical industry will focus on
technical renovation of old enterprises and improvement of a
number of projects that produce steel products which are in short
supply.
</P>
<P>
China imported 16 million tons and exported 5-6 million tons of
steel last year. Enterprises have been asked to establish rules
for the implementation of a new quality control plan, the paper
said.

the works of famous calligraphers and prominent people like Mi Fu,
Wang Ding, Lin Zexu, and Yang Hucheng.
</P>
<P>
Some of the steles are useful for research. One stele, carved
in the year 565, has supplied research materials on Buddhism,
national minority, folk arts, and the dress of that period.

<P>
BELGRADE, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Yugoslav Chamber
of Republics (parliament) Srdja Bozevic today underscored the
importance of unity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
At celebrations in Podogricca, capital of Republic of
Montenegro (Crna Gora), on the 56th anniversary of military
uprising against the German Fascist aggression, Bozevic said, the
hope of people in both the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of
Montenegro to live in the same country serves as the basic policy
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and these two republics.
</P>
<P>
The principles of coordination of common functions,
distribution of power and division of authorities specified in the
federal constitution guarantee equality of the two republics, said
Bozevic who is acting president of the nation.
</P>
<P>
In a federal state, broad prospects for Montenegro's
development and prosperity is created, not only in the interest of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and its two republics, but also
in the interest of all citizens in the federal republic, he said.
</P>
<P>
Montenegro's position is not allowed to become an issue due to
the exclusiveness of any organization or individual, added the
chairman.

<HEADLINE> Students Seek Ways of Rural Poverty-Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen college students left
Beijing yesterday for 15 days of research in countryside on
China's rural political and economic development, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The students, mostly doctoral candidates from China's
prestigious Qinghua University with seven others from Hong Kong
Polytechnic University, will work together in Baise Prefecture in
the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
They were the first group of about 200 students who are
scheduled to spend their summer vacations in Baise and other poor
villages, offering poverty alleviation and technical help.
</P>
<P>
Last summer, more than 200 students from Beijing University did
similar research, which was appreciated highly by Vice-Premier
Jiang Chunyun. He met with some of the students and encouraged
them to contribute more to the government's anti-poverty efforts
by putting their academic skills into practice.
</P>
<P>
This year students will visit poverty-stricken areas and try
to find ways to lift the villagers out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
They will lecture on the rural economic development for village
leaders and ordinary farmers, said Mi Youlu, edictor-in-chief of
Villages and Towns Tribune, one of China's leading magazines run
by the Ministry of Civil Affairs for rural officials, which
sponsors the activity.
</P>
<P>
In the next two weeks, they are expected to hold symposia on
the improvement of township governments, helping them find the
best ways to develop rural enterprises and improve management
under China's growing market economy today.
</P>
<P>
the students also planned to issue questionnaires concerning
some of the most urgent issues farmers face, such as their heavy
financial burdens, and provide research papers or reports on those
issues as references for decision making by local and central
government officials.

<HEADLINE> China Likely to Lower Tariffs on Imported Auto Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China is considering slashing
import tariffs on key parts of light-duty passenger vehicles, the
"People's Daily" overseas edition reported today.
</P>
<P>
Tariffs on major parts of 10 to 19-seat mini-buses are expected
to be set at 17.5 percent and 25 percent, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The move follows a rising demand for 10 to 19-seater passenger
carriers that has come about as a result of rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
China had already accorded preferential tariffs to the import
of some car parts. The adjustment in tariffs on key components of
light-duty vehicles is aimed at increasing the development of
China's light pick-ups and raising their competitiveness.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Floods caused by torrential
rainstorms with more than 400 millimeters of precipitations have
affected millions of people in east and south China, cutting
off railways and forcing thousands of factories to suspend
production, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The number of casualties from the two flood-stricken areas are
not available yet, the paper quoted officials with Beijing-based
State Flood-Control Headquarters as saying, adding that
fortunately China's other large rivers remain peaceful.
</P>
<P>
Serious flooding are reported on the Qiantangjiang River in the
east China and Xijiang and Beijiang, two main tributaries of the
Pearl River in South China.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to hard work of local authorities, main levels of the
Qiantangjiang and Xijiang rivers remains safe, while the
once-receding water level of the Beijiang River is keeping rising
with downpours there.
</P>
<P>
In east Zhejiang Province, an estimated of six million people
are in the flood-ridden areas, comprising more than 30 small
cities and counties. And production was halted in more than 7,000
local factories.
</P>
<P>
All trains from Shanghai to Xiamen and Fuzhou, two major cities
in Fujian Province, were cancelled over the last weekend. But all
of them are expected to resume operation within the next three to

<HEADLINE> Many People in Shanghai Now Choosing Cremation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China's economic powerhouse has
made some real progress in changing its funeral and interment
practices.
</P>
<P>
All local people in Shanghai, except for members of ethnic
minorities and overseas Chinese, when they die, are having their
bodies cremated, a rate that is much higher than the national
average of 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with this more modern development there are an
increasing number of creative ways to dispose of the ashes, from
the more traditional interment in graves or pagoda-like crypts to
scattering them into the sea, burying them deeply underground, or
putting them at the roots of a sapling, where they don't take up
valuable land. The methods that use up no space and have no grave
marker have been accepted by the majority of the local citizens.
</P>
<P>
The city now has 48 mausoleums for the holding of ashes of the
dead. The number of available grave sites and places for urns in
the city is nearly one million, which is expected to meet the
city's demands for nearly ten years, based on an average of
100,000 deaths in the city annually.

<P>
CANBERRA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian government will consider whether to recognize
the Hun Sen regime and maintain aid payments today as Ambassador
to Cambodia Tony Kevin seeks assurances from Phnom Penh on human
rights and free elections.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- Official inquiries have been launched into why the
demolition of an old Canberra hospital went terribly wrong
yesterday, leaving a 12-year-old girl dead and nine other
onlookers injured by flying debris.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- The Commonwealth Bank of Australia is planning to offer
non-union individual employment contracts to its workers, one of
the most significant moves yet by an employer to take advantage of
the federal government's new industrial relations laws.
</P>
<P>
The bank's action, coupled with mining giant Rio Tinto's
attempts to break the power of the coal mining union, suggest a
new resolve among Australia's big employers as they begin using
the government's non-union contracts legislation to gain leverage
over unions.

<HEADLINE> 3,000-year-old Ancestral Temple Found in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 14 (Xinhua) -- An ancestral temple of a clan
that dates back at least 3,000 years has been found on the site of
the capital of late Shang Dynasty (16-11th Century BC) in central
China's Henan province.
</P>
<P>
The temple is located alongside the Heishui (Black Water) River
in Anyang City and is the only one of its kind for that dynasty
ever found, according to Chinese experts.
</P>
<P>
The find suggests that people there had a clan system and that
the clans were concentrated along the Heishui, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
They say that the find will contribute to the study of the
layout of the capital site, known as the Yin Ruins.
</P>
<P>
The 17-m by 11-m temple opened to the east. The foundation of
its front hall contained 18 pottery jars that served as coffins of
children.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 such jars were found in the area, mostly in building
foundations. A total of 35 building foundations have been
excavated.
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, sacrificing children in the
foundations of buildings were common during the Shang Dynasty. That
practice began with the Longshan Culture some 4,000 years ago and
died out after the Shang.
</P>
<P>
Also found in the area were five pits that supplied earth,
77 garbage pits, 10 remains of baked earth, three wells, 466
tombs, and three sacrificial pits.
</P>
<P>
Pottery, bronzeware, and bone and stoneware were unearthed,
including hundreds of pieces of pottery and 20 pieces of
bronzeware that can be restored.
