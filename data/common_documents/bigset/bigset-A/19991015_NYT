<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Q: I have applied for a supervisor's position
four times, and each time I was denied based on a ``predictive
tool.'' This tool gave a report that stated I was unmotivated, have
no competitive drive or initiative, and need close supervision at
all times. These findings are in direct contrast to my performance
reviews during the one-and-one half years I have worked here. I
asked the H.R. manager for more information on the ``tool,'' but he
never came through. What is my next step? T.F. &QL; 
A: After a year-and-a-half of demonstrating your solid motivation,
drive, initiative and independence, it's always nice to take a test
that concludes that you are a complete failure in each of these
areas. The fact is that many of these ``predictive tools'' are
failures.
</P>
<P>
   Many such instruments are fakeable, overly simplistic, have
little to do with the position in question, adversely affect
minorities and lack validity. In a word, they can easily be a way
for a company to spend money, aggravate the employees, eliminate
promotable employees, advance unpromotable employees and even
expose the company to legal claims. It is simply unacceptable to be
given a test, a barrage of questionable conclusions, a denied
promotion and no meaningful follow-up discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that one of the most effective ways to predict a
person's performance in the future is to look at his or her
performance in the past. With this in mind, your next step is to
meet with management to discuss your test. During such a session,
be prepared to match your performance on the test with your
performance on the job, and then push for the promotion.
</P>
<P>
   You have already been hit four times by this tool. If the
company insists that the tool rules, then you need to decide how
long you want it to rule you. &QL; 
Q: I feel foolish writing this to you, but our boss has bad breath,
to the point that it is very hard to even have a short conversation
with him. We want to say something, but we are reluctant because he
may react all wrong. Is there a way to tell him without causing a
problem? A.T. &QL; 
A: It can be difficult to air your complaints to your boss when
your complaint is the air from your boss. If he is a friendly, open
and responsive leader who truly listens to the staff, you should
not have much of a problem. However, if he is a boss who not only
has questionable breath but also questionable managerial and
interpersonal skills, it is difficult to give him any kind of
feedback.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, if anything is going to change, one approach is for
someone to talk to him. With this option, it should only be one
person, as this is a matter that calls for real privacy.
</P>
<P>
   In such a meeting, the best approach is to use questions rather
than conclusions, meaning that you do not just say, ``You have
dragon breath.'' Rather, since bad breath can be a sign of any
number of problems, from hygiene to illness, you can ask him if he
is feeling well, as several of you have noticed this specific
problem. If you approach him from the standpoint of care and
concern rather than criticism, you can have breathtaking results.
</P>
<P>
   A second option is an anonymous note. However, if your
relationship with the boss calls for anonymity when giving
feedback, the work atmosphere may have more problems than merely
his breath.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What can be done about a woman supervisor who makes crude
remarks to one employee about another? This supervisor is not
liked, as she is a total control freak. J.R. &QL; 
A: This supervisor may be a control freak, but it sounds like she
has a real problem controlling herself. Her comments generate a
broad range of dissatisfaction, distress and insecurity, and they
expose the company to a number of claims as well.
</P>
<P>
   If you want this type of crass and mean-spirited behavior to
stop, you need to let her know. This does not call for a
confrontation, but rather for a conversation. The next time she
starts making crude remarks, you and your associates should tell
her that such comments are very upsetting, and your entire
department could work more comfortably, effectively and
productively if they were eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   If the crude comments persist, you and your associates should
discuss the situation with her manager or the human resources
representative. Unless this company is operating in the Stone Age,
some action will be taken by these individuals. And, if they opt to
ignore this matter, then there is more to the crudeness of your
company than merely your supervisor's comments.

KOBE KO'D BY UNKIND BREAK
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Lakers' ugly defeat in their exhibition opener
Wednesday night grew exponentially uglier by Thursday morning: Kobe
Bryant will be out at least six weeks after X-rays revealed he
broke a bone in his right hand in the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Or _ to frame it in terms of coach Phil Jackson's triangle
offense _ the Lakers just lost their hypotenuse, probably for a
minimum of 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal and Glen Rice can mitigate the loss in offense,
but the gaping hole at shooting guard won't be easily filled. Some
combination of Ron Harper, Rick Fox and a host of others will try,
but Jackson admitted there isn't a clear substitute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got no idea, to be honest with you,'' he said. ``That's
one of those spaces that we are short at right now. . . .If we had
to have an NBA game tomorrow, we'd have our problems, I'll tell you
that. Speed-wise and defensively, it's really going to hurt us for
a while. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just happy it's this time of year and not the middle or
the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' problems extend to the frontcourt as well. Reserve
power forward Travis Knight severely sprained his right ankle
Wednesday night and is out three to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Just 21 years old, the dynamic Bryant was emerging as the team's
best defender and established himself last season as a
20-points-per-game scorer and the team's best clutch shooter. He
also was making great strides in the triangle offense, and his
absence will surely hurt the Lakers' progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely a possibility,'' said Derek Fisher. ``I think
because the offense is one that requires all five people to be on
the same page, when a guy's not getting a chance to go through it
and get the repetitions in . . . it will make it a little harder
for him to pick up on some different things and kind of fit back
in. But I think Kobe's bright enough, and he'll be here at practice
every day watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant broke the fourth metacarpal in his shooting hand when it
was struck by someone's elbow in the first quarter of Wednesday's
88-84 loss to Washington in Kansas City, Mo. Amazingly, Bryant
played through the end of the third quarter, scoring most of his 18
points after the injury, which he figured was just a bad bruise
though ``it was hurting like crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knew the extent of the injury until the next morning,
when Bryant was examined at the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours later, Bryant was already dribbling and practicing
with his left hand while his right hand rested in its new cast. And
he vowed to keep up with his triangle training.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is just watching and understanding,'' he said.
``It's imperative for me to be here and acquire a lot of knowledge.
But no, I won't fall behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant was able to forge a smile and joke about shooting
left-handed, but admitted hearing the news ``was tough. When the
doctor first put up the X-rays, he said it was broken, I was down.
I was upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I just pulled myself together. Everything happens for a
reason. I'm a firm believer in that. So it was easy for me to suck
it up and say maybe I'm not in the ultimate shape then. Maybe I
need to get in better shape and come back whenever I come back
ready. Maybe I need to work on my left.''
</P>
<P>
   And Jackson will work on finding a replacement _ probably within
the locker room. Executive vice president Jerry West indicated he
would not immediately try to obtain another shooting guard via
trade or free agency. He'd prefer to let the Lakers play a few more
exhibition games and see if someone emerges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it gives someone else a chance to step forward and get
some confidence and some playing time,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   Harper and Fox are the obvious choices, but West hopes
first-round picks Sam Jacobson and Devean George will seize the
opportunity as well. Jacobson, drafted in 1998, barely played last
season; George, drafted in June, has made tremendous progress since
a poor summer-league showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be fine,'' assured O'Neal. ``It's going to be real
tough, but we've got a lot of other players that can fill that
void. Whenever you lose a player of that magnitude, someone else
has to step up. . . . If we can get two or three guys who can get
six to seven points (each), that will fill Kobe's 20 points a
game.''

HARPER RELISHES MOVE BACK TO L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ron Harper's last extended stay in Los Angeles was
memorable, if not enjoyable. Remember the five years with the
Clippers, the ones he said felt like jail?
</P>
<P>
   Harper got a one-game suspension for the remark but earned
probation _ and that summer he departed for Chicago, where he won
three championships with Phil Jackson's Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 13-year veteran laughs about his farewell to L.A. and
relishes his return as a Laker. And he isn't about to revisit
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not using that comment no more,'' he said of the ``jail''
reference. ``I'm going to refrain from any comments about my old
team here. I like Donald Sterling and the guys over there, Elgin
(Baylor), they're all friends of mine. . . . I felt that when I
played here was a learning experience, and I had fun playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to town as a Laker, playing for Jackson, should be
much more fun.
</P>
<P>
   Harper was signed to provide experience in the triangle offense
and backup minutes at both guard positions. Now he's a candidate to
be the opening-night starter at off guard because of an injury to
Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to play a lot, I think, now. I'm going to need to
get in shape fast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harper practiced for the first time Thursday after signing a
two-year, $4.2 million contract the day before. Personal matters
and the rehabilitation of his right knee prevented Harper from
attending training camp.
</P>
<P>
   But his knee, which underwent arthroscopic surgery in June, is
in good shape, he said, and he's not far behind his teammates
because he played the triangle for five years in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still a good two weeks away from basketball shape, I
think,'' he said. The 35-year-old's health is fine, but ``I'm still
old, though. That ain't never going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper considered offers from a half-dozen other teams and
retirement before deciding to join the Lakers. They certainly need
his expertise in Jackson's system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched them on TV,'' Harper said of Wednesday's exhibition
loss to Washington. ``I gave them a C. They looked like they were
playing the triangle some. Now we can improve, and we will improve,
but we've got a ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to the Rock: The Lakers are trying to reschedule Tuesday's
canceled exhibition game in Little Rock, Ark., and are shooting for
Monday. That would make for a bittersweet road trip for Little Rock
native Derek Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher was disappointed when the exhibition game was canceled,
denying him the chance to play in front of hundreds of family and
friends. But playing Monday would make for a tough back-to-back,
with another game slated Tuesday in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what, I want it real bad, but . . . having to be back
in San Diego for a game on Tuesday, that's a lot,'' he said. ``It
definitely would be fun to get a chance to play that game, but
getting into that back-to-back across the country, this soon,
doesn't sound like a lot of fun.''

DOG HAS HER OWN GUIDE PERSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DENNIS McCARTHY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Turnabout's only fair play.
</P>
<P>
   On any given day in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, hundreds
of guide dogs -- most of them golden retrievers -- help blind
people make it through the perils of daily life.
</P>
<P>
   So, how about a guide person helping a blind golden retriever
puppy do the same?
</P>
<P>
   Meet Mindy Levine.
</P>
<P>
   With a husband, two kids, two horses, four dogs and a full-time
job as a schoolteacher, Mindy apparently didn't have enough to keep
her busy, so she adopted a blind pup and named it after one of the
kids in her kindergarten class.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   She's the 14-week-old pup Mindy's been teaching the ropes to
these past three weeks at her Agoura Hills home.
</P>
<P>
   Savannah's as beautiful as her name. With her head held high and
nose in the air, she waddles into the living room and steals your
heart.
</P>
<P>
   She's not stuck up. That nose in the air isn't for show. She may
not be able to see you, but she can smell you.
</P>
<P>
   And, after she does, Savannah's just like any other puppy. She
nestles up real close, and wants to be cuddled and loved.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need eyes for that.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Levine is a warm, gregarious man, but there are limits to
even the warmest, most gregarious husband, and his wife was testing
those limits.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing they needed in their hectic life was another dog
-- especially a blind dog needing a lot of extra attention.
</P>
<P>
   But deep down, Darryl knew a couple of weekends ago they'd be
making that drive to Thousand Oaks to check out this blind puppy
Mindy had heard about.
</P>
<P>
   Both Savannah's parents were show dogs, but something had gone
terribly wrong with their last litter. Three of the four puppies
had died. The one who lived was blind.
</P>
<P>
   The breeder was looking for a good home for the puppy, but blind
dogs -- even beautiful ones -- aren't in big demand. No one was
coming forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just look, honey, I promise,'' Mindy said. ``I just want
to see her.''
</P>
<P>
   Darryl smiled. Sure, he thought.
</P>
<P>
   When you've been married for 23 years to the softest touch in
town -- a woman with a big heart who devoted the first 10 years of
her career to teaching deaf kids -- you don't just look.
</P>
<P>
   You get involved. Big time.
</P>
<P>
   But this time was different. This time, Mindy didn't have to do
or say a thing.
</P>
<P>
   It was her husband who took one look at that blind puppy
waddling into the room with her nose stuck up in the air, and his
heart was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take her,'' Darryl Levine said, as his wife just stood
there and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute we saw her we both knew there was no way we were
walking out of there without her,'' Mindy would say later.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of sons Jared, 18, and Zachary, 14, Mindy's been
giving Savannah verbal cues to get her up and down the stairs, and
around different rooms in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows now where she is in the house and outside by the
feel under her paws -- the cement, rug, grass,'' said Mindy, who
teaches kindergarten at Haynes Street Elementary School in West
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been only three weeks, but already you can see she's so
much more comfortable getting around. She's so smart.''
</P>
<P>
   On the refrigerator door, Mindy has put up a warm letter from
the breeder thanking the Levines for taking the puppy, and giving
them some of Savannah's vital stats _ like the day she was born.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy smiled. ``I guess it was just meant to be,'' she said.
``We were born on the same date.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, if Savannah was hoping to get some help around the house
from the Levines' other dogs _ Murphy, Buster, Dakota or Rosey _
she could forget it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't baby her or help her get around,'' Mindy said.
``But they do play with her and protect her _ make sure she doesn't
wander too close to the pool.''
</P>
<P>
   The Levines are having a collar made for Savannah that has a
sensor in it to alert her when she's nearing the perimeter of the
backyard pool.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, Savannah's on her own _ treated just like any
dog in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Except she's the only one with her own guide person.

 &HT;    Yankees add another verse to The Curse
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seven outs shy of escaping New York with a split, the
Boston Red Sox encountered a familiar personality Thursday night:
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees claimed a 2-0 lead in the ALCS, coming from
behind in the seventh on clutch two-out hitting by Chuck Knoblauch
and Paul O'Neill to win 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox threatened in the ninth but were turned away,
Mariano Rivera striking out Damon Buford to end it and strand
runners on the corners.
</P>
<P>
   This was hardly news. The Yankees brought an 11-game postseason
win streak to Yankee Stadium while Boston brought a nine-game
postseason losing streak that dates back to 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees starter David Cone left the game after seven innings as
the pitcher of record, allowing two runs on seven hits while
striking out nine, which tied his career-best in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   New York, needing just one more win to the the major league
record for consecutive postseason wins, entered the seventh
trailing 2-1. But the night changed quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, staggering through a 1-for-6 series, tied the game
2-2 with a two-out double in the seventh, scoring Ricky Ledee, who
had opened the inning with a walk. That chased Boston starter Ramon
Martinez, who gave up six hits while striking out five.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Tom Gordon next walked Derek Jeter on a full count,
forcing manager Jimy Williams to bring in left-hander Rheal Cormier
to face O'Neill. Playing with a cracked rib that had limited him to
hitting just one ball out of the infield in eight plate
appearances, O'Neill fell behind 1-2 before fisting a soft single
into shallow left, scoring Knoblauch for a 3-2 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Normar Garciaparra's two-run fifth-inning homer off Cone gave
the Red Sox a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   With Jose Offerman on second and a 1-2 count with two outs,
Garciaparra waited on Cone's side-arm breaking ball, which he
golfed into the left field seats for this third homer of the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez, who had just appeared feeble against Ramon
Martinez's breaking ball in the fourth, put the Yankees up 1-0 with
his first home run of the postseason. After getting ahead in the
count 1-2 with his curve, Martinez attempted to throw an inside
fastball, which drifted back over the plate and Martinez laced it
into the right field seats.
</P>
<P>
   Of New York's first five runs of the ALCS, four of them came off
home runs, a surprisingly high rate for a team than ranked just
eighth in AL home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Cone, who struggled through a 3-5 second half, was coming off an
11-day break, which he tried beforehand to play off as a strategic
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seem to work well on extra rest,'' Cone said. ``The only
other time I can think of that I have had this much rest was during
the All-Star break and then I came out and threw a perfect game.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this night. Cone was not particularly sharp early, walking
two of the first four men he faced, giving up a second-inning
triple to Jason Varitek, yielding two singles in the third and then
a double to Varitek in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sox could not pin him down, due to a clever curve ball
when he needed it. Deep into the fifth, Boston was 0-for-8 with
runners in scoring position with four strikeouts, two of them
called, until Garciaparra's blast.

their mailbox address, instead of the hugely unpopular PMB it tried
to force the industry to change to. Originally, the Postal Service
said the PMB would thwart fraud by helping consumers differentiate

their business would be hurt. By Dave McNary. (Will run on the

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ If Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker listened to a
few reactionary fans, he would be shopping Jeff Bagwell and Craig
Biggio around the major leagues.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Such is the penalty when your bat goes cold in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Hunsicker and New York Mets general manager Steve
Phillips can work a deal. There are a few cold bats in the Mets'
lineup, too. And considering the common denominator, it's really no
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there's nothing wrong with Bagwell and Biggio or Mets
sluggers Mike Piazza, John Olerud and Robin Ventura. The Atlanta
Braves' pitching staff has a way of clamping down on the
opposition's biggest guns during the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the key in every series,'' Braves righthander John
Smoltz said. ``You have to pick out a couple of guys who you're not
going to let beat you.''
</P>
<P>
   That's perhaps the biggest reason the Braves hold a 2-0 lead in
the National League Championship Series as it shifts to New York's
Shea Stadium for Game 3 tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, Olerud and Ventura, who hit a combined .301 with 91
homers and 340 RBIs during the regular season, have one hit in 21
collective at-bats _ with eight men left on base _ in the first two
games of the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   How do you explain the meltdown? Mets pitcher Kenny Rogers says
it's pretty simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is look at the other side,'' Rogers said.
``Good pitching shuts down good hitting. The meat of our order is
great, but sometimes you run into a wall.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are few cracks in the wall that is the Braves'
starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   After facing Greg Maddux and Kevin Millwood in the first two
games of the series, things don't figure to get much easier
tonight, when Tom Glavine takes the mound, or Saturday against
Smoltz, who pitched an inning out of the bullpen to earn the save
in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets might actually have the edge in tonight's matchup.
Based entirely on reputation, Glavine would get the check mark. But
Mets starter Al Leiter is on a roll, holding opponents _ the
Braves, Reds and Diamondbacks _ to a 1.90 ERA over his last three
starts and allowing just 10 hits in 24 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think it's the end of the world, to me, works totally
against you,'' Leiter said. ``You loosen up a bit, have fun with
it, laugh, joke; you could still have an inner aggressive feeling
inside to want to beat the guy you're facing, but it's still fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're still playing a baseball game.''
</P>
<P>
   While all the focus is on the Nos. 3, 4 and 5 hitters in the New
York lineup, the Mets are hitting just .169 and have scored five
runs in the series. Second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo and right
fielder Roger Cedeno have combined for seven of the Mets' 11 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, they need some help from the Big Three.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to stay positive,'' Cedeno said. ``They're good
hitters, and we're 100 percent sure they're going to start hitting
again soon.''
</P>
<P>
   It had better be very soon.
</P>
<P>
   Time is running out for the Mets, who will be two games from
elimination tonight when they take the field before their home
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the shift of venues will change the Mets' luck, but so
far the series has mirrored the regular season when the Braves won
nine of the 12 meetings, including five of six over the season's
final 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we're right there (close),'' said Piazza, who
has watched his team lose the first two games by a total of three
runs. ``They (the Braves) always find a way to beat us, and we
never find a way to beat them. It's frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   And frustration no doubt will turn to desperation if the Mets
lose tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team in the National League knows that to get to the
World Series, you have to go through Atlanta,'' Mets center fielder
Darryl Hamilton said. ``Win a game, and you build confidence; but
you have to win a game first.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, is hard to do when your primary run producers
don't produce runs.

SPARKS HIRE COOPER AS COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Sparks have hired a new head
coach. Again.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the Sparks on Thursday named former Lakers guard
Michael Cooper as the team's fourth head coach in as many WNBA
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper signed a guaranteed multi-year contract. Terms were not
released.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper replaces Orlando Woolridge, his former Lakers teammate,
whose one-year contract was not renewed because of philosophical
differences with Sparks president Johnny Buss. Cooper was an
assistant coach on last season's team when the Sparks recorded
their first winning season (20-12) and made their first playoff
appearance, advancing to the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Sharp was the team's first coach but after a a 4-7 start
was replaced by assistant Julie Rousseau. Rousseau was replaced by
Woolridge, one of her assistants, after a 7-13 start in 1998. The
Sparks were 25-17 in regular season games under Woolridge.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his defensive prowess, Cooper was a third-round draft
pick for the Lakers in 1978. He won five World Championships with
the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited about this opportunity,'' Cooper said.
``After playing 12 years with the Lakers, knowing that I had some
kind of inkling that I would get into coaching. Little did I know
it would be professional women's basketball, but still it's
coaching and I'm excited and I'm ready to roll with the WNBA and
this franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was first on a short list of candidates. His name was
mentioned when the franchise was searching for its first coach
three years ago, but the timing wasn't right. He was an assistant
for Lakers vice president Jerry West at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael was the very first person I talked to about coaching
this team,'' Buss said. ``It was just a matter of time before
Michael was going to take the helm. He's someone I always wanted.
The timing was right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper inherits a talented and experienced team that includes
center Lisa Leslie, forwards DeLisha Milton and LaKeisha Frett, and
guards Gordana Grubin and Mabika Mwadi.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks most likely will protect all of the above when next
year's expansion draft takes place for the league's four newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper made no promises for a championship next season, but said
he expects a better performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Lakers first got together in '79 we were a good team,
but it took certain pieces and other pieces were unlimited until we
got what we needed to win a championship,'' Cooper said. ``I think
that's the way our president is handling this. I'm going to not
promise you a championship, but I'm going to promise you that these
young ladies will play hard, they will play aggressive every game,
and we will let the chips fall where they may.''

FETERIK'S HEISMAN BID UNDER WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kevin Feterik's Heisman Trophy campaign at least the one off the
football field will make its belated debut next week when the BYU
athletic department releases an interactive compact disc titled
``Quarterback Factory, Version 7.0.''
</P>
<P>
   Feterik's Heisman Trophy campaign the on-the-field variety
kicked off on a September evening in Provo, Utah when he was 39 of
59 for 501 yards with three touchdowns in a 35-28 victory over
Washington. His final touchdown throw a 38-yard strike to Chris
Hale after Feterik bought time by scrambling came with 1:16 left in
the contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of like a coming-out party for me,'' said Feterik,
a 1996 Los Alamitos High graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Then why did it take four additional games to launch a Heisman
campaign?
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into the season, Kevin had a couple of years where he
hadn't thrown ball that well or that much,'' BYU coach LaVell
Edwards said. ``Maybe that much wasn't expected of him.''
</P>
<P>
   But here he is, about to be thrown into a Heisman Trophy race
that became considerably more interesting when Florida State's
Peter Warrick, the clear front-runner, was charged with grand theft
recently and suspended from the Seminoles' team.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the Heisman, or for that matter, the Davey O'Brien
Trophy, the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award or the Sammy Baugh
Trophy, is not on Feterik's mind right now. He hasn't even
considered the possibility of being the first player from this area
to be invited to New York for the Heisman presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Former Los Angeles Rams, Notre Dame and St. Anthony High
receiver Jack Snow is the only local player to finish in the top
five in the Heisman voting. Snow finished fifth in 1964, the year
Notre Dame quarterback John Huarte won the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awards are something to look back on when the season is
over,'' Feterik said. ``It's something you can relish or enjoy at
that time. Right now, all I'm worried about is getting ready for
the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   As the quarterback at BYU, Feterik knows all about post-season
awards and high expectations.
</P>
<P>
   BYU as if you have to be told is the former home of such
quarterback luminaries Gifford Neilsen, Marc Wilson, Jim McMahon,
Steve Young, Robbie Bosco, Ty Detmer, John Walsh and Steve
Sarkisian. In the past three years, whether he wanted it or not,
Feterik grew accustomed to hearing his name mentioned with those
players.
</P>
<P>
   But his mention usually went something like ``Kevin Feterik is
no Neilsen, Wilson, McMahon, Young, Bosco, Detmer, Walsh or
Sarkisian.''
</P>
<P>
   Feterik heard the criticism. He also heard the boos and taunts
directed at he and his teammates. While he knew it was unfair,
Feterik accepted it as part of the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people just like to criticize,'' Feterik said.
</P>
<P>
   His numbers were indeed pedestrian compared to his predecessors.
Feterik was 125 of 208 for 1,767 yards as a sophomore junior
</P>
<P>
   and 202 of 336 for 2,718 last season. He had 27 touchdowns and
11 interceptions in the two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would see the stats and wonder why I didn't throw for
more yards,'' Feterik said.
</P>
<P>
   It was more of a change in philosophy than Feterik's ability.
His 544 attempts in two seasons were 18 less than Detmer had in his
1990 Heisman Trophy winning season alone.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of slinging spirals downfield Feterik spent much of the
time handing off to Brian McKenzie in 1997 and Ronney Jenkins last
year. It was the first time at BYU that there had been back-to-back
seasons with a 1,000-yard rusher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were more of a running attack,'' Feterik said. ``It was a
matter of having good running backs and good linemen.''
</P>
<P>
   The best linemen tackle John Tait was a first-round draft choice
and the top two running backs Jenkins and Junior Mahe left school.
So, with the team moving almost exclusively to the shotgun
formation, Feterik went to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did was concentrate on putting on weight,'' said
Feterik, who entered the season with 17 more pounds on his 6-foot
frame than last season's 187. ``I think I've worked hard every
summer, but I worked extra hard this year in the weight room. I was
eating and lifting.''
</P>
<P>
   Feterik looked comfortable from the opening snap of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to figure out who was wearing Kevin's uniform
out there,'' BYU linebacker Rob Morris said after the Washington
game. ``We thought we had Jimmy Mac (McMahon) back.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't McMahon, but it was the old get-everybody-involved BYU
offense. Ten different receivers caught at least one pass in a
34-13 win over Colorado State and Feterik found nine separate
teammates in a 34-31 overtime win over Utah State.
</P>
<P>
   He followed the effort against Washington by torching Colorado
State for 310 yards and two touchdowns on 28 of 37 passing. He was
28 of 47 for 303 yards with three touchdowns in a 45-40 loss to
Virginia, 23 of 36 for 289 yards with four touchdowns in a the win
over Utah State and 25 of 41 for 414 yards with four touchdowns in
a 38-28 victory over California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just taken advantage of our experience,'' Feterik said.
``Most definitely, it's more fun because it's my senior year. I
just feel so confident.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has a perpetual soreness. With a young offensive line in
front of him, Feterik has taken a pounding this season. He missed a
few plays after stretching medial collateral ligament against Utah
State and sat in the Cougars locker room after taking 38 hits
against Cal with ice bags on both elbows and his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is taking a beating like Kevin's taking a beating,''
said Los Alamitos assistant coach Barry Sher, who was the team's
offensive coordinator when Feterik threw for 3,205 yards and 29
touchdowns in his senior year. ``I kept watching him getting hit
and dragging himself up off the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars will be in trouble if Feterik doesn't keep getting
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I don't know what's going to happen if he keeps
having to take those hits,'' said wide receiver Ben Horton. ``It's
a real big concern for us. ... It's amazing he can sit back there
and read coverages while he has all those bodies coming at him.''
</P>
<P>
   He also keeps making plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy Stewart, our safeties coach, did a little study,'' Cal
head coach Tom Holmoe said, ``that showed they had 100 yards
passing on broken plays, where we would flush Feterik out of the
pocket and he'd dump the ball to the tight end or a back. That's
not lucky, that's good preparation and execution.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also good reason to insert Feterik's name into a Heisman
race that lost its favorite when Peter Warrick went on his discount
shopping tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin didn't have the advantage of advance publicity,''
Edwards said. ``He jumped onto the scene right now. But if he
continues to do what he's doing, there will be more attention.''

THRASHERS GAIN THEIR FIRST VICTORY WITH WIN OVER ISLANDERS

<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ The New York Islanders will forever be linked
to one of hockey's latest trivia questions: who did the expansion
Atlanta Thrashers defeat for their first victory?
</P>
<P>
   For the Islanders' sake, it is good that only a handful of fans
showed up on Thursday night at Nassau Coliseum because it was the
Islanders who looked more like the expansion team in losing, 2-0,
to the Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the Islanders who gave the Atlanta Flames their
first victory in 1972 when both teams opened their inaugural
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's game was played in front of the Coliseum's
smallest crowd in recent memory. There were entire sections that
were empty, and other sections had only a handful of fans.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a discount _ the Islanders reduced $27 tickets to $20
for anyone wearing a New York Mets cap or jersey _ there were 3,062
fans spread out in a building that seats 16,297.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't schedule many W's,'' Islanders Coach Butch Goring
said. ``But we certainly felt like this was a game that we could
have won. Atlanta came in and outworked us. That's not going to
happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (1-2-1) got a goal from Andrew Brunette midway through
the first period, then got some help from a blown call by the
linesman for their second tally _ scored by Kelly Buchberger _
early in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders (1-3), outshot by 28-20, repeatedly fired the puck
into Atlanta goalie Damian Rhodes's pads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't give them much of a reason to come back,'' said
Islanders goalie Felix Potvin, who made 26 saves.
</P>
<P>
   Among the small turnout were the Atlanta Braves pitchers John
Smoltz and Tom Glavine, who watched from a luxury box. Glavine is a
former Los Angeles Kings draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Smoltz and Glavine came into the home team's
locker room and talked briefly about baseball with the Islanders'
Kenny Jonsson.
</P>
<P>
   With little to look forward to this season, both teams can at
least brag about their future. Thursday night showcased two of the
league's top prospects, centers Patrik Stefan of the Thrashers and
Tim Connolly of the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly, the fifth pick over all in June, made his debut on the
Islanders' top line, playing between Brad Isbister and Mariusz
Czerkawski. Patrik Stefan, the No. 1 overall selection this year,
centered Atlanta's top line, playing between Buchberger and Darryl
Shannon. Stefan set up the Thrashers' second goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders were lethargic and disorganized in the opening
minutes and found themselves trailing, 1-0, after a power play goal
by Brunette at 12 minutes 21 seconds. Buchberger, the Thrashers'
captain, made the score 2-0 at 6:53 of the final period on a play
that was offside. Nelson Emerson attempted to pass the puck across
the blue line, but it slid over the line by nearly a foot before
Stefan picked it up and passed to Buchberger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously he just missed it,'' Goring said of the linesman. &QL;

IN M'S GRAND SCHEME, A-ROD RESOLUTION MUST COME FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Since Alex Rodriguez and his agent indicated this week
virtually no desire to sign a contract extension with any team
until the shortstop becomes a free agent after the 2000 season, the
corner the Mariners find themselves in this off-season just became
excruciatingly tight.
</P>
<P>
   Because of trade-market pressure, the Mariners have to make over
their roster by around Thanksgiving to induce Rodriguez and Ken
Griffey Jr. to sign long-term contract extensions. And that
makeover may have to be accomplished by a general manager new to
the organization's talent.
</P>
<P>
   If the superstars remain unimpressed with the moves toward
fielding a contending team, the Mariners likely will be forced to
unload both players relatively soon in order to get a respectable
return _ agonizing decisions that will nevertheless eliminate a
repeat of the 1998 Randy Johnson debacle.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the club gave Rodriguez a mid-November deadline for a
response to its September contract offer. The first chance to begin
the makeover is baseball's free agency period, which begins 15 days
after the end of the World Series. That could be as soon as Nov.
11, which is also the last day of the annual meetings among
baseball's GMs.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the Mariners need to move swiftly to satisfy
Rodriguez, they need to move even faster if he spurns them, in
order to take maximum advantage of a thin free-agent crop as well
as ownership's forecasted increase in the player payroll to around
$70 million next season.
</P>
<P>
   Those moves also would be part of the strategy to corral
Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason for the deadline,'' said one baseball
executive. ``Not many teams can afford either player, and because
there's no guarantee that either will sign beyond 2000, some of
those teams will fill their roster holes in ways that are cheaper
and less risky.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only are both players great and greatly expensive, they each
hold a kind of leverage that complicates potential transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Any team acquiring Rodriguez for his final contract year of 2000
is faced with the challenge of convincing him to skip his potential
free agency bonanza after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the gamble worked for St. Louis when the
Cardinals were able to sign Mark McGwire to a long-term deal after
his trade from Oakland. Last year for Houston and Randy Johnson,
the gamble didn't work. The Big Unit was rented from Seattle for
two months, then skipped to the Arizona Diamondbacks, while the
Astros lost three top prospects to the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's case is different. As a player with 10 years of major
league experience, including at least five with the same team,
baseball rules allow such a veteran the right to approve the teams
to which he could be traded.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey puts a finer point on it, saying he will demand to
review terms of any trade. If a team he likes guts itself in order
to make the deal with the Mariners, he will refuse the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no rule that says he can do it,'' said a Mariners
official, ``but if we don't tell him the trade terms, he can say no
for whatever reason.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, he can't be limited by any Mariners-imposed deadline,
as with Rodriguez. Griffey can go through the entire offseason and
play into 2000 if he likes, until the Mariners satisfy him.
</P>
<P>
   However, Griffey, 30 next month, also has told Mariners
officials that, unlike Rodriguez, he prefers to do a long-term
extension this winter, be it with the Mariners or another team.
</P>
<P>
   Because Griffey holds such a powerful hammer, and because his
contract length and size will dictate how much money the Mariners
can commit now to many future payrolls, a Rodriguez resolution must
come first.
</P>
<P>
   Since Rodriguez seems to have closed the door on an early
signing, the possibility remains that he could start the season
with the Mariners. If Griffey has re-upped, other improvements are
made and the team is winning big, Rodriguez might be persuaded to
enter into a long-term deal. If not, the club could still get value
for him at the July 31 trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   That scenario brings up the specter of the Johnson debacle, in
which the uncertainty of his contract future made the Unit an
emotional wreck and compromised his Seattle season.
</P>
<P>
   Though almost no one who knows Rodriguez thinks he will be as
unprofessional as Johnson, the distraction for Rodriguez and the
team will be unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   Another scenario, this one favored by Rodriguez and his agent,
Scott Boras, is that the Mariners let Rodriguez play with the
improved club that includes Griffey for 2000, then pursue him in
the free-agent market with the big dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Boras says if the Mariners truly mean what they say about
building a champion, they shouldn't be afraid. A-Rod has said he's
willing to consider taking less to stay if the Mariners really do
walk the walk. Even if he's traded in July, Boras contends, it
would be with assurances the club will be back after him in the
free agent market.
</P>
<P>
   But a delayed trade is a high-risk maneuver for any club,
particularly one with no history of big-name free-agent success, or
even boldness.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that be might working against the Mariners is one
the club believed would work only for them _ the new ballpark.
Players were asked this season by management to avoid critical
comments, but it was plain in private conversations that neither
Griffey nor Rodriguez took to the place.
</P>
<P>
   Though the much-discussed fence distances can always be
shortened, there's nothing to be done about two environmental
factors _ cold and glare.
</P>
<P>
   At times, April and May will be almost Candlestick-like. Even in
this season's good weather, the brightness of the
moisture-refracted sunlight caused day-game problems for numerous
players at bat and in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Though such stadium issues may sound petty, remember that these
are pampered ballplayers used to getting everything their way. And
with anyone else, if you don't want to be somewhere, any excuse
will work as a reason not to go.
</P>
<P>
   Bleak as things sound for the Mariners, the situation isn't
without hope, at least as far as trades. The same economic madness
that has helped put the Mariners in this bind can also work a
little for them.
</P>
<P>
   If more than one of the deep-pocket clubs focuses on either
player as a new franchise cornerstone, a testosterone-fueled
bidding war could happen that will outstrip the cautions.
</P>
<P>
   When George Steinbrenner, Rupert Murdoch, Ted Turner and any of
their macho brethren get a chance to not only make a big splash,
but embarrass a rival, they can be goaded into foolishness. The
players who are likeliest to induce that foolishness are Griffey
and Rodriguez, highly talented and attractive athletes who are
almost unbelievably young to be this good and this available.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the possibility of above-market rewards, trades mean
Griffey and Rodriguez would be out from Seattle. No deal will bring
back their dynamism, a void that probably will scream for years.

PENGUINS TOP RANGERS, 5-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Rangers followed their most emotional
performance of the young season with their most lethargic one on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the announced sellout crowd at Madison Square Garden had
filed out before the third period had begun. No one could pinpoint
the exact reason the Rangers were so bad in a 5-2 loss to the
Pittsburgh Penguins, just three days after a 4-2 victory over the
Islanders on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone agreed on one thing: it was easily the Rangers'
worst outing of the season. As Coach John Muckler put it: ``We
played very poorly right from the first period. We had nothing
going all night long.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers trailed by three goals just 12 minutes 24 seconds
into the game. And they dropped to a record of 3-3-1, after a
three-game winning streak had put them within reach of two games
over .500 for the first time since Mark Messier left for Vancouver
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the team captain, Brian Leetch _ borrowing a page
from what Messier might have said _ asserted that the Rangers could
learn from Thursday night's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Leetch cautioned, ``we can't look like that out there.
We can't look like we haven't played hockey. We did everything
wrong out there that we possibly could for over a period.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers came out on their heels and pretty much stayed that
way. They played shoddy defense throughout in allowing more than
two goals for the first time this season. The backup goaltender
Kirk McLean, who had had four straight strong outings in relief of
the injured Mike Richter, was yanked midway through the first
period. Richter is due back Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And again, the Rangers received no help from their power play,
which went 0 for 3 and is now 3 for 36 on the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the goalkeeper's fault,'' Muckler said in defense of
McLean, who came back for the third period and did not allow
another goal. ``It was everybody's fault.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the evening was pretty much set 2:08 into the game,
when the former Rangers wing Aleksei Kovalev caught Theo Fleury
flush in the face with a vicious elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury sat out the rest of the period with a sore neck. And as
Muckler scrambled to find the right line combinations, the Penguins
riddled McLean with three goals on nine shots before Muckler
replaced McLean with Milan Hnlicka 12:24 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalev scored the first goal at 6:25. He made a pretty move
around Mathieu Schneider through the right wing circle, passed the
puck to himself before slapping a shot past McLean for a 1-0
Penguins lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was Jaromir Jagr's turn to set up Pittsburgh's second
goal. The last time Jagr played on the Garden ice, he scored the
game-winner to send Wayne Gretzky into retirement, in what many
felt was a passing of the torch. And on Thursday night, Jagr, who
has always given the Rangers fits, again demonstrated why many feel
he is the premier player in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the first period, Jagr carried the puck through
the right wing circle in the Rangers' zone, stopped on a dime,
changed direction, skated back up through the circle to its top and
then passed to Ian Moran at the top of the slot. Moran blasted a
one-timer past McLean.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, Robert Lang pushed a soft goal past McLean at
12:24 to make the score 3-0. That was it for McLean for a period
and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Petr Nedved scored his first goal of the season at 18:57 of the
first period to cut the deficit to 3-1. But on consecutive
second-period shots, Jagr and Rob Brown each blasted one-timers
past Hnlicka, who was making his first National Hockey League
appearance; Jagr's came at 17:10 of the second, Brown's at 18:57.
And the Rangers _ who received a rare goal from defenseman Sylvain
Lefebrve in the final period _ trailed by 5-1 heading into the
third period.
</P>
<P>
   With a minute left in the game, Pittsburgh's 20-year-old rookie
defenseman, Andrew Ference, rattled Nedved with what the Rangers
thought was a cheap hit. John MacLean and Kevin Stevens went after
Ference with a vengeance. It was one of the few signs of life from
the Rangers all night. &QL;

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Black leaders in Kansas City vowed Thursday to mobilize
African-American voters next year to defeat Sen. John Ashcroft, the
Missouri Republican who led the fight to reject Judge Ronnie White
for a seat on the federal bench. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not get angry. Do not get even,'' intoned former Kansas
City Mayor Emanuel Cleaver. ``Get active.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   White, the first African-American to serve on the Missouri
Supreme Court, was rejected for the federal judgeship last week on
a party-line vote. Ashcroft said White had a weak record on the
death penalty, a charge that Democrats disputed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meeting at Mount Pleasant Baptist Church, about 30 black
officials pledged to mount a vigorous election challenge to
Ashcroft next year. The senator is seeking his second six-year term
in November 2000 against Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The officials plan to fax protest letters to the four Republican
senators from Missouri and Kansas who opposed White. They also plan
to mount voter-registration and get-out-the-vote drives against
Ashcroft, the only one of the four senators up for election next
year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, meantime, responded that he had an excellent record
when it came to approving women and minorities for federal
judgeships. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the size of Thursday's crowd wasn't especially significant,
the makeup of the group was. For the first time in years, a
coalition that included members of Freedom Inc., the city's premier
black political group; Concerned Clergy, a group of 65 black
ministers; and elected city and county officials were united for a
common purpose. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last year, African-Americans in Kansas City and
St. Louis were divided over whom to back in the Senate race between
Republican Kit Bond and Democrat Jay Nixon. Bond wound up capturing
33 percent of the state's black vote, a significant accomplishment
for a Republican. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But that will not happen next year in the Carnahan-Ashcroft
race, the black leaders vowed. They said even rank-and-file voters
who don't follow politics closely are angry about the White
rejection. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you Mr. Ashcroft because you just energized a sleeping
giant,'' Kansas City Councilman Kelvin Simmons said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting Thursday, leaders took turns bashing Ashcroft and
Bond for their roles in White's defeat. While Ashcroft spearheaded
the anti-White campaign, Bond announced his opposition the day
before the vote. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Without the support of either home-state senator, White's fate
was sealed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I see little difference between a physical lynching and
political castration,'' said the Rev. L. Henderson Bell, Mount
Pleasant's pastor who led the meeting. ``I see little difference
between a man being drug to death in Texas and a man of Ronnie
White's character being assassinated at this point in his
career.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Mary Groves Bland, president of Freedom, contended
that White's rejection was racially motivated. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows he has the qualifications,'' Bland said. ``He
should not have been denied.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft spokesman Steve Hilton defended the senator. Hilton
contended that Ashcroft's record on appointing women and minorities
to important judicial slots was superb. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That record includes the appointment of the first woman to the
Missouri Supreme Court and the first black to the Missouri Court of
Appeals in Kansas City. The black bar association serving St. Louis
commended Ashcroft in 1991 for his appointments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Senate, he has voted for literally scores of qualified
women and minorities for federal judgeships all over the country,''
Hilton said. ``He cherishes diversity.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hilton repeated Ashcroft's concern that law-enforcement groups
opposed White. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats have countered that Ashcroft orchestrated the
opposition by notifying the groups of potential issues concerning
White's record. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also speaking Thursday was the Rev. Charles Brown of St. Louis,
who contended that Bond lied to clergy members last year because
the senator told them he would back White. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bond, though, has said that he promised to back White only
through the nomination process, not necessarily when it reached the
Senate floor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hard feelings about how African-Americans voted in the 1998
Senate race continue. After the meeting, Bland approached a
reporter to note that in last year's Senate race, Freedom stuck
with Nixon, the Democrat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We researched his record,'' Bland said of Bond. ``We knew who
he was. Freedom made the right decision.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Concerned Clergy, however, backed Bond. Bell defended that move,
saying that ministers could not back Nixon because of his stand on
the Kansas City school desegregation case. Nixon fought to end
state funding of that plan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bond said he turned against White when the law-enforcement
groups spoke out. &QL;

YEARS OF BAD LEADERSHIP PRODUCED KC SCHOOL CRISIS, STATE OFFICIAL
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Missouri Education Commissioner Robert Bartman admits he's a
little fuzzy on what the future would hold for an unaccredited
Kansas City School District. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Bartman is crystal clear on how the district sank to this
point. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He blamed unstable leadership, a bloated bureaucracy, a school
board more interested in patronage than performance and a federal
court presence that kept the district focused on integration rather
than education. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there is a lot of concern about the impact of having an
unaccredited district,'' Bartman said Thursday in Kansas City.
``But I would have hoped the concern would have been just as
heightened knowing that they had young people that weren't doing
well in school...not just this year or last year, but generations
of kids who have gone through the schools without having the kind
of intense focus on student performance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that the position of the state Board of Education is
that the current levels of performance are unacceptable.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bartman is recommending that the Kansas City and St. Louis
districts be stripped of their accreditation for failing to
adequately educate students. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The state board is to discuss Bartman's recommendation Thursday
in Jefferson City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the board follows his recommendation, about 10 percent of
Missouri's elementary and secondary students would be attending
unaccredited schools. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bartman spent parts of two days this week in Kansas City
explaining to civic and business leaders the rationale behind his
recommendation. He met for about two hours Thursday morning with
the editorial board of The Kansas City Star. He then flew to St.
Louis to meet with officials there in the afternoon and evening. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Kansas City school board met in private for the
second time in two nights to discuss the state's actions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Board President John Rios said that district leaders were
``flabbergasted'' and that administrators were reviewing the
district's options. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope this can be worked out and avoid the loss of
accreditation,'' Rios said. ``That's the board's top priority _ to
see what can be done to avoid it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rios said he was angry that the state might act so soon after
the board hired Benjamin Demps Jr. as superintendent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like everybody is telling us what we need to do, but the
assistance is slow in coming,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rios said that if the district loses its accreditation, he would
consider removing his three children from district schools. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As a parent, I would have to consider moving or fleeing,'' he
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bartman said the possible loss of accreditation should come as
no surprise to the Kansas City district. He said the state had
repeatedly warned the district over the last two years of the need
to raise student performance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bartman said he expected to be lobbied to change his
recommendation. But he said he was confident of the support of the
state Board of Education and Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a discretionary call,'' Bartman said. ``We could say
kids are performing all right and that they're doing the best that
they can. But we don't believe that.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bartman said his high regard for Demps would not sway his
recommendation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been encouraged before, about 18 times over the last 20
years, that this next person is really going to get the job done,''
Bartman said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Bartman said, the parade of superintendents has been a
detriment to the district. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last 20 years, the district has been whipsawed back
and forth by different leadership, different styles of
leadership,'' he said. Those leaders also brought in their own
teams, some of whom remained long after their leaders had
departed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Bartman said, those employees build into layers of
people whose agendas may differ from the current leadership. Too
often, those employees become ``a system of assassins'' who block
progress, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized the Kansas City school board practice of
electing some board members from subdistricts. He said that had
contributed to superintendent turnover, patronage and retention of
unqualified employees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Board members elected by subdistrict feel some obligation to
take care of their district, and that sometimes means finding
employment for people in their subdistrict,'' Bartman said. ``So
the children of the district became not the first priority of the
district.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bartman said he and the state board considered the accreditation
process its first real chance to positively influence the direction
of the state's two largest districts. In the past, the state
complained that its role in St. Louis and Kansas City was
overshadowed by the federal court, which oversaw desegregation
lawsuits in both districts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The shadow of the federal court did some positive things,''
Bartman said. ``But what they took away from the district over a
long period of time is any notion of what accountability was. The
focus was never on performance. It was all about programs, about
integration, about buildings, about money.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bartman said his department was also concerned about whether the
loss of accreditation might hasten the exodus of district students
to charter schools. Charter schools are publicly funded but free
from many state and district regulations. Fifteen of the schools
began operating in the Kansas City district this year, and two more
have approval to open. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no simple answer I can give to that,'' he said.
``There might be some who would say if the Kansas City School
District is not performing...maybe those kids ought to go somewhere
else.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Bartman also said there was no evidence yet that Missouri
charter schools would perform better than the district. He is
especially concerned by what he considers to be a lack of
accountability for charter schools, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that we need to come to some agreement that we will
hold fast on charter school openings right now until we see what
the impact is of the decision to not accredit the district,''
Bartman said. ``Let's wait and see how the 15 or 17 are doing and
then see how responsive the Kansas City district is to responding,
to healing itself, to getting better.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some believe the district is too large to operate effectively,
Bartman said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But he said large districts can function well if employees have
a common mission, are competent and willing to take some risks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He called for a more streamlined central office that would give
principals more direct access to top leadership. He also said the
district needed to recruit or train existing principals to be top
performers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bartman also said the district must change the culture of the
organization, ``because there are some people who have given up and
said these kids can't be taught and think if we can keep them out
of trouble during the day and go home safely then we've done our
job. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What schooling is all about is how kids perform, what they
know and are able to do and whether they will be successful when
they leave school,'' Bartman said. ``We intend to continue to push
the envelope on performance for all kids across the state. It's
doable in Kansas City, but it's going to take the new leadership we
believe they have now and the focus of the district and the
community.'' &QL;

HEALTH-CARE REFORM WON'T HAPPEN UNTIL PUBLIC DEMANDS IT, FORMER
SURGEON GENERAL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED FLETCHER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congress won't pass major health-care reform until the public
demands it, former U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders told a
group of health-care providers Thursday in Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any problem feeling that every criminal has a
constitutional right to lawyers,'' Elders said. ``Why can't we feel
that every sick person in America has a right to health care? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It really makes no sense.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elders spoke to more than 70 area health-care providers during
the opening day of the Black Health Care Coalition's annual
symposium on issues facing urban populations. The symposium at the
Westin Crown Center hotel concludes Saturday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elders also talked about the need for preventive health care
over the current system of ``sick care'' and the need for health
education for people of all ages. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elders served as President Clinton's first surgeon general. She
was confirmed by Congress in September 1993. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She resigned in December 1994 after making a series of
controversial statements. During her time as surgeon general she
suggested studying the effect that legalizing drugs would have on
crime and said masturbation was part of ``human sexuality'' and
should be taught as part of sex education. She teaches medicine at
the University of Arkansas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She has not stopped giving her opinions, however. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Health-care organizations that allow lawyers and accountants to
make medical decisions are damaging to patients, Elders said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I always tell people they better get better in their time
limit. Back in the old days, if someone needed to stay a month we
didn't think about it,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We as doctors allowed lawyers...to take over medicine.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the medical system excels at curing the sick, it is not
doing what is needed to prevent illnesses, Elders said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we have the best sick-care system, the best
doctors, best nurses and best hospitals, we don't have the best
health care,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Simple things such as prenatal care, immunizations and education
would result in huge savings and better lives for Americans, she
said. More education is needed for the elderly and youth alike.
Elders advocates expanding health education in schools. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend $10 million talking about nutrition and Mr. McDonald
spends $40 million on advertising his Big Mac. So it is no wonder
kids want a Big Mac,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patients don't have enough information on caring for themselves,
she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty percent of hospital admissions are there because they
did not take their medicine right. So we know it is very costly. We
as a society have to learn that ignorance is not bliss. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be empowered to take care of your health if you
don't know how.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Education also could end the abortion debate, Elders said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If you prevent unplanned, unwanted pregnancies there would
never be a need for an abortion, because I have never known any
woman who needed an abortion that wasn't already pregnant,'' she
said. &QL;

KIDNAPPING SUSPECT CAPTURED; SEARCH FOR GIRL CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD ESPINOZA, STACY DOWNS and DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two-day hunt for a suspected kidnapper ended Thursday
afternoon when a police employee's hunch helped locate Keith D.
Nelson near the Kansas River. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But after Nelson was handcuffed and flown to a hospital,
investigators said they weren't any closer to reaching their most
important goal: Finding 10-year-old Pamela Butler, the Kansas City,
Kan., girl who was last seen being pulled into Nelson's work truck
Tuesday evening. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police still hoped to return Pamela to her family alive, but
that hope dwindled as hours passed with little sign of the girl. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's realistic to say that hope fades as time goes on, but we
retain a positive disposition,'' FBI spokesman Jeff Lanza said.
``Most cases where there's a long amount of time after the
abduction, it is not good news.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, 24, was arrested near the 18th Street Expressway Bridge
on the south bank of the river about 1:30 p.m. Limping from a leg
injury, he was wet after taking to the water in an attempt to elude
pursuers who were alerted by the civilian police employee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By 3:30 p.m. he had been charged with kidnapping in U.S.
District Court in Kansas City, Mo. An accompanying seven-page
affidavit describes how authorities think Nelson conceived and
carried out the abduction, including a suggestion that he ``cased''
Pamela's neighborhood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit says Nelson told a worker at a job site Sept. 29
that he ``would like to kidnap a girl to rape'' and made salacious
comments about a teen-age girl of whom he had caught a glimpse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit alleges that Nelson was lying in wait in the truck
as Pamela skated unsuspectingly toward it. As she approached the
back of the truck, he jumped out and threw her inside, the
affidavit says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pamela was abducted in front of her home in the 500 block of
South 11th Street. Authorities allege that Nelson, who lived with a
woman in Kansas City, Kan., drove Pamela into Missouri. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Nelson was at the University of Kansas
Medical Center for treatment of the leg injury, which police think
occurred Wednesday while he was on the run. Bond won't be set until
he appears before a magistrate, which won't happen until doctors
operate on the leg. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 investigators were hunting for Nelson, taking
clothes from Pamela's room to help dogs lock onto her scent, diving
into a pond for clues and searching fields. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But there was no sign of Pamela, whom her mother described as a
happy child. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a funny girl and likes to play jokes,'' her mother,
Cherri West, said. ``She is a tomboy, she's outgoing, she likes to
Rollerblade, she plays basketball, she sings, she dances. During
recess, she plays tether ball and kick ball at Fiske Elementary.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A man who works in Pamela's neighborhood told police that he had
seen a man who resembled Nelson cruising the area Monday as if he
were casing the neighborhood. On Thursday morning, the first
concrete sign that police might catch Nelson and possibly find
Pamela came when someone saw a man who looked like Nelson driving a
white van in the Armourdale area of Kansas City, Kan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police chased the van through morning traffic from Kansas City,
Kan., along Mission Road into Johnson County as the driver swerved
into oncoming traffic, clipped the rear of a police car and sped
through red lights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police thought their manhunt was over when a man bailed out of
the moving van onto the Prairie Village Police Department's front
lawn, but he turned out to be someone with no connection to
Pamela's abduction, police said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Officers told the man to take care of three traffic warrants
from Kansas City, Kan., but the violations were so minor that
Kansas City, Kan., police officers didn't stop him from walking out
of the police department. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The van sped on. The driver continued south along Mission, under
the Interstate 435 viaduct and onto Tomahawk Creek Parkway in
Leawood. Just north of 119th Street, police rammed the van from
behind, spinning it. It stopped and officers arrested a woman, but
she was not charged Thursday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   West said the morning chase led to a rocky day. ``I was really
aggravated when it turned out it wasn't him,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And she didn't feel any better after Nelson was taken into
custody. ``It's not a good feeling,'' she said. ``A court might
find it's not him.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After about 40 minutes of excitement with the morning chase, the
search for Nelson settled back into the routine of the previous
day: Talking to people who might know where to find him, examining
clues from the 1997 Ford pickup he was driving and letting police
dogs sniff for a trace of Pamela. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next suspect who was chased down turned out to be the man
police wanted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Near the Kansas River the police employee, Laurie Torrez, was
taking lunch to her husband at his job at the Burlington Northern
Santa Fe Railroad tracks. She decided to take a slow drive along a
dike. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was about 1:30 p.m., and she had a hunch Nelson might be
holed up nearby. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lying near the bridge and realizing he had been discovered,
Nelson hobbled to the river, said Kansas City, Kan., Police Chief
James Swafford. The injury kept him from getting too far into the
current, and he either swam or was pulled back to shore, where
railroad employees held him for police. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doctors think Nelson had hurt his leg in a long fall the day
before and might have been in too much pain to flee from where he
landed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the helicopter flew Nelson to the hospital, a group of
investigators _ including police divers and dog handlers _ searched
the river and its banks. They left at nightfall without finding
Pamela. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other officers returned to sites that had been searched before.
Some poked through a home-building site on Lee's Summit Road in
Kansas City, where Nelson's boss said he dumped construction waste
to fill ponds. Others returned to the area near a church in Grain
Valley where a church maintenance worker and his wife had seen
Nelson's empty pickup about an hour after Pamela was kidnapped. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Relatives said they helped Thursday when they spent almost three
hours scouring a junkyard that authorities told them Nelson's uncle
owns in Kansas City, Kan. The junkyard, at 1144 S. 14th St., is
about three blocks from Pamela's home. They didn't find anything. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bates County Sheriff Duane Diehl said Nelson had spent time in
the Bates County Jail, mostly for burglary and stealing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a thief and cat burglar and he's pretty good at it,''
Diehl said. ``He's a scrapper and a fighter, too. And he's elusive.
Four or five of us chased him around town here before we found him
hiding on top of a house.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An outstanding Bates County warrant charges Nelson with
tampering with a judicial officer. Diehl said the charge stems from
an incident in which Nelson allegedly threatened his probation
officer with a can of Mace. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's grandmother said Thursday that she was surprised at the
latest allegation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to believe he did it, but if he did, I think
someone put him up to it,'' Wilma Nelson said from her home in
Amsterdam, Mo., in Bates County, about an hour's drive south of
Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always a follower. He did a lot of break-ins and stuff
like that, but he's never hurt a kid. He was always a good person
around me.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She said Nelson was originally from Kansas City, Kan., where he
lived with his mother and four siblings. According to Wilma Nelson,
the mother moved with the children to California. They later moved
to Texas before settling in Amsterdam. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bates County Circuit Clerk Diana Rich said Keith Nelson was
convicted on four counts of burglary and stealing in February 1993
and sentenced to three years on each count, with the terms to run
concurrently. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The judge suspended the sentence and placed Nelson on
probation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, on April 24, 1993, Nelson helped a man
escape from the Bates County Jail. He was charged with aiding and
abetting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His probation was revoked, and Nelson was sent to prison on May
26, 1993. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was released on Jan. 31, 1996. But he didn't stay free long. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the Missouri Department of Corrections, Nelson was
returned to prison on April 23, 1996, for second-degree burglary
and served until Feb. 18, 1998. &QL;

</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The glare was direct and distinct, Clint Eastwood in
a pinstriped baseball suit, though it was obviously unrehearsed.
After one question, Paul O'Neill had heard enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to feel it once in a while,'' he said of his
fractured rib. ``But I'm tired of talking about it. The story is
Boston and New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The story, again, on Thursday night at Yankee Stadium was a
nervous home team victory, 3-2, for a 2-0 lead in the American
League Championship Series. The seventh-inning sub-plot starred
O'Neill, wounded warrior with a tender swing, against a left-handed
Boston reliever named Rheal Cormier. The Yankees, having just
pushed across the tying run, had Chuck Knoblauch on third, two men
out.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, without a hard hit ball in eight series at-bats,
promptly fell into a 1-2 hole. Cormier tried a fastball, running
inside. O'Neill fought it off, breaking his bat. He blooped the
ball, just beyond the sure hands of the shortstop, Nomar
Garciaparra, into left field, for a run-scoring single. The Yankee
bullpen held on, barely. O'Neill had a game-winning hit to talk
about instead of his pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing,'' he insisted, ``has been blown out of
proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   The tentative swings, the foul ball away, say something else, as
did the Game 1 grimace O'Neill wore after making a sliding catch.
When we have seen that look on other faces, we have remembered it
fondly. A wincing Kirk Gibson struck the supreme World Series pose
hitting his mind-bending home run in 1988. Michael Jordan a couple
of years ago, sick to his stomach during the finals in Salt Lake
City, was never more unearthly and human at the same time. Pete
Sampras serving an ace in a U.S. Open match when he appeared more
likely to faint was never more appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Along those lines, O'Neill hurled himself against the
right-field wall in the second inning on Thursday night for a Jason
Varitek drive he mis-timed and did not catch. The run never scored.
The effort did count.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Paul's going to play,'' Derek Jeter said, ``then he's going
to play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a rare subject in sports that doesn't require much talk.
We can see for ourselves that some athletes play when their bodies
tell them not to, and some athletes don't. Some make an attempt
when they're not feeling well and proceed to not run fast enough to
suit the critics. But those who make millions of dollars are never
more publicly hailed than when they drag their aching bodies across
the big game landscape, and when they win.
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, I remember reading in the newspaper that Mickey Mantle
had bled right through his uniform during the 1961 World Series. It
is an image, a young boy's sense of true heroism, that has endured
for 38 years and more than a few less flattering Mantle tales.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill didn't bleed, didn't hit a home run. As he said, ``Two
strikes, a pitcher making good pitches, I'm just trying to put the
ball in play.'' He had already left two runners on in the third.
Had he failed again, had the Yankees lost with the more menacing
Martinez _ Pedro, not Ramon _ looming Saturday in Boston, Joe Torre
would surely have been asked why he let O'Neill convince him he
could play at all.
</P>
<P>
   Torre could have talked himself into a healthier outfield
situation, but he is loyal to the veterans who have helped him win
here and he also seems to sense that vulnerability has been and
remains a most appealing and effective staple of his Yankee teams.
They have a payroll soaring toward $100 million. They won more
overall games than any team in history last year. They are owned by
a man who considers failure to be everything but the ultimate goal.
And yet, the impression is that rooting for these Yankees is not
like rooting for U.S. Steel.
</P>
<P>
   You start with the manager, a cancer patient last spring, and
his 68-year-old bench coach, Don Zimmer, limping through the season
and bouncing up from the recent dugout shot he took to the ear. Go
through the lineup, and there is Scott Brosius dealing with the
trauma of burying his father, while Knoblauch's father battles
Alzheimer's and the second baseman struggles with his own throwing
dysfunction. Yet it was Knoblach who drove in the tying run, then
scored on the aching O'Neill's hit, making a winner of David Cone,
whose future as a Yankee is a survival story in itself.
</P>
<P>
   Chili Davis at the end of a 19-year run. Darryl Strawberry
living day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   This franchise has had a long winning tradition mixed with
turmoil but this Yankee team has carved its own special niche for
professionalism amidst personal pain.
</P>
<P>
   So O'Neill, without another word about his rib, picked up his
glove again on Thursday night and trotted out to right field. He
hung in against Cormier in the seventh. His bloop today looks like
a blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two one-run games,'' he said of the ALCS thus far. ``Pretty
gut-wrenching.'' &QL;

`GRANNY D.' ON HAND AS SENATE BEGINS DEBATE ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE
BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Doris ``Granny D'' Haddock guessed what was inside
the gift from Sen. John McCain even before getting through the red
wrapping paper: a new pair of sneakers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, good,'' said the 89-year-old woman Thursday. ``I've worn
out three of these, and I'm ready for another pair.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Haddock, who has walked from Los Angeles to Nashville, Tenn., so
far on her trek to Washington, slung the new shoes over her neck.
Then she ascended the Capitol steps, flanked by McCain, an Arizona
Republican, and Sen. Russ Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, as they
made their way inside to the Senate floor for the start of debate
on a bill to reform campaign finance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taking a break from her cross-country journey, she had flown to
Washington to present the senators a gift as well: good publicity
about their uphill effort to ban unlimited soft money donations to
political parties. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Feingold saw Haddock as an irresistible means of
putting a face _ tanned, lined, but beaming _ on a subject that
some lawmakers say draws a blank look from constituents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The media and the Senate have said people don't care, but they
do care,'' Haddock said. ``This bill is what we need in this
country to get back our democracy and our republic.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Haddock began walking Jan. 1 after renting her home for a $1,000
a month to supplement her Social Security, which she said is her
only source of income. She has walked about 10 miles a day, six
days a week, across deserts and over mountains, and expects to
reach Washington by her 90th birthday in January. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Haddock said she became disillusioned with politics after the
1996 election campaign, when the amount of money given to political
parties increased dramatically from four years earlier. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fifty donors, for instance, gave $500,000 or more to the parties
that year, up from nine such donors in 1992, Feingold said. Much of
the money was used to support candidates, who were otherwise
restrained by laws that limit what they can take from individual
donors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most politicians start out with starry eyes and ideas,
and then they find it very hard to suddenly have to give their
souls to the corporations and big-interest money,'' Haddock said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Feingold, who joined Haddock for about two miles of her walk in
Tennessee last week, said the Senate has an easy task compared with
Haddock's walk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``All she is asking members of this body to do is lift their
arms to cast one vote _ a vote to ban soft money,'' Feingold told
the Senate. ``Let's join Granny D. on the road to reform.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Feingold and McCain, the road might end as it
did last year in a Senate filibuster. Although drawn more narrowly,
the bill again appears short of the 60 votes needed to break
another filibuster. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the bill won the support of Sen. Sam Brownback of
Kansas, who joined McCain and six other Republicans backing the
bill in some form. But 15 Republicans will be needed to break the
filibuster even if all 45 Democrats support the bill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brownback objected to last year's bill because it would have
prevented independent groups from running ads on political issues
in a way that indirectly promote certain candidates. Many, such as
Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas, have argued that provision abridges
free speech. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Kit Bond and John Ashcroft of Missouri are still studying
the legislation and had no position Thursday, spokesmen said.
Debate is expected to last several days. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCain insisted in his opening statement to the Senate on
Thursday that banning contributions to political parties does not
inhibit free speech but protects it by giving a more equal voice to
those who give small amounts, such as $100. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What this fight is all about is taking the $100,000 check out
of American politics for good,'' McCain said. ``It's about putting
the little guy back in charge and freeing our system from the
corrupting power of the special interests' bottomless wallet.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCain's assertion drew lengthy rebuke from Sen. Mitch
McConnell, a Kentucky Republican and leading opponent of the
campaign reform movement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say to all my colleagues, do not say `corruption' unless
you have evidence of corruption,'' McConnell said. ``It demeans the
Senate. There is no evidence, none whatsoever, of corruption.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCain said corruption doesn't have to come in the form of a
specific, provable connection between a large donation and the way
a lawmaker votes. The corruption is the special access and perhaps
special consideration given big donors, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe these large amounts have impaired our dignity,''
McCain said. &QL;

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PORTLAND, Ore. _ The conversation finished, he hit the off button
on the cell phone, turned in his chair and smiled up at a familiar
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, well,'' Scottie Pippen said. ``It doesn't look like
things are going too good in Houston. I mean, a team that's all new
and improved gets beat pretty bad. A team that's going to run and
have a wide-open offense can only score 88 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who knows about basketball knows where the Houston
Rockets are now. They are not a championship contender. Not by a
long, long shot, and they won't be with the personnel they have.
I'll tell you, it doesn't look good from my point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is, of course, way up here in the left corner of the U.S.
map, where the gray skies and the constant drizzle will make a good
match for his frequently gloomy moods and there is no shortage of
trees behind which he can hide.
</P>
<P>
   Less than nine months after arriving in Houston with a police
escort, the fanfare of a marching band and a five-year, $67 million
contract, Pippen does not understand why anyone would get the
impression he bailed out on the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't quit,'' he said. ``I just left. I moved on.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Titanic didn't sink. The staterooms simply filled up
with water.
</P>
<P>
   Different city. New uniform. Same old Scottie.
</P>
<P>
   He talks about providing leadership and showing his team the
way, and yet it all sounds like just a well-rehearsed speech.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the way, he learned what a superstar looks and
sounds like, but he evidently never grasped that there is more to
being Michael Jordan than just dressing nicely and doing TV
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   He talks about his former teammates Charles Barkley and Hakeem
Olajuwon lacking the commitment to make the Rockets contenders in
the NBA Western Conference, yet sees nothing wrong with a niggling
little detail like trying to get himself traded to the Los Angeles
Lakers so he could be reunited with his former coach Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked to go to the Lakers,'' he said. ``I don't understand
what all the fuss and the talk about disloyalty was about. I guess
none of them could understand my relationship with Phil and that it
was no reflection on the Rockets.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll look you straight in the eyes and tell you he had no
reason to be remorseful about any of his words or actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel that I owe Charles Barkley an apology,'' Pippen
said. ``Who is he to publicly say I owe anybody an apology?''
</P>
<P>
   One might ask then, Who is Olajuwon to make the same request as
Barkley?
</P>
<P>
   ``Dream said I should apologize?'' Pippen said. ``Where is it in
the law that says I have to apologize to anybody about anything
anyway?
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't know anything about Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. It is easier to start a World Wrestling
Federation-style war of words with one of the NBA's so-called bad
boys than to take on one of its icons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just wasn't going to work out in Houston,'' Pippen said.
``Maybe I wouldn't have gone there if it hadn't been for the
lockout and my having to make a decision in a very short time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, I never paid attention to West Coast basketball
before. The only time I ever saw the Rockets was when we played
them twice a year and they usually kicked our butts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I expected more from Dream, more from Charles. When I
got to Houston, I found that Dream had lost some of his dominance
in the game. Charles makes adjustments, but he's not the player he
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing is I didn't think I could go back there and try
to carry that team again. I'm a veteran, and I can only do so much
at this point in my career, and they had me playing 40 minutes a
night. And I was the only one practicing every day. Not Dream and
Charles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there were veterans on that team who didn't put
forth the effort. I thought they gave up. I mean, you can't beat
the Dallas Mavericks. Are you kidding me?
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what they asked me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Jordan made $30 million a year and scored 30 points a
game. Pippen made $14.5 million with the Rockets and scored 14.5
points a game.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that the superstar yardstick _ a point for every million?
</P>
<P>
   So he pulls on a new jersey and hits the floor running for the
Portland Trail Blazers. In the first quarter alone Thursday night
against Golden State, he scores seven points and dishes five
assists.
</P>
<P>
   He feeds Damon Stoudamire for a layup on a fast break, then
swipes the inbounds pass, kicks the ball out to Steve Smith and
gets a return feed in the left corner, where he nails a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much athletic ability, so much talent in
Scottie,'' said Trail Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy. ``To me, he's
always looked like a guy that could fit in anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Where have we heard that before?
</P>
<P>
   Still, the biggest question is why Pippen chose to blow up
whatever relationship he still had with the Rockets by blasting
away at his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd better ask Charles if we're friends,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weren't you?
</P>
<P>
   ``Were we?''
</P>
<P>
   Didn't he cover your back after bad shooting games?
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he?''
</P>
<P>
   Didn't he defend you after the DWI arrest?
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he?''
</P>
<P>
   What happened, Scottie? What went wrong?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' he said. ``I looked around, checked out my options
and asked to be traded. I'm a professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure. Like a pig has wings.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen doesn't understand why we can't understand.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, he just shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here now, and I'm happy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At least until things get tough.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ He said it 10 times if he said it once. Eddie Perez kept
insisting he's not a good hitter. No way, he protested, can he
possibly be mistaken for a good hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a good hitter,'' Perez said over and over to the swarm
that had descended upon what used to be his rarely noticed locker
in the Atlanta clubhouse. ``You know I'm not. I'm just hot, I
guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez is hot, all right. Habanero pepper hot. He's so hot, he's
Mr. October.
</P>
<P>
   Senor October.
</P>
<P>
   Perez spent a decade in the Braves organization attempting to
win a major-league roster spot. Once there, he spent four more
seasons trying to win a starting job, which finally came in late
July when All-Star catcher Javy Lopez went down with a
season-ending knee injury. Heretofore, Eddie's lone claim to fame
was his being Greg Maddux's personal backstop.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's a hero. Now he's Ed-dee! Ed-dee! Ed-dee!
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, huh?'' he said, smiling at the minicams, enjoying
the media glow.
</P>
<P>
   Not to the Mets, it isn't. They watched Perez smack a solo home
run on Maddux's behalf in Game 1 of the National League
Championship Series. But that dinger merely gave the Braves a
little breathing room. His two-run shot off Kenny Rogers in a
decisive sixth inning of Game 2 broke a tie at 2 and secured
Atlanta's 4-3 winning margin.
</P>
<P>
   Both homers came at Turner Field, where Perez, a .249 hitter in
his first NL season with more than 200 at-bats, hadn't jacked one
all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the funny thing,'' he said. ``I had all my home runs
(seven) on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie, trust me, the Mets are not laughing. Perez's blow over
the left-field fence was the third consecutive hit _ following a
walk _ off the worn-out Rogers and came on the first pitch, a
toothless hanging changeup. Mets manager Bobby Valentine was
covered with bruises afterward from kicking himself for not pulling
Rogers before Eddie took his mighty cut.
</P>
<P>
   Perez says he noticed Mets pitching coach Dave Wallace heading
toward the dugout steps as he approached the batter's box. Then he
saw Valentine call Wallace back _ much to Eddie's relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to face him (Rogers),'' Perez said. ``Not a fresh
arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Would Valentine have been so foolhardy had the hitter been
Reggie Jackson, the original Mr. October?
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the ballgame, not changing pitchers,'' Valentine said
glumly. ``It was the wrong decision, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine's memory must be failing him. Apparently he had
forgotten Atlanta's three-game series against his team in June when
Perez went 6-for-11 with a double, a home run and four RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   As for the postseason, who can explain why Perez consistently
brings his heavy lumber? There's a pattern here, disputing any
notion his recent success is flukish. He was 3-for-4 in limited
duty against the Padres in last fall's NLCS, and his two hits
Wednesday _ he had singled off Rogers in the second _ left him on a
7-for-11 tear in league championship play. This after driving in
three runs with four hits against the Astros in the Division
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, do you remember his grand slam off the Cubs in the Division
Series a year ago? That secured the clinching game and helped
prepare Rod Beck, then Chicago's closer, for what Bernie Williams
did in the ALCS opener Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In 818 career major-league at-bats, Perez has homered only 24
times, a frequency rate of 3 percent. In seven at-bats against the
Mets, he has two, one fewer than the number of outs he has made.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, his infinitely more celebrated Mets counterpart, Mike
Piazza, has yet to manage any manner of hit in his seven trips to
the plate, although he did drive in a run with a groundout in the
first game.
</P>
<P>
   Perez believes pitchers are concentrating so hard on keeping the
Braves' big guns from beating them, they are inclined to take five
against him. He, in turn, is taking them to the cleaners as
Atlanta's adoring fans chant, ``Ed-dee! Ed-dee! Ed-dee!'' The Chop
House crowds have come to love the mustachioed Venezuelan, whose
disarming smile and humility add to his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like hearing them,'' he said. ``Next year they will forget
about me because Javy will play every day. But it feels good to be
able to step up. They don't want to pitch to Chipper (Jones). They
don't want to pitch to Brian (Jordan). They want to pitch to Eddie,
so I have to take advantage and find a good pitch to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   He's finding lots of them. His bat is a magnet for horsehide;
his nerves repel pressure. He's Walter Mitty in a catcher's mask.
Reporters have begun asking Maddux about him, instead of vice
versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a backup,'' Perez argues. ``But I have to be ready because
we don't have Javy. My main thing is catching. I try to take the
at-bats as they come. I know I'm not a good hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough, Eddie. Enough. You are an excellent hitter. You are
Senor October.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
After a week of tinkering in the garage, coach Rudy Tomjanovich was
ready to take his new, souped-up model of the Rockets for a spin.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At some point, everything that can be done under the hood has
been covered. The time had come to hit the track for a test drive.
</P>
<P>
   The horsepower was there. But the first test proved more of a
tease. As fast as the Rockets were ready to go, the handling still
needed some work.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets proved Wednesday their determination to run was
designed for more than merely to irritate Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets insisted they were devoted to learning to play on
the run, literally and figuratively, because the style best fits
the talent on hand, and then went as far as one game could take
them to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Francis was handed the keys to the Rockets' new high-speed
style for the first laps of the massive roster overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   And the Rockets showed their stated intentions to be true,
running from the outset and out in front of the fleet, retooled
SuperSonics.
</P>
<P>
   But in building a 17-point first-half lead and losing it in a
13-point defeat, they also showed how much work remains to be done
heading to tonight's preseason home opener against the Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons the fast break had moved rapidly toward
extinction in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to push close to the edge. Step over that line,
and speed kills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to run,'' Tomjanovich said, ``but we want to be under
control, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very encouraged with how we played at first. The mental
part of the game in the second half was not good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Executing at high speed is something that doesn't happen
overnight. We had too many turnovers. But we had too many turnovers
when we weren't running, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets committed 25 turnovers that the Sonics converted
into 24 points despite a week's worth of missed layups in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   When the Sonics threw half-court traps and presses at the
Rockets, the Rockets rushed through the defense but lost control.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley had said they were
ready to relinquish much of their offensive load, they were
forgotten in the Rockets' rush far more often than designed.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley and Olajuwon combined for just eight points, making four
of 13 shots, two fewer attempts than Francis put up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get the ball inside to our big guys,'' Francis
said. ``They've got to score. The running game will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   But the big guys understood. Francis might have been lured into
a duel with Gary Payton, but he is far from the first and showed an
ability to stand up to such a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   More important, he also seemed to understand he had been duped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got excited tonight,'' Francis said Wednesday. ``I
didn't even sleep today. I was ready for the game last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first three minutes, I relaxed a lot. That's the
stuff you learn when you play the first game. I'm sure Friday will
be much different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot. Hopefully, Friday I'll put two halves
together. I will put two halves together.''
</P>
<P>
   But the process did nothing to discourage his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our team is going to be fine,'' Barkley said. ``It was
a good start. Everybody is excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good mix of old guys and young guys. We've got a
nice combination. We can run the ball. We can set up in the
half-court. We're going to be pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while Wednesday, they were better than pretty good. It
didn't last, but having replaced the old, reliable sedan, it is
worth remembering sports cars can be temperamental until set up
just right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late in the game, we didn't make any plays, offensively or
defensively,'' Tomjanovich said. ``A lot of things happened that
hopefully we'll learn from.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some turnovers and unfortunate situations. We have some
good tape to show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are game-situation things. They're pressing. We have a
definite pattern on how we break (presses and traps).
</P>
<P>
   ``But the whole team played really well in the first half. It
was a good learning experience.''

HOECHST MARION MOVING HEADQUARTERS, 900 JOBS OUT OF KC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that will pull 900 white-collar jobs out of Kansas
City, Hoechst Marion Roussel said Thursday that it is moving its
North American headquarters to New Jersey as part of a global
pharmaceuticals merger. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All affected employees will have the opportunity to move with
the headquarters to Bridgewater, N.J., said Gerald P. Belle,
president of Hoechst Marion Roussel North America. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the headquarters move next year, the company will retain
about 820 manufacturing and related employees in Kansas City, where
it makes the Cardizem heart drug and the Allegra allergy
medication. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always disappointing when something like this occurs,''
said Kansas City Mayor Kay Barnes. ``The good news is that the
manufacturing operation is staying here.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's news ended days of rumors about an impending Hoechst
move and followed the recent announcement that MCI WorldCom plans
to buy Sprint Corp., the area's largest private employer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City headquarters employees work in administration,
finance, marketing, human resources and other support functions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hoechst Marion spokesman Charles Rouse declined to give a
payroll figure for the 900 affected employees. Documents from the
city's Tax Increment Financing Commission put a value on some
Hoechst Marion jobs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In its 1999 annual report, the TIF Commission said jobs at
Hoechst Marion comprised an annual payroll of $73.4 million and an
average annual pay of $48,163. Those figures represent a mix of
headquarters and manufacturing jobs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the economic effect, the headquarters loss will
end part of the legacy of the late Ewing Marion Kauffman, who
established Marion Laboratories Inc. in 1950 and was known for his
philanthropy and for bringing the Royals to Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The corporate reshuffling stems from the planned merger of
Hoechst Marion's German parent, Hoechst AG, with Rhone-Poulenc SA
of France. The combination follows a series of mergers in the
pharmaceutical industry, in which companies are joining to gain
market clout and augment research dollars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new company, to be known as Aventis SA, will focus on
pharmaceuticals, crop protection and animal health. Global
headquarters will be in Strasbourg, France. The pharmaceutical arm,
to be known as Aventis Pharma, will have its global headquarters in
Frankfurt, Germany. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Belle, the head of what will be known as Aventis Pharma North
America, said at a news conference Thursday that he had recommended
keeping the North American headquarters at Hoechst Marion's
well-manicured campus in south Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, he also defended the move to New Jersey, where Hoechst
has significant operations. Belle said a proliferation of
pharmaceutical firms in the state had turned it into the ``seat of
power'' for the industry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an awful lot to be said about being in Kansas City.
But unfortunately, we were in a position of competing with what
some label the mystique of the pharma corridor in New Jersey,''
Belle said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The merger also is hitting Collegeville, Pa., where
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer pharmaceutical unit has had extensive
operations. All 1,650 jobs at the Collegeville site will be moved
to other cities as a result of the merger. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Belle praised the lobbying efforts of Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan
and former Kansas City mayor Emanuel Cleaver to keep the
headquarters in Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the decision did not go the way they or we would
have liked, there was in my mind absolutely nothing else that they
could have done to turn the tide,'' Belle said. ``They did a superb
job of representing Kansas City.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Area officials expressed disappointment at Thursday's news. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing this company is a far more significant blow than Sprint
combining with WorldCom,'' said Jon Baum, chairman and chief
executive of George K. Baum &AMP; Co. and incoming chairman to the
Kansas City Area Development Council. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom and Sprint executives have outlined an aggressive
growth plan that could expand the company's local presence, Baum
said. Thursday's announcement means Hoechst Marion's executive
class will disappear from Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas City has few Fortune 500 companies, so this hurts as
much psychologically as it does economically,'' said Frank Lenk,
chief economist for the Mid-America Regional Council. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You lose the top end of the jobs and that's where the really
highly paid folks work,'' Lenk said. ``You lose the folks who are
able to start new businesses, the entrepreneurial talent. Companies
tend to be oversize charitable givers in the communities where they
are based, so you lose a good corporate citizen.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   State and local leaders tried three times to sweeten the deal
offered to keep Hoechst Marion headquartered in Kansas City. The
final offer included $63 million worth of incentives _ a package
laced with sales tax exemptions, property tax abatements,
forgivable loans and job-training funds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize the state's interest, Carnahan made a
middle-of-the-night phone call to catch Hoechst Marion Chief
Executive Richard Markham 15 minutes before a board meeting in
Europe, said Phil Tate, Missouri's director of business expansion
and attraction. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Kansas City couldn't compete with the evolving
research culture based in central New Jersey. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest competitive factor we faced was the synergy of
the work force,'' Tate said. ``That was probably something that we
could never overcome.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical companies with major operations in the
Bridgewater area include Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Merck &AMP; Co. and
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn. Those companies employ about 24,000 people in
New Jersey. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the company's main North American headquarters is moving
to New Jersey, Kansas City will be the site of a 20-person
industrial operations base that will oversee manufacturing here and
elsewhere in North America. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also, manufacturing in Kansas City, ] Quintiles Transnational
Corp. early this year agreed to purchase Hoechst Marion's research
and development facility, which employs about 500 former Hoechst
Marion workers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rouse said the headquarters move, expected to begin early in
2000 and take most of the year, will free up about 400,000 square
feet of office space owned by the company. The company has not
decided what to do with that space, Rouse said. &QL;

HOW TO PAY TRIBUTE TO PAUL HENSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The late Paul Henson was one of those rare business leaders who
built a corporate empire, but managed to do so in a way that made
him a revered figure among peers, employees and an admiring public
alike. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A strong reminder of the reverence in which Henson is still held
was the reader reaction to a recent column extolling his role in
the ascendancy of the company that became Sprint Corp. After MCI
WorldCom made its record bid for Sprint, my thought was that
Henson's contribution had been overlooked in the excitement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Henson, as head of United Telecommunications before it evolved
into Sprint, made the key strategic decision that vaulted his
company into the telecom industry's forefront. The nationwide
fiberoptic network initiated by Henson resulted from a courageous
vision. Those who will reap the considerable rewards of Sprint's
purchase by MCI WorldCom owe much to Henson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps recognition of his legacy helps explain the heartfelt
responses to the Henson tribute. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked for United Telecommunications during the '80s,''
wrote an erstwhile associate now with IBM, ``and you couldn't work
for a finer man than Paul. He was not only a visionary, but also
cared about his employees. He was the only CEO I have ever
encountered who would bother to talk to his people and actually
care about what we had to say. ... (Your column) brought back great
memories of a fun and frantic time in the telecommunications
industry and a true friend and gentle man who deserves much more
credit than the media is giving him.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A particular concern of some who wrote was that Sprint hadn't
done more to honor the memory of the man who had made so much
possible for the company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his vision that led to today's successful Sprint
Corp.,'' said a longtime employee who now runs a Leawood corporate
communications firm, ``(and) many of us had hoped that the new
Sprint campus (in Overland Park) would have been named in his
honor. It would have been the class thing to do.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it would have been a class thing to do, and it's not too
late to do it. Moreover, since Henson's overall contributions
benefited his community as much as his company, such tributes need
not be limited to whatever Sprint can do. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Naming the new corporate campus in Overland Park after Henson
merely presents the most obvious opportunity to honor the man who
made it happen. It would be just as appropriate for local civic
leaders to consider some way to honor Henson for service and
contributions that transcended his business role. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is Science City, which is due to open next month
as part of Union Station's restoration. While Science City wasn't
even a gleam in anyone's eye while Henson was building the company
that evolved into Sprint, the company has taken a leading role in
bringing the project to fruition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Henson's successor, Bill Esrey, has been a major force in
the project, it still would be a grand gesture to name Science City
for the man who first put Sprint in position to become a major
community benefactor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is just one possibility, though. Civic leaders who treasure
Henson's memory could no doubt come up with many more. &QL;
</P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Don Zimmer was speaking into his right ear, Mel
Stottlemyre into his left ear, and Yankees Manager Joe Torre said
his mind was spinning through the tense eighth and ninth innings,
his team's one-run lead in constant jeopardy, the game hinging on
his every decision.
</P>
<P>
   And Torre and the Yankees maneuvered successfully, edging the
Red Sox, 3-2, on Thursday night in Game 2 of the American League
Championship Series at Yankee Stadium. The Yankees, who tied their
own record from 1927, 1928 and 1932 with their 12th straight
post-season victory, lead the four-of-seven-game series, 2-0. The
series will resume on Saturday in Boston, where Pedro Martinez will
pitch against Roger Clemens in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   Torre hung his head afterward when asked about the eighth
inning, his posture betraying a satisfied weariness. Neither team
had led by more than a run, the outcome always in doubt. David Cone
and Ramon Martinez, the starters, had pitched brilliantly, Martinez
surrendering a home run to Tino Martinez in the bottom of the
fourth before Cone made a mistake, hanging a slider, and Nomar
Garciaparra slugged a two-run home run in the top of the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez, who had not thrown more than 96 pitches in any
game this season, was over 100 as the seventh inning began. He
walked Ricky Ledee leading off, and Ledee moved to second on Scott
Brosius's bunt. Joe Girardi popped out. But Chuck Knoblauch pulled
a double into the left-field corner on Martinez's 120th, and last,
pitch. Ledee ran home, tying the game, and 57,180 fans roared.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gordon relieved Martinez and walked Derek Jeter, with
Knoblauch stealing third, and the Red Sox turned to Rheal Cormier,
their only left-handed reliever, to exploit O'Neill's weakness.
During the regular season, O'Neill's .190 average was the lowest in
the league against left-handers. ``You're just trying to have a
good at-bat in that situation,'' O'Neill said later, ``and put the
bat on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   His side aching from a broken rib, O'Neill had struggled in his
first eight plate appearances in this series, his swing sickly. He
took a strike from Cormier, barely fouled another pitch. The count
was 1-2 and Cormier rammed a fastball inside; O'Neill's bat broke,
but he hit a looper over shortstop, and Knoblauch scored the
go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Sox challenged that lead immediately. The Yankees'
Mike Stanton, who had not pitched in 12 days, entered for the top
of the eighth, and Troy O'Leary smashed a deep drive to
right-center, O'Neill slowing as he ran after the fly; it looked as
if O'Leary had tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the ball bounced off the very top of the wall _ just as
Jason Varitek's long fly ball against Cone in the second had hit
the top of the wall. O'Leary had a double, and Torre went to the
mound for a reliever, calling on Jeff Nelson. So began the moves
and counter-moves; nine different players would be inserted into
the game in the top of the eighth. ``That's the chess game,'' Torre
said later. ``That's the greatest part of managing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nelson hit Mike Stanley with a pitch on the wrist _ Stanley
left the game in agony, for the pinch-runner Damon Buford _ and
then Varitek bunted the runners to second and third. Two relievers
were warming in the Yankees' bullpen. Zimmer was speaking in
Torre's right ear, Stottlemyre in his left.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hatteberg pinch-hit for Darren Lewis. But when Nelson
threw a first-pitch ball, Torre decided to make another change.
``There was nothing clear-cut,'' he said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   He called for the left-hander Allen Watson. Boston Manager Jimy
Williams inserted Lou Merloni to bat for Hatteberg, who had seen
one pitch. ``It was fun to watch,'' Cone said. ``Two great managers
going at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching from the bench, Luis Sojo figured that at some point
Torre would call for the Yankees' closer, Mariano Rivera. But
Rivera had pitched two innings in Game 1, and Torre wanted to get
through this inning with the rest of his relievers.
</P>
<P>
   Merloni batted .184 against left-handers this year, and yet
there was Joe Girardi, the catcher, signaling for an intentional
walk. The crowd reacted anxiously, confused. The bases were loaded.
Butch Huskey, who had been in the on-deck circle, was called on to
pinch-hit for the left-handed hitting Trot Nixon, and suddenly
Torre's strategy was clear: He called on the right-handed Ramiro
Mendoza to pitch to Huskey.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza is a ground-ball pitcher, Huskey is big and slow. Torre
wanted a double play.
</P>
<P>
   But with his changeup, Mendoza fooled Huskey, striking out the
slugger, the crowd responding with cheers. Jose Offerman was next;
the count ran to 2-2, Offerman swung at a fastball and lifted a fly
to center, where Bernie Williams camped under the ball for the
inning-ending out. Mendoza pumped a fist, the Yankees' fans stood.
The crisis had passed.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox would get two hits in the ninth with two outs,
putting runners at first and third, against Rivera. But Rivera blew
a fastball past Buford to end the game.

 Kidnapping suspect captured; search for girl continues  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD ESPINOZA, STACY DOWNS and DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two-day hunt for a suspected kidnapper ended Thursday
afternoon when a police employee's hunch helped locate Keith D.
Nelson near the Kansas River. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But after Nelson was handcuffed and flown to a hospital,
investigators said they weren't any closer to reaching their most
important goal: Finding 10-year-old Pamela Butler, the Kansas City,
Kan., girl who was last seen being pulled into Nelson's work truck
Tuesday evening. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police still hoped to return Pamela to her family alive, but
that hope dwindled as hours passed with little sign of the girl. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's realistic to say that hope fades as time goes on, but we
retain a positive disposition,'' FBI spokesman Jeff Lanza said.
``Most cases where there's a long amount of time after the
abduction, it is not good news.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, 24, was arrested near the 18th Street Expressway Bridge
on the south bank of the river about 1:30 p.m. Limping from a leg
injury, he was wet after taking to the water in an attempt to elude
pursuers who were alerted by the civilian police employee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By 3:30 p.m. he had been charged with kidnapping in U.S.
District Court in Kansas City, Mo. An accompanying seven-page
affidavit describes how authorities think Nelson conceived and
carried out the abduction, including a suggestion that he ``cased''
Pamela's neighborhood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit says Nelson told a worker at a job site Sept. 29
that he ``would like to kidnap a girl to rape'' and made salacious
comments about a teen-age girl of whom he had caught a glimpse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit alleges that Nelson was lying in wait in the truck
as Pamela skated unsuspectingly toward it. As she approached the
back of the truck, he jumped out and threw her inside, the
affidavit says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pamela was abducted in front of her home in the 500 block of
South 11th Street. Authorities allege that Nelson, who lived with a
woman in Kansas City, Kan., drove Pamela into Missouri. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Nelson was at the University of Kansas
Medical Center for treatment of the leg injury, which police think
occurred Wednesday while he was on the run. Bond won't be set until
he appears before a magistrate, which won't happen until doctors
operate on the leg. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 investigators were hunting for Nelson, taking
clothes from Pamela's room to help dogs lock onto her scent, diving
into a pond for clues and searching fields. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But there was no sign of Pamela, whom her mother described as a
happy child. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a funny girl and likes to play jokes,'' her mother,
Cherri West, said. ``She is a tomboy, she's outgoing, she likes to
Rollerblade, she plays basketball, she sings, she dances. During
recess, she plays tether ball and kick ball at Fiske Elementary.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A man who works in Pamela's neighborhood told police that he had
seen a man who resembled Nelson cruising the area Monday as if he
were casing the neighborhood. On Thursday morning, the first
concrete sign that police might catch Nelson and possibly find
Pamela came when someone saw a man who looked like Nelson driving a
white van in the Armourdale area of Kansas City, Kan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police chased the van through morning traffic from Kansas City,
Kan., along Mission Road into Johnson County as the driver swerved
into oncoming traffic, clipped the rear of a police car and sped
through red lights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police thought their manhunt was over when a man bailed out of
the moving van onto the Prairie Village Police Department's front
lawn, but he turned out to be someone with no connection to
Pamela's abduction, police said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Officers told the man to take care of three traffic warrants
from Kansas City, Kan., but the violations were so minor that
Kansas City, Kan., police officers didn't stop him from walking out
of the police department. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The van sped on. The driver continued south along Mission, under
the Interstate 435 viaduct and onto Tomahawk Creek Parkway in
Leawood. Just north of 119th Street, police rammed the van from
behind, spinning it. It stopped and officers arrested a woman, but
she was not charged Thursday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   West said the morning chase led to a rocky day. ``I was really
aggravated when it turned out it wasn't him,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And she didn't feel any better after Nelson was taken into
custody. ``It's not a good feeling,'' she said. ``A court might
find it's not him.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After about 40 minutes of excitement with the morning chase, the
search for Nelson settled back into the routine of the previous
day: Talking to people who might know where to find him, examining
clues from the 1997 Ford pickup he was driving and letting police
dogs sniff for a trace of Pamela. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next suspect who was chased down turned out to be the man
police wanted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Near the Kansas River the police employee, Laurie Torrez, was
taking lunch to her husband at his job at the Burlington Northern
Santa Fe Railroad tracks. She decided to take a slow drive along a
dike. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was about 1:30 p.m., and she had a hunch Nelson might be
holed up nearby. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lying near the bridge and realizing he had been discovered,
Nelson hobbled to the river, said Kansas City, Kan., Police Chief
James Swafford. The injury kept him from getting too far into the
current, and he either swam or was pulled back to shore, where
railroad employees held him for police. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doctors think Nelson had hurt his leg in a long fall the day
before and might have been in too much pain to flee from where he
landed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the helicopter flew Nelson to the hospital, a group of
investigators _ including police divers and dog handlers _ searched
the river and its banks. They left at nightfall without finding
Pamela. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other officers returned to sites that had been searched before.
Some poked through a home-building site on Lee's Summit Road in
Kansas City, where Nelson's boss said he dumped construction waste
to fill ponds. Others returned to the area near a church in Grain
Valley where a church maintenance worker and his wife had seen
Nelson's empty pickup about an hour after Pamela was kidnapped. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Relatives said they helped Thursday when they spent almost three
hours scouring a junkyard that authorities told them Nelson's uncle
owns in Kansas City, Kan. The junkyard, at 1144 S. 14th St., is
about three blocks from Pamela's home. They didn't find anything. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bates County Sheriff Duane Diehl said Nelson had spent time in
the Bates County Jail, mostly for burglary and stealing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a thief and cat burglar and he's pretty good at it,''
Diehl said. ``He's a scrapper and a fighter, too. And he's elusive.
Four or five of us chased him around town here before we found him
hiding on top of a house.'' &QL;

HARD TO FIGURE OUT SOWARD

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Examinations by USC team physicians on R.Jay
Soward's head have revealed nothing abnormal.
</P>
<P>
   But then, not everything inside Soward's head can be
sufficiently seen on a CAT scan.
</P>
<P>
   Soward, who suffered a concussion during last week's loss at
Arizona, is expected to play at full speed Saturday when the
Trojans reprise their celebrated rivalry with Notre Dame at South
Bend, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   It's an opportunity for the Trojans to flog themselves into a
winning mode, and flush out the doldrums of a 3-2 start.
</P>
<P>
   For Soward, the flashy receiver from Fontana, it's one of the
few truly big games left in his college career _ and one of the
precious few chances he has to make something of his senior season,
one that is dangerously close to being labeled a bust.
</P>
<P>
   ``R.Jay is one of the most exciting and emotional players in
college football,'' Trojans coach Paul Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, there has been far more emotion than excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Soward blew off summer conditioning in favor of pickup
basketball games, he challenged Hackett's authority, he has been a
nonfactor in four of the five games he has played and he has
declined virtually all interview requests.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Soward, who appeared on some preseason
All-America and Heisman Trophy lists, has just one receiving
touchdown in five games.
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the question: Was that checkup from the neck up long
overdue?
</P>
<P>
   Just what exactly is going on in that cranium of his?
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't say,'' Soward said, walking briskly off the USC
practice field Thursday. ``I won't tell you anything. I'm not
talking at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, R.Jay's always talking. He's the same motormouth who
starred at Fontana's Steeler Stadium. He talks on the field, the
sideline, the plane, the bus. Just not to anyone with a pen and
notepad.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'll tell you is I'm real excited to play,'' he said. ``I
can't wait to get over there. It's Notre Dame. Doesn't get much
bigger than that.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it doesn't. Both for him and the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   Soward has seven games left in his college career _ eight if USC
makes a bowl game. That's seven or eight chances to make an impact,
seven or eight chances to show NFL scouts he is capable of
dedicating himself to a cause. Seven or eight chances to restore
his reputation as an electrifying, playmaking receiver.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Soward was supposed to be this season. He was
supposed to be the Trojans' top offensive weapon, their big-game
performer.
</P>
<P>
   In the big-game department, the Trojans are guaranteed just two
more this season. This weekend is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   And the Notre Dame game might be the last time Soward has a
national, made-for-TV spotlight in which to shine.
</P>
<P>
   If Soward is stifled on the Notre Dame Stadium turf, if he
throws his helmet in frustration or prances angrily on the
sideline, he will be one game closer to making it official.
</P>
<P>
   Soward's season will be a colossal failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't had that breakout year we expected,'' running back
Chad Morton said. ``A lot of guys like him and myself haven't had
the year we wanted. We haven't had the season we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The low point came last week against Arizona, when Soward was
hit while blocking on a punt return. After a helmet-to-helmet
collision, he was knocked out and lay motionless on the turf for a
few minutes while trainers tended to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like he was crucified to the field,'' USC
quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst said. ``All sprawled out, like he
was making a snow angel.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward was escorted to the locker room, but fought his way free
at the tunnel, ran back onto the field and crashed into the Trojans
huddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he knew what was going on,'' Van Raaphorst
said. ``We had to pull him out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought it was the beginning of the game,'' receiver
Windrell Hayes said. ``He thought he was taking the field for his
first snap.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward had to be talked off the field by trainers. His arms
flailed against them the whole way down the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what USC football is about,'' linebacker Markus
Steele said. ``He overreacted a little bit. You can't go out there
and show off like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I guess with a concussion, you might not act the way you
normally do.''
</P>
<P>
   In this season, Soward might settle for a little normalcy. It
began as a spate of quiet and unproductive games, but after the
last two weeks, it has turned downright strange.
</P>
<P>
   He returned a punt for a touchdown against Oregon State two
weeks ago, but failed to catch a pass, battling an undisclosed
illness that left him nauseated and dehydrated.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the concussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what he wanted to have happen in his senior year,''
said Hackett, who insists Soward has maintained a good work ethic
this season after the two settled their differences in camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has time to change things, both for us and for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward practiced in a yellow jersey this week, signifying his
precautionary status. But he ran his routes well, and his energy
appeared to pick up as the week progressed.
</P>
<P>
   It's taken a few days, but after his bell was rung, Soward
insists he's cleared out the mental cobwebs.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, it will become clear whether he can clear out the
bad karma of a season gone wrong.

SPORTS COLUMN: CONE'S INVISIBLE CLIFF
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When David Cone strode to the mound at Yankee Stadium
for the first inning of Game 2 on Thursday night, he knew there was
an invisible cliff there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I relish this opportunity; I've been in this position a lot,''
he had said, alluding to having a 5-2 record in nine other
post-season starts since he joined the Yankees in 1995. ``But who
knows what's going to happen on down the line?''
</P>
<P>
   On down the line. For David Cone, that's a euphemism for the
invisible cliff. For what's going to happen when it's time for
George Steinbrenner to decide if an aging right-hander who will be
37 years old next season should be pushed over the cliff of the
Yankee payroll. If the principal owner hasn't already decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year,'' Cone said last weekend in Texas, ``I can honestly
say that this may be my last chance to pitch in the playoffs for
the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone didn't mean just his chance to pitch seven sturdy innings
in the Yankees' 3-2 victory on Thursday night in the American
League Championship Series with the Boston Red Sox, he meant
whenever the Yankees need him to pitch if they get to the World
Series for the third time in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Pedro Martinez going for the Red Sox on Saturday,'' Cone
said later, ``we felt we needed this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone needed it, too. After a shaky second half of the season, he
surrendered seven hits, but allowed only two runs on Nomar
Garciaparra's two-run homer in the fifth inning. He struck out
nine, matching the most he has fanned in a post-season game. In
chilly, windy weather too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blew on my hand a lot,'' he said, ``but I didn't have as
many problems as I've had in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone, who was credited with the victory, stranded eight Red Sox
base runners over his seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some tough spots,'' he said. ``I had to make some big
pitches. I felt good being able to keep us in the game, keep us
close. I think the rest really helped me. I felt strong, I felt
sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   But had Cone, making his first start in 11 days, made a
statement that might help to keep him from being pushed over that
invisible cliff?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``I've let that issue bother me more
than I should have. This might go a little way to help me come back
next year, but it's a little unpredictable right now.''
</P>
<P>
   If Cone is elsewhere next season, he would be a victim of what
might be called the Curse of the Perfecto.
</P>
<P>
   David Wells pitched a perfect game against the Minnesota Twins
in 1998, then was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for Roger
Clemens. Cone pitched a perfect game against the Montreal Expos on
July 18 and now he could be in his last days as a Yankee. But he
knows why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let a big year get away from me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Cone's perfect game, his record was a snappy 10-4
with a 2.65 earned run average. After that, he was 2-5 with a 4.28
era; in his last five starts, he was 1-2 with a 6.00 era. Over all,
he was 12-9 with a 3.44 era that was second best in the A.L. behind
Pedro Martinez, the Red Sox ace.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad, but not what it might have been with a stronger finish.
</P>
<P>
   His arm has been under the Yankee microscope ever since aneurysm
surgery in 1996. The next season tendinitis in his right elbow put
him on the disabled list. In 1998, he had a 20-7 record but needed
extensive medical treatments to get through the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The invisible cliff now in Cone's future, of course, is what
baseball free agency is all about.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Cone has earned in excess of $50 million over the last
decade with the Mets, Blue Jays, Royals, Blue Jays again and the
Yankees, suddenly he might no longer be worth the $8 million he
earned this season on his one-year contract with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   At least Cone might no longer be worth $8 million to
Steinbrenner, who next season will need to ante up fresh millions
for Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, Andy Pettitte and Jorge Posada as
the Yankee payroll soars higher than this season's record $85
million.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean Cone won't be worth $8 million, if not
more, to the Mets or the Orioles next season.
</P>
<P>
   For David Cone, the Mets would be ideal: a return to the other
New York franchise for a year-round New Yorker with an Upper East
Side apartment. And it wouldn't take him any longer to get to Shea
Stadium than it has to get to Yankee Stadium for all those
post-season games he has won.  &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ These are the Red Sox and Yankees. New history is
written each day. Controversial calls and lucky bloopers that go
against the Red Sox become instant New England folklore. Expect
nothing less between now and next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 of the Red Sox-Yankees American League Championship
Series provided another painful New York moment for Boston fans.
The Sox stranded 13 runners (an appropriate total), still led, 2-1,
in the seventh, but lost the lead on an RBI double by Chuck
Knoblauch and fell behind when Paul O'Neill scored Knoblauch with a
two-out, bloop single to center off Rheal Cormier. The Yankees won,
3-2, and bring a 2-0 Series lead to Fenway Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   If Wednesday night brought back memories of Ed Armbrister, Larry
Barnett, and the '75 World Series, then Thursday &UR;  &LR; night conjured a
flashback of Joe Morgan's ninth-inning bloop single off Jim Burton
that won the Seventh Game (Morgan and O'Neill both hit 1-and-2
pitches).
</P>
<P>
   Little things went against the Sox in both Yankee Stadium games.
Jason Varitek and Troy O'Leary each hit balls high off the wall in
right field Thursday &UR;  &LR; night. Varitek got a triple, O'Leary a
double. Neither scored. An aggregate of 12 inches on the two hits
would have resulted in a pair of solo homers.
</P>
<P>
   There was excruciating action in the top of the eighth as the
Sox loaded the bases with one out. Jimy Williams and Joe Torre
played chess (three relief pitchers, three pinch hitters and two
pinch runners _ Williams emptied his bench) and wound up with Butch
Huskey hitting against Ramiro Mendoza. Huskey struck out wildly,
then Jose Offerman flied to center.
</P>
<P>
   The ninth was almost as bad. Williams had no bullets left and
had to send overmatched Damon Buford up to face Mariano Rivera, who
hasn't allowed a run since July 21. Looking like Bob ``Beetle''
Bailey, circa '78, Buford went down swinging with two men on to end
the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox stranded eight in scoring position. In Games 1 and 2,
the Sox went 1 for 13 (.077) with runners in scoring position. Both
nights ended with Sinatra's recording of ``New York, New York''
blaring over the loudspeakers as the Sox staggered back to their
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Why do these things happen to the Red Sox? Williams's Warriors
held their ground nicely in New York, led in both games, but
dropped a pair of one-run decisions against the defending world
champs. Now they turn their lonely eyes to Pedro in hopes that he
can keep them from the threshold of a sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Game 2 played out, we could not let go of Game 1, when
umpire Rick Reed blew a call at second base in the 10th inning and
cost the Sox a chance to take the lead. Reed issued a public
apology after the 4-3 Sox loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to make a call that costs a team a ballgame,'' said
the contrite ump. ``It was my job to get it right. I didn't. You
feel bad about it. You feel awful.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the Red Sox got jobbed, just as they did in 1975 when
home plate umpire Barnett failed to call interference on Reds pinch
hitter Armbrister in the third game of the World Series. In that
episode, some of the Sox thought manager Darrell Johnson failed to
argue strongly enough. The inimitable Bill Lee said, ``If it had
been me out there, I'd have bitten Barnett's ear off. I'd have van
Gogh-ed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his home in Vermont Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, Lee had a
similar complaint. ``Why didn't Jimy Williams go out and argue?''
asked the Spaceman. ``All you gotta do is have him ask the other
umpires and have them reverse the decision. It drove me nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimy admitted, ``I guess I just had a brain lapse. Whatever, I
don't know. I just didn't ask.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was worse than Armbrister,'' continued the Spaceman. ``It
was flagrant. Yeah, I had flashbacks. I get 'em every time I have
to see Zimmer's face on TV. This was '75 all over with. But I think
they'll come back. This ballclub has a lot of heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Flashbacks. Good word. With the Red Sox, it's always about
flashbacks. They have now lost 10 consecutive American League
Championship Series games. Roger Clemens (Game 7, 1986 vs.
California) was the winning pitcher when the Sox won their last
ALCS game. The Yankees, meanwhile, have won 12 straight postseason
games. Clemens goes for New York Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees rubbed it in a little Thursday when they had their
pitchers take batting practice. The statement seemed to be: ``We're
going to the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a little premature,'' said Lee. ``Not only is
it arrogant, it's not a good thing to do. That's how I hurt my
elbow in '75.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not 1975. Nor is it 1946, '67, '78, or '86. These are not
your father's Red Sox. But they have not been lucky. And they have
not been good or deep enough to beat the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   A banner hung from the upper-deck facade on the third base side
of Yankee Stadium. It read, ``Babe's Curse is Y2K Compliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro against the Rocket at Fenway Saturday. Rick Reed will be
the home plate umpire.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bloomingdale's vs. Almy's.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but that's the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The third spot in anyone's batting order is supposed to be a
glamour role. He is, in theory, your ``best'' hitter. The Yankees
have a No. 3 hitter who knocked in 110 in an off year. The Red Sox
have a 27-year-old rookie No. 3 hitter who is often completely
overmatched in this exalted level of competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have a veteran, battle-hardened and (reasonably)
healthy pitching rotation that features a lefthander with five
career postseason victories. The Red Sox have Pedro Martinez and an
assortment of rehabs and discards. Their starting lefthander was
jettisoned in late August by a National League team going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   You could have made a sufficiently dramatic compare-and-contrast
case to demonstrate that the Red Sox lineup had even less business
being on the field against the Indians, and at last view the
Indians were seen jumping en masse into the Cuyahoga River.
</P>
<P>
   But the hook there was pitching. For all their Central Division
dominance over the past six seasons, the Indians have never
rectified an essentially mediocre pitching situation. The defending
world champion Yankees have not had that problem.
</P>
<P>
   When the climactic moment came in Thursday night's game, Joe
Torre summoned a proven reliever named Ramiro Mendoza, who has
served his team well in a variety of situations the past several
years. With the bases loaded and one out in the eighth and New York
clinging to a precarious 3-2 lead, he bailed his team out by
striking out pinch hitter Butch Huskey and retiring the dangerous
(five hits in the first two games) Jose Offerman on a routine fly
to center.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Jimy Williams's options in a similar situation: Tom
Gordon, barely sprung from rehab; Bryce Florie, considered
expendable by the woeful Tigers; Rheal Cormier, a well-traveled
lefthander of modest skill; and Rod Beck. 'Nuff said.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomie's vs. Almy's.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox try. Oh, how they try. Jimy Williams is correct.
They most certainly do compete. But when you examine just what they
are working with, the fact that they won 94 games and managed to
defeat the Indians is one of the great baseball stories of our
time.
</P>
<P>
   That said, take out the nearest fedora from your closet and wave
it in the general direction of the noble Ramon Martinez, who gave
his team a magnificent effort in a valiant attempt to send his team
back to Fenway Park Saturday with the series tied. He has given
this team the benefit of superior class and baseball breeding since
making his debut back on Sept. 2. We already know that the team
would not have even gone this far without his spectacular
performance in Game 3 last Saturday against Cleveland. And he did
nothing to diminish his considerable reputation Thursday &UR;  &LR; night,
when he pitched 6 2/3 strong innings in the crushing Yankees
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez the Elder is not exactly pitching with the same
equipment and repertoire he had when he was doing such things as
throwing no-hitters and striking out 18 San Francisco Giants. But
the man does know how to pitch, and for six innings he was beating
the Yankees in this vital game, holding a 2-1 lead courtesy of a
two-run Nomar Garciaparra homer. His only mistake was a
fourth-inning 1-and-2 pitch that wandered into Tino Martinez's
wheelhouse and landed in the right-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   But Ramon walked leadoff man Ricky Ledee on a close 3-and-2
pitch to start off the seventh, and in a game like this such a move
was a definite faux pas. Before the inning was over, the Yankees
would push across two runs, the big blows being a two-out Chuck
Knoblauch double that produced the tying run and a two-out Paul
O'Neill soft single off Cormier that brought home the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great show, but it wasn't enough to beat David Cone,
and the very mention of that name tells you all you need to know
about the essential differences between the Bloomies and the Almys.
For David Cone, a quality, veteran pitcher, hadn't even been needed
in the Division Series against Texas. Were he a member of the
Almys, he would have started Game 2. On the Bloomies, he is now the
fourth starter. Fourth!
</P>
<P>
   Savvy baseball man that he is, Cone is blown away by the
improbability of the Almys. ``They are better than a wild card
right now,'' he maintains. ``This is not a wild-card team. Plus,
they're hot right now. Every guy on that team is putting up quality
at-bats right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the best came at the very end. With two away and nobody
on in the ninth, and with the bitter memory of a pair of would-be
homers by Jason Varitek and Troy O'Leary failing to leave the yard
by 2 and 6 inches, respectively, Garciaparra and O'Leary each got
two-strike, two-out singles in the ninth off gold-plated reliever
Mariano Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   A tease? What do you think? Rivera struck out Damon Buford to
end the game. Bloomies 3, Almys 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are an amazingly resilient team,'' lauds Cone. ``You have
to appreciate that from the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Resilient? Oh, absolutely. The problem is their shelves are
neither as well-stocked nor as laden with quality goods as the
Bloomies'. But they do have one extraordinarily high-quality item,
and let's see what the Bloomies can do with Pedro Saturday before
we call in the liquidator.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ Boston owned the Yankees in head-to-head meetings this
season. Come the playoffs, it has been all New York.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the second straight night, the Yankees rallied in the
seventh inning to turn a would-be loss into another step toward
defending their World Series title.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch hit a game-tying double and scored the go-ahead
run on a single by Paul O'Neill as the Yankees defeated Boston 3-2
in Game 2 of the American League Championship Series on Thursday
night at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees hold a commanding 2-0 lead in the series, which
shifts to Boston for Game 3 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Boston heads home for the second time this postseason trailing
0-2. The Red Sox lost the first two games against Cleveland in a
Division Series before winning three in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy being 0-2,'' said Boston manager Jimy Williams.
``We understand that. Can we do it again?''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees could. New York, which won the opener Wednesday 4-3
after trailing 3-0, rubbed out Boston's 2-1 lead Thursday with with
two runs in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee drew a leadoff walk off Ramon Martinez and Scott
Brosius sacrificed before Knoblauch drove in the tying run with a
double to left. After Knoblauch stole third and Derek Jeter walked,
O'Neill blooped a single to center off reliever Rheal Cormier.
</P>
<P>
   Boston had five runners on base in the final two innings but
failed to score, leaving the bases loaded in the eighth. The Red
Sox stranded 13 runners in the game and went 1-for-13 with men in
scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 12th straight postseason victory for the Yankees, who
tied their own record set in 1927, '28 and '32.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees swept the last three games of last year's ALCS
against Cleveland and four straight in the World Series against San
Diego. They were 3-0 against Texas in a Division Series last week.
</P>
<P>
   After taking eight of 12 games from the Yankees in the regular
season, the Red Sox have lost two one-run games in the ALCS. Boston
has lost 10 straight games in ALCS play.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are better than a wild card in my mind,'' Yankees starter
David Cone said of the Red Sox, who finished the regular season
four games behind New York in the AL East. ``Plus they are hot
right now. Every batter in their lineup seems to have quality
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are an amazingly resilient team.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone, pitching on 11 days' rest, held Boston to two runs and
seven hits in seven innings as he tied a postseason career high
with nine strikeouts. ``Rest has always worked to my advantage in
the past,'' said Cone, who had not pitched since Oct. 2. ``I felt
strong, felt sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez broke a scoreless tie in the fourth with a home
run off Ramon Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   But it was less the home run and two-run seventh that beat
Boston than the Red Sox's own failings.
</P>
<P>
   Boston stranded six runners in the first four innings, and it
got worse in the late going. The Sox were 0-for-8 with runners in
scoring position until Nomar Garciaparra hit a two-out, two-run
homer off Cone in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman opened the fifth with a single and stole second.
Two outs later, the Yankees decided to pitch to Garciaparra instead
of Troy O'Leary, who had struck out in his first two at-bats.
Garciaparra connected with a 1-2 slider, bashing the ball to left
field for a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sixth career postseason home run for Garciaparra,
including three this year.
</P>
<P>
   Boston threatened on several occasions but came up empty-handed
against Cone, who twice escaped by striking out O'Leary with two
runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox had a runner at third in the second inning after
Jason Varitek tripled off the right-field wall. But Darren Lewis
popped out and Trot Nixon flied out. In the third, Cone gave up
singles to Offerman and Garciaparra before striking out O'Leary to
end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez, making his first start at Yankee Stadium, gave
up five hits through six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the seventh, the managers went to the reserves,
shuffling pitchers, batters and runners in and out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the eighth and Red Sox at second and third,
Yankees manager Joe Torre ordered an intentional walk and was able
bring on a tough righthander, Ramiro Mendoza, to pitch to Boston's
most dangerous pinch hitter, righthanded-swinging Butch Huskey.
Mendoza struck out Huskey and got Offerman to fly to center to end
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to pitch a tougher situation than tonight,''
Torre said of Mendoza.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, the Red Sox mounted a two-out rally when
Garciaparra and O'Leary singled off closer Mariano Rivera. Rivera
ended the game by fanning Damon Buford.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one-run games, you're in it until the final inning,''
Williams said. ``You want that opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Sox haven't been able to answer the knock.

   Irvin incident shows how low Philadelphia fans can go
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
HOUSTON _ It is no secret that Philadelphia has the worst sports
fans in America. They are passionate and knowledgeable, and they
can be extremely loyal, but they also can be unbelievably cruel and
obscene.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Eagles' 13-10 victory over the Cowboys, Philadelphia
fans were most infamous for booing Santa Claus, which happened at
an Eagles game in the 1960s. Now, they will be known for their
reprehensible behavior when Dallas receiver Michael Irvin suffered
a neck injury on the cement-hard surface at Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   As Irvin lay prone on the league's worst artificial surface for
20 minutes, possibly paralyzed, many of the fans cheered. When
Irvin was lifted onto a stretcher, the cheers reached a sickening
crescendo.
</P>
<P>
   When Irvin was actually placed in an ambulance, there was some
polite cheering out of respect for a player who may have suffered a
career-ending injury. But at the same time, many cheered even
louder.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in the crowd of almost 67,000 was guilty of one of
the most despicable acts in NFL history, but it was guilt by
association.
</P>
<P>
   After Irvin's injury, the Cowboys were never the same
offensively. The Eagles pulled a stunning upset, thanks to a clutch
drive by the offense and a vastly improved defense that often gets
overlooked because the offense is so ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine that some of the Philadelphia fans who cheered
Irvin's injury are actually trying to take credit for helping the
Eagles pull out a victory? That's not surprising, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The Irvin injury and the crowd reaction were played over and
over on the networks. CNN took it worldwide: Philadelphia, where
the Declaration of Independence was signed, where Rocky won the
heavyweight championship of the world, where the Liberty Bell
rests, where they make the best cheesesteak sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Those television viewers around the world who were unfamiliar
with the ways of Philadelphia fans got to see just how brutal they
can be. Rather like a European soccer crowd, actually.
</P>
<P>
   One caller to a Houston sports talk show tried to make it into a
racial situation. He said the fans reacted that way because Irvin
is black. He must not know too much about Philadelphia sports fans,
who have been known to boo the hometown players so viciously that
they have been compared to animals that eat their young.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter if the player was black or white. It could just
as easily have been quarterback Troy Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter what the fans thought about Irvin as a player
or person _ he played for the elitist Cowboys, America's Team, one
of the Eagles' most bitter rivals that was undefeated and leading
the NFC East. The Cowboys were the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Like fans at a bullfight, they wanted blood. What they could
have gotten was a paraplegic. Fortunately, Irvin is expected to
make a full recovery and might even play again.
</P>
<P>
   If Irvin does return, here's a prediction. When he's introduced
at Veterans Stadium next year, the fans will give him a positive
ovation. Why? Because even the most hard-boiled Philadelphia fan is
embarrassed by what happened.
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, the Eagles players lashed out at their fans, as
did the Cowboys, of course. They admonished the fans. Some of the
younger players were astonished at the crowd. They shouldn't have
been. Welcome to the NFL, Philadelphia style.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia-area media criticized the fans at the game. The
newspapers scolded the fans. No one tried to defend them because
there is no defense for such a disgusting reaction by a stadium
full of degenerates.
</P>
<P>
   If it had happened in almost any city except Philadelphia or New
York, it might not have received so much publicity. Fans in those
cities are easy targets because of their history. They have a
well-founded tradition of reacting in a way that brings
embarrassment to their cities.
</P>
<P>
   Injured players have been cheered and booed in other cities.
Denver, which is supposed to have the best fans in the NFL, was
humiliated two weeks ago. After the two-time defending Super
Bowl-champion Broncos suffered another frustrating loss at Mile
High Stadium, cornerback Dale Carter was leaving the field when a
battery thrown from the stands hit him in the eye and could have
caused serious damage.
</P>
<P>
   But because this was Philadelphia, the incident warranted more
stories in newspapers and more minutes on television. It was as if
the Irvin injury added a notch in Philly's gun and enhanced its
reputation of having the nastiest fans in the country. What a
deplorable reputation to have.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the wretched display at Veterans Stadium,
media around the country attacked Philadelphia. Some outlets tried
to analyze the fans to find out what makes them the meanest and
nastiest in the country. Reporters did stories on the history of
the city's professional sports teams, especially the failures that
left fans angry and devastated.
</P>
<P>
   Even politicians weighed in with their opinions, including
Philadelphia mayor Edward Rendell, who said, ``This, in terms of
bad taste, was as bad as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia actually seemed embarrassed. It should have been.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia fans have a long tradition of viciousness. Because
of the backlash caused by the Irvin injury, it will be interesting
to see if it affects how the fans respond the next time something
like that happens, whether to an opponent or a home player.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be at an Eagles game. It could be at a Phillies,
76ers or Flyers game. At some point, though, an opposing player
will be injured. He may be knocked unconscious. Blood could be
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   How will the Philadelphia fans react? Will it be with polite
applause for a fallen star? Or will it be with derisive cheering,
as they did with Irvin?
</P>
<P>
   You never know. Philly fans may wear it like a medal of dishonor
and actually go to new heights to prove they earned their title as
the worst in professional sports. If that happens, seldom will you
find a reputation that's more deserved.

RAMON MARTINEZ VALIANT IN DEFEAT 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-MARTINEZ-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He was the X-factor, the man who just might have
dealt the first body blow to the Yankees. When pennant fantasists
were plotting out the the American League Championship Series, they
circled Game 2 in Yankee Stadium with Ramon Martinez on the hill
against David Cone as the point where things might turn in Boston's
favor.
</P>
<P>
   For the better part of Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, it seemed they had.
Martinez pitched superbly, shrugging off a solo homer by Tino
Martinez in the fourth to take the Sox into the seventh inning with
a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he pitched a tremendous game,'' said Sox manager
Jimy Williams. ``Kept us in that game. The starter sets the tone,
we always say. Certainly, he did more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who had started only four games during the regular
season after rehabbing from shoulder surgery, pitched one out short
of seven innings. He threw 120 pitches, gave up three runs on six
hits, and struck out five. Had his mates done anything with men on
base, that would have been more than enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees are one of the greatest teams,'' Martinez said.
``That is the reason why they are here. I know I am going to have a
tough game. I did the best that I could.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the wrenching irony Thursday &UR;  &LR; night. The Sox got
exactly the pitching performance from Pedro's big brother that they
craved. Then they fed him starvation rations. ``We have our
chances,'' shrugged Martinez. ``We got our men in scoring position,
but we can't come up with the base hit we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Inning after inning, Martinez kept Boston in the ballgame. He
kept the world champions scoreless through three. And when Tino
Martinez took him four rows into the right-field seats, he simply
bore down and got tougher, striking out the next three batters.
</P>
<P>
   He kept the Yankees at bay until the seventh, when he lost
leadoff man Ricky Ledee on a full-count walk and watched Scott
Brosius bunt him to second.
</P>
<P>
   Up came Chuck Knoblauch, after Martinez got Joe Girardi to pop
up. Martinez threw Knoblauch a changeup, and he sent it bouncing to
the left-field fence. Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan went to the
phone, and in came Tom Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch count pretty much ruled out Martinez going any longer.
``If he wasn't coming off surgery, maybe the decision would have
been to leave him in one more inning,'' said Kerrigan. ``But 120
pitches is 20 more than he's thrown in any start this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Martinez was feeling it. ``I can go farther than
that,'' he said. ``I feel fine when I come out. I was just normal.
I didn't feel any kind of pain or tired or anything. I didn't want
to come out, but I had to.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a sixth game in this series, Martinez will be back
here to pitch it. ``I just don't want to hurt the kid,'' said
Williams. ``I thought he had done his job, and it was time to make
a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez stayed in the dugout and watched Paul O'Neill, whom
he'd held hitless, single off reliever Rheal Cormier to put the
Yankees ahead. He stayed there through the ninth, hoping that Damon
Buford could find magic with one swing.
</P>
<P>
   Then he went into the clubhouse, strapped an iceberg to his
shoulder, and picked at a wee-hours plate. ``It was a good game,''
Ramon Martinez concluded, ``an exciting game.'' It was everything
the pennant fantasists wanted _ for 120 pitches.

CONE'S VICTORY ALL ABOUT HEART AND PERSEVERANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mamma, don't let your babies grow up to be Coneheads.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, why not?
</P>
<P>
   Why not grow a plastic cylinder or a neon orange police pylon
out of the top of your cranium and go absolutely nuts.
</P>
<P>
   That's what they did at Yankee Stadium Thursday night, when
David Cone took the mound and staved off the Red Sox, earning the
3-2 win with a gutsy seven-inning, nine-strikeout performance in
which only one man hurt him _ unless you're counting the Yankee
bullpen, which was gutted in a (finally) successful effort to close
out Cone's win.
</P>
<P>
   His one bad moment came in the fifth inning. Nomar Garciaparra
stood in against Cone and tagged a two-run homer into the
left-field seats to put the Sox ahead, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Cone who struck last. With John Valentin on second,
Cone snuffed Garciaparra in the seventh with a strikeout to end the
inning. The big ``K'' sent Cone to the dugout to watch his
teammates mount a two-run rally in the bottom of the inning, as if
on cue to take care of Coney and secure his first postseason win
this October.
</P>
<P>
   He had his fastball working. His slider and forkball, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just relaxed. I know I had to be poised and under
control because the Red Sox are a hot team. I thought it was going
to be a 1-0 game; that's why I was so mad when I gave up the homer
to Nomar,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   But he did enough to hold the Sox in check, and while he was at
it, maybe Cone staved off those voices all over Gotham that are
whispering about how Cone's days as a Yankee may be growing too few
and too precious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't handled the frustration well at all,'' Cone said
about the second-half slump. ``I let a lot of little things bother
me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the big picture, the 36-year-old right-hander knows this
American League Championship Series is about history, about
rivalry, about the Curse of the Bambino. Cone knows his role is
subordinate, supporting.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there's an ad they play at Yankee Stadium that shows a
bunch of Yankees out at a nightclub. Everyone is dancing this high
leg-kick dance that mimicks the delivery of Yankees starter Orlando
Hernandez, since El Duque is all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called the El Duque,'' a woman tells Cone.
</P>
<P>
   That's when infielder Luis Sojo looks over at Cone. ``Hey,
Coney. Why don't you have a dance named after you?'' Sojo taunts.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, Cone is not the king of the Yankees anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Today in Boston, they'll hold a press conference for Pedro
Martinez and Roger Clemens. The Red Sox ace and the former Red Sox
ace will square off in Game 3 Saturday at Fenway Park. That is the
marquee matchup of this American League Division Series. That is
the heart of this thing, not Cone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's going to be the best matchup in baseball
postseason play in the last 15 years,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday night, Cone proved he is still one of the biggest
gamers in the game. He is still a warrior. He is all about heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a big game because we did not want to go into Boston
and give Pedro the chance to put them ahead in this series,'' Cone
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cone, with the Cy Young and a World Series ring from Toronto and
two more with the Yankees, is not the ace. He is not the same
starter and sometimes stopper whom former Yankee manager Buck
Showalter threw against the Mariners to try and close Game 5 of the
1995 Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   He is not quite the same pitcher whom Joe Torre turned to in
Game 3 of the 1996 World Series. With the Yankees down 0-2 to
Atlanta, Cone turned that series around.
</P>
<P>
   This past July, after throwing a perfect game against the Expos,
Cone finished the second half of the season plagued by
inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to be out there. Everyone wants to be the go-to
guy,'' catcher Joe Girardi said. ``David is no different, but he
knew that at some point, we were going to need him and he had good
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   It's funny how it was Cone who was most shocked the day David
Wells was traded to Toronto for Roger Clemens this past spring.
Cone spent the day at Wells' place in Florida. He was the one who
spoke for Wells, told reporters how upset Wells was about the
trade, about how it hurt for Wells not to be a Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe, just like Wells, Cone could see that being a Yankee,
being on top of the world in the city that thinks it is the center
of the universe, is not a luxury that can last forever.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone took the mound Thursday night, relishing the moment.
He knows this might be his last time around with the world champs,
in a city he has come to claim as his own. He knows this postseason
is not all about him.
</P>
<P>
   But by churning out more important wins for a team and city he
thrives in, he continues to make himself hard to forget.

CONE FIGURED OUT ALL THE ANGLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE FAINARU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Cone threw 88 pitches in his perfect game
against the Montreal Expos earlier this season. His 88th pitch came
in the fifth inning Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, and Nomar Garciaparra belted
it 20 rows beyond the left-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   But Garciaparra's two-run homer was the only real blemish of
Cone's postseason debut in 1999. The Red Sox had seven hits against
him in seven innings, and the homer was one of just two hits in 16
at-bats with runners on base. He struck out nine, including
Garciaparra, the last batter he faced, on his 128th pitch of the
night.
</P>
<P>
   Cone left with the Yankees trailing, 2-1, but New York scored
two runs in the seventh, earning him credit for the Bombers' 3-2
victory over the Sox in Game 2 of the American League Championship
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love looking up and seeing him out there,'' said manager Joe
Torre. ``He's such a good influence on this pitching staff and this
clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   At this stage of his career, Cone is something of an
illusionist. At 36, he was the second-oldest pitcher to hurl a
perfect game after Cy Young, who was 37 when he beat Philadelphia
in 1904. Torre said repeatedly that he had no idea what to expect
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night out of the righthander, who had seemed to tire in
the second half, winning just three games after his perfecto July
18.
</P>
<P>
   Cone did not pitch at all in the Yankees' Division Series sweep
of the Rangers, a factor that may have helped Thursday &UR;  &LR; night. He
has been significantly better with additional rest this season.
Torre made him the No. 2 starter for the ALCS, a move that will
ensure that he pitches in Game 6 should the series return to Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good all night, really. The extra rest really helped
me. I could have gone out for the eighth, which is exactly what I
told Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone emptied the pantry against the Sox Thursday &UR;  &LR; night,
throwing from multiple arm angles and changing his rhythm
constantly to keep the Sox off balance as they threatened him
repeatedly in the first four innings. He even used a hesitation
pitch, halting in the middle of his windup before delivering the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had numerous opportunities against Cone in the first
four innings but squandered all of them:
</P>
<P>
   --In the first, Cone walked John Valentin and Garciaparra, then
struck out Troy O'Leary to get out of the jam.
</P>
<P>
   --In the second, Jason Varitek hit a one-out triple off the very
top of the right-field wall. Cone then retired Darren Lewis and
Trot Nixon on harmless flies.
</P>
<P>
   --In the third, Jose Offerman led off with a single, but Cone
got the next two outs and fanned O'Leary after Garciaparra kept the
rally alive with a ground-ball single.
</P>
<P>
   --In the fourth, Varitek hit a one-out double, but Cone fanned
Lewis and got Nixon on a fly ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like every inning there was a runner on base,'' said
Cone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coney has thrown big game after big game for us,'' said Paul
O'Neill. ``He hasn't pitched in two weeks or something; a lot of
people don't understand how difficult it is to come into a
situation like this and throw the way he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said Cone is the most difficult pitcher to catch, more
difficult than Orlando Hernandez because he throws the ball from so
many angles. Garciaparra tagged him on one of his hesitation
pitches. Cone had two strikes on the shortstop, but Garciaparra dug
out what appeared to be a low off-speed pitch and buried it deep in
the seats beyond the left-field foul pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually was trying to waste the pitch,'' Cone said. ``It
was a sidearm slider. I was already thinking what the next pitch
was going to be, and the next thing I knew, it was out of the park.
It was probably the only slider I threw all night that didn't
really break, and he's going to hit that.''

MUSCLE STRAIN SLOWS GARCES

 SOX-GARCES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Rich Garces returned to the dugout at the end of
the sixth inning in Game 1, the reliever had bad news for pitching
coach Joe Kerrigan.
</P>
<P>
   A muscle strain located on his right side had tightened. At
first, Garces confided to fellow pitcher Bret Saberhagen he had
nothing left and his arm hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan walked over to Garces and asked how he felt. The
reliever told his coach, ``It's hurt. It's sore.'' Then Kerrigan
asked the most important question: ``Can you go back out there?''
Garces repeated that he felt sore.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen sensed the reliever would do more harm than good
taking the mound in the seventh and told Kerrigan to get Garces out
of the game. And as a result of the three-way conversation, Derek
Lowe worked the seventh, eighth, and part of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you're hurt in the postseason, you don't want to be
hurt,'' said Garces, who threw two no-hit innings against New York.
``You want to go out there and do the best you can, and that's what
I did.''
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect and predictable pitching world, Lowe would have
filled the role of closer Wednesday night, guiding the Red Sox
through, at most, the last six outs. But nothing about the Boston
bullpen is perfect or predictable. The seven relievers designated
to play in the American League Championship Series are an odd
assemblage. And between past surgeries, long-term injuries,
ill-timed muscle strains, and votes of no confidence, the strength
of the bullpen has been depleted, and it cannot be managed as Jimy
Williams or Kerrigan might like.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a traditional team,'' said Lowe. ``Our games are
probably going to be spread out between three or four pitchers.
That's just the way we've been doing it all year, and I don't think
things will change.''
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1, circumstances dictated when Lowe would play. The
start of the series revealed the coaching staff had no confidence
in righthanded pitchers Bryce Florie, Tom Gordon, or Tim Wakefield.
The knuckleballer was left off the championship series roster,
while both Florie and Gordon warmed up for late-inning action but
were not used. When asked if Flash would be used late, Kerrigan
said, ``only if we're forced to.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was in fact used in the seventh in Thursday &UR;  &LR; night's 3-2
loss in Game 2. He was brought in with two outs in a 2-2 game to
face Derek Jeter with a runner on third (he walked him). That's a
spot in which Williams might have used Garces.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have become so dependent on Lowe that Kerrigan did
not rule out the young righthander for Game 2. He didn't have to.
</P>
<P>
   Said Kerrigan, ``(Garces) tightened up a little bit after his
second inning Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, to a point where he probably could
pitch if it was a sixth or seventh deciding game. But since it was
the first game of the series, we thought it was smart to take him
out so we'd have him available for the rest of the series.''

EIGHTH INNING LEAVES RED SOX OUT OF PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-EIGHTH INNING-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The utter frustration of that top half of the eighth
inning, so foreign to the American League with four moves by the
Yankees' Joe Torre and five by the Red Sox' Jimy Williams, was
verbalized by the Red Sox' Troy O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few moments earlier, the Yankees' Paul O'Neill had broken
his bat ``on a real good pitch by Frenchy (Rheal Cormier)'' and
O'Neill's single had fallen in front of O'Leary in left field,
scoring the lead run.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary was asked to put all this together, how O'Neill's
broken-bat hump-backer would win a game in light of what O'Leary
himself would do only moments later, drive a ball as far as he
could without hitting a home run, and then stand helplessly on
third base for what seemed eons, unable to travel the final 90
feet. The words came. That Paul O'Neill is a good hitter ``who
fought off a good pitch from Frenchy'' and ``it happened to fall
where there was nobody.'' But what of the top of the eighth inning,
when Torre had made the same mistake that American League managers
have made the last few months _ go by the book and bring in a lefty
(Mike Stanton) to pitch to O'Leary? O'Leary has pasted, pulverized,
and pounded lefthanded pitchers this season, book or no book.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary swung, and the ball moved high and far toward right
center. ``I hit it good,'' said O'Leary. ``I thought it might go
out.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary's blast was hit exponentially harder than O'Neill's but
landed _ oh, when will Red Sox fans finally decide exactly whether
it was two inches or three from the top of the wall in right
center? _ in the very small distance above the ``5'' in the ``385''
sign and then dropped to the warning track. O'Leary pulled up at
second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit the wall, just like (Jason) Varitek hit the wall,''
said O'Leary, the life almost gone from his words. ``We just had to
settle for a double.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary was asked how he could reconcile this, that O'Neill and
the Yankees could win with a hump-backer and the Red Sox could lose
despite a blast. No one has ever answered this in baseball, and no
one ever will, and O'Leary's answer, even if it was a cliche,
summed it all up. ``That's the way baseball is sometimes. That's
how it goes sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The painful inning went on. Mike Stanley was hit by a pitch from
Jeff Nelson, Torre's second pitcher. Varitek laid down a sacrifice
bunt, advancing O'Leary and pinch runner Damon Buford. Williams
sent up Scott Hatteberg, but after one ball from Nelson, Torre went
to lefty Allen Watson to face the lefty Hatteberg. Williams
countered with righthanded-hitting Lou Merloni.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I was looking forward to that; I wanted to hit so badly,''
said Merloni, the Framingham, Mass. youngster who has lived through
so much Red Sox pain. ``And when they (intentionally) put me on, I
was disappointed. I wanted to hit in that situation. It's a
situation you dream of _ one-run game, guys on second and third.''
</P>
<P>
   With Trot Nixon due up, both managers made their moves. Nixon
said he somewhat ``expected to be hit for since I don't face
lefties that much,'' and ``I haven't faced Watson much.'' Williams
sent up Butch Huskey, the power-swinging all-or-nothing hitter.
Torre countered with Ramiro Mendoza.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the opportunity I wanted,'' said Huskey. ``I had the
best opportunity of anybody to do something. I had a great
opportunity to be succssful in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   And Huskey did the least.
</P>
<P>
   He was looking for breaking balls from Mendoza, ``but he didn't
throw me any breaking balls,'' Huskey said. ``He threw me two
changeups and two sinkers. I wasn't looking for any changeups
because he doesn't pitch that way. And the first pitch, I just
pulled it foul.''
</P>
<P>
   And the last pitch? With two strikes on him, ``I was looking for
anything to put in play. He threw me a changeup.'' And Huskey
struck out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll get him next time,'' said Huskey, new to the Red Sox, new
to Boston, where such words come across with such dread.
</P>
<P>
   The last batter was Jose Offerman, who was virtually certain not
to strike out no matter what Mendoza threw at him. Offerman worked
the count to 2-and-2, and ``I had a good swing at his pitch. It was
a pitch a little bit away, and I had a good swing at it and I hit
the ball pretty good'' _ to Bernie Williams in medium-deep center
field. ``It was just bad luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Of which the Red Sox have had more than their share in the two
games in New York. And more than their share this century against
New York.

CALL TO ARMS ANSWERED 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-NINTH INNING-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Yankee manager Joe Torre's sleight-of-hand tactics
weren't as diverse in the ninth inning Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, but they
were no less compelling than his moves in the eighth, when the
Bombers' skipper opened the bullpen door and kept a steady stream
of pinstriped relievers marching to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the chess game,'' said Torre, who clearly has more good
and reliable options in his bullpen than Sox skipper Jimy Williams
has in his. ``You have to empty your bullpen and go for it. The
greatest part about managing is to be able to go back and forth
with the other manager.''
</P>
<P>
   After going with no fewer than four relievers in the eighth
inning, his one-run lead looking thinner by the pitch, Torre called
for his top closer, Mariano Rivera, to seal it the ninth. Quickly,
effortlessy, Mariano dispatched John Valentin on a roller in front
of the plate and Brian Daubach with a fly to left.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera has been nothing less than phenomenal this season. He
came into the playoffs without allowing a run in his final 28
appearances of the regular season. He escaped the ninth unscathed
again Thursday &UR;  &LR; night and now has made 32 consecutive trips out of
the 'pen without getting touched for a run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any way we can win, we do it,'' said righthander Jeff Nelson,
who was the second arm out of the bullpen, following Mike Stanton
in the eighth. ``That's what you have to do _ you have to go with
the matchups.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, perhaps the game's most dominant closer, had to work a
little more than usual for his third save of the postseason. After
getting the first two outs, he was touched for back-to-back singles
by Nomar Garciaparra and Troy O'Leary. Garciaparra at third base
soon would become the eighth Boston runner stranded in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
   But before the inning ended, Torre made an emergency trip to the
mound. Rivera still had to get by Damon Buford to end the game. The
little-used Buford was at the plate, in part, because Mike Stanley
was hit by a pitch in the eighth and had to leave for X-rays.
Rivera reached back and made Buford his fifth strikeout victim in
six innings of postseason relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been automatic for us,'' said an admiring Derek Jeter,
the Yankee second baseman. ``I mean, it's been ridiculous. Hey, you
know, (Ramiro) Mendoza and Rivera _ the Panamanian connection.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, Torre used four relievers in the eighth, including
Mendoza, then pleaded the fifth with Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was about it,'' noted Nelson, who kidded how some of the
relievers hadn't worked in nearly three weeks because he and Rivera
have handled most of the load of late. ``Hideki Irabu was the only
guy left out there.''
</P>
<P>
   While Torre kept his saints marching in, Williams rolled out
only two after starter Ramon Martinez worked into the seventh.
First came Tom Gordon, whose year has been impaired by injury; then
it was Rheal Cormier, the little lefthander who has been a key in
Williams's constant cobbling of the bullpen this season. The
Yankees are much deeper than the Sox _ a large factor in Vegas
making them a 3-to-1 favorite in this series _ and the lopsided
difference may be greatest of all when it comes time to call arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are spinning,'' said Torre, asked what it was like to
be wheeling and dealing with his pitchers, especially in the
eighth-inning chorus-line march. ``I'm in there talking to Zim (Don
Zimmer), and I'm talking to Mel (Stottlemyre) . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``It's do or die. It's right now. There's no thinking, `Oh,
we'll get 'em later on.' It's such an exciting time of the year,
and our players have responded to it.''

MISSING OPPORTUNITIES SINK RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-YANKEES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Red Sox lost the first two games of their
Division Series with the Cleveland Indians, Nomar Garciaparra put
on his best poker face and said the Sox had them just where they
wanted 'em.
</P>
<P>
   What, then, to make of the plight of the New York Yankees? The
Bombers will arrive at Fenway Park for Game 3 of their American
League Championship Series Saturday afternoon with the same
advantage the Indians had after coming from behind for the second
straight night to beat the Sox, this time 3-2 on a tie-breaking
single by sore-ribbed Paul O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   History falls heavily in favor of the Yankees, who tied a record
held by three of their illustrious predecessors with their 12th
straight win in postseason play, putting them two wins away from
returning to the World Series for the third time in the last four
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am tired,'' said O'Neill, who hit a flare over Garciaparra's
head off lefthanded reliever Rheal Cormier to score Chuck
Knoblauch, who had doubled home the tying run off Sox starter Ramon
Martinez. ``Everybody is. We are exhausted. One-run games, they are
pretty gut-wrenching, but I feel great. It was a great game. Both
games could have gone either way.''
</P>
<P>
   Little besides blind faith appears to favor the sons of Jimy
Williams. Not after the Sox took a lead into the seventh inning for
the second straight night and lost it. Troy O'Leary and Jason
Varitek missed home runs by mere inches, the Sox are 1 for 13 with
runners in scoring position in two games, and they may have lost
first baseman Mike Stanley, who was hit in the right wrist by a
pitch from Jeff Nelson in the eighth inning (X-rays were negative).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never easy down 0-2,'' Williams said. ``All we can do is
play one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we did go through it already, in very recent days. Maybe
the way the game ended, the way we had a shot in the eighth and it
didn't work, can we do it again?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you all come to Boston. They have good restaurants
there, it is a nice city, it really is. But we are going, we will
be there to play to say the least.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who left 13 runners on base, gave it one last shot in
the ninth on two-out singles by Garciaparra and O'Leary. But an
overmatched Damon Buford, who entered the game as a pinch runner
for Stanley in an eighth inning in which Williams emptied his
bench, went down swinging against Mariano Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees closer hasn't allowed a run since July 21, a span of
32 appearances, including four in the postseason. The Sox bullpen,
meanwhile, couldn't protect the 2-1 lead Garciaparra had given the
gallant Ramon Martinez with a two-run home run off Yankees starter
David Cone, who matched a personal postseason best by striking out
nine in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't hope for more than to be in that situation,''
Buford said. ``He (Rivera) just won the battle.''
</P>
<P>
   With a healthier bullpen, Williams probably would have excused
Martinez for the night after he walked leadoff man Ricky Ledee to
open the seventh. Martinez already had thrown 105 pitches entering
the inning, and while he was still hitting 90 miles per hour on the
radar gun, he had not been pushed to such extremes since before his
surgery, 15 months previously.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams elected to stick with the elegant righthander.
Scott Brosius bunted Ledee to second, but Joe Girardi popped out,
leaving Martinez one out away from finishing his night's labors
with a lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Knoblauch rifled a 1-1 pitch into the left-field corner,
scoring Ledee with the tying run. With Derek Jeter the next hitter,
Williams came for Martinez, who delayed his departure until
reliever Tom Gordon was almost to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to come out in that situation,'' Martinez said.
``I had to come out. I could have gone farther.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon had warmed up in Game 1 but was not used. Before the
game, pitching coach Joe Kerrigan, asked if he would use Gordon in
a close game late, said: ``We might be forced to. If the situation
dictates it, yeah, we'll use him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon lasted one batter. Missing high with his fastball, Gordon
walked Jeter, bouncing a 3-and-2 curveball that Varitek did a nice
job of blocking to keep Knoblauch at third, where he'd advanced
with a stolen base without drawing a throw.
</P>
<P>
   Williams then summoned Cormier to face O'Neill in a reprise of
their ninth-inning encounter in Game 1. Cormier won that one,
inducing O'Neill to tap back to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Cormier jumped ahead of O'Neill Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, too, putting
the Yankees' right-fielder in a 1-and-2 hole, but O'Neill, despite
being jammed, flared the next pitch over Garciaparra's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would throw the same pitch in the same spot,'' Cormier said.
``Unfortunately, the ball went behind the shortstop where nobody
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams emptied his entire bench in the span of four batters in
the eighth inning, using three pinch hitters and two pinch runners.
Yankees manager Joe Torre countered with four pitchers. The outcome
of all the maneuvers? With the bases full of Sox, Yankees reliever
Ramiro Mendoza struck out pinch hitter Butch Huskey and retired
Jose Offerman on a gentle fly to center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Ramiro Mendoza, there is no question,'' Torre said.
``He has done so many good things. He's not going to pitch in a
tougher situation than he did tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Yankees' 12 straight matches the record set by the
'26, '27, and '32 Bombers, the Sox were unable to end their own
streak of 10 straight losses in American League Championship Series
play.
</P>
<P>
   It was of little comfort to the Sox, of course, that umpire Rick
Reed admitted blowing a 10th-inning call that short-circuited a
potential Sox rally in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he accepted the responsibility, then he did,'' manager Jimy
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Sox must return home again, down 2 games to none,
then they will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's right where we want 'em,'' said reliever
Derek Lowe, who would have been called upon to close if the Sox
could have held serve. ``But we're playing good.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were getting overmatched, it would be different, but
we're not. These games could have gone either way. This series
could be flip-flopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to go back and play the same way. It's very
important we don't change the way we're playing.''

COUPLE OF LONG SHOTS COULDN'T COME THROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is no famous wall here like there is in Boston.
Or at least there isn't supposed to be one. But as the Red Sox made
their way home early this morning, there were two images flashing
in each player's head. There was a constant, frustrating backdrop
in each image: a light blue wall.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Sox, they have a lot in common with the
two well-hit baseballs that traveled to the edge of the Yankee
Stadium outfield Thursday &UR;  &LR; night. Like the baseballs, the Sox
traveled a fair distance before finding themselves falling just
short, up against the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The facts are that the Sox trail the Yankees in the American
League Championship Series, 2 games to 0. Two more losses, and
their season is over. The cruel underbelly to those facts is that
we could easily be saying the same thing about the Yankees.
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, the New Yorkers beat the Sox, 3-2. The Sox were
seven or eight inches from winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must work for Home Depot, selling lumber or something,''
Jimy Williams said when someone posed the seven-inches-from-victory
question to him. ``You are about right. I guess I'm being a wise
guy, but you are about right.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, Jason Varitek hit a towering fly ball to
right field. It appeared to be leaving the park easily. But the
ball landed about five or six inches from the top of the fence. In
the eighth, Troy O'Leary sent a ball toward the 385-foot sign in
right-center. ``I wasn't sure if 'Tek's ball was going to go,''
teammate Butch Huskey said of Varitek, ``but I thought Troy's was
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't. The ball hit just above the ``5'' in 385, two inches
from the top of the wall. Seven or eight inches from a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game was won and lost by inches,'' Varitek said.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall, Yankees second baseman Chuck Knoblauch had no
sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, hang in there,'' he said of the Sox' near misses. ``Our
fences are the right height. What can I say? They always say
baseball is a game of inches, and sometimes it proves to be
right.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes baseball so intriguing and disturbing is games like
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night's. Tino Martinez hit a home run, and it covered 358
feet. Nomar Garciaparra hit a home run and it went 368 feet.
Varitek and O'Leary launched balls that were in the 385-foot range,
and both stayed in the park, becoming a triple and double,
respectively. In both cases, neither man was brought home by a
teammate. The intelligent thing to say, then, was that the Sox did
not take care of their business with runners in scoring position
(they stranded 13). But they were not in the mood to talk about
intelligence. What they felt Thursday &UR;  &LR; night was raw, piercing
depression.
</P>
<P>
   Inside their visiting clubhouse, a few players were able to
smile at the irony of the night. Others cursed nearby reporters.
During this season, the Sox have gained a reputation as a
resilient, gritty team. But no one wanted to talk about that
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night. The Sox are like the guy who has heard, too many
times, the same line from the girl he loves: ``Hey, you're a nice
guy, but you're like a brother to me . . . '' The Sox didn't want
to be the little brother Thursday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Lowe was asked how close the Sox were to homering. He used
a metric-system reference.
</P>
<P>
   ``About a centimeter,'' the reliever said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Sox won't say it, but they need something
extraordinary from Pedro Martinez Saturday. Something very close to
the 17-strikeout performance they got on Sept. 10. They got good
performances in the first two games and have nothing to show for
them. So the truth is that being good is not good enough against
this team. It's akin to taking a championship from an incumbent
heavyweight. If you want to beat him, you cannot match him blow for
blow. You have to knock him out.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the final should have been 4-3, Sox,
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, Boston still did some things that, if they
continue, will have them sitting at home Monday morning. In the
eighth, with a runner on third base and one man out, Huskey could
not bring O'Leary home with a sacrifice fly. You could make the
argument that Trot Nixon should have never been pinch-hit for _ and
I would buy the argument _ but anyone at the plate in that
situation has to be able to bring the runner home. If Huskey had
done that, it would have been a tie game at 3-all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was put in a situation to be successful,'' Huskey said,
``and I didn't do it. I'll have to go get them tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   True. But the recurring images are of that wall and those fly
balls, rising and then crashing at the top of the wall. That
happened twice. Huskey was asked about the symbolism of being seven
or eight inches short of a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' the big outfielder said, ``the wall is too big.''

 &LR;   &LR;  Wilt Chamberlain was a test for a sportswriter. If you could
experience his mix of bombast, opinion and over-the-top joie de
vivre and not walk away smiling, it was time to turn in the old
press shield and explore that career in bartending.
<P>
   You didn't interview Wilt, he interviewed you. And did he ever
speak in anything but full-volume thunder? You'd have to ask one of
his 20,000 dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``L-l-let me ask you this, my man,'' he would say with his
authoritative stutter. ``How often do you think B-b-bill Russell
guarded me straight-up, without the help of at least two other
guys?''
</P>
<P>
   I became a Wilt Chamberlain fan at age 8 when I saw him play for
the Harlem Globetrotters, and I remained an unabashed Wilt fan
until the day he died.
</P>
<P>
   The great sports debate was always: Who's better _ Wilt or
Russell?
</P>
<P>
   L-l-let me tell you this: Wilt waxed Russell's butt up one side
and down the other.
</P>
<P>
   And Wilt waxed life's butt. At 60, he told me he was taking up
mountain biking. Great way to meet girls. And to scare mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Wilt would hop in his car on a whim and drive cross-country,
trying to break his own record, stopping only to autograph speeding
tickets. He claimed to be a gourmet cook. He wrote two books with
no ghostwriter. He designed his own cathedral-like mansion. He
traveled the world, lived on a mountaintop in L.A. and on a beach
in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   One day he told me he was designing and producing his own
limited-edition, high-performance car.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wiltmobile!'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No!'' he frowned. ``The Chamberlain.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he mentioned he was considering marriage, what did I think?
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it,'' I said, ``but I don't think it's for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilt settling down would have been like the Titanic settling
down.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the girls. The stories were true. Wilt took care of 20,000
babes, all right. More.
</P>
<P>
   He made it possible for at least that many women to participate
in high-level athletics. Wilt had six sisters, and he hated that
they had no opportunity to play sports. When he traveled to Russia
with the Globetrotters he was amazed at the athletic programs for
females, and he vowed to make that happen here.
</P>
<P>
   And he did. He organized, bankrolled, encouraged and sometimes
coached top amateur track, volleyball and basketball teams, and
promoted road races and marathons. In that sense, he really was
God's gift to women.
</P>
<P>
   And to the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   ASK FOR IT at your newsstand by its new name: ``SUCKcess.''

   SAN FRANCISCO can't seem to do anything to slow down the drug
pushers. The shopping-cart pushers, that's another story. We got

to snatch back the shopping carts used by homeless folks. But that
was  &UR; somebody's  &LR; plan, somebody high-high up in city authority.

   HONEST, THE ABE LINCOLN knew what it was doing when it steamed
under the Golden Gate Bridge last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The massive aircraft carrier almost skimmed the underside of the
bridge. My inside source said it was pure luck, that nobody had
bothered to calculate the clearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did in fact calculate the air draft clearance,'' says
Captain Bruce Horton, the harbor pilot who guided the Abe into the
Bay, ``and when I got to the bridge of the ship, the captain had
also figured it out. To be exact, we had 27.9 feet of clearance. So
much for pure chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Great, Cap'n Horton, but doesn't all that mathematical
rigamarole take all the spontaneous fun out of boating?

 CLINTON ASSAILS GOP FOR KILLING ARMS TREATY  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton delivered a defiant rebuttal
Thursday to the Senate's rejection of the nuclear test ban treaty,
warning that the Republicans' ``reckless partisanship'' poses a
threat to America's national security as well as to its economic
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   During a combative, hourlong news conference, Clinton repeatedly
attacked his Republican opponents in Congress for embracing what he
called a ``new isolationism'' demonstrated by their refusal to
embrace the arms treaty, pay U.N. dues or fully fund his budget for
foreign operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are saying we don't need our friends or allies,'' Clinton
said from the East Room of the White House. ``They are betting our
children's future on the reckless proposition that we can go it
alone _ that at the height of our prosperity, we should bury our
heads in the sand behind a wall.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong words came a day after the Senate voted 51 to 48 to
reject a treaty that the president had called a top priority of his
second term. A two-thirds majority would have been needed for
passage. In his opening statement, and in the course of numerous
questions on the matter, Clinton tried to turn the stinging foreign
policy defeat to his party's political advantage, insisting the
vote will be a potent election issue for Democrats next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``These arms control agreements have created a climate in the
world which has helped to make us far more secure and helped to
reduce the likelihood that nuclear weapons will ever be used
again,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Without the treaty, he declared, ``we will be in a much, much
more dangerous world.''
</P>
<P>
   Adopting an unusually confrontational tone, Clinton also accused
the GOP of jeopardizing the nation's economic prosperity by
``lurching from one unworkable idea to the next'' in spending
proposals and budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to the congressional majority, enough is enough. We've
got a job to do for the American people. It is not that
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss, was quick to rebut
Clinton's assertion that partisanship had triumphed over policy in
Wednesday night's rejection of the arms treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not about politics,'' Lott said. ``It was about the
substance of the treaty, and that's all it was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some of the most thoughtful senators that have ever
served in this body that said that this treaty was not verifiable,
that it was fundamentally flawed and it should not be ratified,''
Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rejection, Clinton declared that the United States
will abide by the treaty, which has been ratified by 47 nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue the policy we have maintained since 1992 of
not conducting nuclear tests. I call on Russia, China, Britain,
France and all other countries to continue to refrain from
testing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he assured foreign ambassadors that ``we are not
going to reverse 40 years of commitment on nonproliferation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them ... that we were in a battle with the new
isolationists in the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the political potency of the issue, Vice President
Al Gore released the first ad of his campaign for president, a
60-second television spot in which he says that if elected
president, his first act will be to resubmit the treaty to the
Senate for ratification.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vote goes against the tide of history,'' Gore says in the
ad scheduled to air in Iowa, New Hampshire and nationally on CNN.
``I believe in my heart this vote does not speak for the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Among presidential candidates, as in the Senate, support for the
issue is divided along party lines. Like Gore, Democratic Bill
Bradley supports the treaty, while Republican front-runner George
W. Bush and other GOP candidates, as well as independent Bob Smith,
oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton dismissed the Republicans' assertion that personal
politics were not behind the GOP's rejection of the treaty. ``They
had a lot of people committed who didn't know very much about the
treaty,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for efforts to contain nuclear weapons over the past
40 years, Clinton said, the spiraling arms race would have
prevented the nation's current economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that without treaties to reduce nuclear arms, the
GOP would be demanding ``another $30 billion, $40 billion or $50
billion a year'' for weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would totally erode the fabric of our domestic climate,''
the president said. Nations like Brazil that have forsaken nuclear
weapons would be wasting valuable resources to protect themselves,
rather than spending money on health care or trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be a bleak, poor, less secure world. I don't
want my children and my grandchildren or your children or your
grandchildren to live in it,'' Clinton said. ``I will do everything
I can to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton demurred when asked whether he agreed with Gore's
criticism of Bradley for having quit the Senate shortly after
Republicans took control. The president offered strong praise for
Gore but refused to reproach Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get into that kind of horse racing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Al Gore has been by far the best vice president in
history,'' he added. ``I expect to support the nominee of my party,
as I always have.''
</P>
<P>
   The news conference in the East Room of the White House was
Clinton's first since July. He avoided such forums for nearly a
year during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Thursday, he received one
question on a related matter, and flatly refused to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Judge Susan Webber Wright's decision to fine Clinton
for lying about Lewinsky in the Paula Jones deposition, Clinton
intimated he wanted to respond _ but would not do so as long as he
is president.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I am out of office, I will have a lot to say about this.
Until then, I am going to honor my commitment to all of you to go
back to work ... I am not going to say anything else that doesn't
relate to my responsibilities.''

 &HT;    IMPORTED CRAB MEAT THREATENS EAST COAST WATERMEN
 &HT;    Moving in (a) national, (l) lifestyle and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Oct. 24.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRISFIELD, Md. _ Soulful amens drifted over piles of cooked
crabs as the praying concluded and the picking commenced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing it since I was 13. When I was younger, I
thought it was hard. But not now. I just know I have to do it to
survive,.'' said Barbara James, whose nimble fingers and graying
hair testify to decades of separating the sweet meat from the sharp
shells. ``On a good day, I'll make $80 to $90. On a bad day, $50 to
$60.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking a heavenly tilt toward more good days than bad, the crab
pickers at Byrd's Seafood sing the Lord's Prayer each morning. For
generations, they have prayed daily for a plentiful catch by the
local watermen. Such traditions are deeply anchored in the hamlets
nestled along the meandering Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it is in the crab and oyster industry _ mostly
small, family-owned businesses that have been around a long time,''
explained J.C. Tolley, who operates a crab-picking house that his
ancestors opened in 1920. ``In rural, isolated fishing villages,
they're the lifeblood of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the folks who harvest and pick blue crabs believe their
livelihood and lifestyle are being threatened by imported crab meat
from Asia. Seafood industry analysts say that these imports
increased 300 percent between 1994 and 1998. During this period,
the domestic processors' share of the U.S. market fell from 56
percent to 32 percent. When Americans buy crabcakes or deviled crab
now, the meat is more likely to have come from Indonesia or
Thailand or some other foreign country than from native
crustaceans.
</P>
<P>
   The economic effects have been felt all along the Southern
coastline.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Maryland and Virginia around to Louisiana, I don't know
anybody in the picking business that's not having a hard time
selling crab meat,'' said Jack Amason, president of Sea Garden
Seafoods in McIntosh County, Ga., and a director of the National
Blue Crab Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   Asian crab pickers make $2 to $5 a day _ less than U.S. pickers
make per hour. American crab processors say they can't compete with
such low labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven or eight years ago, Georgia had eight picking houses.
Now there are only two left,'' said Amason, who said both
establishments are in McIntosh County. ``My sales are off over 50
percent. I've been at it 30-something years, but I don't know
whether I'll be in the crab business a year from now.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chesapeake Bay communities where most jobs are linked to the
water, the invasion of crab imports is having a ``tremendous
impact,'' said Doug Lipton, a marine economist at the University of
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Watermen are losing income but may survive by selling live crabs
in summer and switching to more oysters and fish, Lipton predicted.
``But for the pickers, an old way of life is threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   STAR DASH
</P>
<P>
   Paintings of crabs adorn the water tower and every street sign
in this waterfront community. Main Street is lined with businesses
like Eddie Heath's Crab Pots and Supplies and Carvel Hall Cutlery,
where they make knives used in picking. At Gordon's Restaurant,
watermen fuel up on coffee and fried-egg sandwiches before dawn.
Streets dead-end at docks where crabbing boats fill nearly every
slip.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, lives have depended on the bounty of the bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been crabbing and oystering for 60 years,'' said Homer
Tyler, 73. ``I finished the seventh grade and then I went out on
the water.''
</P>
<P>
   His father was a waterman and so are his sons. Their days are
spent baiting, stringing and checking crab pots in the bay or
tonging for oysters. Tyler spent 35 years on a skipjack, the
working sailboat that has long since been replaced by motorized
craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work is what keeps me going,'' Tyler allowed. ``I'm up at 3:30
most mornings in the summer, but I come back in around dinner time.
My fingers don't work too well in winter months. But I love the
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Elliott, the son of a sawmill worker, expresses similar
devotion to the crab-picking house at Toddville where he does a bit
of everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I love it,'' he exclaimed. ``I can go fishing off the
pier. It's peaceful. There ain't no place else I want to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott works at Meredith &AMP; Meredith, founded by two cousins
returning from World War I. Their nephew came into the business
when he came home from World War II. His son, J.C. Tolley, joined
the enterprise in 1963 after a couple of years at the U.S. Naval
Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The go-go, online '90s'' have bypassed Toddville, Tolley said.
``We don't have high-tech companies, Kmarts or Wal-Marts. We don't
even have a barber.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are blue crabs and oysters nearby in the bay. For
years, shellfish have supported the families of Toddville.
</P>
<P>
   But with the influx of imported crab meat, Tolley said, ``It's
getting harder for all of us to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much we can do to modernize,'' he said. ``It's
hand work. It's not like you could build a new plant with computers
and robots. There's nowhere to squeeze.''
</P>
<P>
   STAR DASH
</P>
<P>
   In 1914, the Phillips family founded a crab-picking plant on
Hoopers Island, just off the Eastern Shore. In 1956, Brice and
Shirley Phillips opened a seafood restaurant in the resort town of
Ocean City, Md. Since then, the family business has exploded _ with
restaurants from Washington, D.C., to West Palm Beach, Fla., and
Phillips ``Maryland-style'' crab soup and frozen crab cakes in
supermarkets across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the crab meat in the company's restaurants and packaged
products is much more likely to have come from Asia than from the
Chesapeake Bay. Along with its original Hooper's Island picking
house, Phillips now has plants in Indonesia, Thailand and the
Philippines. Those foreign facilities supply most of the crab meat
for Phillips frozen products and restaurants, as well some sold to
outside distributors.
</P>
<P>
   The description of ``Maryland-style'' refers to the Phillips
family recipes, not the origin of the crab meat, said Honey
Konicoff, the marketing director for Phillips Seafood. The quality
of the crabcake is more important than where the crab came from,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips sells pasteurized crab meat to distributors at or above
the domestic market price, said Aden King, the company's sale
manager. Labor costs are cheaper in Asia, he conceded, so Phillips
foreign pickers can take more time to provide ``virtually
shell-free'' crab meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means a lot to restaurateurs'' who otherwise have to pay
their own kitchen workers to check for shells, said Mark Sneed,
president of Phillips. The company has also expanded by emphasizing
``value-added products'' such as prepared crabcakes rather than
plain crab meat.
</P>
<P>
   Sneed said the seafood market has ``changed dramatically'' in
recent years but domestic crab meat processors ``haven't changed
how they do business.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, domestic crab meat processors have a different view
of the situation. Their pickers are guaranteed the minimum wage,
but most make considerably more because they're paid about $2.25
for every pound they pick. There are spot checks for shells, but
the expense of ``double picking'' would be prohibitive, said Norman
Dorrell, president of Warren Denton Seafood of Broomes Island, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't compete on labor costs,'' said Dorrell. Asians
are ``putting us out of business and I don't see any legal way to
stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   For temporary help, U.S. processors are asking the Clinton
administration to impose quotas or duties on imported crab meat to
give the domestic industry time to adjust to the foreign
competition. Similar relief was provided by the U.S. International
Trade Commission when American sheep ranchers were hard hit by lamb
imports from Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tariffs or quotas are only a short-term solution, but (such
measures) might buy time'' for imposing marketing standards and
launching an information. campaign to let consumers know when Asian
crab meat is sold, said Lipton, the marine economist.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers ``may or may not care, but at least they would know
that the crabcakes at a waterfront restaurant didn't come from
local crabs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asian crabs are significantly different from the blue crabs
caught in the Chesapeake Bay and along the Southern coast, said
Jack Brooks, who, along with his brothers, runs J.M. Clayton Co., a
Cambridge, Md., seafood business begun in 1890s by their
great-grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks and other domestic processors maintain that the American
blue crab meat tastes better than the Asian variety. They want
federal requirements so the products will be labeled with the
crab's country of origin. Temporary tariffs or quotas will give the
American crab industry time to differentiate their product, like
Florida has done with oranges or Vidalia, Ga., with onions, Brooks
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Barbara James prays every morning and picks the meat
from a crab every 20 seconds or so. Outside the seafood business,
she said, ``there are no jobs in this town.''

 &HT;    IMPORTED CRAB MEAT THREATENS EAST COAST WATERMEN

   CRISFIELD, Md. _ Soulful amens drifted over piles of cooked
crabs as the praying concluded and the picking commenced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing it since I was 13. When I was younger, I
thought it was hard. But not now. I just know I have to do it to
survive,.'' said Barbara James, whose nimble fingers and graying
hair testify to decades of separating the sweet meat from the sharp
shells. ``On a good day, I'll make $80 to $90. On a bad day, $50 to
$60.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking a heavenly tilt toward more good days than bad, the crab
pickers at Byrd's Seafood sing the Lord's Prayer each morning. For
generations, they have prayed daily for a plentiful catch by the
local watermen. Such traditions are deeply anchored in the hamlets
nestled along the meandering Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it is in the crab and oyster industry _ mostly
small, family-owned businesses that have been around a long time,''
explained J.C. Tolley, who operates a crab-picking house that his
ancestors opened in 1920. ``In rural, isolated fishing villages,
they're the lifeblood of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the folks who harvest and pick blue crabs believe their
livelihood and lifestyle are being threatened by imported crab meat
from Asia. Seafood industry analysts say that these imports
increased 300 percent between 1994 and 1998. During this period,
the domestic processors' share of the U.S. market fell from 56
percent to 32 percent. When Americans buy crabcakes or deviled crab
now, the meat is more likely to have come from Indonesia or
Thailand or some other foreign country than from native
crustaceans.
</P>
<P>
   The economic effects have been felt all along the Southern
coastline.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Maryland and Virginia around to Louisiana, I don't know
anybody in the picking business that's not having a hard time
selling crab meat,'' said Jack Amason, president of Sea Garden
Seafoods in McIntosh County, Ga., and a director of the National
Blue Crab Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   Asian crab pickers make $2 to $5 a day _ less than U.S. pickers
make per hour. American crab processors say they can't compete with
such low labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven or eight years ago, Georgia had eight picking houses.
Now there are only two left,'' said Amason, who said both
establishments are in McIntosh County. ``My sales are off over 50
percent. I've been at it 30-something years, but I don't know
whether I'll be in the crab business a year from now.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chesapeake Bay communities where most jobs are linked to the
water, the invasion of crab imports is having a ``tremendous
impact,'' said Doug Lipton, a marine economist at the University of
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Watermen are losing income but may survive by selling live crabs
in summer and switching to more oysters and fish, Lipton predicted.
``But for the pickers, an old way of life is threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   STAR DASH
</P>
<P>
   Paintings of crabs adorn the water tower and every street sign
in this waterfront community. Main Street is lined with businesses
like Eddie Heath's Crab Pots and Supplies and Carvel Hall Cutlery,
where they make knives used in picking. At Gordon's Restaurant,
watermen fuel up on coffee and fried-egg sandwiches before dawn.
Streets dead-end at docks where crabbing boats fill nearly every
slip.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, lives have depended on the bounty of the bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been crabbing and oystering for 60 years,'' said Homer
Tyler, 73. ``I finished the seventh grade and then I went out on
the water.''
</P>
<P>
   His father was a waterman and so are his sons. Their days are
spent baiting, stringing and checking crab pots in the bay or
tonging for oysters. Tyler spent 35 years on a skipjack, the
working sailboat that has long since been replaced by motorized
craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work is what keeps me going,'' Tyler allowed. ``I'm up at 3:30
most mornings in the summer, but I come back in around dinner time.
My fingers don't work too well in winter months. But I love the
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Elliott, the son of a sawmill worker, expresses similar
devotion to the crab-picking house at Toddville where he does a bit
of everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I love it,'' he exclaimed. ``I can go fishing off the
pier. It's peaceful. There ain't no place else I want to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott works at Meredith &AMP; Meredith, founded by two cousins
returning from World War I. Their nephew came into the business
when he came home from World War II. His son, J.C. Tolley, joined
the enterprise in 1963 after a couple of years at the U.S. Naval
Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The go-go, online '90s'' have bypassed Toddville, Tolley said.
``We don't have high-tech companies, Kmarts or Wal-Marts. We don't
even have a barber.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are blue crabs and oysters nearby in the bay. For
years, shellfish have supported the families of Toddville.
</P>
<P>
   But with the influx of imported crab meat, Tolley said, ``It's
getting harder for all of us to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much we can do to modernize,'' he said. ``It's
hand work. It's not like you could build a new plant with computers
and robots. There's nowhere to squeeze.''
</P>
<P>
   STAR DASH
</P>
<P>
   In 1914, the Phillips family founded a crab-picking plant on
Hoopers Island, just off the Eastern Shore. In 1956, Brice and
Shirley Phillips opened a seafood restaurant in the resort town of
Ocean City, Md. Since then, the family business has exploded _ with
restaurants from Washington, D.C., to West Palm Beach, Fla., and
Phillips ``Maryland-style'' crab soup and frozen crab cakes in
supermarkets across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the crab meat in the company's restaurants and packaged
products is much more likely to have come from Asia than from the
Chesapeake Bay. Along with its original Hooper's Island picking
house, Phillips now has plants in Indonesia, Thailand and the
Philippines. Those foreign facilities supply most of the crab meat
for Phillips frozen products and restaurants, as well some sold to
outside distributors.
</P>
<P>
   The description of ``Maryland-style'' refers to the Phillips
family recipes, not the origin of the crab meat, said Honey
Konicoff, the marketing director for Phillips Seafood. The quality
of the crabcake is more important than where the crab came from,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips sells pasteurized crab meat to distributors at or above
the domestic market price, said Aden King, the company's sale
manager. Labor costs are cheaper in Asia, he conceded, so Phillips
foreign pickers can take more time to provide ``virtually
shell-free'' crab meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means a lot to restaurateurs'' who otherwise have to pay
their own kitchen workers to check for shells, said Mark Sneed,
president of Phillips. The company has also expanded by emphasizing
``value-added products'' such as prepared crabcakes rather than
plain crab meat.
</P>
<P>
   Sneed said the seafood market has ``changed dramatically'' in
recent years but domestic crab meat processors ``haven't changed
how they do business.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, domestic crab meat processors have a different view
of the situation. Their pickers are guaranteed the minimum wage,
but most make considerably more because they're paid about $2.25
for every pound they pick. There are spot checks for shells, but
the expense of ``double picking'' would be prohibitive, said Norman
Dorrell, president of Warren Denton Seafood of Broomes Island, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't compete on labor costs,'' said Dorrell. Asians
are ``putting us out of business and I don't see any legal way to
stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   For temporary help, U.S. processors are asking the Clinton
administration to impose quotas or duties on imported crab meat to
give the domestic industry time to adjust to the foreign
competition. Similar relief was provided by the U.S. International
Trade Commission when American sheep ranchers were hard hit by lamb
imports from Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tariffs or quotas are only a short-term solution, but (such
measures) might buy time'' for imposing marketing standards and
launching an information. campaign to let consumers know when Asian
crab meat is sold, said Lipton, the marine economist.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers ``may or may not care, but at least they would know
that the crabcakes at a waterfront restaurant didn't come from
local crabs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asian crabs are significantly different from the blue crabs
caught in the Chesapeake Bay and along the Southern coast, said
Jack Brooks, who, along with his brothers, runs J.M. Clayton Co., a
Cambridge, Md., seafood business begun in 1890s by their
great-grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks and other domestic processors maintain that the American
blue crab meat tastes better than the Asian variety. They want
federal requirements so the products will be labeled with the
crab's country of origin. Temporary tariffs or quotas will give the
American crab industry time to differentiate their product, like
Florida has done with oranges or Vidalia, Ga., with onions, Brooks
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Barbara James prays every morning and picks the meat
from a crab every 20 seconds or so. Outside the seafood business,
she said, ``there are no jobs in this town.''

 &HT;    A school of their own
 &HT;    By Doug Cumming
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta is about to get its first girls school in
nearly 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when applications for all-girls' schools are rising in
other big cities, several Atlanta mothers have pulled together
$500,000 and influential friends to open the Atlanta Girls' School
next August at a still undetermined site.
</P>
<P>
   Next Tuesday night, the new day school will market itself
alongside seven exclusive girls' boarding schools at an
informational reception for parents interested in this newest form
of an old tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has not had a girls' school since 1952. But before that,
it had generations of girls learning apart from boys. There was
Girls High, a public school that went coed in 1947 when it became
Roosevelt High, and Washington Seminary, a private girls prep
school that closed in 1952 to become part of the new Westminster
Schools. Westminster had boys and girls on the same campus but
taught them separately until the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not new,'' Emily Ellison, an Atlanta novelist who is
board chairwoman for the Atlanta Girls' School, said of single-sex
education.
</P>
<P>
   However, an intense debate over the return of single-sex
education in the 1990s is new.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the trend cite a spate of research that came out
in the early 1990s claiming schools were not sensitive enough to
the distinct learning styles of girls, who were said to be more
cautious, analytical and perfectionist than boys, in general.
Separate research by Carol Gilligan at Harvard University,David and
Myra Sadker at American University and findings in a 1992 report,
``How Schools Shortchange Girls,'' pointed to evidence that girls
often lose confidence and falter academically as they enter middle
grades, partly because of the way teachers give more attention,
both positive and negative, to the aggressive behavior of boys.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees that this research supports a return to
single-sex classrooms. Some say it instead argues for more group
activities and student-centered learning, elements more likely to
be found in a progressive co-ed classroom than a typical girls
school with its traditional curriculum and pleated-skirt uniforms.
Cliff Adelman, a senior research analyst at the U.S. Department of
Education, has criticized the research that finds bias against
girls, arguing that if teachers pay more attention to boys it's
because they act up and have more academic problems. Now, Adelman
says, females have surpassed males or are rapidly closing the
academic gender gaps at all levels, from high school to medical
school.
</P>
<P>
   The improved outlook for girls and declining achievement for
male students in some areas is acknowledged in an update of the
``Shortchange'' report, called ``Gender Gaps: Where Schools Still
Fail Our Children,'' published last year. The American Association
of University Women, which sponsored both reports, also released a
report in 1998, to the chagrin of girls' school supporters,
challenging the assumption that single-sex education is better than
coeducation.
</P>
<P>
   At least one private school in Atlanta has separated boys and
girls in a few classes for at least six years because of the early
1990s research. At the Walker School in Marietta, math in grades
six through eight and some science in grades five and seven have
been offered to single-sex classes, as schedules allow, said middle
school Principal Nancy Calhoun. One result, she said, is a dramatic
increase in the percentage of girls opting for advanced math
courses in high school, such as calculus. The rate of girls taking
such electives at Walker School has risen from 30 percent to 50
percent, she said. Nationally, it's about 17 percent for boys and
girls.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Orrell, head of Walker's middle school math department,
who initiated the single-sex classes, said a lot of girls who at
the beginning of the year said they wouldn't consider a women's
college, after going through the girls-only math class, became open
to the idea of applying to Agnes Scott or other women's colleges.
Orrell hasn't studied the results of her single-sex classes
scientifically, but cites individual cases. One girl who had been
relatively quiet in class, when Orrell ran into her later in a
higher grade, told her, ``When those boys roll their eyes, I just
keep right on asking the question,'' Orrell said.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the eighth grade, she said, ``many will say,
`Oh, next year we're going to have boys in our math class _
yuck.'''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the Atlanta Girls School began with several mothers
who were not happy with their educational choices. Ellison, whose
only child, Elli, was at a high-performing public elementary school
in Buckhead, was troubled by the high-pressure environment she saw
children growing up in. She found it ironic that baby boom parents
wanted to get off the fast-track for the sake of their children,
but ``we're putting our children on a fast-track like nothing we
were on.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she read Mary Pipher's popular book, ``Reviving Ophelia:
Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls,'' about the emotional
difficulties of coming-of-age for American girls. Now, she says,
her home office that was once filled with literary fiction is now
filled with research on education and gender.
</P>
<P>
   The more she read, the more she worried that the pressures on
children _ from media images of style and peer competition _ become
excruciating for girls as they enter adolescence in the company of
too many boy-girl considerations. What she read about girls'
schools seemed to offer an answer.
</P>
<P>
   She and other mothers thinking along the same lines found each
other, through the usual networking of plugged-in parents. Some of
these mothers, unlike Ellison, were themselves products of girls'
schools and were puzzled that Atlanta didn't have one. ``I am
convinced of the value of single-sex education,'' said Brooke
Weinmann, an alumna and trustee of a Virginia girls' boarding
school who worked with Ellison over the last two years on the
Atlanta Girls' School.
</P>
<P>
   The school will open in August with about 100 girls in grades
six to nine, adding grades and students each year until it reaches
12th grade and a maximum of 400 students. Tuition will be
comparable to that of other selective prep schools in Atlanta, with
scholarships anticipated to ensure that students from various
income levels enroll, Weinmann said.
</P>
<P>
   The founders are still looking for a site, but have found and
hired a head of school, Patricia E. Crone.
</P>
<P>
   Crone, the former head of two coeducational private schools in
California, helped found the Coachella Valley Ophelia Project in
southeast California, working with local high school girls using
the ideas in Pipher's book for ``saving the selves of adolescent
girls.'' She has been given free office space from the top-floor
law firm of King &AMP; Spalding, but says she will go anywhere to
interview prospective students.
</P>
<P>
   The first applicant, besides daughters of board members, met her
this week at a coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra Brosius, 13, was nervous and quiet. But instead of
passively answering questions, she asked Crone questions, and not
just about the Atlanta Girls' School. Alexandra asked the woman
four times her age about her own high school experience in Ohio.
And she asked her why girls' schools are better.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra is being home-schooled now, but at the progressive
Montessori-style private schools she attended before that, she said
she experienced the same problems that Crone mentioned from her own
experience, and from the research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several teachers. . .really seemed to favor the boys,''
Alexandra said. ``The boys would get called on more; they got to
do. More than once, I raised my hand as much as the boys, and still
didn't get called on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra left the coffee shop telling her mother that she was
very excited about going to the Atlanta Girls' School. Her only
worry, she said, is not having much of a chance to see boys.
</P>
<P>
   What about after school? ``I'm too busy,'' she said, with lesson
in horseback riding, violin and Irish dancing.

 &HT;    New book, new author, familiar old techniques
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's been quite a while since I've seen a woodworking
book so charming as a British reprint called ``David Charlesworth's
Furniture-Making Techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   It is published, of course, by Sterling in the United States.
Given the cumbersome title and the fact that all of the book came
from the pages of a British magazine called Furniture &AMP;
Cabinetmaking, I wasn't expecting much from it. I have never seen
this magazine, but I am familiar with another Guild of Master
Craftsmen Publication called Woodturning, which is more frustrating
than useful.
</P>
<P>
   But this $17.95 paperbound, printed in lovely color, is worth
every penny of its price.
</P>
<P>
   I'd never heard of David Charlesworth, which means nothing, but
I expect I'd like him since he seems to be fascinated by many of
the things that grab me. This is not another treatise on how to
prepare wood and turn it into furniture; it is a series of chapters
on how to prepare and use the kinds of tools he favors, and if you
work your way through it, you'll be able to handle most things.
</P>
<P>
   He starts with a nice discussion of his own shop and of
workbenches. Following that are chapters on how to properly set up
a marking knife, and then a couple of sections on Japanese chisels.
As you would expect, there are half a dozen sections on the
preparation and use of hand planes, including a very good chapter
on dealing with difficult grain.
</P>
<P>
   Then we have chapters on the two basic joints of woodworking,
the mortise and tenon and the dovetail, especially as produced on
the band saw, before going into some truly headache-producing
discussions of compound dovetails, tapered dovetail housings and,
finally, the hidden mitered dovetail.
</P>
<P>
   There are also chapters on making spokeshaves, and three
projects. The only project that is at all commonplace is a
wall-hung display case. It is built in the style of James Krenov,
with dowel joints, although its design is scarcely up to Krenov's.
I certainly admire Krenov's work, but I have no use for dowel
joints.
</P>
<P>
   I would guess that the other two projects are unique to the
literature. One is a little meditation stool made in the Japanese
style. Charlesworth clearly delights in every facet of Japanese
woodworking, and especially the use of extremely complicated joints
to produce extremely simple-looking, understated pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The final production is a Japanese inro box. This is a tiny box
with two compartments and a lid, all fitted together very
accurately and held in place by silk cord.
</P>
<P>
   As Charlesworth points out, something like this might be made
fairly easily on the lathe, but his project is nowhere near round;
it's oblong with curved corners. The project is unbelievably
complicated, but the planning and execution makes for fascinating
reading.
</P>
<P>
   There is a companion book for the turner, called ``Woodturning:
the Best from Woodturning Magazine,'' at $14.95. It's a handsome
production, and features a lot of fascinating work.

   EDITORIAL-IRS _ ATLANTA _ One robin doesn't make a spring, but
I've just been through an exchange with the IRS that has left me
astonished _ at the polite, professional and fair way the matter
was handled, from first contact through final resolution. If my
experience was at all typical, then the worm has turned, the
leopard has changed its spots, however you want to put it: The IRS
treated me like _ a customer! (Matthews, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ Who would have dreamed in
the days of one stoplight and Huie Nipper's vegetable lunches in
the old train station that Fayetteville someday would have three
Waffle Houses? If I lived there, I'd be proud. (Jim Minter is a
former editor of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED FOR
SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Last week, when I struggled for
a column topic, a friend tried to give me a hand up. ``Write about
Bruce, how you and Jim chased him around the Midwest,'' she
suggested. ``How we hang onto our youth through the music that we
grew up with.'' It was a good idea, but it isn't nostalgia that
keeps drawing me back to this band. It's not merely music to
reminisce by, but music to grow up with. And to remind us, should
we fall behind, of all the people standing by to lend a hand.
(McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Even as a military coup was raising the risk
Pakistan will restart its nuclear arms race with India, the Senate
was removing the United States as leader of the international
effort to contain nuclear weapons. GOP leadership saw a shot at
paying President Clinton back for besting it on issue after issue,
and took it. (Tom Teepen is national correspondent for Cox

   GLASS-COLUMN _ BERLIN _ In visiting Berlin, an eight-hour train
trip from Warsaw, grandfather would put up at the Hotel Adlon on
Unter den Linden near the Brandenburg Gate. Well before his
arrival, a butler would lay out his personal cache in cherrywood
cabinets that rested on limestone floors covered with oriental
carpets. The last time he stayed there was in 1933, shortly before
the Nazis marched through the Gate to proclaim by torchlight the
start of the 1,000-year Reich. Ten years later, they murdered him
and most of my family as Jews. (Andy Glass is a columnist for Cox
News Service in the Washington bureau.) MOVED THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY.

 &HT;    A recent run-in with the IRS proves surprisingly painless
 &HT;    (EDs: This is an editorial from Thursday's Atlanta Journal.)
 &HT;    By Richard Matthews
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If there was ever an oxymoron in the realm of the
federal government, one would surely think it must be this: a
``kinder, gentler'' Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what they promised us last year, when Congress got
hopping mad about a string of horror stories from taxpayers abused,
affronted, insulted and wronged by the government's tax collectors.
By near-unanimous votes, both chambers passed the Restructuring and
Reform Act, which required the IRS to be helpful, rather than
heavyhanded, with America's citizens.
</P>
<P>
   We all knew that was going to happen, right? Despite all the
smooth assurances, most of us thought the best we could hope was
that auditors would use softer blackjacks when they worked
taxpayers over in the back room. It's doubtful many people expected
any real changes, least of all a decent regard for people or a
presumption of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe we were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   One robin doesn't make a spring, but I've just been through an
exchange with the IRS that has left me astonished _ at the polite,
professional and fair way the matter was handled, from first
contact through final resolution. If my experience was at all
typical, then the worm has turned, the leopard has changed its
spots, however you want to put it: The IRS treated me like _ a
customer!
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a big issue. The payroll service firm for my wife's
office had wrongly reported a medical savings account as a
dependent child care account. Since we don't have any children, the
IRS said we owed a few hundred more dollars. We sent in
documentation to correct the error, and everything was fine.
</P>
<P>
   Of course I'm glad the issue was settled easily, but what's
truly interesting is the language used and the apparent
thoughtfulness throughout the process. The first letter didn't
harshly demand money; it said, ``We are proposing changes to your
1997 income tax return ....''
</P>
<P>
   It explained the discrepancy concisely, and described in detail
how we could challenge the ``proposal'' if we thought we were
right. We were given an 800 number and the name of a specific human
being to contact.
</P>
<P>
   After we sent in our explanation, we got another letter
acknowledging receipt, promising a response within 30 days, and
ending, ``We apologize for any inconvenience we may have caused
you, and thank you for your cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks later came the ``closing letter'' giving us
the all-clear: ``We are pleased to tell you that, with your help,
we were able to clear up the differences between your records and
your payer's records.''
</P>
<P>
   That may not be earth-shattering behavior in the private sector,
but it is a dramatic change from earlier IRS ways. As a manager, my
wife has had to deal with inquiries in the past, and she said they
were always abrupt and threatening, treating everyone as if they
were guilty from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Of course there are always going to be differences of opinion
between those who pay taxes and those who collect them, and not
everyone is going to win a challenge to an IRS audit. But if the
agency really has decided to be ``kinder and gentler,'' as my
recent go-round suggests, we may have to go out and find a new
optimum oxymoron for government business. Oh, that's one, isn't it?

   FLU _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Early indications suggest the flu season
will arrive sooner and hit harder this winter than in normal years.
On the bright side, though, doctors will be able to battle
influenza with a newly approved prescription drug. ``It's always
speculation as to whether the numbers are going to be high,'' says
Greg Rozelle, director of the personal health division for the
Combined Health District of Montgomery County, Ohio. ``But there's
a little bit of a difference in the vaccine this year. When the
strains change, more people tend to get sick.'' Public health
officials are predicting flu to strike four weeks earlier than
usual because of a strain that infected people on Alaskan cruise
ships the past two summers. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

   BIBLE-HOMOSEXUALITY _ Does the Bible say that homosexuality is a
sin? A slew of books _ scholarly and otherwise _ have been written
to support both sides of this issue. But the Rev. Samuel Kader's
book brings something new to the argument: The perspective of a man
who is both gay and a member of the clergy. In ``Openly Gay, Openly
Christian: How the Bible Really is Gay Friendly'' (Leyland
Publications, $15.95), Kader argues that scripture commonly cited
as proof that the Bible condemns homosexuality are misreadings, at
best, used by blatant homophobics or by people who have a sincere
intention to help homosexuals ``get right with God.'' (Dayton Daily

   PAPAL-AUDIENCE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The elderly man's face

there in that big, cream-colored chair surrounded by large men in
black cassocks and suits. Two newlyweds describe their audience

   LOVESTORY _ Harry Stillwell Edwards, poet, writer and columnist
for the Macon Telegraph and Atlanta Journal, was a
turn-of-the-century celebrity, lauded by the likes of Rudyard
Kipling and Teddy Roosevelt. After losing his wife in 1922, there
was one great romance in Edwards' last years, one that remained a
secret for half a century. During the summer of 1996 a trove of
letters from Edwards to a young poet named Rebecca Griffin turned
up in the attic of an Atlanta house. They detail a relationship
that would never be acknowledged: She was a teenager and he was in
his 70s. Yet the passion of the words fascinated the woman who
discovered them. Yet none of the official keepers of Edwards' flame
knew about the letters. His granddaughter wishes they'd been
burned. The sisters who found them would like to see them preserved
somehow. (Emerson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS.

   MOVIES-OMEGA _ When the Christian film industry makes an
evangelical film, it usually does pretty well _ with evangelical
Christians. But the
hit-them-over-the-head-with-Jesus-until-they-see-the-light-genre
hasn't worked as well with the vast swath of Americans who go to
the movies purely to be entertained. So when Stephan Blinn set out
to write the screenplay for the evangelical Christian thriller The
Omega Code, which opens today, he knew he had to walk a fine line
between secular storytelling and proselytizing. His hope is that
the action-adventure will hold together on its secular merits _ and
if it provokes some conversation about what's in the Bible, so much
the better. (Palm Beach Post). 20.

 &HT;    Concert renews the soul
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The old man and the old woman were in their 90s,
married 70 years. She had Alzheimer's; he was still full of verve.
And devotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I married a beauty,'' he said. ``And she's still the most
beautiful woman in the world.'' As he leaned over to kiss her, you
could see what he meant. You could envision the young woman he
married, and see the beauty still etched in her face.
</P>
<P>
   This scene from a decade ago came back to me, oddly enough, at a
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band concert in Chicago last
week. It was one of the closing numbers, when the band took turns
at the mike, a round robin of voices singing the verses to the
ballad ``If I Should Fall Behind.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd always thought of the song as a hymn to enduring love:
</P>
<P>
   ``We said we'd walk together, baby, come what may
</P>
<P>
   That come the twilight should we lose our way
</P>
<P>
   If as we're walking a hand should slip free
</P>
<P>
   I'll wait for you
</P>
<P>
   And if I should fall behind
</P>
<P>
   Wait for me.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd always thought the song was strictly about romantic love.
But it's part of the peculiar magic of a live performance that you
can see a song in a different light. Together again for the first
time in more than 10 years, this band sang the song in a way that
made you think about friendship. About all the times you fall
behind, and all the people who reach out a hand.
</P>
<P>
   They played it as an encore, side by side with a turbocharged
version of ``Born to Run.'' I smiled at the juxtaposition.
</P>
<P>
   When we are young, we sing about being born to run and born to
be wild and bad to the bone and born to be bad. We think about
charging forward, not falling behind.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not only in old age that we need a hand up.
</P>
<P>
   I thought of the friend in grade school who accepted me even
though I was afflicted with braces, nerdy glasses and excessive
piety.
</P>
<P>
   I thought of the high school religion teacher who didn't judge
my rebellion, but encouraged me to question.
</P>
<P>
   I thought of the friend who baked a lasagne and offered to
babysit when I was a new mother at the end of my rope.
</P>
<P>
   I thought of all the times I suffer a morning meltdown, and my
husband takes the punishment, bites his lip and packs the kid's
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   All those faces came before me as the familiar faces of the E
Street Band took turns at the mike. Patti Scialfa sang in her
strangely lyrical Minnie Mouse voice; Steve Van Zandt seemed moved,
even awed, to be back with this band, before these fans. The total
was greater than the sum of its parts _ the suggestion that,
through all the years and distance and difficulties, this band
would stand by each other, old friends:
</P>
<P>
   ``Should we lose each other in the shadow of the evening trees
</P>
<P>
   I'll wait for you
</P>
<P>
   And should I fall behind
</P>
<P>
   Wait for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when I struggled for a column topic, a friend tried,
for roughly the thousandth time, to give me a hand up. ``Write
about Bruce, how you and Jim chased him around the Midwest,'' she
suggested. ``How we hang onto our youth through the music that we
grew up with.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a good idea, but it isn't nostalgia that keeps drawing me
back to this band. It's not merely music to reminisce by, but music
to grow up with.
</P>
<P>
   And to remind us, should we fall behind, of all the people
standing by to lend a hand.
</P>
<P>
   Old friends.

a challenge for country folks, even when the town is something less
than Atlanta, or even Peachtree City.
</P>
<P>
   From where we live in south Fayette County, we have to go to
Fayetteville, the county seat, to shop for groceries when we need
more than a loaf of bread. I have to make the trip to mail a
package, to see a doctor, get a prescription filled or put my
Social Security check in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Things certainly have changed in my lifetime, and in lifetimes
much shorter. Not so long ago Fayetteville's first traffic light
was the talk of the town. About the time I was graduating from high
school, the entire county had fewer than 10 miles of paved roads.
Streets around the courthouse were dirt. Farmers came on Saturday
afternoons in wagons and buggies, hitching posts holding their
horses and mules while they shopped for the few necessities they
couldn't grow.
</P>
<P>
   Fayetteville wasn't much bigger than Moreland, which Lewis
Grizzard said needed only one post for the city limits sign. One
sign said ``entering,'' the other said ``leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Small as it was, Fayetteville made visiting country folks feel
nervous and out-of-place. This was mostly in our heads, but now
it's for real, almost like being in Atlanta or Peachtree City. You
hardly ever see anyone you know.
</P>
<P>
   On Fridays, traffic backs up almost into Clayton County. Time
spent circling a route to the laundry on one-way streets would have
gotten us to Jonesboro in the old days.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping centers hopscotching up Ga. 85 will soon be shaking
hands with Riverdale.
</P>
<P>
   Fayetteville has so many new shopping centers that developers
are running out of names. The newest is going to be called
``Uptown,'' which is appropriate since Custard Mize's grocery, K.W.
McElwaney's general merchandise and Ed Travis' hardware store are
long gone from ``downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   You have to stand in line, sometimes 10 to 15 minutes, at the
post office. That never happened when Stanley Morgan was
postmaster. Nobody ever had to wait on Stanley unless he was out on
the sidewalk tied up in a game of checkers, which come to think
about it, was most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Fayetteville folks had civic pride even when the town's lone
policeman also did the city's garbage collecting. According to
Ferrol Sams, the physician-author who has written more books than
many of his neighbors have read, this changed when a society-type
matron from Atlanta drove down in her Cadillac to call on one of
the town's more prominent families.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta visitor was indignant over being apprehended and
issued a speeding ticket by a gentleman dressed in dirty overalls
and driving a garbage truck. Her prominent hosts were embarrassed
and, according to Dr. Sams, succeeded at the next council meeting
in obtaining funds for a police cruiser and a proper officer's
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Despite snowballing growth in the last quarter of the 20th
century, give Fayetteville credit for preserving some of its
antiquities. No matter how much else resembles Buckhead and
Peachtree City, you still can't buy a mixed drink. Although you can
buy beer and wine at any number of grocery stores, or on any corner
where they sell gasoline and loaf bread, Fayetteville voters hold
the line on Demon Rum. Order a martini and the best you can hope
for is a baseball player from the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people complain about this, but personally I can't see
why. The ban on mixed drinks keeps the place kind of quaint, like
in the old days when everybody had to drive to the airport liquor
store to buy a bottle, and Mr. Bill Hightower, the garbage
collector, was very popular with the gossips because he counted
empties.
</P>
<P>
   During the last push to get mixed drinks on the ballot, one
fellow got into deep doo-doo when he complained that because city
restaurants can't serve mixed drinks he has to go to Atlanta to get
a decent meal.
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments slander barbecue and Brunswick stew served on
white bread. I don't live in Fayetteville, but it is our county
seat and I'm ready to stand up for it. Despite tricky one-way
streets and shopping center parking lots designed by Georgia Tech
dropouts, wonderful things have happened since I first went there
from the Woolsey school and got an introduction to indoor plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have dreamed in the days of one stoplight and Huie
Nipper's vegetable lunches in the old train station that
Fayetteville someday would have three Waffle Houses?
</P>
<P>
   If I lived there, I'd be proud.

 &HT;    Papal audience easy to get, hard ever to forget
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The elderly man's face was a little
swollen. From the medication, they said. And he looked tired, maybe
from all of his speaking engagements. But with his white vestments
and his rosy cheeks, he looked regal, too, sitting there in that
big, cream-colored chair surrounded by large men in black cassocks
and suits.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Knobbe felt as if he was outside his body looking down.
Watching himself walk on the red rug toward the man. He saw himself
dressed in the black tuxedo he bought for $10 at a thrift store.
His wife was next to him, elegant in her white wedding gown, a
string of pearls around her neck. The bright light from the hot
Mediterranean sun surrounded them. The word surreal came to mind.
</P>
<P>
   This was the last day of a 2 1/2-week honeymoon for the
newlyweds from Palm Beach Gardens. They had no idea they could
visit the Vatican until a friend told them a few months before they
left for Europe that it was open to the public if they made
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Knobbe had spent 30 years _ his lifetime _ in devotion to this
man he'd never met and never expected to. His parents and seven
brothers and sisters had built their lives around what he
represented. Now, here the man was, slightly stooped in his chair.
His right hand raised and slightly extended. Dan could see the
ring, it was gold, smudged red with lipstick. He reached forward.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Knobbe watched the back of her husband's head. The man in
the chair said something. His words were hard to understand. Don't
genuflect, she had been told, there wasn't time.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't think about her conversion to Catholicism the year
before. She didn't think about how her husband had asked her to
marry him in a basilica built to honor the divinity the man in
front of her represented. Or how she knew she would remember this
moment for the rest of her life.
</P>
<P>
   She just took the man's right hand and bent over, gracefully she
would say later, and held his fingers. His thumb pressed gently on
the back of her knuckles. His fingers were old, warm, wrinkled. On
the ring was a cross. The hand was part of a lineage that had
touched the son of God. She leaned closer. She placed her lips on
the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kissed the hand of the pope,'' she thought. Somewhere,
a camera clicked.
</P>
<P>
   Having an experience with the pope like the Knobbes did is
probably easier than you think.
</P>
<P>
   According to Deacon Patrick W. Kennedy of the North American
College in New Jersey, all you have to do is fax or mail a request
at least a month in advance to the visitor's office in Rome. If you
want to have your marriage blessed, note that on the request.
</P>
<P>
   Since the office is run by two people and receives about 50,000
requests a year, you will not receive a confirmation but you can
pick up your invitation the day before the audience at the office.
</P>
<P>
   All public audiences are on Wednesday, usually at 10 a.m.,
depending on the pontiff's schedule and his health. Tickets are
free and available to non-Catholics, too.
</P>
<P>
   Write to the United States Bishop's Office for U.S. Pilgrims,
Via del'Umilta, 30 00187 Rome, or fax your request to 011. 39. 06.
6900. 1823.

TROPICAL CROTONS CAN ADD FALL COLOR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: I would like advice on crotons. What should I do to
keep the plant healthy? Can I plant crotons in the ground?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Crotons (Codiaeum variegatum) are highly ornamental members
of the euphorbia family. These tropical plants have large,
leathery, thick leaves of multiple colors and shapes. Those with
reds and golds in nurseries now are particularly suitable for fall
color.
</P>
<P>
   But crotons are cold-tender and will die when exposed to
prolonged freezing temperatures, so if you grow them in beds,
either protect them or just use them as annuals and replace next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Many gardeners grow crotons in containers. As winter approaches,
they gradually move the plants indoors and keep them in bright
light. Keep the soil moist, but take caution not to overwater.
</P>
<P>
   Most crotons like sun; some prefer a break from hot rays during
summer. Plant in a sandy, organically enriched soil. These colorful
plants like water, but are drought-tolerant once established.
Fertilize as needed (monthly if they're in containers). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  I have a compost bin that sometimes produces plants I'm not
expecting. One came up in a flower bed when I spread the compost
there. It's about 4 feet tall now, growing somewhat like an
umbrella with the leaves spreading out at the top. Do you know what
it is?
</P>
<P>
   Also, can I expect my avocado to bear fruit? I've had it about
seven years in a large pot. Even after severe pruning this spring,
it's still taller than the house. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; I believe you have a papaya, Carica papaya. Papayas are
tall herbaceous plants with large divided leaves that resemble
those of philodendron. The foliage grows at the top of a
light-green trunk. The flowers are small and greenish; the green,
melon-shaped fruit appear in clusters close to the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Some papayas have male and female flowers on the same plant;
others bear male or female blooms only. These latter types
generally do not produce tasty fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Papayas can't take freezing weather. But gardeners can enjoy
these fast growers during warm months. They like sun, a
well-draining, organically enriched soil and water.
</P>
<P>
   Local gardeners sometimes report success growing fruit when they
plant seed from store-bought papayas.
</P>
<P>
   Papayas bear within a year after being planted from seed. The
fruit is usually harvested when yellow-orange, but green fruit can
be picked and cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Some gardeners here have harvested avocados, but it's not a
common thing. Even if yours never produces, you can enjoy an
attractive plant. Avocado trees must reach a good height _ some say
35 feet _ before they bear.
</P>
<P>
   Avocados are cold-tender and may be killed to the ground when
grown outdoors here. They then need a few years to regrow before
they bear.
</P>
<P>
   Since we have freezes, you'll want to protect the roots as best
you can. Avocados do best in a sunny, well-draining spot. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Our daughter has been growing ginger, and it has been
beautiful this summer. Will you identify the variety and tell us
the best time to transplant as well as when and how to prune?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  The ginger in the photo you sent is shell ginger (Alpinia
zerumbet). Gingers in this large genus are easy to grow, preferring
an organically enriched soil that drains well. Morning sun and
filtered afternoon sun are ideal. Alpinias like moisture and thrive
in humidity. The shell ginger produces highly fragrant, large
cascading clusters of flowers in late spring and summer when the
foliage is not frozen back in winter. Each bloom resembles a white
seashell edged in pink with a red and yellow lip.
</P>
<P>
   Shell gingers will die back during freezing weather, but the
broad, tapered foliage on canelike stems reappears each spring and
can easily reach 8 feet or more in height given several warm
months. The rhizomes spread, and each year you have a larger clump.
</P>
<P>
   Although shell gingers won't bloom following a winter with
freezing temperatures, the lush, new foliage that pops up in spring
makes an attractive accent or screen, if the clump is allowed to
expand.
</P>
<P>
   You can transplant in spring, summer or fall. Prune dead foliage
after a freeze. Prune stalks that have already flowered any time
you wish. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Mail garden questions to Kathy Huber, garden editor, Houston
Chronicle, P.O. Box 4260, Houston, Texas 77210. The bulk of mail
prevents individual replies to each unpublished letter.

WINDOWS 98 FEATURE COULD BE CAUSING PROBLEMS WITH SHUTTING DOWN
COMPUTER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Ever since I upgraded to Windows 98, I've had occasional
problems with shutting down my computer. I'll get to the screen
that says ``Windows is shutting down,'' and that's it. I don't see
``It is now safe to turn off your computer.'' What is causing this?
</P>
<P>
   A: There actually can be many causes for this _ it's one of the
more difficult Windows problems to troubleshoot. But the fact that
it began when you started using Windows 98 offers something of a
clue.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 has a feature called Fast Shutdown, which in theory
is a great idea. Rather than closing out each active driver and
program first, Windows just shuts down, period. This is supposed to
make the shutdown process less lengthy.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is that some software rejects this ``brute
force'' approach, and can cause a system to hang. Fortunately, you
can turn off Fast Shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Go to Start, then Programs, Accessories, System Tools. In that
folder, click on the System Information icon. This brings up the
SysInfo program, which is an excellent diagnostic tool (and by
itself is worth the cost of a Windows 98 upgrade). Click on the
Tools menu, then System Configuration Utility. Click on the
Advanced button, and check the ``Disable Fast Shutdown'' box. Click
OK and exit the utility and the SysInfo tool.
</P>
<P>
   If something else is causing your problem _ or if you still use
Windows 95 _ there are some other things you can try.
</P>
<P>
   First, make sure you have the latest drivers for your video and
sound card, your modem and, if you have one in your PC, your
network card. Next, get down to as lean-and-mean a system as you
can. In February, I did a pair of columns on the wisdom of running
with as few in-the-background programs as possible, particularly
virus checkers and programs that watch for and log software
installations.
</P>
<P>
   These kinds of programs can keep your system from shutting down
cleanly, as well as causing other problems. I advocate not using
them, but religiously and manually scanning any programs or Word
documents that come into your system for viruses. For the details,
see www.chron.com/content/chronicle/tech/99/02/12/compute.html and
www.chron.com/content/chronicle/tech/99/02/19/compute.html.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I had some trouble installing a 133-megahertz processor
upgrade. My computer is a Compaq Presario CDS 526, with a 486DX2/66
MHz processor, bought in April of 1994. I tried to install the new
chip, but when I turned my computer on, the LED lights and monitor
came on, but nothing happened. The screen remained blank. I put the
original processor back in _ still nothing. I called Compaq, and
they said it might be a damaged circuit board. Is it possible there
could be another problem, or will I end up having to spend more to
fix up my computer? I've spent almost $500 trying to upgrade it.
The processor was the first thing I tried to install.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your first mistake was in not calling Compaq before you
bought and installed that chip. Yes, it's very likely that you may
have fried your system board.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Compaq does not recommend installing processor
upgrades. And in many cases chips that are pin-compatible _ meaning
they'll fit in another chip's socket _ aren't compatible with the
motherboard. They may require a different voltage, or work at
speeds faster than the motherboard's capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   I'm surprised that you were willing to spend $500 on upgrade
components, when you could pay that for a new machine and get much
better performance than you would by upgrading an older one. As
inexpensive and as powerful as new systems are now, it's almost not
worth upgrading an older computer _ such as a 486 or a Pentium
system _ once you get past the $400 mark. You're better off getting
a new system.

PRIVATE COMPANIES STILL HAVE OPTIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ These days, when you're negotiating a compensation
package for a new job, a car doesn't cut it. Neither does a country
club membership.
</P>
<P>
   No, executives today want stock options because that's where the
real money is. In good years, when stock prices are strong,
executives can earn much more on their options than on their annual
salary and bonus.
</P>
<P>
   So how does a private company that doesn't have stock options to
offer compete in an environment like that? How can it attract good
managers and executives?
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to attract the best talent when you don't have
the ability to offer long-term wealth accumulation devices such as
stocks and options, said Bob Diers, senior compensation consultant
for William M. Mercer Inc. in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   To try to close at least some of the gap, some private companies
offer ``phantom stock'' to key employees. Phantom stock typically
is based on a variety of variables, such as profitability or
revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   While that helps, the value of the stock typically doesn't rise
as fast as that of a publicly traded issue. It's insulated from the
gyrations of the tempermental market, which has sent some
profitless dot-com companies soaring in value.
</P>
<P>
   And the phantom stock is also costly to a private company.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't cost a public company anything to issue options,
Diers said. The market essentially picks up the tab. But when a
private company offers phantom stock and options, the money comes
right off the bottom line. Consequently, the amount of stock isn't
as great as it might be if the company were public.
</P>
<P>
   Other private companies use a different kind of lure to attract
high-flying employees: the chance to get in on the ground floor of
a company that's poised to issue an initial public offering. Many
top business school graduates are spurning the traditional
consulting firms and are willing to take less of a salary for the
chance to work for a small start-up, in the hope of holding shares
in the next Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HIGHER PAY, BONUSES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To make up for the lack of options, private companies often pay
a higher base pay and bonus than what employees earn in publicly
held companies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a job typically paid $200,000 and the sign-on
bonus is $10,000 to $20,000, a private company could boost the
signing bonus to $300,000 to make up for the lack of options, said
Tom Wilson, managing director with the Stratford Group, an
executive recruiting firm in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But to ensure the employee stays around for a while, the company
would require the employee to sign a note promising to return all
or part of the money if he left before the end of three years.
Under a typical arrangement, one-third or $100,000 would be
forgiven each year.
</P>
<P>
   The asset manager of a privately owned family company in Houston
said he and his colleagues earn above-market salaries and bonuses
to make up for the lack of stock options.
</P>
<P>
   But the lack of options during a time when the market has done
so well weighs on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting older too and I have been thinking about long-term
compensation,'' said the manager, who asked not to be identified.
He said the next time he looks for a job, options will be at the
forefront of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
JOB CANDIDATES PASS BY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Ellisor, president of PolySpec, a private coatings and
sealants manufacturing company in Houston, said there is no
question that he misses some attractive job candidates because he
can't offer stock options like a publicly traded company can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business is not very sexy, either,'' said Ellisor. ``We're
a manufacturing business and we don't have dot-com behind our
name.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ellisor does have a weapon at his disposal. To the few
employees he has given stock to, there is the chance they can do
well if the company is sold and the buyer pays a premium for the
shares.
</P>
<P>
   And Ellisor said he has been able to hire top executives who
were at a point in their lives that they weren't interested in
money because they've already made money on options.
</P>
<P>
   Discounting those special exceptions, do private companies
overall end up with less-than-stellar employees?
</P>
<P>
   They do if they don't come up with innovative compensation,
Wilson said. An enlightened, creative company would try to attract
the best people possible.

&HT;        DOES THE BOY FROM INDIANA HAVE A SHOT?
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Tania Anderson  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Oct. 15 -- Vice President Al Gore and Indiana Sen.
Evan Bayh have a lot in common.
</P>
<P>
   Both are sons of the heartland. Both are sons of senators. Both
present clean-cut, All American images. Born eight years apart,
they both spent part of their formative years in the nation's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Are both destined for higher office? Gore's aspirations are well
known. He wants to be president. But what about Bayh? Does
Indiana's junior senator want to be vice president? Ever since Bayh
was put on a list on potential running mates, Indiana Democrats
have been quietly rooting for the popular former Hoosier governor
as the best man for the second most important job in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It's not certain how the 43-year-old's name started circulating
as a potential vice president or how much interest there is in Bayh
from the Gore campaign. It started after Bayh delivered the keynote
speech at the Democratic National Convention in August 1996. But
Gore has never pubically talked about Bayh as a running mate and he
probably won't make any announcements until the next party
convention in August 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But was it a coincidence this week when both Gore and Bayh spoke
at the Democratic Leadership Council's annual meeting?
</P>
<P>
   Bayh refuses to talk about the issue. At one point his office
was saying that he was flattered by the possibility, but now his
staffers don't even want to touch the issue. Bayh's press secretary
emphatically refuses the many requests she gets from reporters who
want to discuss the possibility that Bayh has a shot at the
``veep'' seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not participate in an article like that. It's not
something we're thinking about right now,'' said Mary Meagher, as
her boss took the podium at the Democratic Leadership conference
here in Washington last week. ``He's concentrating on being the
senator from Indiana.''
</P>
<P>
   But Indiana democrats say Gore would be smart to choose Bayh for
a running mate. The reasons: he's young and attractive, and he
would bring in midwestern votes to balance out Gore's southern
support and he has gained respect from his colleagues in the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a very quiet efficient style. He's not a showboat and
he's able to quietly build bridges,'' said Shaw Friedman, general
counsel for the Indiana Democratic Party. ``Frankly, it's a style
that has served him very well and it's logical that someone of that
stature would be considered.''
</P>
<P>
   Several colleagues have lauded him in particular for
introduction of his ``fathers legislation,'' which would promote
programs that help dads take a bigger role in their children's
life.
</P>
<P>
   Plus he has political roots in Washington. His father, the
former Sen. Birch Bayh ran and lost the presidency in 1976 and lost
his senate seat to former Vice President Dan Quayle in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   At 33, Bayh became the first Democratic governor in Indiana in
20 years. At the time, he was also the country's youngest governor.
He won the top job again in 1993 by the largest margin in the
state's history. Bayh, a lawyer by training, then re-claimed his
father's seat in the U.S. Senate in 1998 by 63 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The father of two appeared in People magazine's 50 Most
Beautiful People earlier this year. He is one of the few
politicians to get on the annual list traditionally shared by
actors, musicians and models.
</P>
<P>
   But some say the Indiana image created by former Vice President
Dan Quayle will hurt Bayh's chances in the race. Quayle dropped out
of the presidential race last month for financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``His only downside is the baggage of Dan Quayle,'' said Michael
Aylesworth, chairman of the Republican party in Porter County. ``He
could be associated with that image.''
</P>
<P>
   And some Washington observers say Gore would do better by
choosing a running mate who will add some excitement to his ``stiff
as a board'' personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Gore) wants to do something dramatic he should go after a
woman,'' said Susan Tolchin, a public policy professor at George
Mason University in Fairfax, Va. ``Especially with the gender gap,
it would be very smart for him to go to (California Sens.) Diane
Feinstein or Barbara Boxer.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course Hoosiers want their guy in the veep seat. Even
Indiana Republicans wouldn't mind seeing Bayh make it to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I'd like to see George Bush but if fate has it, well
it's always nice to have a home guy in there,'' Aylesworth said.

 &HT;    RUSSIAN PRIME MINISTER FACES OPPORTUNITIES, DANGERS WITH LATEST
CHECHEN WAR
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ So far, war has been a healthy thing for the political
life of the man President Boris Yeltsin says should succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   Few Russians had ever heard of Vladimir Putin or bothered to
form an opinion of him when Yeltsin in August named the former spy
and security chief to be prime minister and his presidential
heir-apparent.
</P>
<P>
   But today, as Putin sternly directs the war against the breakway
republic of Chechnya, the no-nonsense, 47-year-old former KGB agent
has seen his popularity soar in public opinion polls. Putin has
been active and visible, waging war in the south and handling
affairs in Moscow as the unpopular Yeltsin, dogged by illness, has
been in the hospital and seclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe the renewed Chechnya war was designed as a
``Wag the Dog''-style effort to raise the poll numbers and
visibility of Putin, and eclipse ongoing scandals alleging
Kremlin-linked corruption and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   It is a momentous season in Russia; the nation will hold
parliamentary elections in December and the vote to replace Yeltsin
is scheduled for next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in 1994, there was the need for a small victorious war as
elections approached,'' political analyst Nikolai Petrov said,
referring to the first war in Chechnya from 1994-96. That war ended
with a humiliating Russian retreat and a negotiated settlement,
after which Chechnya proclaimed independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it's election time again. This small war may also provide
for establishing a semi-police regime, to prevent the power from
falling into hands that the Kremlin sees as wrong,'' said Petrov of
the Carnegie Center in Moscow, a think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Just two months ago only about 2 percent of Russians recognized
Putin's name, and now his approval rating in one poll stands at 70
percent. Another poll on people's preferences for president put
Putin in a close third place behind two political veterans --
front-runner former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, and Communist
Party chief Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
   That could change as Russian forces move deeper into Chechnya
and confront determined guerrilla fighters in the capital, Grozny,
where most Russian losses came in the last war.
</P>
<P>
   Just as quickly and easily as Putin has ascended, analysts say,
he could fall.
</P>
<P>
   In a commentary Friday headlined: ``Putin on a tightrope,'' the
daily Komsomolskaya Pravda said: ``People seem to love Vladimir
Putin more every day ... In fact, he need only take one step to
become a full-fledged candidate for president. But this is not an
easy step to take. It is called victory in Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin projects something Russians haven't seen much of in recent
years _ coherent leadership from the Kremlin. He is Russia's point
man against terrorism, in the wake of a string of
apartment-building bombings that killed nearly 300 in Moscow and
other cities in September.
</P>
<P>
   Those bombings, as yet unsolved but widely blamed on Islamic
militants from Chechnya, prompted Russia to begin an air war
against the southern republic last month. The bombings have also
been responsible for much of the public support for the
re-invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Russia announced Friday that it was moving into a new phase of
its ground war, begun Oct. 1. Russian forces will delve deeper into
the southern territory in their effort to crush militant
separatists.
</P>
<P>
   If the re-invasion of Chechnya was calculated for political
purposes _ akin to the 1998 film ``Wag the Dog,'' in which a
fictitious U.S. president declares war to save his re-election bid
from scandal _ it is an immensely risky strategy in a region where
Moscow has failed before.
</P>
<P>
   Russian newspapers have dubbed Putin the ``military premier''
for his tough talk and conspicuous support of the country's defense
establishment, itself a formidable player in vying for the
Kremlin's influence. Putin supported another $1 billion for the
military budget, even though Russia's government is cash-strapped
and the economy is struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Russia's military has moved cautiously in Chechnya,
directing a largely unchallenged air campaign and moving troops
into Chechnya's northern border region _ a relatively unpopulated
area.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy has resulted in widespread civilian casualties in
Chechnya, but has kept Russian troop losses low.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1994-96 war, at least 30,000 people are believed to have
died, most of them civilians and green Russian conscripts thrown
into the fighting. The war became highly unpopular in Russia and is
widely viewed as the most glaring mistake of Yeltsin's eight-year
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apart from the understandable worry about sparing people's
lives, the premier cannot but consider his political rating, which
will inevitably fall if 'Load 200' arrives from Chechnya,''
commentator Alexander Goltz said in Itogi magazine. Russia's
version of body bags are metal coffins known in military parlance
as ``Cargo Number 200.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the war, analysts also question Putin's staying power
because he is so new to the political scene and without an
established following. In August, Putin was something of a national
joke, coming from virtually nowhere as Yeltsin's fifth prime
minister in just 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin-backed candidates are not expected to do well in
December's parliamentary elections, leading to widespread
speculation that the ever-capricious Yeltsin could fire Putin early
next year, or be forced to by a new opposition parliament. The
Kremlin inner circle is reportedly already drawing up a list of
several new possibilities for prime minister, including Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, it is the war that will determine Putin's fate.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister has about a month to bring the war in
Chechnya to a successful conclusion, said analyst Vasily Golubev.
Otherwise, he added, ``society's discontent with this fruitless
'struggle against terrorism' will grow. In such a situation it is
useless to expect a continuation of the growth of the prime
minister's rating.''

DRUGGIES TAKING TOLL ON DEMOCRACY

   Commentary

 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It was the limp that attracted John Burke's
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of middle-aged guys, Burke owns tender, delicate
knees. He watched the woman limp awkwardly into the restroom at the
bus station, and he felt sorry for her.
</P>
<P>
   When she came out, she wasn't limping any more. That's when John
Burke's sympathy gave way to curiosity. Narcotics cops tend to be
nosy people. And Inspector John Burke is the head narc in the
Albany County sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was a mule. She had drugs stashed beneath her skirt.
She'd been limping into the restroom because the package was coming
loose. After a search, she ended up as another drug bust. That
happens to somebody in this country every 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   As you read this, nearly 2 million Americans are behind bars.
Four in five of them either violated drug or alcohol laws, were
wasted at the time of their arrest, stole something for drug money
or have histories of drug abuse and/or alcohol addiction.
</P>
<P>
   We Americans are the most conspicuously stoned population in the
industrialized world. This society has a drug problem because it
has a demand problem, an apparently insatiable appetite for
intoxication that lands roughly one American in 150 in the slammer
at any given moment.
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Department of Corrections estimates that at
least three in four of its 71,000 inmates could benefit from drug
treatment. Every year, it runs about 37 percent of the population
through such programs. Since the average inmate does 30 months, the
state figures it pretty much exposes each inmate to treatment, but
the recidivism rate for drug-related crime remains enormous.
</P>
<P>
   That's because some people can't stay away from the stuff, and
some just don't want to, not even after 30 months in the can. Also,
there's huge money in the drug trade, and towering sums of money
are spent fighting it. John J. DiIulio, Jr., a criminologist of
serious repute at the University of Pennsylvania, frets that it now
costs so much money to imprison drug offenders that policing itself
is at risk.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't a good week to snort nose candy on State Street in
Albany. That's because about 800 narcs were at the Crowne Plaza
hotel for the first meeting of the International Narcotic
Enforcement Officers Association. The hotel was crawling with
federal narcs, state narcs and local narcs. Burke was the official
host. All these narcs spent the week studying techniques to more
effectively nail druggies.
</P>
<P>
   The drug trade pros are increasingly shrewd. The other day, a
crew-cut guy named Sgt. Mike Lewis of the Maryland State Police ran
a seminar on interdiction, on spotting mules on the highway and
locating their stashes in their vehicles. Experienced dealers and
mules aren't in Beemers or Mercedes any more, he was saying. But
keep your eyes peeled for more modest vehicles with tinted windows.
Mules still don't like people seeing what goes on inside their
cars.
</P>
<P>
   When the New York Legislature convenes in January, modifications
in the ferocious Rockefeller drug laws probably will be on the
table again. In recent years, the cost of imprisoning so many
druggies has become a political issue. We Americans now have more
people in the slammer than any other democracy, mainly because of
drugs. That's troubling stuff in a free society.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem, though, is demand. We live in a drug and
booze-soaked culture where use and even abuse is not only tolerated
socially but increasingly accepted. Slowly, that attitude is
bankrupting us.
</P>
<P>
   And in more ways than one.

BEFORE `DUTCH,' ANOTHER IMAGINARY REAGAN 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The scene is a fictional re-creation of the
Warner Brothers second-class commissary at lunchtime on March 7,
1938. The author puts some words in the mouth of a young actor
named Dutch Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spaghetti here is the cat's pajamas,'' he says. ``Hey, you
fellows mind if I join you?''
</P>
<P>
   No, the future president is not sitting down with a fictional
character named Morris. Reagan is having lunch with a fictional new
friend named Gabriel Prince, who was invented as a Reagan companion
by the author Peter Delacorte for his time-travel novel, ``Time on
My Hands,'' in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That was two years before biographer Edmund Morris announced
that he had cast a fabricated version of himself in Reagan's life
for ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I were in Toronto when the news broke about
Morris' book,'' Delacorte said. ``She said, `He's stolen your
book.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I feel empathy for Morris. It's so easy to write
fiction about Reagan because he seems like a fictional character.''
</P>
<P>
   In Delacorte's book, the mission of Reagan's imaginary companion
isn't to explain Reagan, as in Morris' book. This companion is sent
back in time to keep Reagan from becoming president, so no one will
have to explain him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, left-wing physicist Jasper Hudnut finds a time machine
and sends travel writer Gabriel Prince back to prewar Hollywood to
perform an errand. Hudnut is a Reagan-hater who wants to keep the
actor from trickling up to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel doesn't have anything against Reagan or his presidency,
and just thinks of him as ``a daffy old king of America.'' Still,
he agrees to go back and abort the Reagan presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel's plan is deceptively difficult: Turning Reagan into an
A-movie star who'll stay in movies, stay liberal and stay married
to Jane Wyman.
</P>
<P>
   No, he doesn't want to kill Reagan, but Reagan does take an
ill-fated right turn out to sea during a night swim. Time travel
can undo accidents like that. Can it undo a career in B movies?
</P>
<P>
   What a notion _ keep a guy out of the White House by giving him
the career he really wants. If someone went back in time and made
Bill Clinton a rock star, think of how many things would be
different. Well, not much.
</P>
<P>
   As you can see, ``Time on My Hands'' (now out in paperback by
Pocket Books) is a comic novel, one that toys with time, not
credibility, the way Morris' book does.
</P>
<P>
   Morris has said he used the device of an invented character to
get past a bad case of writer's block in writing about Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, it was Reagan who got me out of my writer's
block,'' Delacorte said. He needed some empty object, a
``McGuffin'' like Hitchcock's Maltese Falcon, for his time traveler
to seek.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan is the perfect empty object.
</P>
<P>
   Delacorte's book, like Morris' book, does have its touching
parts, including Gabriel's relationship to young Dutch, his
infatuation with prewar Hollywood and his love for a young Warner's
starlet named Lorna.
</P>
<P>
   When Gabriel finally explains to Lorna that he's from the future
on a mission to keep Reagan out of the White House, she has a line
that shows how far we've come since the days of President Franklin
Delano Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems so ... absurd,'' she says. ``I mean, the idea that a
Hollywood actor could become president. And it's not as if it's
someone like Fredric March, or Spencer Tracy _ someone you could
imagine being president.''
</P>
<P>
   Or Warren Beatty, if you reset the balky ball-bearing settings
on that French-made time machine a bit forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to evaluate Reagan's policies, I'd fall closer to
Hudnut than Gabriel,'' Delacorte said. ``I think he represented a
politics that existed before he came on the scene, but he widened
the gulf between rich and poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Morris, Delacorte didn't collect everything Reagan ever
did in his hometown of Dixon, Ill., or every thought Reagan didn't
have. He talked to a couple of old-timers who knew Reagan in the
'40s and read Garry Wills' book.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't really written a political book anyway. Rather, it's
an entertaining addition to the H.G. Wells time travel tradition,
with intriguing allusions to what life would have been like with
two terms of Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Just for starters, Jerry Brown moved up to Education secretary
and led a worldwide disarmament conference.
</P>
<P>
   Readers will be glad to know that Delacorte's fictional
character takes less than half as many pages to stalk Reagan as
Morris' fictional character.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan is America's great Rohrschach for writers. Think of the
ink spilled by Morris, Delacorte, speech writer Peggy Noonan and
hundreds of columnists. It's amazing how much writing has been
expended on a man with so little to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I haven't read the book,'' said Delacorte, when asked
about Morris' book. He sounded like a man condemned to spending 900
pages with Ronald Reagan and another writer's invented character.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have to, though. His character was hanging around
with Dutch first and never saw this guy named Morris.

HILLARY CLINTON BLASTS WHITE HOUSE POLICY ON HEALTH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARA JAKES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOLTON LANDING, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton told New York's
largest health care association what it wanted to hear Thursday,
criticizing her husband's White House administration for enacting a
federal budget-reduction bill that cut millions of dollars in aid
to the state's hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady and prospective U.S. Senate candidate also lashed
out at Congress for approving the cuts, which were stipulated in
the 1997 Balanced Budget Act (BBA). Congress, Mrs. Clinton said,
should not leave Washington this year until some of the $115
billion cut from health programs is restored.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1997 law, New York hospitals will take a $4.7 billion
hit in federal funding over a five-year period, mostly in Medicare
reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cuts went too far,'' Mrs. Clinton told about 400 members
of the Healthcare Association of New York State at their annual
meeting in Bolton Landing. ``They have caused far too much pain and
are cutting too much muscle and bone. ... The administration should
take whatever steps the BBA allows it to remedy the situation. And
the Congress must not recess until it has addressed the problem as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her statewide tour and fledgling Senate campaign,
Mrs. Clinton has repeatedly turned away from policies advocated by
President Clinton that would alienate New Yorkers in next year's
election.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the health association have long been outspoken
critics of the Clinton administration's health care policies. The
group has ripped a White House plan that would restore $7.5 billion
to Medicare cuts over 10 years instead of taking up a proposal
backed by the Republican-led Senate that would restore about $15
billion. Moreover, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
is currently seeking paybacks of $1 billion from 130 New York
hospitals claiming that the federal government had previously
overfunded Medicare reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton promised to try to ease the Medicare ``squeeze''
but was not specific on how she would do so. That was enough,
however, for Dan Sisto, president of the Healthcare Association of
New York State. ``In order to treat a problem, you have to diagnose
it correctly,'' Sisto said after Mrs. Clinton's half-hour speech.
``And she clearly gave the right diagnosis.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in the audience were unconvinced. ``She didn't really say
anything that was going to happen,'' said Diane Osika, chief
executive officer of the Tri-County Memorial Hospital in Gowanda.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton ``said what needs to be done, and I suppose that's
good, but everybody talks about it _ what are you going to do about
it?'' Osika said.
</P>
<P>
   The event in front of the health association _ and again later
for the state's Nurses Association in Lake Placid _ marked one of
Mrs. Clinton's first major policy speeches on the hustings. She
still has not said for sure if she would run for the seat being
vacated by retiring Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the first lady is ever edging toward a full-fledged run,
and has scheduled meetings with labor leaders and Democratic
officials around the state throughout the weekend and into next
week. She also avoided a potential pitfall Thursday when the White
House announced the Clintons have refinanced a $1.3 million house
loan through a Pittsburgh bank instead of through Democratic
fund-raiser Terry McAuliffe.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the Clintons chose to refinance the loan for the
Westchester County house through PNC Mortgage of America, campaign
spokesman Howard Wolfson said: ``I gather it was the best deal for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady was criticized for accepting the house loan from
McAuliffe.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's likely Republican opponent, New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, also has not said whether he would run for the Senate.
But while Giuliani has not ``in so many words'' actually confided
his candidacy, ``I have every reason to believe he is and will be
running for the Senate and I would hope he wins,'' Gov. George
Pataki, a Republican, said Thursday. ``If he does, he will be a
great senator for New York.''

WHAT BEGINS WITH AN `S' AND ENDS WITH A `T'? ASK CBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, now it's hit the fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago Hope'' broke new television ground with Thursday
night's program, not with a striking story line or its major cast
changes or new gore, but with four little letters. I'll spot you
the ``s'' and the ``h,'' but that's it.
</P>
<P>
   It happens.
</P>
<P>
   Just not on network television. At least until now.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of the show _ the omnipresent David E. Kelley,
Michael Pressman and Henry Bromell _ successfully lobbied to have
the s-word included in the script. The historic profanity was said
by Dr. Jake McNeil (Mark Harmon) as he talked to lawyers after a
botched operation. ``S--- happens,'' McNeil said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The producers felt strongly the line was important for
artistic truthfulness,'' CBS spokesman Chris Ender said Thursday.
``It's not a statement, it's not a sign, it's not a symbol of
things to come.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a word, a word many of us hear if not say every day. It's
only in the bizarre fantasy world of network television where the
majority of people say ``golly,'' ``shoot'' and ``dang-gummit.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Stern was vowing Thursday morning to start using the
s-word on the air if ``Chicago Hope'' can get away with it. He also
notes that many rock songs played on the radio are full of curses.
Howard is no longer the most shocking, and he also has a point:
What is the difference?
</P>
<P>
   Another question: If the word is ``artistically truthful'' in
this instance, certainly it is applicable in context in other
instances. So how can the network say this is a one-time-only deal?
</P>
<P>
   Harmon's curse is not the first time profanity has been uttered
on television: Cable is replete with unbleeped bleeps. And anyone
watching a sports broadcast, especially one employing a sideline or
courtside microphone, does not have to be a world-class lip reader
to make out the curses of athletes.
</P>
<P>
   But never before has a network ventured this far into the
dirty-word territory in an entertainment show. And if you had been
taking bets which network would have been the first to do so, you
probably would have gotten 500-to-1 odds on CBS (as opposed to
1-to-5 on Fox and even money on UPN).
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say there has been considerable debate about it,''
Ender said. ``We see it as an isolated incident. This does signal
the change in standard at CBS. This won't happen on a weekly
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, CBS was also the network to break a language
barrier earlier this decade. In 1990, the short-lived ``Uncle
Buck,'' a comedy based on the John Candy movie, made history in the
first of its few moments on the air when a young girl said ``you
suck.''
</P>
<P>
   And there have been numerous other shows, most notably ``NYPD
Blue'' on ABC, that have taken the concept of permissible language
and nudity on a network to the extreme. At least to what was
thought was the extreme. But Ender acknowledges the obvious: There
is an acute double standard between cable and the networks
regarding content, one that allows cable to go further in terms of
language, violence and nudity than over-the-air networks, which are
governed by the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   And as the networks lose viewers, and more people at home don't
make the distinction between cable and broadcast networks _ they
are all just channels coming through the box _ it's clear it's not
a fair fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a little bit of a double standard,'' Ender said.
``The press showers praise on `The Sopranos,' `Sex and the City'
and `South Park' (all cable shows) for pushing the envelope, but if
the network does this we get burned at the stake.''
</P>
<P>
   So should that double standard be eradicated? Should all walls
be taken down? ``I don't want to go there,'' Ender said.
</P>
<P>
   The networks are losing viewers to cable, the Internet and
elsewhere. And even staid CBS appears willing to test any and all
boundaries to try to get them back.
</P>
<P>
   It happens.

NOTEBOOK BUYERS GET TO DIFFERENTIATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the beginning, most notebook computers looked alike. They all
looked like, well, notebooks. That's changing.
</P>
<P>
   Different users want different things. Some want as little
weight and size as possible, and are willing to sacrifice some
capabilities. Others don't care about heft, preferring something
that can functionally replace a desktop PC. And still others just
want something that looks cool.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at two very different machines that serve the far
ends of the notebook spectrum, showing just how wide a range there
is in portable PC design.
</P>
<P>
   _ iBook, $1,599, Apple Computer: If style and the Macintosh OS
is at the top of your consideration list when shopping for a
portable computer, then this is your obvious choice. Apple has
crafted a slick notebook version of its popular iMac consumer line.
However, iBook is not as good a portable as the iMac is a desktop.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the iBook has a gotta-have-it design. With its
rounded corners, translucent white-and-blue or white-and-orange
plastic, your choice _ it's an eye-catcher. It also has a nice
feel: The colored portion is rubberized, and the white part has a
slightly textured feel.
</P>
<P>
   It's fairly heavy and bulky
</P>
<P>
   Opening the case, you'll find a wide expanse of plastic
surrounding both the 12.1-inch active matrix screen and the
keyboard. In fact, it almost seems like wasted space that could
have been put to better use.
</P>
<P>
   For example, while the letter and number keys are full-sized,
the function and cursor keys are about a third the size of standard
keys. The cursor keys also are jammed up against the right shift
key, so that it's too easy to hit the up-cursor key when trying to
hit the shift. This is a common design flaw in a lot of notebook
keyboards and Apple, with its design savvy, should know better.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard has an excellent, springy feel. The pointing device
is a touch pad that's nicely responsive, though as with all Apple
products, it has only one click button. Bummer.
</P>
<P>
   The screen has a gorgeous look to it, though it's limited to
800-by-600 pixels of resolution. This doesn't bother me, but
apparently some Apple loyalists are disturbed that it's not capable
of 1,024-by-768.
</P>
<P>
   The iBook comes with a 300-megahertz PowerPC G3 chip, a
3.2-gigabyte hard drive, a 24X CD-ROM drive, a 56K fax modem and
just 32 megabytes of memory. Unfortunately, the portable is not
available with more memory at retail or from Apple's Web site.
You'll have to buy it from a third party and either have it
installed or do it yourself. And you'll want that extra memory _
the iBook in its standard configuration suffers from sluggishness
if you have more than one application running at a time. If you buy
one, spend the extra bucks to bump it up to at least 64 MB.
</P>
<P>
   The iBook comes with a single Universal Serial Bus port for
connecting peripherals _ owners of older devices will either have
to find adapters or get new printers, scanners, etc. _ and an
Ethernet port capable of connecting to a network at speeds of up to
100 megabits a second.
</P>
<P>
   The iBook also is capable of doing wireless networking at speeds
up to 11 megabits a second using a base station called an AirPort
and a card that installs in a slot in the lid. However, Apple
didn't have one available for me to test.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, I like the iBook, but Apple needs to tweak the design
and make adding memory easier. You may want to wait for iBook 2.0.
</P>
<P>
   _ Armada M300, $1,999, Compaq Computer Corp.: While its
competitors explored, expanded and developed the ``ultra-portable''
notebook category, Compaq has stayed on the sidelines, watching and
waiting. Its designers saw what worked in an ultra-portable, and
more importantly, what didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that Compaq's first entry into this market is
essentially a second-generation model. The business-oriented Armada
M300 (and its consumer twin, the Presario 305) avoids the mistakes
made in designs from other companies. As a result, it's the best
ultraportable I've seen this year.
</P>
<P>
   The M300 I tried came with a 333-MHz Intel Celeron processor; 64
MB of memory; a 4-GB hard drive; an 11.3-inch active-matrix screen;
a single PC card slot; and a 56K fax modem. It comes with an
external floppy drive and a full set of ports on the back, which is
a plus. Many ultraportables require you to have an external port
adapter to connect serial or parallel devices or external monitors.
</P>
<P>
   At just under an inch thick, the case is not as thin as some
other models in this category, but it feels a lot sturdier. It
weighs in at 3.3 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard, while slightly undersized, is excellent. Compaq
pulls the cursor keys down a bit from the shift key, so you're less
apt to hit them by mistake. There's even room for a wrist-rest. The
touchpad is quite responsive and very customizable.
</P>
<P>
   The 11.3-inch screen is bigger than most ultraportables, which
usually have 10-inch screens, and has a bright, crisp look. It's
capable of resolutions of up to 800-by-600.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq has attached the battery as a cylinder on the back of the
computer, which can be pulled down to angle the keyboard. It's a
small battery, though, and the best I could do with it was just
over two hours of power.
</P>
<P>
   The $1,999 base price does not include a multimedia base that
snaps on the bottom of the M300, giving it CD-ROM ($349) or DVD-ROM
($499) capabilities. The base also adds an additional PC card slot
and a place for another battery.
</P>
<P>
   The main difference between the M300 and the Presario 305 is
that the latter comes with programmable buttons for launching
software or surfing the Web. It also comes with the CD-ROM version
of the multimedia base, and sells for $2,199.

NOTWITHSTANDING `DIE HARD,' PROOF THAT BRUCE WILLIS CAN ACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attention, all ye who loathe Bruce Willis; all ye who mock, nay,
spit upon his career; all ye who curse the wretched earth from
which he rudely sprang; all ye who loathe, condemn, execrate,
spindle, fold and mutilate the celluloid upon which his films are
based; all ye who wince (alas!) at the ``Die Hard'' movies and
shrink (alack!) at the thought of ``Moonlighting.'' Get over it.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to make amends. It's time to give the guy a break.
It's time to look old Bruce in the eye _ which, by the way, has not
been squinting lately _ and smile back at that close-lipped little
half-grin that's annoyed you for the last 14 years, seven months
and 12 days.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to admit to him, yourself and the waiting world that
Bruce Willis Is A Really Good Actor. A Really, Really Good Actor.
In fact, Bruce Willis is such a Really Good Actor that his newest
movie will (are you ready for this?) make you forget
``Armageddon''!
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, Bruce made some progress in this regard earlier
this year, playing the grim, good-hearted shrink to Haley Joel
Osment's haunted kid in ``The Sixth Sense.'' But if that film
showed what Willis can do with understatement, this one _ a
touching, funny charmer called ``The Story of Us'' _ gives us an
actor so blithely gifted that it's hard to imagine anyone else in
the part. Willis has called this the best work he's ever done, and
he may be right. He's superb.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Rob Reiner (``The American President,'' ``Ghosts of
Mississippi''), ``The Story of Us'' concerns the marital woes of
one Ben Jordan (Willis) and his wife, Katie (Michelle Pfeiffer).
Ben and Katie have been hitched for 15 years, a union that produced
two charming children and one SUV, but lately they've been
teetering on the edge of divorce. Katie wishes Ben were more of a
responsible grown-up, while Ben wishes Katie were still that
fun-loving gal who donned a pith helmet with a twirling siren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just sick and tired of having to be the designated driver
of this marriage!'' screams she. ``Is it all my fault you turned
into your $&AMP;!! mother?'' howls he.
</P>
<P>
   Ben and Katie yell a lot, but they also flash back to happier
times _ to babies, laughter, tooth fairies, George Bush, sex _ and
go out to dinner with amusing friends. Among them are Paul Reiser
(``the Ten Commandments were probably easier to stick to when you
dropped dead at 35''), Rita Wilson (who helpfully, and hilariously,
explains why women won't have sex while angry) and Reiner himself
(whose dissertation on truth and derrieres yields unexpected
results).
</P>
<P>
   All of them are having way too much fun for woebegone
pessimists, but who cares. ``The Story of Us'' is breezy about
everything; even its hardest, blackest,
this-marriage-is-a-hopeless-pit-of-gloom moments are leavened by
Reiner's unfailingly light touch.
</P>
<P>
   The film's most extraordinary scene _ better than anything he's
done in the last 10 years _ is a bitter bedroom sequence in which
Katie and Ben are joined by their parents. Not their actual
parents, mind you, but the psychic busybodies who crowd the
marriage bed of any bickering couple: in this case, Tom Poston,
Betty White, Red Buttons and Jayne Meadows. The scene is quippy and
painful, bizarre and defiantly honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Story of Us'' was written (and co-produced, along with
Reiner) by Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson, who wrote the
screenplays for ``Dragnet'' and ``Stepmom,'' respectively, and here
prove that redemption is always possible. Despite a pat ending,
it's a smart script _ smart in a breathless, cram-it-in kind of
way, like a vast game of Hollywood speed chess. So many words
tumble so humorously out of so many mouths that sometimes, the
sheer verbal heft of it becomes oppressive; it cries out for the
rewind button.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Reiner's cast rises to the occasion, yielding the sort of
comic-orgasmic crescendos that Meg Ryan made famous in ``When Harry
Met Sally.'' Pfeiffer is brittle and vulnerable and translucent as
usual, and her chemistry with Willis is both believable and tart.
Perhaps it's believable because it's tart _ most marriages, even
the good ones, aren't a perfect fit.
</P>
<P>
   Although it would be simple to attribute Willis' performance to
parallels with his own failed marriage, there's more to it than
that. He seems liberated, sprung free; there's a looseness in his
joints that wasn't there before. ``I've always been big on happy
endings,'' he says, professing optimism. And you know, we believe
him.

`ELECTRIC' LIVE SHOW IS TRIO'S PASSION 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world of pop radio can be baffling and unpredictable. Just
ask the New York-based trio Luscious Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the group _ lead singer Jill Cunniff, guitarist Gabby
Glaser and drummer Kate Schellenbach (keyboardist Vivian Trimble
left last year to pursue other musical ventures) _ hovered just
under the mainstream radar. The band won critical praise and a
small circle of devoted fans with its debut EP, 1992's ``In Search
of Manny,'' and its first full-length album, 1994's ``Natural
Ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   It was all taken up a notch with 1996's ``Fever In Fever Out.''
The trick? ``Naked Eye,'' an impossibly catchy single that was a
groovy break from the more somber tone of the album. The single
went Top 40 and earned ``Fever In Fever Out'' a gold record for
selling 500,000 copies. More fans, relentless touring and a
well-received Gap Christmas commercial soon followed.
</P>
<P>
   The stage seemed set for ``Electric Honey,'' the group's third
and best album, to make an even bigger splash when it was released
during the summer. It boasts good dance beats, energetic charm and
impressive guests, including Emmylou Harris and Debbie Harry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we definitely agreed that we wanted to do something a
little bit more upbeat than `Fever In Fever Out,''' Schellenbach
said from her home in New York. ``Not to say that was a suicide
record, but it definitely had a dark side, and we kinda were
exploring a lighter side on this album.''
</P>
<P>
   Throw in ``Ladyfingers,'' a killer first single, and you have a
flawless pop dessert destined for the upper echelons of Billboard's
charts, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Ladyfingers'' is still being pushed to radio
stations, and ``Electric Honey'' has continued to sell modestly
(thanks to the group's constant touring), Luscious Jackson's hip
quotient seems to have cooled a bit, at least on radio.
Schellenbach wonders why.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty funny,'' Schellenbach said of today's music.
``Obviously, it's not allowing a whole lot of room for us on the
radio at this point. There's a lot of pop _ super-duper, kinda
mindless pop. There's a lot of hard rock-rap. We're so perplexed by
radio and MTV and all that stuff. We really do all the work that we
think it takes. We put on a good show; we do a good album; we do
all the interviews. It's kinda out of our hands at this point what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of focusing on what's not being accomplished, however,
Luscious Jackson continues to focus on its original goals and the
residual rewards earned from the success of ``Naked Eye,''
including a spot on last summer's Lilith Fair tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never really had illusions _ or delusions _ of being rich
and famous,'' Schellenbach said. ``That's never been our goal. It's
more like making records, having access to recording and
performing.''
</P>
<P>
   Schellenbach had one of her personal dreams realized when she
was invited to play drums for pop icon Blondie. Members Harry and
Chris Stein were impressed with Schellenbach's playing when they
saw her at a Blondie tribute in New York. A month later,
Schellenbach was called in when Blondie drummer Clem Burke couldn't
make a show.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an absolute dream come true. They were my first band
that I was obsessed with as, like, a 13-year-old. I mean really,''
Schellenbach said. ``They were like, `We know you know the songs.'
The most thrilling part about it was actually the rehearsal.
Playing these songs and having Debbie Harry singing and dancing in
front of me. When we played, it was like a blur.''
</P>
<P>
   Collaboration has always been an integral part of the Luscious
Jackson experience. Schellenbach played drums for the Beastie Boys
in the early '80s, and Luscious Jackson was the first group signed
to the Beasties' Grand Royal label in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Schellenbach and her drums turned up on two
tracks on the Indigo Girls' new album, ``Come On Now Social,'' and
Cunniff co-wrote a song with Harris for her ``Western Wall''
project with Linda Ronstadt.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the things that we have accomplished, actually, have
been connections to other musicians that we've really respected and
been able to collaborate with,'' Schellenbach said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for us, being asked to do Lilith Fair, was like an
affirmation of how far we've come as a band. Being able to chat and
jam with Sheryl Crow _ it's really cool. That means more to us, I
think, than having our faces on the cover of a magazine. It keeps
you on your toes. If you end up playing the same songs every night
with the same band, you're not really challenging yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The group was faced with a hurdle in April 1998, when Trimble
left to tackle other projects, including a solo album, a
collaboration with Jon Spencer Blues Explosion drummer Russell
Simins and a band (with Breeders member Josephine Wiggs) called the
Dusty Trails.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had been coming for a while,'' Schellenbach said of the
split. ``As friends, you don't wanna force your friends to do
things that make them unhappy. We knew that we could regroup
without her. She just really didn't wanna spend that kind of time
away from home, and she wanted to really work on her music. It's
really cool. We're still close; we're still friends; we still
collaborate.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Luscious Jackson is focusing on its live show, which
the trio aims to improve with each tour. They also give much of the
credit to fans for an always-unpredictable outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We maintain that we have one of the best audiences around _
the most diverse, the most energetic _ and fun-loving, good-looking
and stylish and good dancers. It really makes a difference,''
Schellenbach said. ``One of our missions is really bringing people
together and proving that people don't just listen to Korn. They
respect us; they respect each other.''
</P>
<P>
   With that confidence, who needs a Backstreet-size radio hit,
anyway? Certainly not these ladies.

LASER SURGERY COMPANY CUTS PRICES TO COMPETE WITH CANADIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ LCA Vision Center is cutting the price of its
laser eye surgery in California and Maryland in response to growing
competition from cheaper Canadian providers.
</P>
<P>
   The popular surgery to correct nearsightedness costs about
$5,000 for both eyes. The same operation in Montreal costs $1,600.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wilson, the president of LCA, acknowledged that stiff
competition by Canadian companies is cutting into business at the
Cincinnati-based company, the third largest provider of laser eye
surgery in North America.
</P>
<P>
   LCA operates 21 clinics in the United States and Canada. LCA
provides LASIK, the most popular type of laser eye surgery.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Americans are going to clinics in Canada is the
exchange rate. For every U.S. dollar, a visitor to Canada gets
$1.48.
</P>
<P>
   Another is a pricing structure in the United States that adds to
the expense, including payments to referring optometrists, higher
surgeon salaries and a $260 premium that physicians must pay to the
laser manufacturer every time they use the machine.
</P>
<P>
   LCA has already taken some steps to lower its price to deal with
its two main North American competitors based in Canada: TLC in
Toronto and Lasik Vision Corp. in Vancouver, British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   In Toronto, where Lasik Vision Corp. charges a total of $1,600
for both eyes, LCA offers a price of about $2,025, less than half
of what it charges in the United States. The company has also given
its Toronto surgeons the flexibility to lower the price further in
individual negotiations with patients.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, however, the company has created a new
discount subsidiary, called LasikPlus. At two new locations in
Maryland and four in California, the company is charging $2,995 in
hopes of attracting more customers, especially from TLC, its
largest competitor in those markets.
</P>
<P>
   LCA has claimed it can perform the surgery at that price because
it is employing its own physicians. In almost all its other
centers, LCA provides only the facilities and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said it was too soon to determine whether those same
prices could be applied at other centers.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Henderson, the president of Lasik Vision Corp., said
such a dual pricing system only reinforces that many American
consumers are being overcharged. ``I do think it's strange that a
company markets its product at two different prices,'' he said from
his Vancouver office.
</P>
<P>
   Lasik Vision also is trying to bring lower prices to the United
States by opening its first U.S. clinic in Bellevue, Wash. The
company has yet to get federal approval to operate its laser there
and has so far used the office to take care of pre- and
post-operative visits for its Vancouver clinic, located just over
the border.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Canadian surgeons have more experience with laser
eye surgery than their U.S. counterparts because they have been
doing it longer. The procedure was approved in Canada several years
earlier than the United States.

   HOMECOMING-DESEGREGATION _ COWETA COUNTY, Ga. _ Decades after

East Coweta's homecoming queen. For 30 years, ever since the black
and white school systems merged, East Coweta has been electing two

   GIRLS-SCHOOLS _ ATLANTA _ Research suggesting that boys and

California and Michigan, 27 private girls schools have sprung up in

   GEORGIA-WINES _ TELAVI, Republic of Georgia _ The last man in
this former Soviet republic who knows how to handcraft a wooden
barrel is suddenly in demand. This green vale in the shadow of the
Caucasus Mountains was the Napa Valley of the Tsars. Georgian wines
were prized for their flavor and clarity. And then came the Soviet
industrial revolution. The Soviet's built mass-production plants in
the '50s with gigantic steel vats that reduced Georgian wines to
the mediocre. Now, hoping to revive their winemaking skills and
appeal to lucrative Western markets, Georgian winemakers are going
back to the future. They want to store their wines once again in
oak barrels. That's where Rubiko Batiashivili comes in. He learned
the craft as a teenager half a century ago, and now he's finally
putting the skill to work. (Holmes, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTO.

many new chapters in their 3,000-year history. Efforts are being
made to stop the encroachment of mankind that has cut up panda
territory and divided the panda population, making genetic
in-breeding a potentially deadly problem. And now the Chinese are
laying the groundwork for the precarious possibility of
reintroducing to the wild pandas born in captivity.

antibodies against the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to be a national problem, not just New York
State,'' said Claire Pospisil, a spokeswoman for the state Health
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The problems appear to lie with both the distributors of the
vaccine and the Food and Drug Administration, which must approve
every batch of vaccine manufactured before it can be released to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't canceled any clinics yet,'' said Denise Ayers, the
director of the Rensselaer County Health Department, ``but if they
don't release it, we might have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from both the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta and the state Health Department have
contacted the FDA in hopes of expediting the release, Pospisil
said. County health departments usually get all of their vaccine
before fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, state health officials hope to make up the
shortfall with their own limited supply of vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have provided Clinton County with vaccine and we may be
able to provide other counties with enough vaccine until they get
their shipments,'' Pospisil said. ``They have to request it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albany County Health Department is awaiting some 2,000 doses
of vaccine to help it finish out its schedule of clinics. The
county is so far managing to meet the demand with its current
stockpile of 5,000 doses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Eva Graziano, the immunization action plan coordinator,
is anxious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called today and they said anytime,'' she said. Graziano
said she'd only be reassured when ``it's in my refrigerator.''

 &HT;    TOP TEACHERS SEEK BIGGER SAY IN EDUCATION REFORMS
 &HT;    550&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Top teachers from across the country vowed at the
seventh annual National Teachers Forum here to increase their
influence on the reforms that are transforming education in most
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are redefining what it means to be a teacher in 1999,''
Mary Beth Blegen, teacher in residence at the U.S. Department of
Education, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could continue to sit back and see ourselves as victims of
teacher-bashing or as worker bees at the bottom of a hierarchy,''
Blegen said. ``But most of us choose to say we understand kids and
teaching and learning, and we want to raise our voice beyond the
classroom and teach others in our schools and districts, and even
at the state level, what's realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   About 120 top-notch teachers _ including all 50 state teachers
of the year, many state finalists and 10 from private schools _
spent three days at the department and in a hotel in nearby
Alexandria, Va., discussing how to reshape details of the school
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of them said many of their students had been
helped by higher academic standards and tests to assess progress,
but many said the reforms designed by governors, legislators,
businesses and universities need adjustments to work in today's
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Ivie, who teaches 28 fourth graders in Aurora, Colo.,
said her state's legislators don't realize that today's teachers
can't handle classes as large as those in the days when she and
they were in school.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, she said, their teachers could concentrate on getting
average students through school, while the top one-third excelled
on their own and the lower one-third could still find a job if they
failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, when all children are expected to succeed, it's like
doing an individual learning plan for each child,'' she said.
``I've never had the luxury of teaching less than 25 children, yet
I must assess every single child's understanding and learning and
constantly make adjustments during the day in order to take each
kid up to the highest level.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A real sore spot'' in Texas is that the governor and state
education officials ``desperately need teacher advisers,'' said
Miriam Lancaster, who teaches six English classes at Pine Tree High
School in Longview. ``It could save money and it could save them
from going down the wrong avenues.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, ``conflict resolution'' programs designed
to get children to avoid violence by talking about their
differences face to face ``no longer work with a lot of street
kids, because they see it as weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers are only three of the 64 members of the commission
formed by Gov. Roy Barnes to recommend education reforms in
Georgia, said middle school teacher Ernie Blankenship of
Loganville, Ga. ``It's a voice, but it's a small one, considering
that this is our lifelong profession,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some teachers want to work on local reforms as simple as
exchanging tips with teachers in classrooms across the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Alaska, when we have a young sled dog, ...we put them in
harness with a calm, experienced, dedicated sled dog,'' said Daniel
Walker, who teaches at a combined middle and high school in
Anchorage. ``We can no longer put new teachers in the classroom,
wish them luck, and close the door.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, ``all our classrooms are wired, but a lot of teachers
aren't sure how to use technology effectively in the classroom,''
said Maureen Judy, an elementary school teacher in Maumee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my technology director to give me a few more computers
than normal, so that anybody could walk into my classroom and see
how we use it in the curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   Before she can spread her techniques to other schools and
districts, research must be funded to find out whether her approach
is better than others, Judy said. ``Without a research base,
teachers won't even listen to you,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, where standardized tests were used this year to rate
schools on a scale from ``A'' to ``F,'' Ruby Zickafoose, who
teaches at a B-rated elementary school in Manatee County, would
like to find a way to channel more support to nearby schools with
lower ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel this has really caused a lot of bad morale,''
Zickafoose said. ``Teachers who know they are doing everything they
can are walking around with their chins down and this scarlet
letter 'D' on their chest.''
</P>
<P>
   She worries that signs on their school lawns, displaying
messages like ``100 Days Until the Test,'' show that solid courses
are being crowded out by hoopla and constant test-preparation
drills.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, which has had high-stakes tests for three
years, teachers still debate whether to emphasize pre-test drills
or ``authentic assessment and hands-on learning,'' said Marshall
Matson, whose language arts and social studies classes for seventh
graders in Tarboro, N.C., resumed after a two-and-a-half week gap
caused by floods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weird thing is, nobody's systematically collecting the
data to see which method works best,'' Matson said. ``I bet we'd
find it's a combination of the two, but right now nobody knows.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers at this week's forum carefully avoided endorsing
any nationwide, cookie-cutter approach for all districts and
states.
</P>
<P>
   Montana, ``beautiful and broke,'' lacks the money to
``adequately fund education,'' so teachers at that state's forum
next spring will will skip educational theory and discuss ways in
which ``our economy must be turned around,'' said Dan Adcock, who
teaches at an elementary school in Missoula.
</P>
<P>
   Two South Carolina teachers said they hope to improve academic
performance by pushing for ``access by all children to health
care.''
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, described by high school teacher Joseph Bacewicz
of Tollano as ``one of the nation's wealthiest states, with three
of its poorest cities,'' he and other teachers are starting a
``Read Aloud'' program in a primary school in a poor neighborhood.
They hope that even functionally illiterate parents would come to
school once a week to hear their children take turns reading
stories aloud.

SWEEP AWAY THE MESS TO UNCOVER YOUR TRUE SELF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GAILE ROBINSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you toss all your old magazines, catalogs and newspapers,
pick up your clothes, clean all your closets and attend to all your
stacks of paperwork, Michelle Passoff swears you will find
enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   Passoff, author of ``Lighten Up, Free Yourself From Clutter''
(Harper Perennial, $13 softcover), is here to bring order,
fulfillment and self realization, if you'll only clean up your
life. She maintains that we hang on to memories and they slowly
suffocate our dreams: ``Clutter cleaning is a way to discover who
you really are.''
</P>
<P>
   Passoff has a theory about cleaning that borders on the
metaphysical.
</P>
<P>
   After almost a decade of helping people organize and eliminate
their stuff, she has witnessed the positive effects of clutter
removal. Productivity, effectiveness, creativity, vitality and
peace of mind come with excising the extraneous.
</P>
<P>
   Say ``Hallelujah.''
</P>
<P>
   Passoff administers to people who are handicapped physically and
mentally by their clutter. Too often, she says, these people are
building monuments to their past that impede their progress. Their
insistence on hanging on to every scrap of paper and every article
of clothing can literally trap them in their physical surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   There is a difference between mess and clutter, Passoff
cautions. A mess is when you try on everything in your closet and
leave it in rejected puddles on the bedroom floor.
</P>
<P>
   Clutter is everything from your closet from the past 10 years
plus all the paperwork needed for your 1997 taxes spread over the
bedroom floor. It is so overwhelming you think nothing of dropping
a layer of 1998 tax receipts on the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later,'' that's your mantra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clothes keepers, makeup hoarders, paper stackers are all the
same,'' says Passoff. By the time they come to her, they are
usually at a critical mass. ``One time it was the collapse of a
coat rack. The husband threatened to divorce his wife if she didn't
do something about her collection of stuff.'' Another client came
to Passoff when her bedroom floor became a solid field of laundry
baskets stuffed with cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   Passoff says the prompting situation could be a threat, the loss
of a job, the coming of a child. The clutterers seek internal
peace, but are burdened with excuses that are the road bumps on the
path to their self-realization.
</P>
<P>
   Passoff says not being organized is the excuse many people use
to keep them from realizing their dreams. They don't entertain
because they are embarrassed by their surroundings. They don't move
because they can't imagine the organizational nightmare it would
take.
</P>
<P>
   Passoff says: ``My focus is not on being neat and tidy. It's
having a life you love, having one that you participate in fully.
And that can happen if your dreams are out there in the world, if
they are tangible and not a figment of the imagination.'' They
cannot be out there if they are buried under a layer of trash.
</P>
<P>
   Her process for change begins with a large vision accomplished
by small organizational steps. Clutter removal requires clipping
and filing, hanging and tossing. For example:
</P>
<P>
   She quickly reallocates the contents of the kitchen junk drawer
_ the fast-food fliers are filed with paperwork in a file cabinet,
under ``food'' with ``recipes.'' Tools and screws are placed in the
tool chest with the other household hardware. Pens, pencils, rubber
bands and the like are relegated to the desk organizer. In almost
an instant, Passoff has freed a kitchen drawer and nothing was
thrown away, it was reorganized.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes time to toss, Passoff suggests that every item be
given at least 20 seconds of consideration. A brief, but expedient
mourning period. Ask yourself, ``Is this something that is of
benefit to me and what I want?'' If it is a nagging guilt brick,
attend to it, now. Answer that letter, write that thank-you note.
File that receipt, pay that bill. Now move on.
</P>
<P>
   The only clothes in your closet should be ones you will wear
this season. Every piece should be in good repair and clean.
Out-of-season clothes, the ones that fit and are in good repair,
should be stored. Anything that is too small, torn, stained or
hasn't been worn in the past two years should be in a trash bag on
its way to the trash, recycling shop or charity bin.
</P>
<P>
   Passoff is cruel. ``Everything that is important must have a
specific place. If it doesn't have a specific place, it's trash.''
She says to make a place to process the incoming paperwork, one
with a wastebasket and file cabinet nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three quarters of the piles of papers on desk and table tops
are things that have yet to be tossed. They are trash,'' she says
with the conviction of someone who lives in a tiny Manhattan
apartment yet still has room in her closets.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   INFO BOX
</P>
<P>
   Clutter removal requires clipping and filing and hanging and
tossing. Passoff has a thorough system. It's in her book, ``Lighten
Up! Free Yourself From Clutter,'' and will be the topic of her
three-hour chalk talk at FunEd Learning Center, 7 p.m. Thursday
night in Dallas, 13608 Midway Road. Tickets are $32, plus a $6
registration fee if you have never been to a Fun/Ed program before.
To make reservations or register, call (972) 960-2666. For more
information visit Passoff's Web site, www.freefromclutter.com.

HANDY TOOL SWEEPS ICONS OFF DESKTOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: So, here's your chance to show your readers
what an idiot I am. Those kind people at Microsoft were nice enough
to put Network Neighborhood, Inbox and My Briefcase icons on my
desktop. I only use my computer for fun and want to take them off
my desktop but not delete the programs. Can it be done?
</P>
<P>
   _ Desktop Dumbbell
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DD: I'm hurt. Kindly ol' Doc Bombay would never think of
humiliating a reader. Well, not unless you did something really
stupid. This time, it's the doofuses at Microsoft who are to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they thought that everyone would love having all those
mystery icons taking up desktop space. Network Neighborhood shows
up if you use any sort of networking tool, even though you're not
on a network. Inbox is part of Windows Messaging, which handles
network and Internet e-mail. Briefcase is some bright guy's idea
that assumes you're actually organized enough to keep data files on
your laptop synchronized with what's on your other computer. If you
have one, that is. I'd bet most normal users could dump all three.
</P>
<P>
   Well, you could just dump them in the Recycle Bin, but if you
someday have an inexplicable need to use one of them, you'll be out
of luck. There's a tool that lets you ``hide'' them, though, but
you're going to have to do some legwork to find it.
</P>
<P>
   It's called TweakUI, and it's one of the handiest tools you can
have for taming Windows. It hides those icons, fine-tunes the user
interface and clears the browser history so your wife won't find
out you've been visiting the Anna Nicole Smith home page again.
Naturally, Microsoft has stopped making it easily available. Some
people think that's because Microsoft doesn't want to support what
is essentially freeware cobbled together by software engineers
whose ideas got left out of the original Windows interface. I think
Microsoft just wants to show us who's boss.
</P>
<P>
   If you have the second edition of Win98, which is what you find
on almost all new PCs, you'll have to find somebody with an old
Windows 98 CD. Look in the Tools folder, then Reskit, then
Powertoy. Please follow the instructions in the folder. If you
cannot do that, you shouldn't be messing with any settings. You
should probably put the newspaper down, too, before you get a paper
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, you can still find the Win95 version on Microsoft's
Web site (www.microsoft.com/windows95//j downloads). Of course,
Microsoft doesn't officially support that one either. Look,
Microsoft, we don't care if you support the thing or not. Just put
it where we can find it, because it happens to be the handiest
thing to come out of the Pacific Northwest since wood.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: My horror story with America Online: My
31-year-old son passed away unexpectedly. After the funeral, we
moved everything out of his apartment before the end of the month _
turning off the utilities and etc. I called to cancel all credit
cards. When I called to cancel AOL, I was told there was ``no way''
I could cancel the service without sending a death certificate.
Since there was no credit card or phone anymore, I told them where
they could stick their service. I was so very upset that I threw
the phone across the room.
</P>
<P>
   _ Another Dissatisfied Customer
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DISS: And I used to think the people at Microsoft were the
bad guys. A lot of readers have said the only sure way to dump AOL
_ if it won't stop billing you after cancellation _ is to tell your
credit card company to stop paying it. That, or you can wait on
infinity hold for a service rep until you're ready for a death
certificate, and even that's no guarantee AOL will stop.

THERE'S ONLY ONE PARENT WHO ALWAYS GETS IT RIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We all like to think we're good at parenting.
</P>
<P>
   I know I do. But there's nothing like disciplining your child to
make you second-guess yourself. It's times like those when I wish I
were Solomon or even God. For example, let me share a talk I had
recently with my youngest daughter, Asha.
</P>
<P>
   Asha is 8, and like most little girls her age doesn't take well
to being told no, as in, ``No, you can't spend the night at
Lindsey's,'' or ``No, I can't afford to buy you a baby grand,'' or
``No, I can't leave work to take you shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   You get the picture?
</P>
<P>
   If saying ``no'' seems to come easily and frequently for me, you
haven't heard Asha's sweet, pitiful plea on my voice mail. ``Mama,
this is your baby, Asha. Call me back, I have to ask you something.
I know you're going to say no, but call me back. I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a moment like this when you understand what your parents
meant when they said, ``This will hurt me more than it will you.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying ``no'' is sometimes like having food go down the wrong
way.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, no amount of explaining will do for Asha.
Inevitably, she folds her arms, pushes her lips out as far as they
can go and storms off. If we're home, she goes to her room and
slams the door. If we're in the car or a store, her lips swell and
her eyelids open and close until the tears flow.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could cry on cue like that.
</P>
<P>
   I've scolded Asha about her behavior a million times. She
apologizes and responds exactly the same way the next time the word
``no'' forces itself into our conversation.
</P>
<P>
   One day recently, she called me again at work and asked for
Pokemon cards. I told her ``no.'' Determined to nip this little
problem in the bud, I told her that I don't like the way she
responds when she doesn't get what she wants. I told her that maybe
if she can change her behavior by the end of the week, we can buy
Pokemon cards, even though I'm having trouble pronouncing Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   I feel bittersweet but I think this might work because Asha
hasn't slammed the phone down, hasn't run to her room or acted cold
toward me.
</P>
<P>
   In the most pitiful voice I've ever heard, she said: ``That's
how God made me and I really can't help it. I told (God), I'll try
to be a better girl about my attitude and my temper. But Mama, my
blood pressure gets so built up and I get sooo mad!''
</P>
<P>
   It took everything in me to keep from laughing. I was about to
burst, but there was such sincerity in Asha's voice, I couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing I could say was, ``Well, let's see how you do the
rest of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   After hanging up the phone, I couldn't help but wonder whether I
did the right thing. I reminded myself of all the times I've
excused my behavior with, ``God made me that way,'' but also
reminded myself that God disciplines me anyway. And I remain
punished until I get it right.
</P>
<P>
   I told myself that God is omniscient and perfect in his judgment
and that I'm not, that maybe I didn't handle this the right way. By
week's end, the tally against Asha had mounted. I couldn't buy her
the Pokemon cards.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks have passed, and I notice her struggling to
respond in the right way. We're in the middle of something and she
asks, ``Mama, do you think my attitude is getting better?''
</P>
<P>
   I tell her yes. I notice she's trying.
</P>
<P>
   I hope God's noticing that I am, too.
</P>

MOVIE BRINGS NO SMILES TO THE REAL HAPPY, TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAPPY, Texas _ Loraine McDonald could barely believe it when she
opened a letter from her daughter and there was a copy of an
article found on the Internet about the new movie ``Happy, Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald left the Happy post office that day and walked up the
red-brick streets of this Texas Panhandle town, past the vacant
buildings on Main Street to the little white building with the
handmade ``City Hall'' sign. The city worker got the copy machine
humming and then set out to distribute the article that the
650-or-so residents of Happy would consider mostly bad news.
</P>
<P>
   She brought copies to the gas station, bank and two grain
elevators, and then she stopped, because there really isn't
anywhere else to go in Happy. There are five churches and two
schools, but McDonald was not going to bring a review of the
slapstick PG-13 rated film to houses of worship and education.
</P>
<P>
   The Miramax film ``Happy, Texas'' opened this week and residents
of the real Happy, Texas, aren't happy about it at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to embarrass us,'' McDonald says.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of folks in Happy say they won't go see the film, not even
when it opens in Amarillo, 35 miles north, on a road so flat and
straight it's like driving across a table top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy, Texas'' features two escaped convicts who hide out in a
small Texas town where they are mistaken for gay beauty pageant
directors who have come to revive ``The Little Miss Fresh
Squeezed'' pageant. The plot reveals the small-town sheriff's
sexual identity crisis and plays on a host of Texas stereotypes _
from accents to armadillos.
</P>
<P>
   Happy has no ``town sheriff.'' For that matter, Happy has no
movie theater, doctor, grocery store or police department. Happy
has a convenience store, some feedlots, two grain elevators and The
First State Bank of Happy.
</P>
<P>
   Happy Senior High has a football team _ the Happy Cowboys _ that
is having trouble rustling up enough players to field an 11-man
team.
</P>
<P>
   A long time ago, it had a newspaper, the Happy News, but that
folded decades ago, perhaps because of a lack of happy news.
</P>
<P>
   Happy sits along a 21-mile draw where spring water surfaces, a
fact that so delighted early cowboys they named it Happy Draw, from
which the town derives its name.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's co-writer, Ed Stone, told The Associated Press that
he once worked as a disc jockey in a small West Texas town. He
would hear about Happy's annual Happy Days, held the third weekend
in August every year, and he'd make fun of the Miss Happy, Junior
Miss Happy and Little Miss Happy selected to participate in area
parades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most every small town in Texas, Happy's citizens were
just mad when it came to beauty pageants,'' Stone told the AP. ``As
a disc jockey from another part of the world, I'd sometimes go on
the air and poke a little fun at this obsession with pageants, and
you wouldn't believe the angry calls that came in.''
</P>
<P>
   Town administrators voted to allow the moviemakers to use the
town's name, said city secretary Patricia Sims, before they knew
the plot line or that the movie would be rated PG-13, which is a
parental warning for films with violence, strong language or
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to go see movies back when Gary Cooper and Elizabeth
Taylor were around,'' McDonald says. ``I stopped. Now they are just
loud music and violence, and. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Sex.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to get anyone in Happy to talk about the gay
characters. Most of them just roll their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the movie will be just the opposite of what Happy is
about,'' says Judy Shipman, assistant vice president of the First
State Bank. ``Happy is a family place where everyone knows each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Shipman says she'd love to see a revival of the town that was
built on land donated by her great-grandfather, J.F. White. Antique
stores, maybe. A tea shop. Something to attract visitors.
</P>
<P>
   But some years ago, Interstate 27 bypassed Happy, and Shipman
said she thinks that ruined the town's chances for recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost a ghost town,'' McDonald says. Like most folks who
live here, she was born and raised in Happy, the daughter of
immigrants who came from Germany, mostly by way of the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came looking for the American Dream, and when they got
here they didn't really find it, but they stayed,'' McDonald says.
</P>
<P>
   Happy did have its heyday. McDonald recalls stories of cattle
drives that stopped nearby and cowboys who stayed at the now
long-closed hotel, sometimes for months while the cattle fattened.
</P>
<P>
   But fortunes change. Droughts come and cattle and feed prices
don't remain stable. Area farmers lost their ability to irrigate
after the water level dropped in the Ogalalla aquifer, says Michael
Schoenenberger, the city's water superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of land fell fallow when the federal government
started paying farmers not to farm, he says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, more and more buildings became vacant on Main
Street, and the population dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Happy's residents say they don't think it would have helped the
town economy even if William H. Macy and cast had camped on Main
Street to film the movie instead of on location in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where would they (filmmakers) have spent their money?''
McDonald says.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe now, however, a few tourists will come through Happy and
spend a little money. That would make the residents smile again in
a place whose slogan is, ``The Town Without a Frown.''

 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, now it's hit the fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago Hope'' broke new television ground Thursday night, not
with a striking story line or its major cast changes or new gore,
but with four little letters. I'll spot you the ``s'' and the
``h,'' but that's it.
</P>
<P>
   It happens.
</P>
<P>
   Just not on network television. At least until now.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of the show, Michael Pressman and Henry Bromell,
successfully lobbied to have the s-word included in the script. The
historic profanity was said by Dr. Jack McNeil (Mark Harmon) as he
talked to lawyers after a botched operation. ``S--- happens,''
McNeil said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole episode is about that,'' Bromell said Thursday.
``This is a story about a doctor who did everything right and
everything went wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Think for a minute: What do you say when this happens to you?
That's right, ``s--- happens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to that line and thought, `You know what? I'm going to
fight for this,''' Bromell continued. ``To somewhat my surprise, I
won.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS was making it clear that this was not designed as a frontal
assault on language standards. ``The producers felt strongly the
line was important for artistic truthfulness,'' network spokesman
Chris Ender said Thursday. ``It's not a statement, it's not a sign,
it's not a symbol of things to come.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a word, a word many of us hear if not say every day. It's
only in the bizarre fantasy world of network television where the
majority of people say ``golly,'' ``shoot'' and ``dang-gummit.''
</P>
<P>
   Syndicated radio host Howard Stern Thursday morning vowed to
start using the s-word on the air if ``Chicago Hope'' (9 p.m.
Eastern, Thursdays) can get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   Stern also noted that many rock songs played on the radio are
full of curses. Howard is no longer the most shocking, and he also
has a point: What is the difference?
</P>
<P>
   Another question: If the word is ``artistically truthful'' in
this instance, certainly it is applicable in context in other
instances. So how can the network say this is a one-time-only deal?
</P>
<P>
   Over at ABC, Bromell said, you can bet Steven Bochco of ``NYPD
Blue'' is telling his network he is going the same route. At the
same time, Bromell said he dreads any possibility that profanity
becomes as commonplace on network television as it is in the
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon's curse is not the first time profanity has been uttered
on television: Cable is replete with unbleeped bleeps. And anyone
watching a sports broadcast, especially one employing a sideline or
courtside microphone, does not have to be a world-class lip reader
to make out the curses of athletes.
</P>
<P>
   But never before has a network purposefully ventured this far
into the dirty-word territory in an entertainment show. And if you
had been taking bets which network would have been the first to do
so, you probably would have gotten 500-to-1 odds on CBS (as opposed
to 1-to-5 on Fox and even money on UPN).
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say there has been considerable debate about it,''
Ender said. ``We see it as an isolated incident. This doesn't
signal a change in standards at CBS. This won't happen on a weekly
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, CBS was also the network to break a language
barrier earlier this decade. In 1990, the short-lived ``Uncle
Buck,'' a comedy based on the John Candy movie, made history in the
first of its few moments on the air when a young girl said ``you
suck.'' And there have been numerous other shows, most notably
``NYPD Blue'' on ABC, that have taken the concept of permissible
language and nudity on a network to the extreme. At least to what
was thought was the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   But Ender acknowledges the obvious: There is an acute double
standard between cable and the networks regarding content, one that
allows cable to go further in terms of language, violence and
nudity than over-the-air networks, which are governed by the
Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   And as the networks lose viewers, and more people at home don't
make the distinction between cable and broadcast networks _ they
are all just channels coming through the box _ it's clear it's not
a fair fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a little bit of a double standard,'' Ender said.
``The press showers praise on `The Sopranos,' `Sex and the City'
and `South Park' (all cable shows) for pushing the envelope, but if
the network does this we get burned at the stake.''
</P>
<P>
   So should that double standard be eradicated? Should all walls
be taken down? ``I don't want to go there,'' Ender said.
</P>
<P>
   The networks are losing viewers to cable, the Internet and
elsewhere. And even staid CBS appears willing to test any and all
boundaries to try to get them back.
</P>
<P>
   It happens.

BRIGHT SPOT IS CITED ON POPULATION CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES RADIN 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 6 billionth human being on Earth, who by United Nations
estimates was born Tuesday, arrived nearly a year late _ one of an
increasing number of bright spots in the world population picture.
</P>
<P>
   Population control ``was an area of doom and gloom, and everyone
said nothing could be done,'' said Dr. Nafis Sadik, director of the
United Nations Population Fund, in an interview Thursday, ``and it
was not so.''
</P>
<P>
   The late arrival of the 6 billionth, she said, represented a
substantial slowing of the rate of population growth since the 1994
International Conference on Population and Development, in Cairo.
Based on demographic trends at the time, the 6 billion mark should
have been reached in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   At a population conference &UR;  &LR; Simmons College in Boston, where she
was keynote speaker, Sadik also said that, based on current trends,
the next 1 billion jump in global population will take 14 years _
two years longer than the previous rise of a billion, and another
sign of slowing rates of growth.
</P>
<P>
   Sadik, whose agency provides population-program assistance to
more than 140 countries and territories around the world, said
gains are being made mostly because women are gaining the power to
make their own reproductive decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys prior to the Cairo conference showed that people in all
regions of the world desired a family size lower than the usual
family size where they lived, she said, but lack of information,
lack of access to contraceptives, and a feeling among women that
they could not make reproductive decisions had contributed to
keeping family size up.
</P>
<P>
   Since the conference, she said, change has been dramatic:
Family-planning information and services are available in virtually
every country, use of contraceptives is up, and fertility is
generally down.
</P>
<P>
   After the conference, nations turned away from top-down efforts
at population control, such as China's one-child policy, and toward
better education and health care for girls and greater gender
equality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Top-down policies in India and China led to coercion,
poor-quality services, deceptions, draconian measures,'' Sadik
said. Now that such quotas, targets, and regulations have been
dropped, and governments are concentrating on providing information
and services, better results are being achieved, because ``most
women didn't want to have that many children.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort to control population is far from finished, she said,
noting that there are currently 1.04 billion people in the
15-to-24age group, and ``the decisions these young people make will
have a very big effect.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``I don't think there are any negative trends in
the developing world,'' Sadik said, adding that developed countries
that have problems with too-low birth rates might also benefit from
improving the situation of women. A case in point is Japan, where
the population is rapidly aging but young women are avoiding
child-bearing.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan ``women are totally responsible for bringing up the
children, and it is onerous,'' Sadik said. ``Not every child is a
success,'' and in Japan the mother is held responsible. Japan is
supplanting the United States as the broker of international
population agreements _ a result of faltering US financial support
for the UN and its programs, and of what she called the
preoccupation of the US Congress with abortion, which blocks
effective US participation in family planning efforts in the
developing world.

ACTION IN CONGRESS BACKS UNIVERSITIES, HOSPITALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as President Clinton and the Republican-led
Congress wrestle over proposed spending cuts, lawmakers are poised
to give a major budget boost for the second straight year to a
crucial sector of the New England economy: university and hospital
research.
</P>
<P>
   Little has been signed into law, but House and Senate
negotiators have already agreed to a 7 percent increase for the
National Science Foundation. Senators Thursday joined the House in
approving the Pentagon budget, which includes an 11.5 percent jump
in research spending, the biggest since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health, a crucial funding source for
Boston's cluster of medical research facilities, would see a 13
percent budget increase under Senate plans and at least 8.5 percent
under a House proposal. NASA, meanwhile, has sidestepped a stunning
10 percent cut approved by a House panel in July and will receive
slightly more money than the agency requested.
</P>
<P>
   These agencies send hundreds of millions of dollars each year to
local universities and hospital research programs, which are sure
to benefit if the budget increases become law. Moreover, momentum
is building in Congress to restore some of the Medicare payments to
hospitals and nursing homes that lawmakers cut in 1997. In
Massachusetts, hospitals complain that those cuts have made
providing health care a money-losing proposition.
</P>
<P>
   The expected increases stand in sharp contrast to this year's
budget-cutting rhetoric from Republican leaders. Without raising
taxes, they want to keep spending under the tight caps that
Congress and Clinton approved in 1997, and which are partly
responsible for producing this year's budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders have also made a point of saying they will
reject any plan that spends a penny of the Social Security surplus,
which they say should be reserved for the retirement program's
future funding needs.
</P>
<P>
   In the age of the Internet and continual medical breakthroughs,
however, even budget hawks are convinced that funding research is a
proper role for government. Leading Republicans, some of whom are
cancer survivors, have signed on to the general goal of doubling
medical research budgets within five years, which helped give the
NIH a remarkable 15 percent budget hike last year. Newt Gingrich,
the former House speaker, was a top advocate for other scientific
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could double the research budgets, and I'd be happy,''
said Kevin Hassett, an economist with the conservative American
Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank. He compared research
funding to ``borrowing money at 7 percent and investing it at a 50
percent return,'' because it sparks new products, companies, and
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   That opinion is not universal. ``Most of the productive research
is done in private labs with private venture capital dollars,''
said Stephen Moore of the libertarian Cato Institute, another think
tank. ``A lot of Defense and Commerce department-related research
is just another name for corporate welfare, and it should be funded
privately.''
</P>
<P>
   While the funding boosts this year are still not certain,
research advocates are increasingly optimistic about their budget
prospects. Only three weeks ago, university leaders joined science
groups in a ``lobbying day'' in Washington designed to raise alarms
about potential cuts to research funding. The group, which included
Harvard University president Neil Rudenstine and Tufts University
president John DiBiaggio, said that New England stands to lose
about $1.5 billion in research and design money, about a third of
what it now receives, and that thousands of jobs would be
jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Senate has approved budget increases in answer
to steep cuts passed by the House. And House leaders have proposed
a variety of accounting devices that could allow them to spend
money without violating the budget caps. Those include designating
some expenditures as ``emergency spending'' and deferring to future
years the cost of today's programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at a much better outcome than many of us would
have predicted,'' said George Leventhal, an analyst at the
Association of American Universities, which represents large
research centers, including Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. ``The final outcome has been quite good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly looks to me that it's not going to be the kind of
disaster that people feared a month or so ago,'' said David
Litster, vice president for research at MIT. ``The people in
Congress have recognized the importance of government support for
basic research and have done things to protect it.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest source of MIT's $400 million annual research budget
comes from private industry, Litster said, but the NIH, the
Pentagon, NASA and the Department of Energy each contribute between
15 percent and 20 percent, with the National Science Foundation
offering a bit less.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, key Republican lawmakers have begun pushing
for some modest relief for hospitals and other health care
providers, who have been complaining about Medicare cuts that
Congress approved two years ago. The cuts were designed to help put
the federal budget in surplus, but hospitals in Boston and
elsewhere said they have turned out to be steeper than the
lawmakers intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cuts have a tremendous effect on the research side of
things, because it's in the hospitals that clinical trials go on,
and it's where they train people and do research,'' said Arthur
Ullian of Boston, who leads a task force on biomedical research.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Bill Thomas, a California Republican who leads
the House subcommittee on Medicare, has proposed giving $9.4
billion back to health care providers over five years, and for the
White House to make administrative changes worth another $5.6
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Senator William Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who leads the
Senate Finance Committee, would spend slightly more money and
devote more of it to hospitals. A bill cosponsored by Senator
Edward Kennedy would give hospitals even more.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Hospital Association Thursday said that the
House plan would restore $160 million of the $1.7 billion in cuts
to Massachusetts hospitals that Congress approved for the years
1998 through 2003. Roth's Senate plan would restore about $200
million.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the proposals ``show that bipartisan momentum is
building to help hard-pressed teaching hospitals, nursing homes,
home health agencies'' and other providers. ``The issue now is not
whether relief will be enacted, but whether it will be adequate to
undo the damage,'' he said.

MISSING A CHANCE   FOR A SAFER WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was never this bad.
</P>
<P>
   Not during the first 99 years of the 20th century. Not till the
very last year of the bloodiest, weapons-drenched,
cordite-stenched, violence-saturated century has the Congress of
the United States behaved in such awkward, backward, retrograde
fashion. The Republican majority's rejection of the nuclear test
ban treaty marks the century's low point.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Senate rejected a treaty was 80 years ago,
when Woodrow Wilson was rebuffed on the Versailles Treaty, and we
wound up with World War II after fighting and winning the War to
End All Wars.
</P>
<P>
   Not during the do-nothing years of the first half of the
Depression, or the worst of the isolationist years of the late
'30s, or the craven Red Scare pandering of the '50s, or the '60s
collective cowardice that gave us 55,000 slain GIs in Vietnam, has
a Congress been so far off the path of progress.
</P>
<P>
   The century ends with America's voters bathed in apathy and
cynicism because of the poison-the-well style of politics in vogue
in Washington. This is part of the reason why most people no longer
bother to vote. Petty, vengeful, small-minded and ultimately
inconsequential are all suitable adjectives for this Kollection of
Klucks and Klaghorns currently reigning in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   United only by their bilious hatred of President Clinton, and
their dependence on the corrupt flow of campaign contributions from
well-heeled lobbyists, the minority-of-a-majority that rules the US
Senate and clings precariously to a miniscule edge in the US House
has brought effective national government to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-line right-wingers dictate terms to the GOP leadership in
both branches. But not till Wednesday night's rejection of the
nuclear test ban treaty has Congress taken a step that so endangers
the national security of the rest of us. It crystallized the
bloody-mindedness of the Republican majority in this impeachment
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Under the whip hand of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, an
unctuous right-wing Mississippian whose power rests in the
methodical harvest of tens of millions of dollars of soft money
from corporate influence-buyers, this Senate has repeatedly impeded
the progress of American civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Skewering the nuclear test ban treaty on the heels of the
rambunctuous Pakistani military's seizure of that country's nuclear
arsenal sent the arms control movement back a decade or more. This
may be the most irresponsible of all the Senate's actions under
Lott's small-minded and vindictive leadership.
</P>
<P>
   He has masterminded the refusal of the Senate to vote on
confirmation of more than 60 federal judges, imposing costly delay
as well as ideological blinders on the federal court system. He has
turned the Pentagon budget into a personal trough for his
Mississippi good old boys, ordering ships and planes the Defense
Department neither wants nor needs, to pay off his cronies. The
same week that Lott orchestrated the destruction of the world's
main hope for curbing nuclear proliferation, he yanked around the
congressional furniture to secure funds for a $1.5 billion aircraft
carrier to be built in his hometown shipyard.
</P>
<P>
   His name might as well be Senator Loot, honoring his propensity
for stripping the budget of foreign aid and UN dues in favor of
pork-drenched federal largesse for his homies. Lott has pandered to
the Neanderthal tendencies of Senate Foreign Relations Committee
Chairman Jesse Helms, who orchestrated the vengeful veto of William
Weld's ambassadorial nomination. A vestige of 19th century
isolationist, white supremacist America, Helms wields, by virtue of
the Senate's ridiculous rules and customs, a virtual veto over
American foreign policy on the eve of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   With the kind of graceless dismissal of world opinion for which
he is renowned, Helms mocked the last-minute pleas from the leaders
of Britain, France, and Germany that the Senate not destroy the
test ban framework. Sure, sneered Helms, and Tony Blair probably
told Clinton, ``and give my regards to Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Lott, Republicans have shut down the government, catered
to the rich, beggared federal programs for those without wealth or
power, and frustrated the Clinton administration at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Playing footsie with the far right, Lott now dares to make the
world less safe from nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Most voters don't grasp the stakes. Prosperity and ennui dull
the voters' appetite for politics. There could be a mushroom-shaped
cloud over Pakistan or India, over the Middle East or the Korean
peninsula, because the US Senate let loose the dogs of nuclear war.
Clinton put it simply:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, if we ever get a president that's against the test ban
treaty, which we may get _ I mean there are plenty of people out
there who say they are against it _ then I think you might as well
get ready for it. You'll have Russia testing, you'll have China
testing, you'll have India testing, you'll have Pakistan testing,
you'll have countries abandoning the nonproliferation treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to you, Senator Loot.

`YEAR ONE' HOLDS FEW SURPRISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the nearsighted innocence of ``Freaks and Geeks'' to the
extraterrestrial angst of ``Roswell,'' teen alienation has many,
many faces this season. Friday night, youthful disquiet finds its
way into the Philadelphia police force, where a sensitive
19-year-old cop tries to balance a college girlfriend with some
bloody life-or-death crime situations. Called ``Ryan Caulfield:
Year One,'' the hourlong drama mixes coming-of-age lessons and
romantic distress with gunpoint face-offs and precinct-house
politics. Talk about teen beat.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, despite the inventive way it blends genres,
``Ryan Caulfield'' is familiar and predictable TV. The Fox Network
show never manages to rise above the tired rookie-cop cliches that
have been featured on just about every cop show that ever made it
to prime time. Shock at seeing his first dead body, the numbness of
veteran cops, the worrying mother, they're all here and more. And
of course Ryan can't take his eyes off of a female cop, a
conventional plot twist that will undoubtedly complicate his
romantic life in future episodes. There's little that you haven't
already seen many times in ``Ryan Caulfield,'' formerly titled
``The Badland'' after the dangerous Badlands neighborhood in which
it's set.
</P>
<P>
   What the show does have going for it is an appealing lead actor,
Sean Maher, who looks like a young Ray Liotta. Maher, a newcomer,
veers easily between confidence and fear, and he keeps the
earnestness that's written into his character from becoming
cloying. The show also gets an A for effort for trying to give its
supporting characters some distinction. Ryan's partner, played by
Michael Rispoli (he was Jackie Aprile on ``The Sopranos''), is an
awkward man who likes to sniff his own body odor and ask non
sequitur questions. And Ryan's co-worker, played by Roselyn
Sanchez, is disarming in her quiet honesty. Sanchez and Maher have
the potential to develop a sweet romantic chemistry, if they can
transcend the formulaic script that surrounds them.

<P>
   (FR)  &UR; Tonight &LR;  at 10 on ``20/20,'' ABC will air what it calls
``the report Metabolife is so afraid of.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is the outgrowth of a four-month investigation into
the diet pill's safety claims, and also contains a look at
Metabolife's founder, Michael Ellis. Metabolife recently spent $1.5
million to advertise a Web site on which it posted an unedited
videotape of an interview ABC conducted with Ellis. Last week,
Ellis told the Associated Press that he launched the preemptive
strike because he was afraid ABC wouldn't tell ``the whole story.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis also told the AP that he suspected the ABC report was in
retaliation for the defamation lawsuit Metabolife filed against
WCVB-Ch. 5, an ABC affiliate, for a report the station aired about
potentially harmful side effects caused by the company's products.
An ABC spokeswoman, while acknowledging the Channel 5 report was
one of the stories that prompted the network to take its own look
at the issue, called the claim that the ABC story is retaliatory
``completely and utterly false.''
</P>

   ABC News president David Westin says the report is ``fair,
accurate, and free from influence others sought to impose.''

`FIGHT CLUB' PACKS PUNCH BUT LACKS STAMINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Fight Club'' is a midnight-black electrode of a movie that
sizzles with tongue-in-cheek cool and a screenful of marketing
savvy. Even if you choose to experience it as no more than Brad
Pitt's latest body slam, it's still an apocalyptic comedy of rage
that flirts with the muscular allure of fascism. Certainly no movie
in years has had this much subversive fun with militant but shaky
male egos. Even though it can't go the distance, and eventually
turns explosively silly, even though it's only more slick than
genuinely anarchic, it's still not bad for an evening at the
multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with David Fincher's camera surfing the synapses of
Edward Norton's nerd brain as if in heat-seeking search of the
Eighth Deadly Sin _ or at least Testosterone Central. Yes, there's
fighting, and more, as the film zaps us with its envelope-pushing
aspirations to boldness and originality. It even recapitulates
previous films of Pitt and Norton. If you thought Pitt's Nazi
superman number in ``Seven Years in Tibet'' (fleetingly cited here
as a visual in-joke), or his urban Gothic loose cannon in ``12
Monkeys,'' or the dark moral void he prowled in ``Seven'' were
outrageous, check out his evil twin to Norton's corporate drone
here. And yes, you'll be reminded of Norton's pumped-up neo-Nazi in
``American History X.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't long before we're plunged into illicit slugfests in
ill-lit basements where life's angry losers convene to pound one
another into hamburger as blood rooster tails across dank spaces
heavy with male odors. In those preserves, whose subterranean
aspects are as metaphorical as they are literal, there's as much
masochistic pride in taking a punch as in throwing one. Mostly,
though, ``Fight Club'' is about an over-the-top Brad Pitt bent on
world domination.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a pretty sight, even apart from Pitt's pond-scum chic
look. Norton's numbers-cruncher, whose job involves flying to
accident sites to decide whether it's cheaper for the auto company
employing him to do a recall of a particular model or face the
likely number of lawsuits, chats up Pitt's smug hipster salesman
selling his own homemade soap. But what the soapster's really
selling is anarchy. Before Norton's unhappy corporate camper
realizes it, he has only to think an anarchic thought and Pitt's
wild man makes it happen, although the fighting is Pitt's idea.
</P>
<P>
   One night, for no apparent reason, he starts shoving Norton
around in a parking lot. Norton finally shoves back, punches are
thrown, and the fight club is born as other testosterone-driven
guys are drawn to the slugging duo and want to emulate them on a
weekly basis. As Norton's contempt for his job increases in direct
proportion to his rebellious thoughts, so does Pitt's nihilistic
ingenuity and energy at acting upon them. As the fight club
membership grows, and more or less begins responding in robotic
unison and dressing in black uniformity, Pitt plunges deeper into
his Nietzschean triumph-of-the-will mode and suggests a surfer
version of Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if he's acting out Norton's angry, destructive,
system-rejecting impulses to the max. As Pitt's private army helps
him escalate his agenda of violence, it extends to the closest
thing Norton has had to a personal relationship. Before he meets
Pitt and his exhilarating just-do-it gang of neo-Nazis, Norton's
character got off on haunting different support groups and playing
emotional vampire, a system that provided catharsis until he
realized that another emotional ghoul played by Helena Bonham
Carter was working the support groups, too.
</P>
<P>
   He confronts the woman named Marla (Bonham Carter, at her
corpselike best, looking like a discarded doll) and makes a deal
with her to split the groups. Tuberculosis and bone cancer for one,
melanoma and testicular cancer for the other. Once immersed in the
punchy delights of the fight club, however, he abandons the
support-group vampirism. Marla tracks him down to the dilapidated
house he and Pitt and their army share, but attaches her punked-out
Pierrette charms to Pitt's character, not Norton's. She, who began
as the weirdest one, becomes the most human.
</P>
<P>
   Pitt and Norton, who bring the Fight Club up out of the cellar,
expand its repertory and rename it Operation Mayhem. They become
more and more outlandishly cartoony until they paint themselves
into a corner from which there is, dramatically speaking, no escape
once Pitt fatefully points out that with enough soap you can blow
up just about anything. Too bad, because ``Fight Club'' begins with
that invigoratingly nervy and imaginative buzz. But its chic
indictment of empty materialist values fizzles, especially when it
replaces them with nothing more than the classical fascist values
of male bonding through physical struggle (and highly defined abs)
and the worship of dynamism and energy for their own sakes.
</P>
<P>
   Given its collapse after that blowout beginning, it's unlikely
that there'll be a sequel to ``Fight Club.'' If there is, Leni
Riefenstahl ought to direct it.

 &HT;    SEAT BELT LAWS DON'T PROMOTE 'RACIAL PROFILING,' STUDY FINDS
 &HT;    BY SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mandatory seat belt laws do not contribute to the
racial harassment of African American drivers, a new study reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Of 1,100 African American drivers surveyed this year by the
National Black Caucus of State Legislators and the Air Bag &AMP; Seat
Belt Safety Campaign, only four linked the laws to an experience of
police harassment or other race-related problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming support for strong seat belt laws by African
Americans in primary belt law states tells us that the law is
working fine for them, and that they want the benefits of fewer
injuries and deaths,'' said Georgia state Rep. Bob Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   A primary seat belt law allows a police officer to stop a
vehicle and ticket a driver for a seat belt violation, while a
secondary seat belt law doesn't allow an officer to stop a car with
a driver not wearing a seat belt unless there is another traffic
violation.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 16 states and the District of Columbia have primary
seat belt laws. The study found that 83 percent of African
Americans wore seat belts in primary enforcement states and 66
percent in states with secondary enforcement laws.
</P>
<P>
   The study also showed that 72 percent of African Americans
favored seat belt laws in primary enforcement states and 62 percent
approved of them in secondary enforcement states.
</P>
<P>
   Favorable attitudes toward seat belt laws among the African
American drivers could not come at a better time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the African American community, seat belt usage is really a
public health issue,'' said Rep. John Conyers Jr., a Democrat from
Michigan and ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study showed that automobile accidents were the leading
cause of death of Americans 15 to 20 years old. Studies have also
shown that minorities are in even greater danger when it comes to
seat belt safety. African American youths are 60 percent more
likely not to buckle up than children of any other racial
background, and black and Hispanic male teenagers are nearly twice
as likely to die in a car crash than white male teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases, the fears surrounding the possible impact of a
primary law have been large enough to keep us from taking action to
protect our children and families,'' Florida state Sen. Kendrick
Meek said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Meek said that when Florida legislators began talking about
passing a primary seat belt law, he had apprehensions as a black
driver that it would allow some law enforcement officers to justify
``racial profiling'' practices. Meek added that he is now working
to pass the primary law.

AN ALTOGETHER UNREMARKABLE `STORY' 
</HEADLINE>

   There's appealing warmth in Rob Reiner's ``The Story of Us,''
and some nice work from Michelle Pfeiffer and Bruce Willis as a
couple whose 15-year marriage is unraveling. But its recriminations
and back-and-forth and resurgences of affection are little more
than sitcom-deep. It isn't a bad marriage, exactly, that they're
trying to work their way through, just one that's lost its steam
and is calling for a parting or a renewed commitment by the time
the kids come back from summer camp. The only real question, as
they slosh through anger and anguish, is whether the film is going
to tie everything up neatly in a package, or go somewhere really
surprising. Mostly this potential slugfest in the marital trenches
is undermined by a will to innocuousness.
</P>
<P>
   While such previous Rob Reiner films as ``When Harry Met Sally''
were able to work their way through some protracted stretches of
whininess with wit, this one gets stuck in a rut pretty early on
and has difficulty rising out of it. It suggests a marriage ride in
a theme park, running along a track in tumultuous but predetermined
fashion. The writing is at its best when it has Pfeiffer's
sharp-eyed Kate detail all of the little specifics that she once
may have found charming, like her writer husband Ben's veering off
into spontaneity. But while the film tells us that she's the one
who likes neat little boxes, he's the one who comes off as the
picky one.
</P>
<P>
   Their consultations with their pals have a prefab quality, too.
In fact, the film exerts an inordinate allure when it flashes back
to the days when they got along, if only because it gives us a
break from the spillover of hostility that has sent them to neutral
corners, feeling sorry for themselves. For all the pinpointing of
the little things that become wedges driving couples apart, ``The
Story of Us'' is conspicuously short on the kind of texture that
makes us feel we're watching real people living real lives. In a
film about a writer, it's no help to have so much of what he says
sound so written, and in such routine ways.
</P>
<P>
   They talk about wrestling with the seemingly paradoxical
question of how the things that brought them together now are
driving them apart. But the film never really feels as if they're
grappling with this. The most authentic thing in it is the tension
they project, even though it's grating to sit through. Certainly it
beats the film's glum tendency to fall back on in-law jokes when
the creativity level sags and the fractured time line takes its
toll. The secondary roles add little, although Rita Wilson's salty
confidante freshens up a story that increasingly needs freshening
as it plods to an unremarkable conclusion. Beyond its crescendo of
frazzled nerves obscuring a reservoir of good will each feels
toward the other, the film suggests that what Ben and Kate need is
not a divorce, but a time out. Perhaps that's why, at bottom, ``The
Story of Us'' plays like an intermission. Its promise of marital
fireworks, either comedic or dramatic, is largely unkept.

A HARROWING LOOK AT BLOODY CHAPTER IN HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Earth,'' the second installment of Deepa Mehta's film
tetrology keyed to the four elements of antiquity, is a baleful and
bloody reminder that the Hindu-Muslim antagonism newly ignited
between India and Pakistan is not new. In this film set in 1947,
the unity both sides had maintained against the British isn't long
in crumbling with the end of colonialsm. Watching ``Earth,'' as we
do through the innocent eyes of an 8-year-old Parsee girl in
Lahore, is like watching an impending train crash that she can't
see, but that we know is unavoidable. Staining the earth red with
blood would be an unforgivable exaggeration in many a film, but not
this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earth'' hurls its Holocaust at us in a series of justifiably
horrific images. As soon as the first rumblings are to be felt on
the eve of independence, the father of the girl named Lenny
expresses the wish that their family will be spared. ``If the Swiss
can do it, so can the Parsees,'' he says, relying on the insulating
power of neutrality. But as the nonviolence of Gandhi crumbles
almost as soon as the new borders were drawn between India and a
divided Pakistan, the virtually powerless father is unprepared for
the extent and viciousness of the carnage on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Any hope that Lahore will remain untouched literally goes up in
flames after Muslims slaughter Hindus nearby and retaliation
arrives in the form of a train pulling into Lahore station loaded
with butchered Muslim corpses and body parts. The film's central
image is that of Lenny mutilating her dolls after she had seen the
same thing happen to a person the night before in the street. When
her nanny tries to stitch a doll together, and can't, she breaks
into tears, realizing, as Mehta intends us to, that the doll stands
for the self-divided country.
</P>
<P>
   Mehta's strategy is to have the upheaval affect us through its
effects on the Parsee family. He's helped by Maia Sethna's
involvingly sentient performance as young Lenny. Nandita Das is
touching, too, as the nanny caught between rival suitors, each
portrayed vividly, but not able to climb out from under the
schematism of their ties to the rival factions. ``Earth'' has been
called the ``Gone with the Wind'' of India, but, unlike that film,
the family in this one is swept off the screen by the scenes of
hostility meant to provide context and background. Sadly, history
has granted ``Earth'' its shattering climax. What, one wonders,
will Mehta do with ``Water''?

PATAKI CALLS FOR NEW POLLUTION LIMITS ON POWER PLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DINA CAPPIELLO  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki said he would require New
York's 32 power plants to reduce emissions that cause acid rain and
smog.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, announced Thursday, raises the bar already placed on
all electric utilities under the 1990 amendments to the federal
Clean Air Act, reducing sulfur emissions at New York plants by an
additional 50 percent and curbing nitrogen oxide emissions
year-round by Jan. 1, 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Current federal law requires only nitrogen oxide reductions
during the summer, the prime season for smog, or ground-level
ozone, which causes asthma and otheratory ailments.
</P>
<P>
   The state just recorded its smoggiest summer in recent history,
with a total of 211 violations of the federal ozone standard.
Sulfur dioxide is the main culprit in the formation of acid rain,
which threatens lakes and streams. Roughly 24 percent of Adirondack
lakes in New York are seriously acidic, according to the National
Acid Precipitation Program.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency study found that
even under the current Clean Air Act, the number of acidic lakes
would double by 2040.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, a Republican, attributed about 80 percent of New York's
air pollutants to out-of-state plants, particularly those located
in the Midwest, but said that well over 20 percent comes from
in-state power sources closer to the Adirondacks. These plants
deposit additional nitrogen and sulfur in the state's lakes and
downwind in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing for us to stand there and say the Midwest
states do more,'' Pataki told a press conference at the Capitol.
``It's another when you are the state leading the nation in air
emission standards.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, New York's power plants emitted 313,606 tons of sulfur
dioxide while Ohio's, which produce roughly three times the amount
of energy, emitted 1.4 million tons and Indiana's 968,340 tons. New
York plants released 102,000 tons of nitrogen oxide compared to the
515,882 tons in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Yorkers have plenty of reasons to complain about
Midwestern states,'' said Paul J. Elston, chairman of the New York
League of Conservation Voters. ``It is a perfect cover for every
politician to do nothing. That's not what's going on here.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's announcement came a month after Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer said he would take legal action against 17 power plants in
the Midwest and South, which he contends violate the Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's case drew criticism from environmentalists and
industry officials who said that attorney general should look
closer to home. New York has 20 plants that are grandfathered _
exempt from the air quality standards for newer power-generating
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists argue that this exemption provides older
plants with the incentive to remain dirty. By not being required to
install pollution-control devices, companies can produce energy at
a lower cost and sell it more cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Spitzer sent letters requesting documents from eight
older power plants in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the newly deregulated energy market, Pataki's directive would
narrow the gap in air emissions standards between old and new
plants, making cleaner ones more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as emissions are concerned, they all would be required
to meet the same standards,'' said Environmental Conservation
Commissioner John P. Cahill.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill's department is responsible for working out regulations
by Jan. 1., 2003, for the 130,000 tons reduction in sulfur dioxide
and 20,000 tons reduction in nitrogen oxide each year that the
governor is seeking. Under deregulation, utilities are getting out
of the power-production business by selling off their plants. For
the companies that are buying them, Pataki's announcement was a
slap in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly unexpected,'' said Frank Rapley, a spokesman
for NRG Energy Inc. of Minneapolis, which recently purchased
Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.'s Dunkirk and Huntley plants and
ConEdison's facility at Astoria in Queens. ``The reductions that he
has proposed are dramatic and they will definitely have a
significant impact on our operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Cahill estimated the cost of updating existing plants to meet
the state's new standards could be as much as $80 million. Pataki
stressed that he expects no rate increase because of the
competition brought about by deregulation.

PAGE FLIES AGAIN WITH THE BLACK CROWES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a concept: No home video, no pay-per-view, no live album,
no tribute album, no strings attached. The teaming of the Black
Crowes and Led Zeppelin legend Jimmy Page defies all the corporate
machinations that typically accompany such all-star unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing this for the music. The glory is in just
playing,'' Black Crowes singer Chris Robinson says of the band's
short tour with Page this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Crowes/Page express debarked in New York for two shows
earlier this week, and leaves for Los Angeles for two more next
week. But sandwiched in between is Saturday's stop at the Worcester
Centrum Centre. It's a coup for the Centrum and a chance to see
what should be one of the rock events of the year. New York, Los
Angeles, and Worcester. No other US cities are on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole show is us and Jimmy,'' says Robinson, noting that
they'll join forces to play Crowes tunes, Zeppelin tunes, and blues
covers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played with Jimmy in London this summer and did Zeppelin's
`In My Time of Dying,' `Whole Lotta Love,' and `Your Time is Gonna
Come.' And we did the Crowes songs `Remedy,' `Wiser Time,' and `By
Your Side.' Jimmy has his place on those. And this time we want to
do some (Zeppelin) stuff we didn't do there, like `Down by the
Seaside' and ``Ten Years Gone.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As for blues covers, the musicians tackled the B. B.
King-identified ``Woke Up This Morning'' in London, and may do the
Otis Redding-identified ``Old Man Trouble'' this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we don't even rehearse the blues covers,'' says
Robinson, ``except to discuss who's going to play the first solo or
the one after that. We want to keep it pretty spontaneous. Hey, I'm
going to let the guitar players do all the work! Just let them
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Page, who is not doing any interviews, first met the Crowes six
years ago when the Crowes' ``High as the Moon'' tour came to
London's Royal Albert Hall. He and the Crowes hit it off backstage.
A day later, Page went to the Crowes' gig in Paris and sat in. Then
in 1996, the Crowes opened Page and Plant's tour of South America,
further solidifying the bond. Then came the London gig in June when
Page asked the Crowes to be his backup band. It was a benefit for
two children's charities, one of which was Action for Brazil's
Children, chosen because Page's wife is from Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a rehearsal, and it was awesome,'' Robinson recalls of
that show. ``It was so laid-back and easy. Really, no pressure. We
said, `This is so good, let's do it somewhere else.' So here we
are.''

BUSINESS BECOMES HIS BEAT

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Think hard for a moment. How many successful
rock musicians have also been successful rock managers? Not many,
but Paul Geary is living proof that it can be done. He was the
drummer for Extreme _ a million-selling Boston act in the early
'90s _ and he's now managing Godsmack, the hottest-selling
break-out rock act of recent months, whose self-titled album is
approaching 2 million copies sold.
</P>
<P>
   Geary, now 38 and working from a 10th-story office with a
panoramic view of the Boston skyline, knows that he's beaten the
odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many players have come and gone and can't get arrested
now?'' he asks. ``But I've been lucky, because I was able to parlay
one success into another success. And I think I'm uniquely suited
to managing acts. When a band says, `We can't hear our monitors,'
that might go right by some managers, but because I've actually
been onstage, I know exactly what it means. And that goes a long
way for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Geary has become Boston's most prominent rock manager (he also
helps guide the careers of newcomers Reveille and veteran Cyndi
Lauper) since the heyday of Tim Collins, who managed Aerosmith for
12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Collins is an unabashed Geary supporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to make the transition from artist to
manager,'' says Collins. ``It's a different world. It's right brain
versus left brain. But Paul has indefatigable energy. He's
persistent and smart and dedicated. He's got a great ear and is
always hustling. He's been around and has toured internationally.
Plus, he was the guy in Extreme who dealt with the inner politics,
and that set him up to be a good manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Most big-time managers, says Collins, come from a business
background. Cliff Bernstein, who works with Metallica, is a
statistician. Howard Kaufman, who manages Aerosmith and Jimmy
Buffett, is an accountant. Irving Azoff, who manages the Eagles, is
``another numbers guy,'' says Collins, who himself went to business
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as an artist, I always had my nose in business,'' says
Geary, who grew up in Medford and Malden. ``I co-managed Extreme
from the start, and as the years flew by, I became more and more
comfortable with the business side of things. I'm now as
comfortable jumping on the phone and cutting a deal as I was
getting onstage and playing drums.''
</P>
<P>
   In the band Extreme, which had such Top 10 hits as ``More than
Words'' and ``Hole-Hearted,'' Geary was the only band member who
paid serious attention to the business end. Singer Gary Cherone,
who joined Van Halen after Extreme broke up three years ago, was
mainly focused on writing lyrics, Geary says. Guitarist Nuno
Bettencourt, who has since gone solo, ``wanted to make rock records
where he could bash away on guitar and not worry about singles.''
And bassist Pat Badger, who recently joined Florida band Super
Transatlantic, was also ``content with just playing music.''
</P>
<P>
   Extreme almost signed a management deal with Collins, who had
the band open for Aerosmith in Portland, Maine, as a way to check
it out. Aerosmith's Steven Tyler and Joe Perry were ``cheering us
from the side of the stage and I think we really played well,''
says Geary, who was an Aerosmith fan from childhood (the first
record he ever bought was Aerosmith's ``Get Your Wings''). But
Collins, after much thought, decided to stay exclusively with
Aerosmith.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme was unusual in that it was always much bigger overseas
than in the United States. The group would headline two nights at
London's Wembley Arena and two at Toyko's Budokan, yet struggle to
do more than one show in a US city, despite selling millions of
records. The reason, Geary says, was that overseas audiences
recognized Extreme as a rock band, whereas listeners here became
confused when the first two domestic hits were the acoustic-based
``More than Words'' and ``Hole-Hearted,'' versus the electric,
funk-based rock that was the group's specialty.
</P>
<P>
   Geary left Extreme on ``friendly terms'' a year before the group
officially broke up _ and he quickly started building a management
roster. He signed three bands _ Hunk (from New York), the Hookers
(from Los Angeles), and Flip (from Minneapolis). They all got
record deals, but personnel changes at the labels doomed the
records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to get the idea that Extreme wasn't the norm, that it
wasn't easy to take a band to Extreme's heights,'' Geary says.
``You might get a great record deal one day, but in six months it
wasn't worth the paper it was written on.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Godsmack appeared. Geary had known Godsmack singer Sully
Erna for 10 years before the band was formed. Geary then caught
them at the Atlantic Lounge (now called the Tank) in Revere. Geary
went to the show with his New York-based partner Arma Andon, and
they loved what they heard. They also loved the tape Godsmack
recorded at New Alliance Studio in Boston. The band made it for
only ``$2,500 to $3,000, but it was sonically great,'' says Geary.
Universal Records released it as the debut album that has now sold
nearly 2 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   The rest has been a fantasy. Godsmack became the first band
since Metallica to have two singles (``Whatever'' and ``Keep
Away'') chart simultaneously in the Top 10 at most album-rock radio
stations. Locally, WAAF-FM (107.9) was the first station to get
behind the band, but nearly every other rock station has followed
suit. Godsmack also toured on the Ozzfest and performed at
Woodstock '99.
</P>
<P>
   Geary, who has also spent time as a promoter and venue owner
couldn't be happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long road, but I really feel like I'm home now,''
he says. ``I hope to manage bands for the rest of my career.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bloomingdale's vs. Almy's.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but that's the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The third spot in anyone's batting order is supposed to be a
glamour role. He is, in theory, your ``best'' hitter. The Yankees
have a No. 3 hitter who knocked in 110 in an off year. The Red Sox
have a 27-year-old rookie No. 3 hitter who is often completely
overmatched in this exalted level of competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have a veteran, battle-hardened and (reasonably)
healthy pitching rotation that features a lefthander with five
career postseason victories. The Red Sox have Pedro Martinez and an
assortment of rehabs and discards. Their starting lefthander was
jettisoned in late August by a National League team going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   You could have made a sufficiently dramatic compare-and-contrast
case to demonstrate that the Red Sox lineup had even less business
being on the field against the Indians, and at last view the
Indians were seen jumping en masse into the Cuyahoga River.
</P>
<P>
   But the hook there was pitching. For all their Central Division
dominance over the past six seasons, the Indians have never
rectified an essentially mediocre pitching situation. The defending
world champion Yankees have not had that problem.
</P>
<P>
   When the climactic moment came in Thursday night's game, Joe
Torre summoned a proven reliever named Ramiro Mendoza, who has
served his team well in a variety of situations the past several
years. With the bases loaded and one out in the eighth and New York
clinging to a precarious 3-2 lead, he bailed his team out by
striking out pinch hitter Butch Huskey and retiring the dangerous
(five hits in the first two games) Jose Offerman on a routine fly
to center.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Jimy Williams's options in a similar situation: Tom
Gordon, barely sprung from rehab; Bryce Florie, considered
expendable by the woeful Tigers; Rheal Cormier, a well-traveled
lefthander of modest skill; and Rod Beck. 'Nuff said.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomie's vs. Almy's.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox try. Oh, how they try. Jimy Williams is correct.
They most certainly do compete. But when you examine just what they
are working with, the fact that they won 94 games and managed to
defeat the Indians is one of the great baseball stories of our
time.
</P>
<P>
   That said, take out the nearest fedora from your closet and wave
it in the general direction of the noble Ramon Martinez, who gave
his team a magnificent effort in a valiant attempt to send his team
back to Fenway Park Saturday with the series tied. He has given
this team the benefit of superior class and baseball breeding since
making his debut back on Sept. 2. We already know that the team
would not have even gone this far without his spectacular
performance in Game 3 last Saturday against Cleveland. And he did
nothing to diminish his considerable reputation Thursday &UR;  &LR; night,
when he pitched 6 2/3 strong innings in the crushing Yankees
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez the Elder is not exactly pitching with the same
equipment and repertoire he had when he was doing such things as
throwing no-hitters and striking out 18 San Francisco Giants. But
the man does know how to pitch, and for six innings he was beating
the Yankees in this vital game, holding a 2-1 lead courtesy of a
two-run Nomar Garciaparra homer. His only mistake was a
fourth-inning 1-and-2 pitch that wandered into Tino Martinez's
wheelhouse and landed in the right-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   But Ramon walked leadoff man Ricky Ledee on a close 3-and-2
pitch to start off the seventh, and in a game like this such a move
was a definite faux pas. Before the inning was over, the Yankees
would push across two runs, the big blows being a two-out Chuck
Knoblauch double that produced the tying run and a two-out Paul
O'Neill soft single off Cormier that brought home the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great show, but it wasn't enough to beat David Cone,
and the very mention of that name tells you all you need to know
about the essential differences between the Bloomies and the Almys.
For David Cone, a quality, veteran pitcher, hadn't even been needed
in the Division Series against Texas. Were he a member of the
Almys, he would have started Game 2. On the Bloomies, he is now the
fourth starter. Fourth!
</P>
<P>
   Savvy baseball man that he is, Cone is blown away by the
improbability of the Almys. ``They are better than a wild card
right now,'' he maintains. ``This is not a wild-card team. Plus,
they're hot right now. Every guy on that team is putting up quality
at-bats right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the best came at the very end. With two away and nobody
on in the ninth, and with the bitter memory of a pair of would-be
homers by Jason Varitek and Troy O'Leary failing to leave the yard
by 2 and 6 inches, respectively, Garciaparra and O'Leary each got
two-strike, two-out singles in the ninth off gold-plated reliever
Mariano Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   A tease? What do you think? Rivera struck out Damon Buford to
end the game. Bloomies 3, Almys 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are an amazingly resilient team,'' lauds Cone. ``You have
to appreciate that from the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Resilient? Oh, absolutely. The problem is their shelves are
neither as well-stocked nor as laden with quality goods as the
Bloomies'. But they do have one extraordinarily high-quality item,
and let's see what the Bloomies can do with Pedro Saturday before
we call in the liquidator.

BC'S CIRINO PLANS TO HOLD THE LINE VS. PITT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Pedro Cirino has already been through two 4-7 seasons
too many. After Boston College suffered its first loss of the
season in last Saturday's 24-14 setback at Temple, the senior free
safety and defensive co-captain emphatically vowed not to finish
his BC career by going through a third.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he intends to draw the line when the Eagles play host
to Pittsburgh Saturday in a huge Big East game at 5 p.m. at Alumni
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were 4-7 last year, and that's something I can't accept,''
said Cirino, a 5-foot-11-inch, 201-pounder from Jersey City, N.J.,
who ranks as the hard-hitting heart and soul of BC's defense.
``It's tough for me because I can't go through another season like
that, and I'm going to do whatever I can to control that.''
</P>
<P>
   What Cirino and Co. weren't able to control, however, was a
Temple offense that gained new life under Devin Scott. The backup
quarterback had suffered a rib-cage injury in a 55-24 loss the week
before at Pittsburgh and wasn't even expected to play against BC.
Scott rallied Temple from a 14-0 deficit to 24 unanswered points,
including 17 in the second half. The Owls amassed a season-high 429
yards total offense against BC's beseiged defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out after taking a 14-0 lead, and I don't know what
happened, but we just relaxed and took the other team for
granted,'' Cirino said. ``We couldn't do much out there after that.
We couldn't move the ball, and we couldn't stop them. They
out-toughed us in the second half, and that's something we're not
happy with. We've got to get back to playing tough football, but we
didn't react well to it.''
</P>
<P>
   What was the most troubling aspect of the Temple loss? ``We
didn't react to the way they came out in the second half,'' said
Cirino, who was credited with six tackles and now ranks second on
the team (42) behind senior linebacker Frank Chamberlin (48).
``They gained the momentum at halftime (when Marcus Godfrey scored
on a 1-yard run to make it 14-7 with two seconds remaining before
halftime), and that was probably the turning point of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We roughed the punter (to help sustain Temple's first scoring
drive of 13 plays, 78 yards), and it was reminiscent of two years
ago when we were down there,'' Cirino said, recalling BC's 28-21
loss to Temple in O'Brien's debut as BC's head coach. ``It was the
exact same situation. We roughed the punter and gave them all the
momentum from there on out. The offense struggled the whole game,
pretty much, and that's something we can't have. We have to have
them help us, and we have to help them out by getting them the ball
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Cirino admitted the Eagles were caught off guard when Temple
``ran some plays we had never seen before and we didn't expect,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   BC's defense failed to react with a physical response. ``The
coaches tried to put us in a position to make some plays, but we
just didn't make them,'' Cirino said. ``The whole thing comes down
to us on the defense. Whether the offense doesn't move the ball or
not, they had 14 points on the board and that's enough to hold
them, but we didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   BC's defense has become vulnerable on the right side.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past two weeks (against Temple and Northeastern), offenses
have spread us wide apart and then try to pound the ball and have
our linebackers and secondary in a situation where we're spread out
all over the place,'' Cirino said. ``That's what kills you. I mean,
the coaches have gone to a new approach this week, and if they try
to do it to us this week, they're going to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to O'Brien, the only thing BC's defense needed to
do better was tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're lining up as we were,'' O'Brien said. ``It was just that
we didn't tackle. We had the chance to make plays, and we didn't
tackle. That's the bottom line on defense: too many missed tackles.
There were more missed tackles in that game than in the previous
two or three.''
</P>
<P>
   Cirino concurred. ``If we don't come out and play (against
Pittsburgh), they might beat the hell out of us,'' he said.
``That's something we can't have happen.''

RAMON MARTINEZ VALIANT IN DEFEAT 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-MARTINEZ-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He was the X-factor, the man who just might have
dealt the first body blow to the Yankees. When pennant fantasists
were plotting out the the American League Championship Series, they
circled Game 2 in Yankee Stadium with Ramon Martinez on the hill
against David Cone as the point where things might turn in Boston's
favor.
</P>
<P>
   For the better part of Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, it seemed they had.
Martinez pitched superbly, shrugging off a solo homer by Tino
Martinez in the fourth to take the Sox into the seventh inning with
a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he pitched a tremendous game,'' said Sox manager
Jimy Williams. ``Kept us in that game. The starter sets the tone,
we always say. Certainly, he did more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who had started only four games during the regular
season after rehabbing from shoulder surgery, pitched one out short
of seven innings. He threw 120 pitches, gave up three runs on six
hits, and struck out five. Had his mates done anything with men on
base, that would have been more than enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees are one of the greatest teams,'' Martinez said.
``That is the reason why they are here. I know I am going to have a
tough game. I did the best that I could.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the wrenching irony Thursday &UR;  &LR; night. The Sox got
exactly the pitching performance from Pedro's big brother that they
craved. Then they fed him starvation rations. ``We have our
chances,'' shrugged Martinez. ``We got our men in scoring position,
but we can't come up with the base hit we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Inning after inning, Martinez kept Boston in the ballgame. He
kept the world champions scoreless through three. And when Tino
Martinez took him four rows into the right-field seats, he simply
bore down and got tougher, striking out the next three batters.
</P>
<P>
   He kept the Yankees at bay until the seventh, when he lost
leadoff man Ricky Ledee on a full-count walk and watched Scott
Brosius bunt him to second.
</P>
<P>
   Up came Chuck Knoblauch, after Martinez got Joe Girardi to pop
up. Martinez threw Knoblauch a changeup, and he sent it bouncing to
the left-field fence. Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan went to the
phone, and in came Tom Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch count pretty much ruled out Martinez going any longer.
``If he wasn't coming off surgery, maybe the decision would have
been to leave him in one more inning,'' said Kerrigan. ``But 120
pitches is 20 more than he's thrown in any start this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Martinez was feeling it. ``I can go farther than
that,'' he said. ``I feel fine when I come out. I was just normal.
I didn't feel any kind of pain or tired or anything. I didn't want
to come out, but I had to.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a sixth game in this series, Martinez will be back
here to pitch it. ``I just don't want to hurt the kid,'' said
Williams. ``I thought he had done his job, and it was time to make
a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez stayed in the dugout and watched Paul O'Neill, whom
he'd held hitless, single off reliever Rheal Cormier to put the
Yankees ahead. He stayed there through the ninth, hoping that Damon
Buford could find magic with one swing.
</P>
<P>
   Then he went into the clubhouse, strapped an iceberg to his
shoulder, and picked at a wee-hours plate. ``It was a good game,''
Ramon Martinez concluded, ``an exciting game.'' It was everything
the pennant fantasists wanted _ for 120 pitches.

A BETTER WAY TO SETTLE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY SHUFFLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We usually stop people who cut in line by tapping them on the
shoulder and giving them the thumb backwards. It's time to give the
thumb to New Hampshire, Iowa, and Delaware and give the first
presidential primaries to the states that truly deserve them.
</P>
<P>
   The latest rudeness was sparked when Delaware set its
presidential primary for Feb. 8, 2000. This made New Hampshire set
a date of Feb. 1 for its first-in-the-nation primary. This irked
Iowa, which had set Jan. 31 for its first-in-the-nation caucuses.
Iowa wanted Delaware to go back to Feb. 15 and New Hampshire to
Feb. 8. Getting no such cooperation, it appeared that Iowa would
instead move its caucuses up to Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion has become a national concern. The Republican
National Committee is asking its members whether New Hampshire and
Iowa should have the first caucuses and primary.
</P>
<P>
   This makes New Hampshire nervous. New Hampshire Republican Party
chairman Steve Duprey and two RNC members from New Hampshire, Ruth
Griffin and Tom Rath, wrote a letter to the committee, saying, ``We
understand that the first primary is an enormous privilege, but we
believe we have earned it over the last 50 years with voter
turnouts in excess of 75 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Duprey, Griffin, and Rath were right about the primary being an
enormous privilege. But if voter turnout, as they suggest, is the
key for that privilege, New Hampshire has not earned it.
</P>
<P>
   I have thought for several years that the nation's first
presidential primaries should go to the states that have the
highest voter turnout in the previous presidential election. In
that regard, Delaware is not even close. Its 49.5 percent turnout
of its voting age population in 1996 ranked 28th.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire and Iowa had respective turnouts of 58 and 57.7
percent. But that was good for only eighth and ninth place. The
states that should get the first primaries are Maine, Minnesota,
and Montana. The three states, respectively, sent 64.5, 64.3 and
62.9 percent of their voting age population to the polls in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A discerning eye would see one very positive thing and some
obvious flaws in reshuffling the primaries this way. A good thing
about Maine being at the top of the list is that it proves that a
state's wealth is not necessarily a factor. Maine's personal income
per capita ranks only 38th of the 50 states plus the District of
Columbia. Louisiana, which was in 12th place for presidential
turnout at 56.9 percent, is 41st in personal income per capita.
</P>
<P>
   The flaws begin with the fact that all of the top 10 states in
presidential election turnout in 1996 are between 91.5 and 98.8
percent white. That is hardly reflective of a nation that is 75
percent white, 12 percent black, 9 percent Latino, 3 percent Asian
and 1 percent American Indian.
</P>
<P>
   If the first 10 primaries went merely to the top 10 cities with
the best turnout, none of the top 10 largest cities, the cities
with some of the most pressing urban problems, such as public
schools, would be stumped by candidates. Such a system would also
work against which have the highest percentages of nonvoting
children in the population and highest percentages elderly. Of the
10 top voting states, only South Dakota is in the top 10 of both
underage population and senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   So, as the nation edges closer to rewriting the order of the
primaries, here is what I would do. I would give Week 1 to the
three states with the best turnout from the previous election. This
year, that would be Maine, Minnesota, and Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Then I would wait three weeks as the candidates stump the three
states out of the 10 most populous that had the best previous
turnout among them. This year, that would have been, New Jersey,
Michigan, and Ohio. New Jersey happens to be one of the states that
most reflect the color of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   After that, I would redo the cycle, giving the next set of
primaries to South Dakota, Wyoming, and Vermont. Then it would be
back to the most populous states with the next best voting records,
which, based on 1996, would be Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Florida.
The next cycle would be Idaho, New Hampshire, and Iowa. Then New
York, California, and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   This way, the nation's primaries would send candidates to most
corners of the nation, to most of its people and address a wider
variety of issues. It is not perfect, and it certainly does not
address the issue of big money, but it would be much better than we
have now, especially with 35 me-first states now holding their
primaries and caucuses between Feb. 1 and March 14.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Duprey said, ``We've gotten used to this
primary and think of it as our right.'' In their childishness, New
Hampshire, Iowa, and Delaware remind us that none of them has an
arbitrary right to cut in line. We should have a system in which
the people who get in line first vote first.

Y2K: WILL IT BE PANIC OR PICNIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, residents of Newton, Mass., received a bright yellow
flier from City Hall titled ``What to Do to Prepare for the Year
2000.'' It suggested stocking up on gasoline, cash, food, and
firewood, and laying in a two-week supply of prescription medicine.
For those of you with portable generators, disconnect them from
your home electrical system. The people responsible for pumping
water into Newton homes suggest you ``store drinkable water in
empty soda bottles.'' How very reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Newton's response seems alarmist. Cambridge and
Boston, for instance, have focused their Y2K preparedness outreach
on senior citizens' forums, operating under the theory that
oldsters might be the first to drain their bank accounts in the
face of a perceived crisis. On the other hand _ who knows? ``It's
the ultimate in not knowing where we are,'' says Richard Landes,
director of Boston University's Millennial Studies Center.
``There's stuff we know we don't know, and stuff we don't know we
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Landes isn't hoarding _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   Government has a devilish choice: to openly discuss the
possibility that some services may be interrupted, and panic the
citizenry, or clam up and hope for the best. The first option risks
becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. If too many people decide to
``stockpile'' cash or stocks, for instance, that could create
problems in the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has chosen option two: Clam up and keep
fingers crossed. The CIA just weighed in with its opinion that the
Y2K crisis will be most acute in faraway lands, like Russia,
Ukraine, China, Egypt, India, and Indonesia. The Senate Special
Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem helpfully suggests
that ``a couple of extra cans of food'' will get Americans through
the Dec. 31 changeover.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the White House has adopted a ``see no evil'' policy
on Y2K matters. The Clinton administration's Y2K czar, John
Koskinen, is Pennsylvania Avenue's invisible man. (True to form,
Koskinen sneaked in and out of Boston this week with no one
noticing.) ``The president's failure to take adequate actions now
to encourage the public to take adequate preparations and to
minimize the impacts of Y2K and the embedded systems crisis will
cost the nation and the world dearly,'' according to George
Washington University professor Paula Gordon, author of a study
called ``The Year 2000 and the Embedded System Crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon quantifies the potential Y2K disruptions on a scale of 1
to 10, and believes that government inaction has created a risk
range between 5 (mild recession; isolated supply/infrastructure
problems; runs on banks) and 9 (supply/infrastructure collapse;
widespread disruptions; martial law). Landes is more sanguine about
the events of December 31: ``There's a 5 percent chance this could
be very serious,'' he says. ``We're counting on it not being
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   In a few days, the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency
will come up with a publicity campaign to heighten citizen
awareness of 1999-2000 conversion issues. In a nutshell, MEMA plans
to push preparedness _ stock up as if for a winter storm _ and
``let the people know what state government has been doing to
eliminate the possibility of anything bad happening,'' according to
spokesman Peter Judge. Like everyone I spoke with, Judge emphasized
the uncertainties surrounding Y2K: ``The only thing we really know
about this is the date.''

THE WOMAN WHO OUTSMARTED `BUTCHER OF LYON' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good causes usually make bad films. Perhaps it's because the
filmmaker subconsciously feels that part of the work is being done
for him by the moral force of the story. ``Lucie Aubrac'' isn't a
bad film. Its high level of craftsmanship keeps it from that. But
it's a curiously inert film, given its dynamite true story. There
not only was but still is a Lucie Aubrac, who was brave and nervy
and clever and lucky enough to snatch her patriotic saboteur
husband from the clutches of Klaus Barbie and the occupying Nazis
in Lyon in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   The statuesque Carole Bouquet, who plays Lucie, is at her best
during the few intimate moments she's able to snatch from her
husband's efforts _ and eventually hers _ on behalf of the
Resistance. What's best about her underground heroics is that
they're done coolly enough to impress us with her sense of
self-possession, although her most magnificent gesture is almost
romantically foolhardy. In a burst of fiery determination, she
decides to get her husband sprung on the anniversary of their
honeymoon and does it by threatening a local prosecutor and Nazi
puppet with assassination.
</P>
<P>
   It works. Her husband, Raymond, is played by Daniel Auteuil,
whose natural acuity is dampened by being required to mostly look
dumbfounded or numb after having been tortured. His first release,
risky as it was for Lucie to have bluffed it into being, was
comparatively easy since he was able to convince his captors that
he was guilty of the relatively minor crime of black marketeering.
But the stakes are raised after a traitor tips the Nazis to a spy
cell meeting and almost all are arrested and sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   To spring her husband this time, she's got to go through the
infamous ``Butcher of Lyon,'' Klaus Barbie, presented here by Heino
Ferch in the all too familiar sadistic, sneering Nazi serpent mode.
Bouquet convinces as a woman with her own center of gravity, but
while her avoidance of cheap dramatics is admirable, she also comes
across as something of a blank, which the real Lucie assuredly was
not. The film, too, seems more an exercise in iconography than an
urgent dramatization. It would hardly seem possible, given its
real-life heroics and real-life dramatics, but ``Lucie Aubrac''
seems so preoccupied with genuflection that it never achieves its
subject's heart-pounding immediacy.

SMALL SCHOOL CLOSES IN ON A BIG RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUNDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The numbers indicate greatness: eight undefeated seasons, four
national championships, and a 145-16-3 record in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that the level of competition (Division 3)
diminishes those impressive numbers to some extent.
</P>
<P>
   Horsefeathers.
</P>
<P>
   Winning is winning, and when you have 47 consecutive victories,
as tiny Mount Union has over the past four seasons, you deserve all
the accolades you receive.
</P>
<P>
   The feel-good story of this college football season should be in
Alliance, Ohio, Saturday afternoon as the Purple Raiders go after
the record when they meet Otterbein.
</P>
<P>
   By winning _ and Mount Union is an overwhelming favorite _ the
Purple Raiders would break a tie with Oklahoma, which set the NCAA
record for consecutive wins in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Union coach Larry Kehres, who holds the all-time mark for
winning percentage (.811) among college football coaches (ahead of
No. 2 Knute Rockne and No. 3 Frank Leahy), understands the apples
and oranges aspect of the streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mount Union can't break Oklahoma's winning streak because they
are Division 1 and we're Division 3,'' says Kehres. ``If you were a
longtime Oklahoma person and heard some little school called Mount
Union is breaking your record, you'd go, `What are you talking
about?' I respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   As well he should. But what Mount Union has accomplished also
deserves recognition and respect.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Union has not lost since a 20-17 defeat at the hands of
Wisconsin-LaCrosse in the semifinals of the 1995 Division 3
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Which means: no bad games, no letdowns, no flat games. The team
has not lost a game in almost four seasons, not four weeks or four
months.
</P>
<P>
   And Kehres has done this going through a couple of recruiting
classes. It wasn't like he brought in a superstar class that kicked
butt for a few years and moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Those classes are gone, and Mount Union is still winning, still
adding to the streak.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the Purple Raiders have been lucky _ they survived a
57-51 triple-overtime battle against John Carroll two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma may have run up its winning streak from 1954 to '56
against tougher competition, but that competition is relative.
Division 3 football is not Division 1. There are no athletic
scholarships and the athletes are less-skilled, but Mount Union has
done it on a level playing field.
</P>
<P>
   You can argue the merits of the achievement all you want and
talk about how Oklahoma had to beat tougher competition. And that
may all be true.
</P>
<P>
   But the feat of winning 48 games in succession should not, must
not, be trivialized.
</P>
<P>
   In this era, when negative stories get more attention than
positive ones, Mount Union deserves the 15 minutes of national fame
it has received this week and will receive if it breaks the record.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mum's the word in Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State coach Joe Paterno has shut down the media's access to
his players this week in preparation for the Ohio State game,
barring all but three players from speaking.
</P>
<P>
   His argument is that the players are overwhelmed, not just by
the media, but by fans and autograph hounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they need a little time to themselves,'' said Paterno.
``I think this thing has gotten a little bit ridiculous, the amount
of time they have to give up to it. Someone complained to me that
they can't get things done, that there are a lot of things going
on. You keep forgetting that they are college students. You're the
first people that would crucify them if they don't go to class or
they flunk out of school or something happens to them. I've got to
protect them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine, Joe. Have it your way. But life is not just games on
Saturday afternoon. It's dealing with adversity, it's dealing with
pressures. It's what going to college is all about.
</P>
<P>
   By shutting down access, Paterno is making the game more
important than it is, saying this is a different week than any
other. If the routine is broken, the players might be more uptight
than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State coach John Cooper has made that mistake numerous
times before Buckeye games with Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State-Penn State is a big game, but there will be bigger
ones. There will be bigger things in the players' lives in the
future, far more than a simple game Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Talking to the media doesn't require a lot of time or effort. An
hour a week is enough in most instances. A few innocuous quotes,
and life goes on.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of life. Paterno, as much as anyone, should know that.
</P>
<P>
   Deal with it and move on. Don't make it bigger or more important
than it should be by breaking the routine.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno has chosen not to do that. If Penn State loses to Ohio
State, the finger will be pointed in a lot of directions, but not
at the media.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Pitt-fall for BC?
</P>
<P>
   The loss to Temple last Saturday exposed Boston College's
weaknesses and magnified the challenge the team now faces. At 4-1
(instead of 5-0), the Eagles will have to pull off a few upsets to
become bowl-eligible with six wins.
</P>
<P>
   The game against Pittsburgh Saturday looks like a tossup, with
the Eagles holding the home-field edge.
</P>
<P>
   After that, there are no guarantees. The Eagles could very well
lose all of their remaining games, which would put another dark
cloud over the program at The Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the uncertainty is the health of starting quarterback
Tim Hasselbeck, who injured his right shoulder in the 24-14 loss to
Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tom O'Brien's dilemma is clear. Hasselbeck might be
healthy enough to play, but also fragile enough that one hit could
sideline him for several weeks or the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   What should O'Brien do?
</P>
<P>
   He could sit Hasselbeck for a week to get him healthy and play
Brian St. Pierre instead. If he does that and St. Pierre has a
strong game to help beat Pittsburgh, O'Brien's got a quarterback
dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   All of that makes Saturday's game the biggest of the season for
BC, one that could determine the course of the season and the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Either the Eagles move on and build, or they fall back into what
could be another deadly 4-7 season.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big East feast
</P>
<P>
   The Big East finally has a national marquee game. Syracuse at
Virginia Tech has drawn the ESPN Game Day traveling set to
Blacksburg, Va. It will be the first time a Big East game has been
covered by the network's top crew . . . With Florida State's Peter
Warrick sitting out another game because of legal problems, the
wide receiver's quest for the Heisman Trophy becomes more
difficult. The character issue involved in committing what was a
petty crime (paying less than 10 percent for more than $400 worth
of merchandise) is not as important to many voters as simply not
playing in games . . . The first BCS ratings, which will determine
the teams in the Sugar Bowl Jan. 4, come out next week. Right now,
Florida State and Nebraska are 1-2, which could be a problem for
undefeated Virginia Tech and Penn State if everyone runs the table.

`BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS' LACKS BITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Breakfast of Champions'' is a well-intended film of Kurt
Vonnegut Jr.'s satiric novel about America's consumer society
consuming itself. But it's largely a misfire, possibly because its
adapter and director, Alan Rudolph, is better suited to mood pieces
than to the madcap energies of Vonnegut's barbed but humanistic
farce. Or maybe Rudolph just waited too long and the vital impulses
that would have fueled the film expired during its long gestation
period, which began with Rudolph writing an adaptation while
working for Robert Altman in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Rudolph and an obviously devoted cast put the material
onscreen with a will, even though the source of the social toxins
in the novel has shifted from the Vietnam War to a mindless runaway
consumerism. As the film opens, its slaves in a manically upbeat
town called Midland City are feeling hollowed out and lost to
themselves while they turn the very land beneath their feet into
festering sewage so that the local factories with their belching
smokestacks can turn out things nobody needs, like
raspberry-flavored air freshener. With an almost too-perfect
symmetry, Bruce Willis's Dwayne Hoover, the richest man in town, is
feeling the most alienated and despairing.
</P>
<P>
   Willis's go-get-'em car dealer, who hard-sells the wares on the
lot at his Exit 11 Motor Village in a manner even more lifeless
than his obvious hairpiece, begins each day by sticking a gun
barrel into his mouth and getting closer and closer to pulling the
trigger. His underutilized wife, played by Barbara Hershey, pines
away in front of the TV between suicide attempts, depressed at his
absence from their life and his refusal to even try to talk to her.
His sales manager, Nick Nolte, lives in fear that his pastime of
dressing in frilly ladies' underwear will be discovered. His
secretary, played with a drolly amusing demure insincerity by
Glenne Headly, dutifully services him with quickies in the motel he
owns, hoping he'll reciprocate by setting her up with a fast-food
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes. Not knowing how to blast out of his rut, he
desperately lunges at enlightenment when his path converges with
that of a crumpled old failure of a writer whose philosophical
ramblings have remained unpublished except as filler in porn
magazines. Kilgore Trout is the name of this pillar of literary
futility (and Vonnegut's alter ego), who appears regularly in
Vonnegut's novels. Failure though he is, he at least maintains a
crumpled integrity, even though, in his own words, he spent his
life looking for art and beauty and ``didn't find doodly-squat.''
Albert Finney dodders good-naturedly through the role of the
old-timer coming to Midland City to be honored by the local art
mavens (an excuse for Vonnegut and Rudolph to tee off on art
poseurs).
</P>
<P>
   But by the time Dwayne and Kilgore collide, the film has pretty
much capsized. Willis and Nolte, trapped in caricature, are
consumed by it as it becomes glumly apparent that there is to be no
escalation to the demented giddiness ``Breakfast of Champions''
needs. For the record, let it be noted that Vonnegut can be seen in
a cameo, as a TV director shooting a commercial at the dealership
littered with self-motivational tools, like the sign over the
full-length mirror that says, ``You look like a winner.'' The
problem faced by ``Breakfast of Champions'' on the eve of the
millennium is that a lot of its satiric targets have been surpassed
by the even more outrageous and relentless iron rule of real-life
marketing. Consumerism is running more amok than ever, but this
satire of it isn't. The Shopping Network is wilder.

`ANIMALS' A TELLING LOOK AT HUMAN HEALING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``All the Little Animals'' is a satisfying British film about
damage and redemption, given a benevolent back-to-nature twist. It
begins with a boy, Christian Bale's Bobby, who never has been whole
following a head injury. An even bigger blow befalls him when his
protecting mother dies and he finds himself at the mercy of an evil
stepfather. As played by Daniel Benzali, the greedy arriviste named
De Winter suggests a malevolent iceberg advancing slowly and
determinedly toward the boy, meaning to simultaneously freeze and
crush the life out of him so he can grab the department store the
boy inherited. When The Fat _ as Bobby has nicknamed his sinister
relative _ asphyxiates Bobby's pet mouse, Bobby correctly reads it
as a sign of things to come, and runs away, to Cornwall.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, or, to be more accurate, at the side of it, he
meets a grizzled, eccentric loner contrastingly named Summers. As
played by John Hurt, Summers mumbles to himself, is habituated to a
nip of Scotch but otherwise lives simply in a rough cabin in the
woods, and hides what his eyes tell us is a caring soul beneath a
cranky exterior. Occupying a patch of mythic turf somewhere between
Tolkien and A.A. Milne, Summers _ the perhaps too obvious polar
opposite of De Winter _ keeps busy by burying roadkill, tenderly
laying the small animals in the ground and cursing the cars and
drivers that killed them. His idea of a preemptive strike involves
a nocturnal invasion of a rich butterfly-collector's lawn and
freeing a tentful of moths lured into it by a light.
</P>
<P>
   Under his ministrations, Bobby blooms as he never did back in
so-called civilization. Jeremy Thomas, making his directorial
debut, catches the intimacy with nature so highly prized by the
English, who have preserved at least this patch of the West Country
from encroaching modernization.
</P>
<P>
   As we feel Bobby gather strength and competence, we know
there'll be a clash between Summers and De Winter, that Bobby will
be in the middle of it, and that we will bring to it a rooting
interest. The settings in Cornwall and on the Isle of Man count for
a lot. So do conviction and an offbeat story. They override
predictability in the involvingly acted, surehandedly crafted ``All
the Little Animals.''

FOLLOWING TRADITION, OCTOBER SPOOKS INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a typical October. The weather is beautiful; the leaves are
changing colors; the New York Yankees are still playing baseball.
And oh yes, the stock market is in a funk.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 54 points Thursday after
losing a total of more than 400 points the previous two days. At
10,286.61, the Dow is off nearly 10 percent from its August high.
</P>
<P>
   This October's damage pales in comparison to Octobers past. The
crashes of 1929 and 1987 both happened in October. But investors
are clearly in an edgy, almost frightened state. When Raytheon
announced a major earnings disappointment this week, its stock fell
44 percent in a single day. Intel and Tyco International, two
blue-chip stocks, have seen their share prices drop sharply in
response to small doses of bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Need more evidence that people are spooked? According to Syl
Marquardt, research director at John Hancock Funds, a popular
survey of investor sentiment he tracks is registering its gloomiest
reading in 20 years. Only 35 percent of stock market investors and
24 percent of bond market investors currently identify themselves
as bullish.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the fact that it is October, what is making investors so
skittish? Economists and money managers we interviewed Thursday
came up with a long list of things worth worrying about.
</P>
<P>
   They include:
</P>
<P>
   --Rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rates would have to be the number one problem,'' says Wayne
Ayers, chief economist at Fleet Boston Corp. The Federal Reserve
didn't hike rates at its last meeting but the central bank said it
was leaning toward a rate hike in the future.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't hard to see why. The American jobless rate is at a low
4.2 percent; wages are climbing; oil prices are rising; and the
economy shows very few signs of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   Put it all together and you get the possibility of more
inflation, even if the actual evidence of inflation is hard to
find. Fearful investors Thursday pushed the yield on the 30-year
Treasury bond to a two-year high in anticipation of coming bad news
on the inflation front.
</P>
<P>
   --A falling dollar.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, the strong dollar has been a boon to the
stock market. It has kept import prices low and made the United
States a magnet for foreign investment. Lately the dollar has been
weakening, especially against the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US is not the only game in town anymore,'' says Allen
Sinai, chief economist at Primark Decision Economics. Improving
economies in Asia and Europe are attracting investment money, which
in turn strengthens foreign currencies against the dollar. Because
the US needs foreign capital to finance its trade deficit, the weak
dollar puts upward pressure on interest rates _ bad news for
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   --High stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the recent selloff, the value the market is putting on
stocks is still ``sky high,'' says Mark Zandi, chief economist at
RFA Dismal Sciences, a Pennsylvania forecasting firm.
</P>
<P>
   According to Zandi, the market as a whole is trading at about 30
times earnings, far above historical norms. The high number
reflects an optimism about future earnings that may be difficult to
satisfy, say money managers, especially if higher interest rates
slow the economy next year.
</P>
<P>
   As defense contractor Raytheon found out this week, companies
that fail to meet earnings targets quickly come under attack from
hostile investors.
</P>
<P>
   --The market's dependence on the technology giants.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of big technology stocks, including Cisco Systems,
Microsoft, and IBM, have managed to soar this year while the rest
of the stock market has fallen to earth. Along with a few big
Internet names, such as Yahoo, the tech giants account for much of
the stock market's progress in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   If one of the giants stumbles, says Thomas O'Neill, chief
investment officer at Fleet Boston, ``you could see the whole
market wash out.''
</P>
<P>
   --Everything else.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is entering the presidential campaign season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always uncertainty around an election,'' says Sinai.
Will a new president radically change economic policy? Health care
policy? No one knows.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign politics could be worrisome too. What if Pakistan's new
government takes a confrontational stance toward India? What if
India gets nasty in response?
</P>
<P>
   And then there is always Y2K. The conventional wisdom is that
the year 2000 problem was overblown all along. But what if the
conventional wisdom has it all wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Syl Marquardt of John Hancock says investors are overly worried
at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be leaning against the wind at this point,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Marquardt may be right. But just in case he isn't, don't walk
under any ladders until October is over.

THE TWO WOMEN BEHIND `THE MILLION DOLLAR MERMAID' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE MILLION DOLLAR MERMAID &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Esther Williams, with Digby Diehl &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster, 416 pp., illustrated, $26 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Million Dollar Mermaid'' almost seems the stories of two
different women. There's the public Esther Williams, the
hard-working movie star strong and talented enough to succeed in
the grinding Hollywood studio system. And there's the private
Williams, looking for love in all the wrong places.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, MGM signed the tall, beautiful 19-year-old swimming
champion to do with water what skater Sonja Henie had done with
ice; i.e., make the studio lots of money. And she did. In the 1940s
and '50s, Williams starred in one water-borne movie musical
extravaganza after another. Her films were kitschy even in their
day. The public loved them. Williams wasn't much of an actor, but
she didn't need to be, as long as she was in or near the water.
</P>
<P>
   Even before publication some of the choicest bits in this
undeniably juicy Hollywood memoir found their way into the gossip
columns, most notably Williams's defrocking, so to speak, of he-man
actor Jeff Chandler. She describes the moment she found her fiance
in ``red wig, a flowered chiffon dress, expensive high-heeled shoes
and lots of makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible not to feel a little sorry for Chandler, being
``outed'' as a transvestite at this late date.
</P>
<P>
   But that's show biz. That's show biz memoir, anyway, a genre in
which the departed are fair game.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many before her, Williams understandably prefers to tell
tales about those who are no longer in a position to protest. Joan
Crawford. Ava Gardner. Clark Gable. Bette Davis. Marlene Dietrich.
Gene Kelly. Busby Berkeley. Louis B. Mayer. It's what sells, after
all.
</P>
<P>
   One surprising revelation is that Williams tried LSD. Following
the lead of Cary Grant, an outspoken proponent of LSD-assisted
psychotherapy, Williams took LSD in 1950, under the direction of a
psychiatrist. Back then, the drug was being tested as an aid to
``instant psychoanalysis.'' It worked, for Williams, or so she
writes. It enabled her to understand that at age 8, she had
subconsciously taken on the persona of her older brother, a
promising actor who died at 16. She believes that incorporating her
brother made her driven to succeed, as well as driven to take care
of those around her.
</P>
<P>
   Williams grew up in a poor family. As a teenager, she was
sexually abused by a foster brother, and took refuge in competitive
swimming.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she was 18, she was national champion in five events
and headed for the 1940 Olymics. When World War II broke out, she
instead joined impresario Billy Rose's Aquacade, a swimming show in
which she starred with the first Tarzan, Johnny Weismuller, who
groped her relentlessly underwater and shed his suit at every
opportunity to show off his ``remarkable genitalia.''
</P>
<P>
   The offer of an MGM contract rescued Williams from the Aquacade
and delivered her to Louis B. Mayer. In fairly short order she was
bending down to kiss Mickey Rooney in ``Andy Hardy's Double Life.''
Her career was launched. She went on to make a series of popular,
if seldom critically acclaimed, movies, and piles of money for MGM.
</P>
<P>
   Williams's personal life was less successful than the
MGM-generated image; i.e., a combination of perfect homemaker and
glamorous movie star. At 19, she was married, briefly, to a premed
student. Her second marriage, to band singer Ben Gage, lasted 13
years and produced three children, but it was far from a happy
union. Gage was an alcoholic who squandered her money on gambling
and good times and left her $750,000 in debt to the IRS. Williams
admits that during their marriage she took comfort elsewhere,
ranging from Victor Mature (``a strong and fulfilling lover: Even
better than I had fantasized''), to Clifford Odets (``It had been a
long time since I'd had a conversation with a man who was
intellectually stimulating''), among others.
</P>
<P>
   Williams's third marriage, to Fernando Lamas, in 1961 seems to
have been both the best and the worst of her relationships. The
term ``self-centered'' barely begins to describe Lamas. The
handsome, charming Argentinian actor emerges from these pages
almost as a parody of Billy ``You look maahvelous!'' Crystal's
parody of him. Lamas wanted nothing to do with Williams's three
children. He didn't even allow them in the house he and Williams
shared.
</P>
<P>
   Lamas also demanded that she ``give up being Esther Williams,''
retire from movies, and wait on him full time. It was their
``deal.'' She loved him, and in his way, he loved her, but she paid
an enormous price for that love.
</P>
<P>
   After Lamas died in 1982, Williams rediscovered herself. She
made a popular swimming instruction video for babies and started
designing swimsuits under her own label. She married again, a
former college professor, Edward Bell. And she found that she was
``godmother'' to a new Olympic sport, synchronized swimming, a
perfect role for the movies' one and only mermaid.

COUPLE OF LONG SHOTS COULDN'T COME THROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is no famous wall here like there is in Boston.
Or at least there isn't supposed to be one. But as the Red Sox made
their way home early this morning, there were two images flashing
in each player's head. There was a constant, frustrating backdrop
in each image: a light blue wall.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Sox, they have a lot in common with the
two well-hit baseballs that traveled to the edge of the Yankee
Stadium outfield Thursday &UR;  &LR; night. Like the baseballs, the Sox
traveled a fair distance before finding themselves falling just
short, up against the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The facts are that the Sox trail the Yankees in the American
League Championship Series, 2 games to 0. Two more losses, and
their season is over. The cruel underbelly to those facts is that
we could easily be saying the same thing about the Yankees.
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, the New Yorkers beat the Sox, 3-2. The Sox were
seven or eight inches from winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must work for Home Depot, selling lumber or something,''
Jimy Williams said when someone posed the seven-inches-from-victory
question to him. ``You are about right. I guess I'm being a wise
guy, but you are about right.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, Jason Varitek hit a towering fly ball to
right field. It appeared to be leaving the park easily. But the
ball landed about five or six inches from the top of the fence. In
the eighth, Troy O'Leary sent a ball toward the 385-foot sign in
right-center. ``I wasn't sure if 'Tek's ball was going to go,''
teammate Butch Huskey said of Varitek, ``but I thought Troy's was
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't. The ball hit just above the ``5'' in 385, two inches
from the top of the wall. Seven or eight inches from a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game was won and lost by inches,'' Varitek said.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall, Yankees second baseman Chuck Knoblauch had no
sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, hang in there,'' he said of the Sox' near misses. ``Our
fences are the right height. What can I say? They always say
baseball is a game of inches, and sometimes it proves to be
right.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes baseball so intriguing and disturbing is games like
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night's. Tino Martinez hit a home run, and it covered 358
feet. Nomar Garciaparra hit a home run and it went 368 feet.
Varitek and O'Leary launched balls that were in the 385-foot range,
and both stayed in the park, becoming a triple and double,
respectively. In both cases, neither man was brought home by a
teammate. The intelligent thing to say, then, was that the Sox did
not take care of their business with runners in scoring position
(they stranded 13). But they were not in the mood to talk about
intelligence. What they felt Thursday &UR;  &LR; night was raw, piercing
depression.
</P>
<P>
   Inside their visiting clubhouse, a few players were able to
smile at the irony of the night. Others cursed nearby reporters.
During this season, the Sox have gained a reputation as a
resilient, gritty team. But no one wanted to talk about that
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night. The Sox are like the guy who has heard, too many
times, the same line from the girl he loves: ``Hey, you're a nice
guy, but you're like a brother to me . . . '' The Sox didn't want
to be the little brother Thursday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Lowe was asked how close the Sox were to homering. He used
a metric-system reference.
</P>
<P>
   ``About a centimeter,'' the reliever said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Sox won't say it, but they need something
extraordinary from Pedro Martinez Saturday. Something very close to
the 17-strikeout performance they got on Sept. 10. They got good
performances in the first two games and have nothing to show for
them. So the truth is that being good is not good enough against
this team. It's akin to taking a championship from an incumbent
heavyweight. If you want to beat him, you cannot match him blow for
blow. You have to knock him out.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the final should have been 4-3, Sox,
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, Boston still did some things that, if they
continue, will have them sitting at home Monday morning. In the
eighth, with a runner on third base and one man out, Huskey could
not bring O'Leary home with a sacrifice fly. You could make the
argument that Trot Nixon should have never been pinch-hit for _ and
I would buy the argument _ but anyone at the plate in that
situation has to be able to bring the runner home. If Huskey had
done that, it would have been a tie game at 3-all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was put in a situation to be successful,'' Huskey said,
``and I didn't do it. I'll have to go get them tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   True. But the recurring images are of that wall and those fly
balls, rising and then crashing at the top of the wall. That
happened twice. Huskey was asked about the symbolism of being seven
or eight inches short of a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' the big outfielder said, ``the wall is too big.''

BABBITT PROMOTES EFFORTS TO PREDICT EARTHQUAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The old dream of earthquake prediction has
faded in recent years, but it lives on in the heart of at least one
top U.S. official: Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt visited a quake conference in Oakland on Thursday to
reassure the geological community of his commitment to an increased
budget for their research.
</P>
<P>
   Just as hurricane forecasters have greatly improved their own
forecasts in recent years, and just as volcano experts can better
foresee volcanic eruptions than ever before, quake predictors might
one day anticipate specific quakes with surprising precision, said
Babbitt, who was trained as a geologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``When will we be able to come to the public and say (a quake
will occur) at 2:01 p.m. on April 21 of a given year? There's a lot
of reason to think we will get there; we're not there yet,''
Babbitt said at the General Assembly of the Association of Bay Area
Governments.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt, 61, cautioned that the breakthrough in quake prediction
would not come soon _ ``not in my lifetime. But in coming
centuries, the answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited the U.S. Geological Survey's successful forecast of a
volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines as an
example of what scientists can achieve when they put their minds to
it.
</P>
<P>
   At the same meeting, USGS scientist David Schwartz formally
unveiled the agency's long-awaited ``probabilities'' report
estimating the likelihood of another big quake in the San Francisco
Bay area. The report concluded there are 70 percent odds of an
earthquake measuring magnitude 6.7 or worse over the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz's quake-casting report is different from the kind of
quake-predicting prophesied by Babbitt. While Schwartz's forecast
involves probability estimates over a few decades, Babbitt hopes
for far more specific forecasts that target fairly specific times,
dates and places for quakes.
</P>
<P>
   Many seismologists have lost hope for such specific predictions,
partly because of the perceived failure of the USGS' highly
publicized ``Parkfield prediction experiment'' in Parkfield, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Parkfield area has experienced a quake of about magnitude 6
an average of once every 22 years. Hence geologists predicted
another one would strike in the early 1990s. It has not happened _
not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Parkfield experiment _ which maintains an extensive
array of scientific instruments, from lasers to seismographs,
scattered across the cow-and-wildcat-sprinkled hills of Central
California _ must continue, Babbitt told a news conference after
his talk.

THE SEASON OF THE HUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, Maine _ Already the October gales have powdered the
high country with snow, already taken the edge off the colors that
swell in the valleys below the hilltops.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, generations of American males have felt a stirring
restlessness in the fall, an anticipation as strong as the promise
of spring. It is the season of the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Through late summer into September, fathers would take sons _
and occasionally daughters (there are whole hunting families) _
into the woods to look for signs.
</P>
<P>
   This is the season when hunters try to figure out the living
patterns of the deer they intend to hunt. Where is the path to
water? Where are the yards? Do they feed on that ridge or the
valley below?
</P>
<P>
   Down on the coast, waterfowlers make repairs to marsh blinds,
camouflage their duck boats, and watch the marsh for activity. Much
can be learned from the first movements of waterfowl in the flyway.
</P>
<P>
   And all is done in the anticipation of a huge season. The hunt
is as deeply ingrained in our psyches as the harvest.
</P>
<P>
   The first boom of shotguns out on the marsh was the very sound
of civility, if not conviviality. Like fishing and gathering of all
kinds, hunting is near some seat of the soul.
</P>
<P>
   And though there have been women hunters and anglers, the
father-son generational bond was the very heart of hunting.
</P>
<P>
   But in closing the century, the figures are clear _ hunting is
on the decline. Where the last, most active hunting generations
were during the war years, the baby boomers they spawned faced the
first problems of the ``modern'' world.
</P>
<P>
   The increase of land postings (as urban folk seek to gentrify
and develop the wilderness) and a rising aversion to violence
rising out of the 1960s created the first generational
disconnection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Generation Xers,'' said Maine deer biologist Gerry
Lavigne, ``are being recruited into hunting at half the rate of the
boomers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavigne, whose demographic study of Maine deer hunters echoes
the declining national trend, said that since the early 1980s
through the '90s, as the Generation Xers have grown into adulthood,
the number of hunters has dropped by 16 percent, even as the deer
herd has grown.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Lavigne said, Maine had more licensed hunters (214,000)
than whitetail deer (160,000). But last year, Maine's deer herd
burgeoned to 292,000 as the number of deer licenses dropped to
180,000.
</P>
<P>
   That number is bound to decrease ever faster. With much fewer
hunters coming north to take the places of their fathers, the math
is simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two sons, and I always kind of envisioned bringing them
hunting,'' said Cliff, a Portland native who asked that his family
name not be used. ``Until about five years ago, I used to do at
least a few days with my dad, but he can't go out anymore. And my
boys never had any interest. One was into football and the other
was a big skier, but neither one of them wanted to go hunt with Dad
and me. It's wasn't like they hated the idea, they just didn't seem
to have time to get into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the times. (The kids) just seem to have busier
lives, and it's not as if they grew up in the woods like I did.''
</P>
<P>
   But therein is the irony. The fastest growth of Maine's deer
population has not been in the wilderness or forests, but rather in
the state's most populous corridor, from Kittery to Brunswick,
bordered between the coast and the Maine Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   Firearm discharge ordinances make some pockets of southern Maine
so deer-infested that it's impossible to grow crops or even keep a
garden. Forest degradation, traffic hazards, and even disease
become issues in suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   In central Maine, the population density stands at around 25
deer per square mile. Some pockets of southern Maine, such as the
coastal islands and Falmouth Foreside, a seaside suburb of
Portland, the figure rises as high as 100 deer per square mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's worse,'' said Lavigne, ``is that Lyme disease (spread
by ticks) is endemic to the deer population.''
</P>
<P>
   Expanding the seasons and liberalizing the bag limits and other
regulations are but a few strategies available to control deer
populations. Maine has changed to smaller management areas and
expanded the archery season, and such tactics could result in more
efficient managing of whitetails.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a larger picture. As urbanites heading for the
wide-open spaces erect the fences that close them down, and as a
new generation never learns what some old sportsmen now simply
refer to as ``the old ways,'' the movement underway in sport
hunting is seemingly irreversible.

STICK WITH THE COMPANY 401(K)
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 37 and earn $110,000 a year. My wife is at home with our
children, aged 4, 3, and 1. I put the maximum 16 percent allowed
into my company's 401(k) plan until I hit the $10,000 annual cap
for pre-tax contributions. I then contribute on an after-tax basis
at the 6 percent level until the end of each year, as the company
will match up to that amount with 80 percent of my contribution
with its own stock. Because of this, I haven't looked into a Roth
IRA. I currently have about $205,000 in the 401(k), which is my
only retirement savings. I would like to retire at age 55. What do
you think of my position? I assume I will be able to withdraw from
the 401(k) with a 10 percent penalty until I reach age 59 1/2.
Would I be better off with some other vehicle after I hit the
$10,000 pretax cap on the 401(k). What do you think of my
allocation, which I attach? J.H., Cape Cod, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm not sure how to read this one. If your employer matches
80 percent of all of your contributions, you should be in nice
shape, with $2,231,850 in your retirement savings at age 55. This
assumes average portfolio growth of 10 percent and continued
contributions at current levels. It would be enough to allow you to
continue living at your current lifestyle, even after factoring in
the effects of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But if your employer only matches the after-tax contributions, I
think you've set yourself a pretty ambitious goal, and perhaps an
unrealistic one. Suppose you contribute $1,466 a month to the
401(k) until about the end of July of each year, at which point you
reduce contributions to $550 a month. The annual level of your
contributions is $10,000 on a pre-tax basis, $2,750 after-tax, plus
a $2,200 match in company stock.
</P>
<P>
   Under that scenario, if the plan produced total returns of 10
percent annually for the next 18 years, you would accumulate about
$1,850,000 at age 55.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds like an impressive number, but let's analyze your
needs. After all of your savings, including college savings for
your children, you have a current income of $92,250. If inflation
runs at 3.5 percent for the next 18 years, you will need $171,353
to buy the same goods and services that $92,250 buys today. If you
wanted to make these withdrawals without depleting your nest egg,
you would need a 9.3 percent yield. And that would also leave you
no money at work to protect yourself from the effects of future
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   So if the company match is limited to your after-tax
contributions, it leaves you with a pair of unpleasant options. One
is to consider targeting a later retirement date, and the other is
to step up your savings.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether to set up an Roth IRA instead of the after-tax
contributions to the 401(k), it would be silly to forsake that 80
percent match from your employer, since that money, too, would be
locked up until age 59 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   But if you do decide to save more and to stick with the age-55
retirement target, you should make these savings in taxable
accounts, which will then be available to help you through the 54
months until you can withdraw from your tax-deferred accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Your 401(k) portfolio looks fine to me _ a little less than half
in a US Index fund, a little more than a quarter in your company's
stock, and the rest nicely apportioned among domestic and global
balanced funds, small cap, international stock, and US growth, and
telecommunications sector funds. I also liked your recent portfolio
move, away from large-cap US growth to the small cap and
international positions.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, while I don't have space to go into detail, I suggest
you stop saving for your children's education in UGMA and Education
IRA accounts and put future college savings in your own name.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will be 42 in December and am in the process of a divorce.
I earn $80,000 per year and expect to get about $1,500 a month in
support for my daughters (ages 11 and 14) until they reach 18. I
currently have $106,000 in my previous employer's cash account
pension plan, and $60,000 in my previous employer's 401(k) plan,
both of which I plan to roll over into my new employer's 401(k)
plan. In addition, I have a $19,000 IRA invested in Fidelity Growth
and Income fund to which I no longer contribute. My priority is to
build my retirement funds and retire as early as possible. Is it
realistic to retire at age 55 or 57, and what type of investment
mix should I pursue when I roll my funds into the new 401(k) plan?
M.M., Hampstead, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. The missing element here is how much you plan to save. You
certainly have a nice start, and if you simply left that $185,000
in retirement savings alone and if you achieved 10 percent average
annual investment returns, your accumulation would be $702,000
after 14 years, when you are age 56. Were you to save 15 percent of
your current salary, or $1,000 a month, the total would be
$1,053,619, using the same assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   If you read the discussion of inflation in the answer to J.H.
above, you'll probably see that while you could probably manage a
retirement with such a plan, it would be far from comfortable and
assured. I suggest you save (but not invest) as aggressively as you
can, and consider that a likely retirement age in the range 58 to
60 is more realistic than 55 to 57.
</P>
<P>
   As for investments, you don't supply information about the
available options, but I suggest you put about 50 percent of your
money in a large-cap domestic stock fund, ideally one managed to
duplicate the results of the Standard and Poor's 500 index. I would
then divide the remainder, more or less evenly, among a mid-cap
stock fund, a small-cap stock fund, an international (not global)
stock fund, and, if available, a health care fund.
</P>
<P>
   One strategy which might serve you well would be to adopt a
discipline of adding to your retirement savings each time you get a
raise, maintaining the 15 percent savings level. Thus with decent
raises, you would increase your accumulation and improve the
chances of retiring earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a 65-year-old retiree, recently widowed, and have
recently begun monthly withdrawals of $3,000 from my retirement
savings. My IRA consists of $63,000 in Vanguard Prime Money Market
fund, $123,000 in Vanguards Index 500, $52,000 in its Index Value,
$103,000 in its Balanced Index. I also have an IRA of $95,000 in a
bank CD, which will mature in six months. What can you suggest to
maintain the $3,000 monthly income stream as I move towards an
income-oriented portfolio? R.J., Oceanside, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. To be honest, in addition to quickly moving to a fixed-income
portfolio, I think you should rework your budget. If you achieved
average 6.5 percent portfolio returns, your sequence of $3,000
monthly withdrawals would deplete your savings in a little more
than 23 years. If you were able to manage a 10 percent reduction,
the sequence of withdrawals would stretch over 30 years before the
money is gone.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion would be to reduce the stock side of the portfolio
to no more than 20 percent, and to move the balance to fixed-income
holdings. Since all of the money is in IRA accounts, there will be
no short-term tax effect of changing your holdings, so I would work
out a portfolio where about 50 percent of your fixed-income money
is in Vanguard GNMA, about 20 percent in Vanguard High-Yield
Corporate Bond fund, and the rest in short-and-safe holdings such
as CDs, money markets, or the Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond
fund.
</P>
<P>
   If you do maintain 20 percent of your savings on the stock side,
your average portfolio returns should be a little better than the
6.5 percent upon which I based my calculations, thus providing you
with some protection against the inflation which is likely to come
in the later years of your retirement.

GOOD TILER, BAD GROUTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, October 17, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The tiler did a good job of laying ceramic tiles on my
kitchen floor, but a lousy job of grouting. The grout lines are
sloppy, up to 1/4 inch wide, and are bumpy, not at all smooth. How
can I correct this? Can I put new grout over the grout that is
there now?
</P>
<P>
   RAY REICHEL, Quincy, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I am not sure he did such a hot job on the tile laying,
either, because 1/4 inch is a bit wide for space between tiles. You
can't do anything about those wide joints, and you can't put new
grout over the old. However, the joints might look 1/4 inch thick
because excess grout has gotten on the face of the tile; you will
find this out when you scrape out the old grout.
</P>
<P>
   The tiler should scrape out the grout and put new in, but if he
cannot or will not, then you have to do it yourself. My own tiler
asked if I would do the grouting because he knew I'd do it better
than he could. Well, flattery will get you anywhere, and the
handyman took the bait and did it. You can bet it's a good job.
</P>
<P>
   Dig out all the old grout to the full depth and full width of
the joints. You can buy a tool for this purpose, but a cold chisel
or extra-stiff-bladed knife will do. Then put in new grout, and put
it in very, very compactly; if you don't compact it completely, it
will fail in months.
</P>
<P>
   To grout, use a sanded grout, which is best for floors and for
wide joints.
</P>
<P>
   Mix the grout thoroughly so that it is just a shade
free-flowing, not crumbly as mortar should be. You could buy,
instead, a ready-mixed grout of the right consistency. Plop a large
dollop on the floor, and spread it into joints with a rubber
squeegee. And, press more into the joint with the edge of the
squeegee. Press and press and press! That's important. After 15
minutes or so, squeegee off excess grout from the face of the tile,
and a bit off the joints so that the grout fills the joint without
overflowing on the face of the tile. Then wipe the floor with a
damp sponge, well squeezed out. When the floor dries, it will leave
a dry haze of grout; wipe this off with a dry cloth.
</P>
<P>
   What color grout? You asked the wrong _ or right _ person. The
handyman suggests black, or a dark color, which will provide a nice
contrast to the tile and will not show the dirt, mildew and other
crud that gets onto and into light-colored grout.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some of the joints in my mortared fieldstone foundation leak,
so I repointed them, filling them with hydraulic cement. So far, no
leaks. Can I skimcoat the foundation to help prevent future leaks
and make it look better than it does now?
</P>
<P>
   JIM KEATING, Melrose, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. A skimcoat might be good for looks, but unlikely to prevent
future leaks; the hydraulic cement, which expands as it sets, has
made very tight joints, and basically that is all you want. To
skimcoat, you have to apply a bonding agent to the foundation
first. So, instead, try this: Apply a coat of cement-based paint to
the wall; this is a powder that you mix with water and scrub on the
walls; it will not do much for the stone but will reduce seepage in
the joints. And it will look good.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I paint a galvanized steel garage? There is a lot of
peeling, and I'd like to know how to seal the finish and any paint
that remains after I scrape.
</P>
<P>
   CHRSTINE LARSON, Dedham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Paint does not need sealing, and it is not possible to seal
steel, galvanized steel, or other metal. But you can prime it.
Chances are fair to good that the old paint peeled because there
was no primer applied. To prepare, scrape and sand as much paint as
is going to come off. Then apply a primer; for metal the best
primer is a zinc-rich metal primer, usually the godawfulest yellow
color you ever saw. Finish with an oil-based house paint; latex
paint could cause rust spots to show where it hits bare steel. As
always, apply thin coats.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The paint on my house blisters only when it rains; the
blisters are full of water; it dribbles out when I break the
blisters. It happens mostly on the northeast side. What do I need:
New siding? Stain? Or new shingles?
</P>
<P>
   JIM MAHONEY, Foxborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. What you have is a water problem, originating behind the
shingles or clapboards or whatever wood you have on the house. As
for your other questions, no to siding; that only covers the
problem, and is ugly as sin anyway. Yes to stain; you could remove
all the paint and put on a semitransparent stain, which will
accommodate the water and not peel but might not be compatible with
the rest of the house. Yes to new shingles. You could remove all
those old shingles and put up white cedar shingles, let them
weather and never touch them for 40 years. That, too, might not be
compatible with the rest of the house, and it will not exactly
solve the water problem, but the water will go through the shingles
and should not cause any more things like those water-filled
blisters.

IN ROME EVERYONE IS STYLISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL VIRTANEN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Rome, the women walk in high shoes and the men wear tight
pants and everyone is stylish.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half the people smoke, too, but they do it stylishly
especially on motor scooters rounding tight turns at 40 mph in a
crowd of fast, small vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The Romans are sleek and slender and smartly turned out and talk
to one another with cheerful animation, sometimes even while riding
on their motorbikes, called motorinas.
</P>
<P>
   The tourists from all over _ and there were a considerable
number considering it was low season in late August _ can be found
on the Spanish steps at any time of the day or evening. They lounge
on the stone stairs in the Roman sunshine and gather around the
fountain to cool off or take photographs of themselves and one
another.
</P>
<P>
   They're not so stylish as the Romans, but for tourists they're
pretty good. Perhaps most understand the standards set by the
Romans, or perhaps a little fashion rubs off after a few days.
</P>
<P>
   In a place of narrow streets, broad piazzas and extraordinary
beauty, in a culture deeply rooted in classical aesthetics, where
antiquities stand in the midst of day-to-day life, where dining out
is a leisurely four-course affair with wine and bottled water,
where cafes are as common as treasures in the 55 galleries of the
Vatican museum or stray cats by the Colosseum, it's difficult not
to be affected.
</P>
<P>
   For travelers, there's a hedonistic Mediterranean undercurrent,
as if the old Roman Empire faded but the toga party never quite
did, that living itself might be fine art _ a Botticelli or Bernini
sentient and in motion. Which is heady if you give yourself over to
it. Buona sera.
</P>
<P>
   Or else it's a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   They lost my bag on the flight over, somewhere between
Philadelphia and the DaVinci airport. Or else it was held back in
customs, perhaps by the fashion police who examined its contents.
By our second afternoon in Rome, it was still missing, driving me
into the fashionable shops in the old city, near our hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In the shops, the clerks prefer to help you find a garment,
rather than letting you handle all their goods, and I came away
with a shirt and a pair of tight pants. (My wife and daughter had
found the shops much earlier and came away with shoes, sweaters,
I'm still not sure what else.)
</P>
<P>
   Late that evening, after a fine dinner at the rooftop cafe of
our small hotel, the Valadier, the missing bag arrived. The next
morning we left, taking the slow train north into Tuscany, heading
to an artful week at a flat in Florence, driving out one day for a
long, slow, sun-washed day at the beach at Viareggio. By now it was
September, low season at the coast, and many of the beach chairs
and umbrellas were unoccupied.
</P>
<P>
   The last afternoon, on the way back to Rome, we stopped to lunch
and stroll in the medieval hilltop city of Perugia, with its
university students and odd bloody history.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the rental car wasn't too difficult except the evening
we were lost on the winding, one-way streets of Florence, trying to
find the way back to the apartment. The Italian drivers were fast
but not aggressive in the American fashion, especially the stylish
women on the motorinas.

UNDATED: Cookies are introduced. 1975: The word ``fajita'' appears
in print for the first time. From the Spanish ``faja,'' for
``girdle'' or ``strip,'' the word actually means the cut of meat
itself. Cooking the meat over wood has always been a Texas
tradition, but how the name derived is anyone's guess _ including
that of Homero Recio, who used a fellowship to Texas A&AMP;M in 1984 to
study the subject. But Texas restaurants should probably thank
Ninfa Laurenzo for popularizing the item when she put it on her
menu at the original Ninfa's in Houston in 1973 as tacos ``al
carbon.'' 1975: American consumption of soft drinks surpasses that
of coffee. 1975: The ballpark nacho is born at the Texas Rangers'
Arlington Stadium. 1976: Tom Wolfe calls the 1970s the ``Me
Decade,'' and Burger King follows with the ``Have It Your Way''
campaign. 1977: Dean &AMP; DeLuca and The Silver Palate specialty-food

 &HT;    Tim Green's latest career: Blockbuster novelist
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Tim Green, the success machine.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Books plans to make Green the next megamillion selling
author. A brand-name. The franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly right,'' says Rick Wolff, Warner Books
executive editor. ``Tim's primed to become the next David Baldacci
or the next John Grisham ... the next big, blockbuster novelist.''
</P>
<P>
   Bet against Green at your peril. The former first-round NFL
draft pick for the Atlanta Falcons programmed himself from
childhood to be No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   At everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be the best. I was obsessed. In school, I couldn't
waste too much time fooling around with classmates. I had to
listen. One missed fact could mean the difference between an A and
an A-. In sports, if reckless abandon was required, I could do
that, too. If it didn't come naturally, I could learn it.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is Green writing about grade school.
</P>
<P>
   Besides writing books, he is a practicing attorney, National
Public Radio commentator, Fox TV NFL analyst, and USA Today
columnist.
</P>
<P>
   Life as a two-minute warning. Wasted seconds can beat you.
</P>
<P>
   But who is he playing against?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote a 300-page answer to that,'' he says, softly. ``I was
adopted as an infant. People would remark throughout my life that I
was driven, I was an overachiever. I was obsessed with winning and
goals and medals and achievement and honors and awards. A lot of
that, if not all of it, came from this sense of rejection at being
given away at birth.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's 1997 autobiography, ``A Man and His Mother: An Adopted
Son's Search,'' is an uncompromising self-examination. But while
that book came and went, his writing reputation grew with football
fiction. ``Double Reverse,'' in stores now, is his fifth novel, but
Warner Books is basing its battle plan on a book that will be in
stores next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Letter of the Law'' is a legal thriller that has nothing
to do with football. Its female protagonist, attorney Casey Jordan,
caught the attention of Warner's publisher, the head of sales and
the head of marketing. All women.
</P>
<P>
   ``They felt setting my books in a world of football is a huge
handicap,'' recalls Green. ``At first I was confused. It's my
identity. My editor said, `Do you think you can?' I said, `Of
course I can.'''
</P>
<P>
   Key to Green's rise, says Wolff, is an ability to create
powerful, believable, female characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I know women pretty well,'' says Green, ``but I'll
use my wife (Illyssa) as a sounding board for characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, 35, better know something about women, considering the
looks he gets at the Jacksonville Hilton bar as the Fox TV team
readies for a 49ers/Jaguars game.
</P>
<P>
   Men glance. Women stare.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet, 2 inches, the former linebacker/defensive end is a
bigger, stronger version of Tom Cruise. Retired as a player since
1993, Green is wearing a well-worn, gray New Orleans Saints
T-shirt. His red workout shorts connect six-pack abs to sinewy
legs. Finger-combed dark brown hair matches his high-school hero's
clay-smooth face.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff has seen women react to Green. ``We just may put his
picture on the book,'' Wolff says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Eight seasons with the Atlanta Falcons left Green with a bum
knee, bad elbows and a banged-up shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best analogy is a 1972 Impala,'' he says. ``Things just
loosened up on them and rattled, there's a lot of play in the
steering, but they're still going.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he can no longer run or swing a golf club, Green
finds time to work out _ even while working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of the time,'' says Kenny Albert, Green's Fox
TV partner the past four seasons, ``when I talk to him on the phone
at his home, he's on the treadmill. He's got one of those headset
phones. Or, he's in the car driving the kids somewhere. He won't
waste any time.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend Fox TV work allows Green to be home in upstate New
York weekdays with Illyssa and their four kids, ages 2 to 9. A
typical week runs from practicing contract/business law to getting
his son to soccer practice.
</P>
<P>
   Says Albert, ``He's always on the move, nonstop energy, more so
than anyone I've ever worked with. He's one of the nicest, most
genuine people I've ever met, but he is a perfectionist.''
</P>
<P>
   The former ``Good Morning America'' correspondent barely watches
TV, sometimes ``The X-Files'' or a soccer game. Going to the movies
can drive him nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a bad mood if I go to a movie that I don't think is
good,'' he says. ``I can't stand to see a mediocre movie. That's
not acceptable because it's two hours of my time.''
</P>
<P>
   There's never enough time to read as much as he wants. James Lee
Burke, Cormac McCarthy, Dickens, Hemingway. Reading was revered
where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Green was adopted by a fourth-grade teacher and her computer
program designer husband near Syracuse, N.Y. But while he loves his
parents, sister and brother, not knowing anything about his birth
mother or father haunted him.
</P>
<P>
   Themed nightmares _ trapped with an impossible task that meant
certain failure and rejection _ began in a boy's bedroom and
continued to NFL hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   He was a high school all-everything in academics and athletics.
But his relentless push to perfection made him a big target. While
deciding between free-ride football scholarships from Penn State,
Ohio State, Syracuse and Notre Dame, Green's senior classmates
voted someone else best athlete. They voted him best brown-noser.
</P>
<P>
   ``They booed his valedictorian speech!'' says Greg Allen,
Green's senior producer at National Public Radio. ``Can you believe
that?''
</P>
<P>
   What defines Green these days, says Allen, ``is that he really
wants to give people what they want. He wants to make people happy
whether it's a listener, an editor or a coach. He does his best
work with you, and that's why he's a dream to work with. I wish all
the people I worked with were as easy as Tim.''
</P>
<P>
   Give people what they want and maybe they won't reject you.
</P>
<P>
   Co-valedictorian at Syracuse. Tops in his law class. No. 1 NFL
draft pick. But when it came to women, it got ugly for Green. He
remembers female rejection back to sixth grade when a girl dumped
him with a note passed in a hall.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of female rejection could suffocate relationships and
produce in him a jealous control-freak who could and would use sex
as a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was repulsive,'' he confesses in ``A Man and His Mother.''
</P>
<P>
   To stop the madness, it took a six-year search for his birth
mother that required cash, detectives, lucky breaks and friends
willing to break rules dealing with sealed adoption papers.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 27, playing for the Falcons, he found his birth
parents: She was a Philadelphia teacher and he owned a Seattle
computer software business.
</P>
<P>
   She got pregnant after a one-night indiscretion with a man
looking for fun, not a family. She was in college to earn the
degree that would be a one-way ticket out of her own poor,
fatherless home. She couldn't raise a baby. Her one request of the
adoption agency: he would go to a couple who were college-educated.
</P>
<P>
   When Green's personal mystery ended in 1991, so did his
obsession to excel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still kinda' go about things in the same way,'' he says,
``but I have a lot more equanimity about it. I don't have the same
desperate desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensing doubt, he quickly offers an example. His best-selling
book so far is ``The Dark Side of the Game,'' about his NFL years.
Publicity included ``60 Minutes.'' But the book made only a cameo
on the New York Times best-seller list. ``Why?,'' hesays,
``because they didn't have enough books out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Book business bumbling, he says, ``doesn't drive me nuts any
more because it is what it is. My wife gets crazier about it than I
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next book, `The Letter of the Law,' will have a chance
because Warner Books will line up behind it. Sooner or later, if
I'm meant to get there, I'll get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   But couldn't he be happier?
</P>
<P>
   The former obsessed overachiever laughs. ``No, I couldn't.''

<HEADLINE>
`FIGHT CLUB' IS A BLEAKLY FUNNY, NO-HOLDS-BARRED FILM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) offers to let ``Fight Club's'' unnamed
narrator (Edward Norton) stay at his place after an explosion has
demolished his modernist condo.
</P>
<P>
   He does this on the condition that the Narrator do him a favor:
`Hit me as hard as you can.'' He does, and eventually the two are
going at each other like animals, beating each other senseless
until the ecstasy is undeniable. They're in love, if not with each
other, then with one's recognition that the other is capable a
being a monster.
</P>
<P>
   David Fincher's bleakly funny, pitch-black ``Fight Club''
couldn't be any more on time if Domino's delivered it. Tyler and
the Narrator's live-in relationship runs the gamut from Oscar and
Felix to Ike and Tina to Rocky and Apollo and, ultimately, to John
McClane and (insert ``Die Hard'' demon here).
</P>
<P>
   It's the rawest, most hot-blooded, provocatively audacious,
dangerous movie to come of out Hollywood this year, serving as both
a supercharged spectacle and a scorching, though problematic screed
against materialism, consumption and vanity.
</P>
<P>
   The film has one of the most enthrallingly told first halves
you'll see, brought to you by a band of subversives on both sides
of the camera who are at the vanguard of their crafts, with a
particularly inventive and mind-blowing performance by Norton.
</P>
<P>
   This comes in spite of the film's deadly attempts in its last
act to visualize the supernatural-pyrotechnic lollapalooza that
happens toward the end of Chuck Palahniuk's 1996 novel, on which
``Fight Club'' is based.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler and the Narrator's inaugural parking-lot pummel is both
like a first-date shag and the start of a beautifully malevolent
friendship. The arrival of the crafty, chain-smoking Helena Bonham
Carter as Marla, the pseudo-suicidal sex interest, only ups ``Fight
Club's'' inverted ``Casablanca'' ante, as she hops in and out of
Tyler's bed.
</P>
<P>
   She's a walking Cure tune, made to look like a Wile E. Coyote
Acme bomb has just gone off in her face. Having her mewl the
``Theme from Valley of the Dolls,'' at one point, is a shrewd
touch.
</P>
<P>
   Fincher tweaks this sociopathic odd-coupling for its inherent
laughs. (Their massive, ramshackle house and its squalid insides
make a nice set piece for the mockery.) This material is the ideal
vehicle for the apocalyptic, anti-consumerist idea Fincher's been
working out since his music-video days and ``Seven,'' which was a
grisly rough draft for ``Fight Club's'' mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Tyler and the Narrator form Fight Club, an underground
support group through which angry males can unload on each other
until one of them has a really tough time getting up.
</P>
<P>
   Anonymous, cathartic and as thrilling as a one-night stand, it's
therapy- playtime-happy hour for blue- and white-collar men who've
had their inner barbarians sucked out of them by 40- to 70-hour
work weeks. (``We are our jobs,'' the film asserts.)
</P>
<P>
   It's a post-modern bathhouse for men who just don't feel
anymore; that pitch-black spot in a man's id where Susan Faludi's
research failed to go for her 800-page tome about disaffected,
emasculated American males.
</P>
<P>
   And Fincher, who's operating on full focus from a handsome Xerox
by Jim Uhls of Palahniuk's brilliant first novel, presents the
bludgeoning as an unsensationalized, if satirical inevitability.
This is simply what three decades of mixed popular-culture messages
will insidiously do to a man.
</P>
<P>
   Women eat or starve themselves or shop or talk. Men go South
Bronx on each other.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting is shot by the ingenious Jeff Cronenweth in mostly
real time under single bulbs in dank, limping color, without the
primal opera Martin Scorsese made of boxing in ``Raging Bull'' and
without any of the chemical-induced techno assaults in a video game
like ``Mortal Kombat.''

 &HT;    TOP TEACHERS SEEK BIGGER SAY IN EDUCATION REFORMS
 &HT;    Eds: Inserts new graf 12 with official's comment on education
reform panel.
 &HT;    550&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Top teachers from across the country vowed at the
seventh annual National Teachers Forum here to increase their
influence on the reforms that are transforming education in most
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are redefining what it means to be a teacher in 1999,''
Mary Beth Blegen, teacher in residence at the U.S. Department of
Education, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could continue to sit back and see ourselves as victims of
teacher-bashing or as worker bees at the bottom of a hierarchy,''
Blegen said. ``But most of us choose to say we understand kids and
teaching and learning, and we want to raise our voice beyond the
classroom and teach others in our schools and districts, and even
at the state level, what's realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   About 120 top-notch teachers _ including all 50 state teachers
of the year, many state finalists and 10 from private schools _
spent three days at the department and in a hotel in nearby
Alexandria, Va., discussing how to reshape details of the school
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of them said many of their students had been
helped by higher academic standards and tests to assess progress,
but many said the reforms designed by governors, legislators,
businesses and universities need adjustments to work in today's
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Ivie, who teaches 28 fourth graders in Aurora, Colo.,
said her state's legislators don't realize that today's teachers
can't handle classes as large as those in the days when she and
they were in school.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, she said, their teachers could concentrate on getting
average students through school, while the top one-third excelled
on their own and the lower one-third could still find a job if they
failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, when all children are expected to succeed, it's like
doing an individual learning plan for each child,'' she said.
``I've never had the luxury of teaching less than 25 children, yet
I must assess every single child's understanding and learning and
constantly make adjustments during the day in order to take each
kid up to the highest level.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A real sore spot'' in Texas is that the governor and state
education officials ``desperately need teacher advisers,'' said
Miriam Lancaster, who teaches six English classes at Pine Tree High
School in Longview. ``It could save money and it could save them
from going down the wrong avenues.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, ``conflict resolution'' programs designed
to get children to avoid violence by talking about their
differences face to face ``no longer work with a lot of street
kids, because they see it as weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers are only three of the 64 members of the commission
formed by Gov. Roy Barnes to recommend education reforms in
Georgia, said middle school teacher Ernie Blankenship of
Loganville, Ga. ``It's a voice, but it's a small one, considering
that this is our lifelong profession,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Georgia commission includes six active teachers
and 18 former teachers, said the governor's education assistant,
Ron Newcomb.
</P>
<P>
   But some teachers want to work on local reforms as simple as
exchanging tips with teachers in classrooms across the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Alaska, when we have a young sled dog, ...we put them in
harness with a calm, experienced, dedicated sled dog,'' said Daniel
Walker, who teaches at a combined middle and high school in
Anchorage. ``We can no longer put new teachers in the classroom,
wish them luck, and close the door.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, ``all our classrooms are wired, but a lot of teachers
aren't sure how to use technology effectively in the classroom,''
said Maureen Judy, an elementary school teacher in Maumee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my technology director to give me a few more computers
than normal, so that anybody could walk into my classroom and see
how we use it in the curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   Before she can spread her techniques to other schools and
districts, research must be funded to find out whether her approach
is better than others, Judy said. ``Without a research base,
teachers won't even listen to you,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, where standardized tests were used this year to rate
schools on a scale from ``A'' to ``F,'' Ruby Zickafoose, who
teaches at a B-rated elementary school in Manatee County, would
like to find a way to channel more support to nearby schools with
lower ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel this has really caused a lot of bad morale,''
Zickafoose said. ``Teachers who know they are doing everything they
can are walking around with their chins down and this scarlet
letter 'D' on their chest.''
</P>
<P>
   She worries that signs on their school lawns, displaying
messages like ``100 Days Until the Test,'' show that solid courses
are being crowded out by hoopla and constant test-preparation
drills.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, which has had high-stakes tests for three
years, teachers still debate whether to emphasize pre-test drills
or ``authentic assessment and hands-on learning,'' said Marshall
Matson, whose language arts and social studies classes for seventh
graders in Tarboro, N.C., resumed after a two-and-a-half week gap
caused by floods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weird thing is, nobody's systematically collecting the
data to see which method works best,'' Matson said. ``I bet we'd
find it's a combination of the two, but right now nobody knows.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers at this week's forum carefully avoided endorsing
any nationwide, cookie-cutter approach for all districts and
states.
</P>
<P>
   Montana, ``beautiful and broke,'' lacks the money to
``adequately fund education,'' so teachers at that state's forum
next spring will will skip educational theory and discuss ways in
which ``our economy must be turned around,'' said Dan Adcock, who
teaches at an elementary school in Missoula.
</P>
<P>
   Two South Carolina teachers said they hope to improve academic
performance by pushing for ``access by all children to health
care.''
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, described by high school teacher Joseph Bacewicz
of Tollano as ``one of the nation's wealthiest states, with three
of its poorest cities,'' he and other teachers are starting a
``Read Aloud'' program in a primary school in a poor neighborhood.
They hope that even functionally illiterate parents would come to
school once a week to hear their children take turns reading
stories aloud.

 &HT;    RUSSIAN PRIME MINISTER FACES OPPORTUNITIES, DANGERS WITH LATEST
CHECHEN WAR
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ So far, war has been a healthy thing for the political
life of the man President Boris Yeltsin says should succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   Few Russians had ever heard of Vladimir Putin or bothered to
form an opinion of him when Yeltsin in August named the former spy
and security chief to be prime minister and his presidential
heir-apparent.
</P>
<P>
   But today, as Putin sternly directs the war against the breakway
republic of Chechnya, the no-nonsense, 47-year-old former KGB agent
has seen his popularity soar in public opinion polls. Putin has
been active and visible, waging war in the south and handling
affairs in Moscow as the unpopular Yeltsin, dogged by illness, has
been in the hospital and seclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe the renewed Chechnya war was designed as a
``Wag the Dog''-style effort to raise the poll numbers and
visibility of Putin, and eclipse ongoing scandals alleging
Kremlin-linked corruption and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   It is a momentous season in Russia; the nation will hold
parliamentary elections in December and the vote to replace Yeltsin
is scheduled for next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in 1994, there was the need for a small victorious war as
elections approached,'' political analyst Nikolai Petrov said,
referring to the first war in Chechnya from 1994-96. That war ended
with a humiliating Russian retreat and a negotiated settlement,
after which Chechnya proclaimed independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it's election time again. This small war may also provide
for establishing a semi-police regime, to prevent the power from
falling into hands that the Kremlin sees as wrong,'' said Petrov of
the Carnegie Center in Moscow, a think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Just two months ago only about 2 percent of Russians recognized
Putin's name, and now his approval rating in one poll stands at 70
percent. Another poll on people's preferences for president put
Putin in a close third place behind two political veterans --
front-runner former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, and Communist
Party chief Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
   That could change as Russian forces move deeper into Chechnya
and confront determined guerrilla fighters in the capital, Grozny,
where most Russian losses came in the last war.
</P>
<P>
   Just as quickly and easily as Putin has ascended, analysts say,
he could fall.
</P>
<P>
   In a commentary Friday headlined: ``Putin on a tightrope,'' the
daily Komsomolskaya Pravda said: ``People seem to love Vladimir
Putin more every day ... In fact, he need only take one step to
become a full-fledged candidate for president. But this is not an
easy step to take. It is called victory in Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin projects something Russians haven't seen much of in recent
years _ coherent leadership from the Kremlin. He is Russia's point
man against terrorism, in the wake of a string of
apartment-building bombings that killed nearly 300 in Moscow and
other cities in September.
</P>
<P>
   Those bombings, as yet unsolved but widely blamed on Islamic
militants from Chechnya, prompted Russia to begin an air war
against the southern republic last month. The bombings have also
been responsible for much of the public support for the
re-invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Russia announced Friday that it was moving into a new phase of
its ground war, begun Oct. 1. Russian forces will delve deeper into
the southern territory in their effort to crush militant
separatists.
</P>
<P>
   If the re-invasion of Chechnya was calculated for political
purposes _ akin to the 1998 film ``Wag the Dog,'' in which a
fictitious U.S. president declares war to save his re-election bid
from scandal _ it is an immensely risky strategy in a region where
Moscow has failed before.
</P>
<P>
   Russian newspapers have dubbed Putin the ``military premier''
for his tough talk and conspicuous support of the country's defense
establishment, itself a formidable player in vying for the
Kremlin's influence. Putin supported another $1 billion for the
military budget, even though Russia's government is cash-strapped
and the economy is struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Russia's military has moved cautiously in Chechnya,
directing a largely unchallenged air campaign and moving troops
into Chechnya's northern border region _ a relatively unpopulated
area.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy has resulted in widespread civilian casualties in
Chechnya, but has kept Russian troop losses low.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1994-96 war, at least 30,000 people are believed to have
died, most of them civilians and green Russian conscripts thrown
into the fighting. The war became highly unpopular in Russia and is
widely viewed as the most glaring mistake of Yeltsin's eight-year
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apart from the understandable worry about sparing people's
lives, the premier cannot but consider his political rating, which
will inevitably fall if 'Load 200' arrives from Chechnya,''
commentator Alexander Goltz said in Itogi magazine. Russia's
version of body bags are metal coffins known in military parlance
as ``Cargo Number 200.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the war, analysts also question Putin's staying power
because he is so new to the political scene and without an
established following. In August, Putin was something of a national
joke, coming from virtually nowhere as Yeltsin's fifth prime
minister in just 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin-backed candidates are not expected to do well in
December's parliamentary elections, leading to widespread
speculation that the ever-capricious Yeltsin could fire Putin early
next year, or be forced to by a new opposition parliament. The
Kremlin inner circle is reportedly already drawing up a list of
several new possibilities for prime minister, including Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, it is the war that will determine Putin's fate.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister has about a month to bring the war in
Chechnya to a successful conclusion, said analyst Vasily Golubev.
Otherwise, he added, ``society's discontent with this fruitless
'struggle against terrorism' will grow. In such a situation it is
useless to expect a continuation of the growth of the prime
minister's rating.''

CHAVEZ RESURRECTS A VENEZUELAN HERO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Oct. 17) 
 
By JOHN OTIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Quiet as a library and featuring a musty
collection of documents, swords and medals, the Simon Bolivar
museum and birthplace isn't exactly Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to encouragement from President Hugo Chavez, throngs
of youngsters crowd the building every day. They come to learn
about the audacious general who freed much of South America from
Spanish rule in the 1800s and dreamed of a unified continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bolivar liberated five nations. We want our kids to learn that
they, too, can be leaders,'' said Carmen Henriquez, a social worker
who recently brought a group of students from a poor Caracas
neighborhood to the museum on a bus provided by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Bolivar is considered the George Washington of South America for
winning the independence of modern-day Colombia, Venezuela,
Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia from Spanish domination.
</P>
<P>
   But under Chavez, who took office in February, the veneration of
Bolivar has reached new heights. A former army paratrooper and a
fiery populist, Chavez considers Bolivar a military genius, a
visionary and the perfect oracle for a country that, he believes,
lacks national pride and role models.
</P>
<P>
   But critics claim that Chavez is exploiting the image of Bolivar
to stir up nationalist sentiment and build support for his own
political projects.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez peppers his speeches with references to Bolivar. Instead
of the traditional presidential photo, portraits of Bolivar hang in
many government offices. During Independence Day ceremonies July 5,
the president whipped out one of Bolivar's old swords and waved it
to the cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez even suggested renaming the country the Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela. The idea was scrapped after studies
determined that it would cost $43 million to print new passports,
official documents and currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of regime that we are promoting must be based on our
culture and our essence. Bolivar is our inspiration,'' said Luis
Miquilena, president of the Constitutional Assembly, which is
writing a new Magna Carta for Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Bolivar can be hard to resist. He even inspired a
novel ``The General In His Labyrinth'' by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
</P>
<P>
   Born into a wealthy family in Caracas in 1783, Bolivar joined
the rebel army when war against Spain broke out in 1810. After a
series of victories, he entered Caracas in 1813 and was christened
``the Liberator.``
</P>
<P>
   Spain recaptured Caracas, and Bolivar went into exile. But he
returned to launch a series of surprise attacks and eventually
defeated Spanish forces at Boyaca in present-day Colombia. His
triumph is considered one of the great campaigns in military
history.
</P>
<P>
   Bolivar was named president of Greater Colombia, which was made
up of Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador and Panama. His army later went
on to free Peru and Bolivia from Spanish domination.
</P>
<P>
   But Bolivar's vision of a united Spanish America was thwarted by
separatist movements and resistance to his own authoritarian ways.
Venezuela and Ecuador soon seceded from Greater Colombia, prompting
Bolivar to lament: ``We have plowed the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Disillusioned and racked with tuberculosis, he died in 1830.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, many Venezuelans today say that Bolivar had the
right idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``When everyone else was thinking of making a separate country
out of every little piece of land, Bolivar wanted to make these
pieces into one country,'' said Frank Payares, a Caracas lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had built one great country, we could compete with the
United States. But now we have the opposite. Everyone is fighting
among themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez intones the glory of Bolivar at almost every public
appearance. Indeed, some analysts believe that Chavez views himself
as a modern-day ``liberator.''
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Leal, dean of the sociology department at the
University of the Andes in Bogota, said that Venezuela was ruled
for much of its history by military strongmen who considered
themselves the heirs of Bolivar and the saviors of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But before jumping into politics, Chavez spent 20 years in the
army. He formed a clandestine group of rebel officers called the
Bolivarian Revolutionary Movement 200 and launched an unsuccessful
coup attempt in 1992 against then-President Carlos Andres Perez.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Chavez has promised to free the nation from
poverty, graft and the stranglehold of traditional political
parties that ran Venezuela for the past four decades until his
election last December. Despite vast oil wealth, the majority of
Venezuelans are poor.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez is also promoting a different kind of South American
unity through regional trade alliances like the Andean Pact and
Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bolivar dreamed that America would come together, and now this
change is happening through economic integration,'' said Miquilena,
the president of the Constitutional Assembly. ``Bolivar was ahead
of his time.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Venezuelans seem to appreciate the government's
resurrection of Bolivar. Visits to the Bolivar museum are on the
rise. Many people supported renaming the country.
</P>

   ``Venezuelans aren't very religious. If you don't believe in
God, it's no big deal. But if you say that you don't think much of
Bolivar, people will really come down hard on you,'' said Manuel
Caballero, a Venezuelan historian.
</P>
<P>
   Caballero added that, unlike other Latin American nations with
strong Indigenous cultures and a rich heritage, Venezuela lacks
swashbuckling figures and a sense of tradition. Bolivar, he said,
is one of the nation's few authentic heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Critics complain that Chavez is exploiting history for political
gain. They say that by wrapping his government in the aura of
Bolivar, Chavez can paint his political enemies as unpatriotic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has grossly monopolized the father of the country and has
converted him into a miraculous recipe'' for all of Venezuela's
ills, wrote columnist Alberto Barrera Tyszka in the Caracas daily
El Nacional.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz Sonntag, a political analyst at the Caracas research
center Cendes, adds that it makes little sense for Venezuela to
look backward on the cusp of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bolivar was a man of the 18th and 19th centuries,'' Sonntag
said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Russia's president, he added: ``It would be like
Yeltsin pursuing the politics of Lenin.''

DO YOU SINCERELY WANT TO BE RICH? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, October 17, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Peter Lynch, the next best-known money man in Boston
probably is John Spooner. There is a world of difference between
the two. But their gospel is essentially the same.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch made jillions as manager of the Magellan Fund, is now best
known now as a pitch-man for Fidelity Investments. Spooner is a
novelist who has made millions for his customers in his day job as
a stockbroker, these days at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch has sold more books _ ``One Up On Wall Street'' and
``Beating The Street'' were huge best-sellers. But Spooner is the
more lively writer.
</P>
<P>
   His novels _ ``Class,'' ``The Foursome,'' ``The King of
Terrors,'' ``Three Cheers for War in General,'' and ``The
Pheasant-Lined Vest of Charlie Freeman'' _ are sly and telling
tales of life among the Boston ethnics that call to mind the
stories of George Higgins and John P. Marquand.
</P>
<P>
   His investment guides _ the classic ``Confessions of a
Stockbroker,'' ``Smart People,'' and ``Sex and Money'' _ convey the
flavor of markets in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, much like those
of John Brooks (``The Go-Go Years'') and Jerry Goodman (who wrote
``The Money Game'' under the pen-name Adam Smith.)
</P>
<P>
   Now Spooner has summed up his distinctive approach to personal
investing in a little book called ``Do You Want To Make Money or
Would You Rather Fool Around?'' It offers very different counsel
from the myriad accounts of fabulous wealth creation in Silicon
Valley that are now tumbling off the presses _ of which Michael
Lewis' ``The New New Thing'' is far and away the best.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it is a deep and cheerful probing of the psychology of
personal investing from the point of view of someone who helps
manage half a billion dollars of other people's money. To be sure,
there is too much schtick for the taste of some; if it is how-to
advice you are after, you'll prefer the Globe's personal finance
columnist, Charles A. Jaffe. (Disclosure: I once went to a dinner
that Spooner attended. When I started to prepare this column, I
went to hear him talk. I manage my own money. But I read everything
that he writes.)
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the new book, Spooner says, ``If you are lucky
in life, you will know, and be friendly with, people who are older
than you.'' To which it might be added, the next best thing would
be to read these 60 short meditations on changes that have taken
place in financial markets over 40 years _ and the things that have
stayed the same.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in ``The Dinosaur Club,'' Spooner describes the
dinner meeting of three old friends from the institutional side of
the investment business. ``That means that they buy and sell stocks
and bonds to and from professional investors like banks, insurance
companies, and mutual funds,'' Spooner explains. These men are in
their late 50s; they drink See-Throughs (martinis); and they are
worried about a business that they fear has passed them by.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had street smarts,'' says one. ``We started at $5,000 a
year and were told to keep our eyes and ears open. Now the trading
desks only hire brilliant kids from the Ivy League at 80 grand. And
they don't want to look at anyone from commuter colleges. We'd
never get jobs in our firms if we were interviewing today.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Oldsters' complaints about the death of loyalty and the
rise of Edge slowly dissolve in a series of stories about the
securities business when it was was fun. The moral capital of their
friendship _ their Dinosaur Club _ becomes more clear. ``Make sure
you stop and think about what you are getting from the way you are
handling your money,'' advises Spooner. ``Do you just want to make
money? Or are you looking for a life?
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, in ``You Need a Net Youngblood in Your
Life,'' he makes the useful observation that, ``In living the smart
life, you always need something to trade.'' People are anxious for
a human touch, advice, personal counsel, he says; a friend once
traded the promise of a few fly-fishing lessons for Super Bowl
tickets. `` &UR; Today &LR; , almost all of us could use help from a
youngblood who is proficient in surfing the Net and can teach us
about the new world of cyberspace.'' Where to find one? Try your
own family first.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Buying on the News,'' Spooner analyzes investors who are
whipped into a frenzy by what they read in the papers. In ``Selling
Short,'' he reflects on his 1,700 clients scattered around the
world. ``No more than one of these people ever sell a stock short
in the space of a year. Why is this? Americans are optimistic
people _ they like betting for things, not against them.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Losing My Virginity,'' he recounts the story of firing a
client who wanted to find something to short the afternoon John F.
Kennedy was shot _ and how he came to regret his reluctance to take
his business. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Education of a Stockbroker,'' Spooner compresses his
autobiography into four lyrical pages about his family's Irish cook
_ gefilte fish, chopped liver, and cherry cheescake were her
specialties _ who taught him to sing ``Whiskey, You're the Divil''
before he learned ``America the Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30 years ago, when ``Confessions of a Stockbroker'' was
published under the pen-name ``Brutus,'' Spooner took advantage of
a good-natured book editor at this newspaper to review the book
under his own name (thus joining the ranks of self-puffing
deceivers whose ranks, my colleague Alex Beam has pointed out,
include Mark Twain and Ambrose Bierce). ``This cynical Brutus, who
can handle my money anytime. . .'' began the review. ``I almost
wish this Brutus were writing for the films or television,'' it
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Other Boston writers are better known. None is more financial.
As editor Nancy Gaines has written, Spooner is a singular figure,
godfather and gadfly, ``telling tales out of school while in a most
discreet profession, painting word-pictures of the city's caste
stystem while sitting atop it's social structure.'' He is, she
says, ``the outsider looking in, the insider looking out. . . He's
Harvard, Beacon Hill, bow ties, Brookline, Jew, wise ass.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also a national treasure.

CATHOLICS PUMP MONEY INTO ANTI-GAY MARRIAGE INITIATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANASTASIA HENDRIX  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Catholic Church has contributed more than
$311,000 to support a California ballot initiative that seeks to
ban gay marriages.
</P>
<P>
   According to campaign finance reports filed with the secretary
of state, eight of the state's 12 Catholic dioceses have made
donations to support the measure that will appear on the ballot
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an issue we support, and we will be supporting it in
other ways as the campaign actually opens,'' said Carol Hogan,
spokeswoman for the California Catholic Conference, the public
policy arm of the state's 28 Roman Catholic bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, much of the fund-raising focus has centered on
the Mormon church, whose members have raised $3.6 million to
support the proposal by state Sen. William J. ``Pete'' Knight,
R-Palmdale.
</P>
<P>
   California law already defines marriage as between a man and
woman, and gay marriages would not be legalized if the initiative
fails. But the senator has said he is worried that another state
may eventually approve such unions, which in turn could be
recognized in California.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Knight's gay son, David Knight, spoke out against
his father's initiative for the first time in an opinion piece
published in the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe, based on my experience, that his is a blind,
uncaring, uninformed, knee-jerk reaction to a subject about which
he knows nothing and wants to know nothing, but which serves his
political career,'' wrote David Knight, a Gulf War fighter pilot
who now works as a cabinetmaker in Baltimore and is estranged from
his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, I told my father I was gay and that I have a
life partner, Joe. From that moment on, my relationship with my
father was over,'' Knight wrote. ``I can't begin to explain the
hurt that has come from this rejection.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator responded to the column by issuing a statement on
Thursday: ``I regret that my son felt he needed to force a private,
family matter into the public forum through an editorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I don't believe he was fair in describing the true
nature of our relationship, that is a subject which should remain
between the two of us. I care deeply about my son.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of David Knight's editorial, coming just as the
latest campaign contributions were made public, was applauded by
the opponents of the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is appropriate that it came out today because it really
sends a message to people supporting the initiative that it is an
anti-family measure, and that whether wittingly or not, they are
participating in something solely designed to separate people from
people and families from families,'' said Mike Marshall, campaign
manager for the opposition group Californians for Fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, who was raised Catholic and who attended Catholic
schools, called the church contributions stunning, hurtful and
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of Catholics I know support the church
because of its commitment to social justice, not to be part of the
bishops' jihad against gays and lesbians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parishioners may not even be aware that the donations were being
made to the Protection of Marriage Committee because bishops
independently decided how much of the church budget to contribute,
said Roberta Ward, spokeswoman for the Diocese of San Jose, which
donated $24,130.
</P>
<P>
   The eight dioceses that made contributions for the July 1 to
Sept. 30 period were:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles, $144,998.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Roman Catholic Bishop of Orange, $36,498.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego, $35,072
</P>
<P>
   _ The Roman Catholic Bishop of San Bernardino, $29,436.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Roman Catholic Church of Sacramento, $25,542.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Diocese of San Jose, $24,130.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Catholic Bishop of Monterey, $10,742.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Roman Catholic Bishop of Fresno, $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The combined $311,418 is a fraction of the total amount raised
by the Protection of Marriage Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In the 90 days covered by the filing, the anti-gay marriage
group raised $3,119,494.04, bringing the total raised to date to
$3,863,165.04 documented.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the campaign statement filed for the same time
period by the opposition campaign, Californians for Fairness,
raised about $900,000.

 &HT;    Get a handle on toilet repair
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you've moved into a new house or replaced a
toilet in the past five years or so, you may look back on your old
toilets with nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   Old-fashioned toilets do a dirty job with a minimum of fuss and
bother. And although some of the moving parts needed to be replaced
occasionally, the sturdy tank and bowl could last forever.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of toilets available for sale now are still as tough
as nails, but they may not function with the effortless grace of
their ancestors. That's because federal water-conservation
regulations dictate that new toilets must do the same work as old
toilets with about one-quarter as much water.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional toilets use about 6 gallons of water per flush;
newer toilets must make do with 1.6 gallons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's having trouble with water-conserving toilets,''
said Tom Long, salesman for A-Atherton Plumbing Co. in Dayton.
``They just can't handle solid wastes and paper without two or
three flushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting so bad people are going to start going back to
digging a hole in the back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   If you've got an older toilet, there are usually ways to keep it
working effectively and without leaks. Perhaps if you can hold on
to the older model for a few years, federal regulations may ease,
and you'll be able to buy a new toilet with greater water capacity.
</P>
<P>
   But if you really want to replace a toilet now, it's a job most
average do-it-yourselfers can handle.
</P>
<P>
   TOILET MAINTENANCE
</P>
<P>
   Most toilet leaks can be traced to two sources: a bad seal over
the flush valve or a shut-off device that fails to shut off when
the tank is full.
</P>
<P>
   The flush valve is the hole at the bottom of the tank at the
back of the toilet. When you depress the handle to flush the
toilet, you're actually lifting a rubber stopper out of the flush
valve.
</P>
<P>
   Check the stopper first. Cut off the water supply by turning off
the supply valve, which should be under the toilet on the left.
Flush to get the water out of the tank.
</P>
<P>
   The stopper should have the pliable feel of fresh rubber. If it
is stiff or cracked, replace it. A replacement stopper costs no
more than about $5 in any hardware or home-improvement store.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the problem is in the chain or metal rod that lifts
the stopper. Work the mechanism a few times without water in the
tank to be sure the stopper always lifts and drops smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   If the lifting arm moves more than half an inch before starting
to pull the plug open, reduce the slack in the lifting chain or the
metal rod.
</P>
<P>
   The device that shuts off water when the tank is full is called
a ballcock. Adjusting a ballcock that doesn't shut off properly is
usually simple.
</P>
<P>
   Many tanks have a float ball at the end of a metal arm. If the
water does not shut off about an inch from the top of the overflow
tube, grasp the arm and bend it gently to push the float ball
lower.
</P>
<P>
   Some toilets have ``cup floats'' that are positioned around the
body of the ballcock. These are adjusted by squeezing a metal clip
and sliding the cup down to make the water shut off sooner.
</P>
<P>
   A few toilets have pressure valves that don't use floats at all.
They are adjusted by turning a screw counterclockwise, half a turn
at a time, to reduce the water level.
</P>
<P>
   If none of these adjustments work, you can replace the ballcock
for about $10.
</P>
<P>
   This operation involves removing two or three bolts and takes
only about 15 minutes if the bolts holding the old ballcock in
place and the water-supply tube are in good condition. If they're
badly corroded, you may need a plumber to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   REPLACING A TOILET
</P>
<P>
   Modern toilets come in two basic types: gravity-fed and
pressure-assisted. Long said gravity-fed toilets sell for about
$150.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure-assisted toilets use compressed air along with water to
help clear solid waste, and they're typically more effective at
handling solid waste than gravity-fed toilets. But they're noisy
and usually cost about $325 to $350, Long said.
</P>
<P>
   Stores that sell replacement toilets probably will have
brochures or instruction sheets to give you the basics on replacing
a toilet. Two other excellent sources of tips are the books ``The
Complete Photo Guide to Home Repair'' from Black &AMP; Decker and
``Home Improvement 1-2-3'' from Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, though, you'll follow these steps:
</P>
<P>
   _ Shut off the water supply to the toilet and flush to remove
water from the tank. Use sponges to remove remaining water from the
tank and bowl.
</P>
<P>
   _ Disconnect the water-supply line. Remove the bolts holding the
tank to the bowl (unless you have a one-piece toilet) and set the
tank aside. Pry off the protective caps over the bolts holding the
toilet to the floor and remove them. You may have to hacksaw the
bolts if they are badly corroded.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rock the bowl from side to side to break the seal and then tip
it on its side. Have lots of rags standing by in case there is
water left in the bowl. Stuff a rag into the drain pipe to block
sewer smells.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scrape off the wax around the flange that held the old toilet
to the floor. Clean it with a stiff wire brush and disinfect it
with bleach.
</P>
<P>
   _ Place a fresh wax ring and rubber drain sleeve over the bottom
of the new toilet. Take out the rag plugging the drain and press
the toilet down onto the flange to spread the wax ring and create a
tight seal. Bolt the bowl in place.
</P>
<P>
   _ Attach the tank and install any hardware needed inside the
tank. Attach the water supply and test the mechanism. The last step
is adding a toilet seat.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Until not long ago, the single greatest contribution
made by an American female athlete to the history of style was that
spinning plate of a haircut from the skater Dorothy Hamill _ the
one that for a few moments in the 1970s changed the look of
third-grade suburbanites.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of Serena and Venus Williams onto tennis courts is
happily reshaping that legacy. With their colorful hair beads,
jeweled wrists and tennis skirts that look as though they're on
their way to a night of caipirinha-drinking, rather than an
afternoon of pummeling Martina Hingis, the Williams sisters have
become more than racquet-sport prodigies; they're muses, budding
fashion divas in the minds of some.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at the ready-to-wear shows in Paris, the avant-garde
designer Jeremy Scott turned out little dresses he said were
inspired by the sisters. Last year, the young women, who if stacked
on top of each other would stand over 12 feet tall, appeared in
Vogue wearing gowns by Carolina Herrera. The Vogue editor Andre
Leon Talley, a fan of the sisters' court style (``They burned
tennis whites!''), recently described the photo this way, ``I
thought it was the second coming.''
</P>
<P>
   That may seem a bit extreme, except that in the world of at
least one of the sisters _ Serena _ clothes shopping does suggest a
religious experience with all the fervor and devotion.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams, now 18, won the U.S. Open championship last month.
Last week, she was in town to promote the Chase Championships, a
tennis tournament, beginning Nov. 15, in which she will play, and
she seized on the chance to spend time at Saks Fifth Avenue. She
did not shop alone; there was an entourage, including her mother,
Brandi, a representative from the World Tennis Association and a
publicist.
</P>
<P>
   In a room reserved for VIP customers on the fifth floor,
personal shoppers had selected 12 outfits for Ms. Williams'
inspection, along with five wraps (one resembling a neon
comforter), three pairs of shoes and more than 15 little handbags,
which seemed even more diminutive in the presence of the athlete.
Nanette DiFalco, one of the personal shoppers, said she'd chosen
the clothes with the likes and dislikes of a typical 18-year-old in
mind. ``We stayed away from anything that looked athletic because
of endorsement deals,'' she added. When she competes, Ms. Williams
is dressed exclusively by Puma.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams was wearing black bell-bottoms, a leather jacket
and a pair of red platforms belonging to her sister Venus. She had
bought the leather jacket during a tournament in Germany. ``Was it
Stuttgart or Munich?'' she asked her mother. It turned out to be
Stuttgart, where she'd also bought two other leather jackets, a
pair of leather pants and a leather hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a French seam,'' Ms. Williams said knowingly, as she
stroked and ogled a pink DKNY top with rhinestone chains for
straps. ``I'm in design school,'' she said. After winning the Open,
Ms. Williams enrolled in the Art Institute of Florida, where she is
taking classes in drawing, sewing and psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams has a fashion diva's penchant for proclamation.
Going through the selections _ two skirts, some rubberized pants,
more DKNY tops, a Vivienne Tam knit sequined skirt and sweater,
some white denim _ she rattled off her thoughts on style like a
Diana Vreeland with menacing calves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Purple is in,'' she announced. Gravitating toward the
accessories table, she said: ``I love bags! I think you can really
express yourself with a bag. Flat bags are in!'' But she didn't
seem to want the flat bag with floral applique from Patch. ``The
problem with a flat bag is you put too much in it, and then it
ruins the whole purpose,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also rejected a pair of white pants from Helmut Lang that
were embellished with side pockets and Velcro straps. ``I wouldn't
get into these pants,'' Ms. Williams said. ``There's just too much
going on here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, like legions of adolescents before her, Ms. Williams
could not resist the rebellious pull of leather. She tried on a
mini leather wrap skirt that reversed to pony skin on the flip
side. The label wasn't as posh as Helmut Lang _ Elements by Vakko _
but it was more to Ms. Williams' taste. She paired it with a pink
sleeveless turtleneck from DKNY. Where, one wondered, might she
wear such an ensemble?
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go to school in it,'' she said, sizing herself up in a
mirror. ``Ricky Martin has a concert coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams described the evolution of her off-court dress
code. ``I started with Bebe, and then I went on to BCBG and then
Max Mara,'' she said. ``I really like Max Mara.'' But there was
nothing from any of those manufacturers lined up for her at Saks.
``I have a $1,400 shirt from Dolce &AMP; Gabbana,'' she noted.
``They're too expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   After trying on the rubberized pants and Vivienne Tam knits, and
deeming them not quite right, the young champion settled on the
leather mini and DKNY top. She also picked out a silver Kate Spade
purse and silver DKNY sandals. Saks offered her a gift of a pink
pashmina shawl, but Ms. Williams wasn't quite sure what pashmina
was.
</P>
<P>
   Her total purchases came to $798.85 _ closer to those of a Long
Island teen-ager. She paid for it the way an average teen-ager
would, too, using her mother's credit card.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Bonjour,'' ``Merci beaucoup'' and ``Je m'appelle''
flew around the balcony of the Bowery Ballroom on Monday night as
fans eager for autographs flexed what little they remembered of
French 101.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere we go people try to speak French to us,'' said
Celia Faussart, the younger half of Les Nubians, the hot Afro-soul
duo that is proving that fine wine isn't the only popular export
from Bordeaux these days. ``Sometimes we don't understand what
they're saying, but it's good that they try.''
</P>
<P>
   At their first major concert in New York, Celia, 21, and Helene
Faussart, 24, played to a sold-out crowd with a five-piece band and
a spoken-word poet in dreadlocks.
</P>
<P>
   They performed songs from their award-winning debut album,
``Princesses Nubiennes,'' Sade-esque lounge grooves laced with
hip-hop and ``Afropean'' rhythms. (They have a French father and a
Cameroonian mother.) Fans who wanted to meet the latest young divas
of the downtown music scene mobbed the sisters before they
retreated backstage.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for their only night on the town, Celia and Helene
changed from the vintage halter dresses they wore onstage into
Coca-Cola sweatsuits. (Coke is sponsoring their 20-city tour.)
Known as much for their Afro-chic style as for their music, the
sisters dressed up their sweats with matching head wraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suits me perfectly,'' Helene said to her sister. ``But it
doesn't suit you at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the playful dig, Celia wrapped her burgundy pashmina
shawl around herself and looked sullenly at a plate of crudites.
``I'm in New York,'' she announced. ``I'm starving, and I need good
food.''
</P>
<P>
   So the sisters and their entourage of 15 (local friends and a
Frenchwoman who had won a ``Night Out With Les Nubians in New
York'' contest sponsored by a French hip-hop magazine) headed to
First, an American bistro on the Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving, Helene looked disappointed. ``Why no Balthazar or
Casimir?'' she asked, standing outside in the cold night air,
smoking a Marlboro Light. After Celia explained that the kitchens
were closed at those places, Helene went inside and nestled into a
leather banquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate New York restaurants because they are so
conceptual,'' she said, admiring the silver auto-radiator hose
clamps serving as napkin holders.
</P>
<P>
   The Faussart sisters go for high-concept stage makeup, too:
their arms were still covered in glitter, and white dots lined
their brows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Makeup helps bring magic to the stage,'' Celia said, swabbing
her T-zone with a Ponds facial wipe. ``But I don't really like to
wear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Between bites of beef carpaccio and tuna au poivre, the sisters
surveyed the wine menu. ``You know why I love New York?'' Helene
asked. ``Because I can find wine from every country here. This is
paradise for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, she ordered a bottle of sparkling white from Bordeaux,
and the talk turned to guys. ``I wanted to marry Lenny Kravitz
until someone at the label told me he was too short for me,'' said
Helene, who is 5-foot-8. ``But Method Man is tall, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Around 2 a.m., they were feeling the effects of their 18-hour
day. ``We don't usually have this many people around, because
generally I don't like to talk much after performances,'' Helene
said. Then her exhausted face brightened. ``But it's New York, and
here you have to have fun with everyone.''

PLANTING IN DIFFICULT AREAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Oct. 17) 
(jt) 
 By CASS PETERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's possible to have too much of a good thing in a garden. The
danger is not so much in overplanting one thing _ say, German
irises or cottage roses _ and leaving no room for anything else,
but in planting something that decides to take over.
</P>
<P>
   Gardeners who foolishly plant houttuynia, that multicolored
ground cover commonly called chameleon plant, will understand the
problem. A modest patch of houttuynia quickly becomes a juggernaut,
marching inexorably across the soil in defiance of all efforts to
curb its migration.
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said for most varieties of bugleweed,
buttercups, pachysandra and a host of other plants that would be
more useful, and more charitably described by garden writers, if
they were more mannerly.
</P>
<P>
   The silver fleece vine that I planted at the foundation of a
toolshed _ thinking it would drape prettily over the roof, with
cascades of white flowers in the autumn _ has decided instead to
engulf the shed.
</P>
<P>
   Every strand that escaped from the original trellis and touched
the ground promptly rooted, and the vine has moved the full length
of the building, wrapping around it like living luggage straps. It
even grows inside the shed, so that I have to hack my way through
pale, sun-starved vines every time I want to retrieve a tool.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with some trepidation that I recommend lily of the
valley as a fine plant for those difficult areas that are both
shady and dry. Most yards have such places at the base of trees or
under shrubs, where there is too little sunlight for grass and too
little moisture for most ground covers.
</P>
<P>
   Lily of the valley (Convallaria majalis) is perfect for such
places. It stays low, rarely exceeding eight inches in height, and
its foliage stays green all summer. The flowers are tiny waxy bells
on stiff stems, so deliciously fragrant that lily of the valley is
a popular scent for perfumes. Unfortunately, the season of bloom is
short. In my garden in south-central Pennsylvania, lily of the
valley blooms for only a week or so in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   If the spot is truly dry and shady, lily of the valley will
remain demurely where you plant it, venturing out only as far as
the edge of the nearest lawn, where the mower can keep it in check.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is any sort of natural pathway from the dry spot to
one that is more fertile and moist, the lilies will find it in a
New York minute. They spread by rhizomes that travel horizontally
underground, so you may not notice they're on the move until they
pop up some distance away. The next time you look, they will be
bullying the begonias in the flower beds, crowding out the crowns
in the strawberry patch and harassing the herbs in the kitchen
garden.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson's garden records suggest that he planted lily
of the valley among his anemones and trolliuses. If the garden had
more than lily of the valley blooming in that spot after a couple
of years, it was only because of regular and thorough human
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Where it can be contained, however, the plant is both delightful
and easy. It's best planted in October, after frost, but before the
ground freezes hard.
</P>
<P>
   What you plant are called pips, the combined roots and crowns,
which are readily available at garden centers or through mail-order
catalogs in the fall. These should be planted three or four inches
apart, and the tips covered with an inch of soil. A light mulch
after the ground freezes is a good idea the first year, to keep the
pips from heaving out of the ground before they are well rooted.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the plants need only a light top dressing of compost
or a sprinkling of fertilizer in October to keep them happy.
</P>
<P>
   If the leaves start to get small and the plants stop blooming
well, they're overcrowded. In that case, dig out large clumps after
frost has killed the foliage in October and refill the empty spaces
with fresh soil. The remaining clumps will quickly recolonize the
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Do not succumb to the temptation to plant those clumps elsewhere
in the garden unless you yearn for a monoculture of lily of the
valley. If you don't have friends who want them and don't want to
waste them, you can force them into bloom indoors.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, choose pips with thick crowns, which indicate that
there are many growing tips clustered together. (The more growing
tips, the more flowers the plant will have.) Avoid lopsided crowns,
which may produce deformed foliage and flowers. Cut the roots back
to about three inches, and plant about a half-dozen pips in a
six-inch-diameter flower pot, just barely covering them with soil.
</P>
<P>
   Water the pot well, and put it in a cool, semidark place until
the pips start to sprout. This will take a couple of weeks; be sure
that the pot doesn't dry out in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   When you see sprouts, put the pot in a warm spot, again being
sure the soil doesn't dry out. You'll have fragrant blooms in a
couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers still last only about a week, but if you prepare
several pots of pips and leave the pots outdoors to freeze, you can
bring new ones in periodically all winter for forcing. Lily of the
valley is never invasive when it's in a pot on a windowsill. It's a
wonderful way to enjoy a good thing you have too much of.

   With the release of his ``In The Life of Chris Gaines'' CD three
weeks ago, Garth Brooks traded in the cuddly, love-handled appeal
that helped him sell almost 100 million albums for the brooding,
eyeliner-wearing visage of a pop rock alter ego no one had ever
heard of.
</P>
<P>
   For the album cover, Brooks, the balding country superstar, put
on a tousled black wig and a clump of hair beneath his lower lip,
and got more grief from critics than the Village People got when
they put on face paint and poet shirts for their 1981 New Wave
album, ``Renaissance.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, who is 37 and a promising actor if his stint as the host
of ``Saturday Night Live'' is any indication, has been accused of
having too much time on his hands by one rock critic; another
called the album the self-indulgent product of a midlife crisis.
</P>
<P>
   His radically altered look resembles ``Trent Reznor crossed with
a guy who eats a lot of cheese steaks,'' wrote Time magazine.
Rolling Stone theorized that Brooks is ``letting his Yankee freak
flag fly'' by assuming the persona of a fictional 32-year-old rock
star who, as his fictional bio goes, has been racking up hits since
1989.
</P>
<P>
   We are in a season of alter egos. Dame Edna Everage, the
creation of the Australian character actor Barry Humphries, opens
Sunday night on Broadway in ``Dame Edna: The Royal Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   In bookstores, Edmund Morris' life of Ronald Reagan, ``Dutch,''
features an alter ego of the biographer, decades older than the
real Morris, who wanders in and out of his subject's life in
fictionalized encounters.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of artistic license makes some critics very nervous.
``Dutch'' has occasioned a firestorm of rebuke. Rolling Stone,
reporting on Brooks, ventured, `` `In The Life of Chris Gaines'
suggests that the singer is confronting some serious identity
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   More likely, Brooks is simply engaging in the human equivalent
of cross marketing, acting a role as a means to reach an audience
he has not yet tapped. ``In The Life of Chris Gaines,'' a mock
greatest hits CD, was No. 2 last week on the Billboard pop chart.
Morris is thought to have become exasperated by the ineffability of
his subject and sought higher truth in a fictional device.
Whatever, he's selling a lot of books.
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of the criticism of all this role-playing is
surprising. Alter egos, after all, are not exactly an unprecedented
career move. Two decades ago, David Bowie unveiled his most famous
alter ego, Ziggy Stardust _ which also was initially derided as too
strange for words.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, in the performance world, barrier breakers like
RuPaul have made drag more acceptable to the mainstream. Strangely,
these days a man dressing as a woman seems to be more acceptable
than him dressing as another man. When a man changes stripes as
convincingly as Brooks does with Chris Gaines, people get
frightened. Costumes, they can handle. Multiple personalities,
perhaps not.
</P>
<P>
   The question is why some performers feel the need to immerse
themselves in a character so deeply? Is it, as drag queens often
say, that they have too much style, talent and personality for one
person? Or is it, to paraphrase the film director Peter Farrelly,
``a very commercial form of mental illness?''
</P>
<P>
   Farrelly was speaking of the actor Jim Carrey, who stars as the
late comedian Andy Kaufman in the upcoming film ``Man On The
Moon.'' Kaufman's alter ego, a piggish lounge singer named Tony
Clifton, was as troublemaking as Kaufman's other famous character,
Latka Gravas on ``Taxi,'' was endearing.
</P>
<P>
   During the making of the film, it was widely reported that
Carrey lived the role of Kaufman on some days and assumed the guise
of Tony Clifton on others. Employing Method acting techniques,
Carrey simply did not exist during the filming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me a little time to get used to it, but it was a
wonderful game to play,'' said the director, Milos Forman, in a
cover story on Carrey in the October issue of Vanity Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Secretly most people have alter egos; they just don't make
albums or appear on stage as them. We employ these alternate
personas to say and do what we in our everyday guise cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Dame Edna verbally shish-kebobs her audience every night in a
way that the more bookishly reserved Humphries would never do.
Brooks can indulge his rock-and-roll fantasies without alienating
his country audience. Whether unleashing an alter ego is cathartic
or schizophrenic is anyone's call.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jeff Roberson, a former advertising art director at Foote, Cone
&AMP; Belding, found his voice not by becoming a latter-day Darren
Stevens of ``Bewitched,'' but by becoming a red-haired diva named
Varla Jean Merman. His alter ego, the supposed daughter of Ethel
Merman and Ernest Borgnine, was created nine years ago as a way for
Roberson to deal with the anxiety of being overweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got thinner I had to change my material,'' he said
recently on the phone. These days, he is playing Rhonda Skidmore, a
murderous little girl in blond braids, in ``The Bad Seedling,'' a
parody suggested by ``The Bad Seed,'' on stage at Mother, a
nightclub in the meatpacking district.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that's not true. Varla Jean Merman is playing Rhonda.
Even he has trouble keeping it straight. ``It's strange being in a
play, playing a character, and being billed as someone else,'' he
said. ``When I'm acting, it's not even me, it's Varla. So who am I?
I'm nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   The delicate relationship between a man and his alter ego can be
strained at times. ``When I moved, I had to tell Varla she couldn't
live in this new apartment, it was too small,'' said Roberson,
amused by the notion. ``I had to get a storage space for her. She's
living in Manhattan Mini Storage with the other homeless people.''
But it's not as bad as it sounds, he maintains. ``Her storage unit
is almost as big as my apartment,'' he added.

 &HT;    Uncovering love story between celebrity Georgia author and teen
poet
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 17.
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was a celebrity author, a nationally known newspaper
columnist and 78 years old. &QR;   &QR;  She was a poet, a starry-eyed fan
and only 16. &QR;   &QR;  They exchanged letters for two years in the
mid-1930s. What started as avuncular advice from the literary elder
statesman became something more. He was obviously smitten. Through
the mail, romance bloomed. &QR;   &QR;  Then it was over. She stopped
answering his eloquent typewritten notes. And though he continued
to promote her poetry in his newspaper column, his letters trailed
off as well. &QR;   &QR;  And so the story of Harry Stillwell Edwards,
Macon's second most famous writer, and Rebecca Griffin, ``Tifton's
poet laureate,'' also would have ended. But 60 years later, a
treasure chest of mementos from Griffin's life, stored in a dusty
Austell attic, came into the hands of Sherry Mullinax, and hearts
throbbed all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Tears just rolled when I read,'' says Mullinax, 52,
a Stockbridge (Ga.) mother of four, who became fascinated not just
by the romance but by this glimpse of a forgotten chapter in
Georgia's literary past.
</P>
<P>
   In the blast-furnace summer of 1996, Mullinax was helping Bill
Greene, a retired construction company owner, as he carted boxes of
papers and books out of the attic of his house in Austell. Greene
was once married to Griffin's late daughter-in-law, and the Austell
house was once hers.
</P>
<P>
   The papers were destined for the burning barrel, but a glimpse
of an old book made Mullinax put several boxes aside. Days later
she was still reading Griffin's scrapbooks and journals,
sketchbooks and poetry. And the 50 letters from Edwards were the
icing: articulate, romantic, ornate and thoroughly 19th century.
Mullinax lost herself in an antique world of courtly gentlemen,
beautiful ladies and heartfelt verse. Then she found Harry's
photograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found this picture and I thought, `God, what an elegant,
elegant man!''' Mullinax says. ``The way he wrote, the way they
talked to each other, it was like something you'd see in the
movies, it was like I was back there listening to their
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called (her sister) Barbara and said you need to come over
and check this out. I'm living back in the past with this excellent
gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax and her sisters Barbara Dumas, 54, and Rose Hammond,
53, were hardly the types to be entranced by a Deep South fairy
tale. None had ever heard of Edwards or Griffin, nor were they fans
of Georgia literature. Atlanta residents since the early 1980s,
they grew up in southern Michigan, part of the sprawling Gale
family, a working-class assemblage of 13 children from two sets of
parents. They spent time in foster care, or with relatives or
grandparents, and life was hard. But their hearts were softened by
this love story, and they decided they needed to find out who Harry
and Becky were, if they could.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;  A rising literary star
</P>
<P>
   The man who drew them into his life was still dashingly handsome
in his late 70s. He was erect and slim, his features distinguished
by calm eyes, a Roman nose and a mustache luxuriant as a gray pushbroom. A one-minute snippet of film in family hands, probably from
1937, shows a poised H.S. Edwards in a wide-brimmed fedora, his
vest and tie immaculate, a cigarette held in his left hand, a cane
hooked over the right.
</P>
<P>
   Though advanced in years, he was at, or near, the peak of his
celebrity. In 1919, Rudyard Kipling had praised his enormously
successful ``Eneas Africanus.'' Franklin D. Roosevelt sent him
birthday greetings in 1935, and two years later Henry Ford made a
special trip to Macon to meet the author, bringing a gift of a
brand-new car. Among the dozens of scrapbooks, photo albums,
letters and journals in Griffin's cache were clippings of news
stories about Ford's visit, during which he pronounced Edwards fit
for the office of U.S. poet laureate. (Edwards, who had been
friends with Macon's most famous writer _ poet Sidney Lanier _
demurred, insisting that he was no poet, but a writer of
``verse.'')
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1855, one of 10 children, Harry Stillwell Edwards came
from a wealthy Macon family. But the Civil War, and the death of
his father and a brother, turned their fortunes upside down, and at
age 8 Harry was delivering The Macon Telegraph to earn money for
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in a house on College Street, he took a special
interest in the young women of nearby Wesleyan College, where he
would frequently stray with his guitar to serenade a crowd of
sweethearts.
</P>
<P>
   He was known to sneak onto the closely guarded campus at night
to ring the college bell, just to let the young women know he was
thinking about them. This practice once prompted the college
president to take a shot at him.
</P>
<P>
   One of those Wesleyan sweethearts, Mary Roxie Lane, would become
Edwards' wife in 1881, the same year he would purchase part
ownership of the newspaper he had once delivered. They had five
children.
</P>
<P>
   In 1886, at the suggestion of his wife, Edwards sent a piece of
short fiction, ``Elder Brown's Backslide,'' to Harper's Monthly
magazine. This inaugurated a successful career in magazine fiction,
and he left the Telegraph (where he was editor and publisher)
shortly thereafter to concentrate on contributing stories to
publications such as The Saturday Evening Post, Atlantic Monthly,
Scribners and Century Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   During a breakneck 23-day burst of productivity in 1895 he wrote
his first novel, ``Sons and Fathers,'' which won the eye-popping
$10,000 first prize in a contest sponsored by the Chicago Record.
Edwards spent some of the prize money buying bicycles for the
neighborhood children.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest success was ``Eneas Africanus,'' a long short story
about the post-Civil War wanderings of a former slave, published
first in The Macon Evening News in 1919. Reprinted as a small book,
it is reported to have sold more than 3 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to fame as a writer, Edwards gained a reputation as
a speaker, touring the Lyceum Circuit on a bill with James Whitcomb
Riley and Edgar ``Bill'' Nye. He dabbled in politics, speaking at
the 1904 Republican National Convention in Chicago to second the
nomination of Theodore Roosevelt. He also made an unsuccessful run
for the U.S. Senate in 1920, campaigning as a Progressive
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;  Writer to writer
</P>
<P>
   After Mary Roxie Edwards died in 1922, Edwards began writing a
column called ``Coming Down My Creek'' for The Atlanta Journal,
which consisted of lighthearted sketches of everyday life in Bibb
County and environs. He often retreated to write at Kingfisher
Cabin, a rustic log house in the woods on Holly Bluff, his
two-square-mile Macon plantation.
</P>
<P>
   It was probably the column that, in 1934, caught the attention
of Becky Griffin of Tifton, a high school journalist and aspiring
poet. A photo from the time shows a dark-eyed girl with a broad
grin.
</P>
<P>
   She sent him letters and poems, and he responded, encouraging
and praising her ability. ``I want to see you develop into a
success dear little Sunshine Lady,'' he wrote her in February, ``to
fling you the torch if I have one.''
</P>
<P>
   In his column of April 26, 1934, Edwards reprinted the
three-stanza poem she had written to him for his 79th birthday
(April 23), ``To You My Friend,'' which includes the lines: ``O
lover of the flow'rs and the birds, / the love I bear for you is
far / Too sweet for idle words. ... O writer of the Cabin and the
Creek, / You are my friend, tho' I, for life's / Ambition, still
must seek.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards didn't identify the poet, except as a ``16-year-old
whose path I cheered a little in this column some months ago. And
of course I am her slave henceforth and forever.''

   ATLANTA: slave henceforth and forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The poem _ and a clipping of the column _ are among the
treasures Mullinax and her sisters rescued. A few days after the
column appeared, Edwards wrote to Griffin privately to say, ``I am
terribly in love with you _ a deep genuine love it must be, since I
have never seen you and know you only in my dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   The next month Edwards traveled to Becky's hometown of Tifton,
where she was a junior at Tifton High School and her father was
manager of the Ritz movie theater. The school had dedicated its May
graduation ceremony to Edwards, with speeches lauding his merits as
a unique man of Southern letters.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards addressed the admiring group and read from his own work,
and also, approvingly, from the work of Miss Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   In his column of May 27, he wrote of the ceremony, and of
meeting ``Tifton's little 16-year-old literary genius, Rebecca
Griffin, whom I herewith name Poetess of the Wiregrass.''
</P>
<P>
   He had already written a letter to her suggesting that they
might have a future together, a future impossible while she was yet
16, but conceivable if she was willing to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``My compromise is for us to be engaged until you are 18,'' he
had written on May 23, ``to give you a chance to secure an
education, without which you would be lost if anything disastrous
happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Such an arrangement was not to be. Edwards' letters became more
wistful over the next few months, until he lamented, on April 18,
1935, ``Have you entirely ceased to love me?''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;  Destroy my letters, he said
</P>
<P>
   We may never know. No letters from Griffin have turned up _
either in the Edwards archives at Macon's Washington Memorial
Library, in the small Edwards collection at the Macon Museum of
Arts and Sciences or in any of the boxes from that Austell attic.
</P>
<P>
   And none may ever surface. Edwards knew that the vast difference
in their ages was unacceptable, and advised Griffin to destroy his
letters. ``A lost letter can wreck a life,'' he wrote to her on
April 23, 1934. The odds are good that he destroyed hers.
</P>
<P>
   But Griffin couldn't follow suit. She carefully saved at least
50 of his dispatches, which he had typed on plain manuscript paper
and mailed to her in care of her father's theater. She also clipped
out his columns, and any news stories that made reference to his
writings, and pasted them into scrapbook after scrapbook _ the
sisters have at least a half-dozen. But the only place to hear
Griffin's voice is in her poetry, and the few quotes attributed to
her by Edwards in his columns and letters.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, she also produced an impressive file of her own
newspaper clips. After graduating from Tifton High in 1935, she
moved to Manchester with her family and wrote reviews of the movies
that showed at her father's movie theater there, the President. Her
poems were also published in The Tifton Gazette, The Carroll County
Times, The Dublin Courier Herald, The Warm Springs Mirror, The
Manchester Mercury, The LaGrange Herald and The Atlanta Journal.
Some of the newspapers called her ``Tifton's poet laureate.''
</P>
<P>
   Her poems were collected in a slim booklet published by the
Mirror, and several were included in an anthology published by
Crown. Her poem ``The Little Chapel,'' about the Old Church on the
Emory campus at Oxford, was highly praised, and the Rev. A.I.
Branham, who was connected with the school, told her in a letter
that the poem should be inscribed on a plaque on the wall there.
</P>
<P>
   But it never was, says John Forney, president of the Oxford
Historical Shrine Society, which has raised $400,000 to rebuild the
Old Church _ and probably never will be.
</P>
<P>
   By 1937 Griffin was carrying on a lively correspondence with a
Warm Springs newspaperman named Sid Williams, who was much closer
to her own age, and they were married at the end of that year.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, ever gallant, continued to promote the ``Poetess of the
Wiregrass'' in his column, and remained cordial. When he learned of
her nuptial plans, he advised her that he would make sure The
Atlanta Journal printed an announcement. He died of bronchial
pneumonia in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;  Time takes its toll
</P>
<P>
   Today if you want to find Harry Edwards, you must step through
the automatic glass doors of the very modern Washington Memorial
Library in downtown Macon. There, in the genealogical research
room, is a handsome bronze bust of the writer as an older man, with
a plaque that reads ``Distinguished Southern Author.'' Adjacent to
Edwards is a similar statue of Sidney Lanier. The two seem to stand
as bookends, holding up Macon's literary history.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was also postmaster in Macon for 14 years, and his
figure is part of a mural adorning the walls of the post office, up
the hill from the library.
</P>
<P>
   But the most tangible part of his legacy is the original
Kingfisher Cabin, the 12-by-24-foot writing shack where he could
pen his column away from the noisy brood of grandchildren who
shared his house at Holly Bluff. After his death the cabin was
disassembled and placed on the Wesleyan campus; then, in the late
1960s, it was moved to the grounds of the Macon Museum of Arts and
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Charmed by his words, entranced by his photograph, Mullinax and
her sisters recently made a pilgrimage to the cabin, to see the
place where their hero spent his quiet time. They left a bouquet of
roses on the mantelpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Are Edwards' letters evidence of an unseemly May-December
courtship? Mullinax doubts it. She says that, despite appearances,
this was a relationship of the mind. ``She wanted to learn how to
write,'' Mullinax says, ``and he was the elite of writers.'' The
trip to the cabin was a high point, she adds. ``I could feel Harry
there, I could picture him sitting there. Going to his cabin, after
reading all those letters, that was pie a la mode. There couldn't
be anything better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but to the casual visitor, wandering down a cinder path
in the woods, not 50 yards from the museum's back door, the little
one-room structure seems forlorn and alone. Once the site of
birthday parties, nature classes and dramatic re-enactments of
scenes from the author's stories, the cabin has not fared well in
the lapse of years.
</P>
<P>
   All the furnishings _ the stuffed deer head, the woven grass
rugs, the framed lock of hair from young Becky Griffin _ are gone.
Some of the timbers have been attacked by post beetles, and others
replaced with anachronistic pressure-treated lumber. Birds have
found their way into the bare interior, and a finch has constructed
a nest in one of the built-in shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're beyond Band-Aids,'' says Bonnie Hopkins, the
museum's director of development, who confesses regret at the
cabin's condition and a dedication to finding the money to restore
it, even though that could cost up to $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask Mary Lane Hartshorn, it would be money well spent. An
Edwards granddaughter, she was one of those rambunctious children
riding her tricycle inside the big house at Holly Bluff. She
remembers the cabin as Edwards' special retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather wrote about the noise, how my mother would try
to keep us quiet, and he would say, `No, I'm getting inspiration
from the children,''' says Hartshorn, 72, who lives in
Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   The Holly Bluff house burned in 1964, taking most of Edwards'
manuscripts, first editions, letters and personal papers with it.
Reprints of some of his short works are still sold by the Middle
Georgia Historical Society, and the Wesleyan library carries a
complete collection. For many years his daughter, Nelle Edwards
Smith, continued to print several of his works, including his paean
to education, ``The Tenth Generation,'' through her own Eneas
Africanus Press.
</P>
<P>
   But Edwards' literary reputation seems almost as neglected as
Kingfisher Cabin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone recognizes his name,'' says Doris Lanier,
a retired professor of English at Georgia Southern University who
wrote her master's thesis on Edwards in 1970. Edwards' genius was
in capturing the post-Civil War world of Middle Georgia, which made
him an important member of the regionalist movement, but less
relevant to other places and times.
</P>
<P>
   His most famous character, the peripatetic Eneas, is today a
politically incorrect embarrassment: a faithful former slave who
pledges gratitude and fealty to his master. Yet Edwards documented
black church services, and other aspects of rural Georgia life,
both white and black, that might otherwise have gone unreported. In
fact, Booker T. Washington, one of the most influential black
leaders of his day, praised Edwards' essay ``The Negro and the
South,'' saying, in a letter, ``it is strong, courageous, and will
prove helpful, I am sure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrote about the Old South,'' says Hartshorn, whose garage
shelters the 1938 Ford given to Edwards by Mr. Ford himself. ``That
era is gone now, and a lot of people don't appreciate knowing about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Also out of fashion is Edwards' 19th-century style of courtly
banter, which he seemed to carry on with all women at all times.
For this reason, Hartshorn suggests that the romance between
Edwards and Griffin was strictly literary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aunt Roxie kept house for him, and she would always put a big
bouquet of daffodils on the piano,'' recalls Hartshorn. ``When he
was going downtown he would swoop them up and give one to the girl
at Woolworth's, and one to the girl at the S &AMP; S (cafeteria). ...
Pretty girls were his chief delight.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;  `I do not want fame'
</P>
<P>
   If Edwards' writing is hard to find today, even more obscure is
the poetry of Rebecca Griffin. She grew up in a time when
newspapers routinely printed poetry from writers both famous and
amateur, sometimes on the front page. Her scrapbooks show that
dozens of her poems appeared in print, and her slim 1937
collection, ``Stars and Flowers,'' was reviewed favorably by the
local press.
</P>
<P>
   In his ``Coming Down My Creek'' column for July 3, 1936, Edwards
reprinted Griffin's sonnet to the Old Church, plus part of a letter
she had written him. Pasted into one of the scrapbooks rescued from
the Austell attic, it is one of her few surviving missives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose I shall always go on writing, even though the world
doesn't know,'' the young woman said. ``I do not want fame, for I
wouldn't know what to do with it. I live to share my heart with my
mother, my sweetheart and my friends. As long as they love me, I
shall feel famous enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax spent two years trying to find Griffin's descendants,
before giving up. ``I wanted to return these things,'' she says.
She learned only that the poet, who would marry three times, died
sometime in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax's sisters then began trying to market the collection.
They approached a used bookstore in Decatur, Sotheby's auction
house in New York City and the Macon museum. They tried to get a
message to Ted Turner because, says Barbara Dumas, ``Ted is the man
with the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of inexperience, the sisters have yet to talk with any
archivists, in Macon or elsewhere. Whether they seek to sell or
donate, however, they will find the crowd of takers small, says
Tena Roberts, archivist at Wesleyan's Willet Memorial Library,
which houses some of Edwards' surviving papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world knows Ernest Hemingway, but not Harry Stillwell
Edwards,'' says Roberts, who has seen some of the Edwards-Griffin
letters. ``He's known by a limited circle of scholars, so these
letters have limited appeal.'' Nevertheless, she said, Wesleyan
considers them significant and is interested.
</P>
<P>
   Dumas and Hammond would like to sell the collection; Mullinax
would be happy if it found a home in a proper archive. And all
three seem delighted to dive into those cardboard boxes again and
again, and spend time with Harry. This Southern gentleman, who had
such a way with women, has, across the ages, cast his spell on the
sisters.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon at Rose Hammond's knickknack-choked Norcross
apartment, Hammond and Dumas sift through photographs, yellowed
clippings and old composition books strewn across Hammond's carpet.
``Everything we've got is worth a fortune to us,'' Dumas points
out, ``but probably isn't worth a dang to anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the story, she says, should be told. ``I think this story is
a great romance, about true love, deep-down emotional love, about
honesty, faithfulness, devotion.''
</P>
<P>
   And, casting her eye across the photograph of that elegant man,
she betrays another motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Says Dumas, ``I think this was the greatest human male of all
time.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last summer, Dr. Andre Churchwell bought himself a
new blue suit. Not just any blue suit, but a single-breasted,
two-button model with peak lapels and a dapper ticket pocket _ a
ringer, he was quick to note, for ``the suit Pierce Brosnan was
wearing when he first met Renee Russo in `The Thomas Crown
Affair.'''
</P>
<P>
   Churchwell, 45, a cardiologist in Nashville, Tenn., makes it a
point to know about such things. Speaking by phone from his office,
he all but crowed describing another recent acquisition, a
dove-gray coat and trousers made in New York by his tailor, Leonard
Logsdail, and cut, he said, from the poshest ``Super 100'' wool
flannel.
</P>
<P>
   Terms like Super 100 and Scabel (a luxury fabric from a British
textile mill) have also leeched into Dennis Saul's conversation.
The head of his own stock brokerage firm, Saul, 56, has his suits
made in Brooklyn by a tailor whose name he won't disclose _ for
fear of driving up his prices.
</P>
<P>
   Each new ensemble sets Saul back about $2,000; a bargain, he
maintained, since ``I'm getting the difference between a Chevy and
a Porche.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Saturday, I looked at 20 different fabrics,'' he
recalled. ``I like to feel that in the course of examining this
stuff, I'm building a body of knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Churchwell and Saul are devout members of an exclusive but
growing fraternity of affluent clothing buffs, who have turned
their backs on off-the-rack apparel in favor of a garment uniquely
tailored to their whims.
</P>
<P>
   Men like these contend that they are wild about a custom suit's
superior fit and quality. But they are just as taken with its
unspoken function as a badge of rank, an expression of their
rarefied tastes and connoisseurship _ as though it were a rare wine
or a vintage car they had studied up on before acquiring.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly brand-conscious, a prosperous minority of men with
a passion for finery has given rise to dynamic sales of hand-made
apparel for the first time since the boom years of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In this decade, suit sales overall have taken a beating as
consumers lean toward casual wear. But when men do buy suits,
retailers and tailors say, they are more likely to splurge these
days, investing in top-of-the-line goods.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in the '80s, men's wear's last gilded age, when a
peacock display of red suspenders or an Hermes tie were thought to
be status symbols, consumers with well-lined pockets are not
blinking at the $2,000 to $7,000 price tag for a custom suit. It's
the sartorial equivalent of a platinum card.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the custom club like to subtly signal one another by
flaunting their ticket pockets _ slim pockets on the jacket
originally used to fit a pair of theater tickets _ and functioning
buttonholes on jacket sleeves, which Wall Street's young turks
leave undone in a quiet show of status.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few years, the custom business has picked up
dramatically,'' said Clifford Grodd, the president of Paul Stuart,
a high-end men's-wear emporium in midtown Manhattan, where the
custom business has doubled since the mid-'90s.
</P>
<P>
   Other merchants cite a similarly robust growth _ about 15
percent to 25 percent annually _ in hand-tailored suits, though no
industry-wide figures exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the hallmarks of affluence, beside buying your Range
Rover, is having a suit made,'' Grodd said. ``It's the sartorial
equivalent of name dropping.''
</P>
<P>
   The lineup of clothiers offering men's custom services in the
New York area, including suits, shirts and sometimes ties, includes
tailors like Leonard Logsdail; specialty stores like Saks Fifth
Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, and such lofty labels
as Oxxford, Kiton, Zegna, Brioni, Attolini and, most recently,
Giorgio Armani, who began selling made-to-measure suits just this
fall under the Le Collezioni label.
</P>
<P>
   Even Moe Ginzburg, the venerable rack-and-pipe operation on
lower Fifth Avenue that is home to $250 budget suits, is trading
up. Next spring, the store will feature made-to-measure men's
apparel in its newly renovated and gentrified store.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ginzburg, the third-generation owner of Moe Ginzburg,
expects made-to-measure customers to come from the ranks of those
who are ``bestowing fine wine on themselves, along with good
caviar, expensive girlfriends and even more expensive wives,'' he
said, adding, ``A custom suit is one more luxury that makes them
feel they have arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, and some retailers _ are often confused about the
terminology of tailored clothing. Essentially, there are three
levels of quality and expense:
</P>
<P>
   _ A custom suit, the cordon bleu of tailored apparel, is cut and
stitched from scratch, using a pattern made of muslim cloth
designed for each client. Known as a bespoke suit in England.
Prices range from $2,000 to well over $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ A made-to-measure suit is a Betty Crocker variation on custom
tailoring. Customers are measured, and choose from a wide range of
fabrics, but their suits are cut using standard patterns, not made
from scratch. This is what men's-wear designers offer when they do
``trunk shows'' at stores. Priced from $700 to $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   _ Off-the-rack suits, those hanging in stores when customers
walk in, are made in standard sizes and can be altered in simple
ways by a tailor. Priced from $100 to $3,000.

 &HT;    Wahsington exhibit reveals America's renaissance man
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ George Washington did not cut down the cherry tree.
</P>
<P>
   A historian quashes that bit of American mythology in one of the
video clips in ``Treasures of Mount Vernon: George Washington
Revealed,'' opening today at the Atlanta History Center.
</P>
<P>
   But don't worry: You won't end up admiring him any less.
Washington may have worn false teeth _ a spring-operated
contraption has fascinated visitors at prior stops of the show tour
_ but his conduct was true. And remarkable in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   Marshaling letters, clothing, furnishings, military gear,
artwork from the collection of his Virginia estate, the Mount
Vernon staff reveals Washington to be a man of diverse talents. The
able statesman and military hero was also a successful farmer, a
gallant dancer, a tasteful decorator, a prescient environmentalist
and a reluctant international celebrity. All that, and a
Southerner, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Treasures'' tells its story chronologically and thematically.
It begins with a plaster cast of the ``life mask'' made by French
artist Jean-Antoine Houdon in 1785, immortalizing the famous
features, as chiseled as, well, Mount Rushmore. The teeth are in
the same case, behind the mask. The pairing makes a statement about
the show's intentions to get beyond the public persona. It must be
said, however, that the teeth are about as intimate as it gets. If
you were looking for a warts-and-all expose, you will be
disappointed. This is a show about achievement, not peccadilloes.
</P>
<P>
   The curators wisely alternate small-scale objects and
life-size-displays , both of which are augmented by wall texts and
labels. (There is also an audio tour, free with admission, which
was unavailable for review.) For instance, the first gallery
includes the surveyor's tools representing Washington's first
career and a walk-in replica of the tent from which he directed
battles as Commander in Chief of the Continental forces.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was ``charmed'' by the sound of whizzing bullets, our
leader loved the farmer's life on his Virginia plantation. The
gallery devoted to Mt. Vernon tells us much about his various
talents. Ledgers and letters chronicle his prosperous and diverse
agricultural pursuits, from fish to liquor. We learn that
Washington was ahead of his time in rotating crops.
</P>
<P>
   Chairs, silver and porcelain speak to his elegant taste. He also
knew a thing or two about time management: He took advantage of
time spent in Philadelphia during the Constitutional Convention to
buy household goods from the great craftsmen there.
</P>
<P>
   The plethora of portraits of this famous man as well as displays
of his clothing give you sense of his imposing physical presence.
They also bespeak his life-long fame, a fate to which he responded
with good-natured resignation. As suggested by the number of French
portraits, he was revered across the Atlantic as well. The Marquise
de Lafayette even gave him the key to the Bastille to honor his
role in fostering the French Revolution. Such was his popularity
that his likeness became a cottage industry, copied, often badly,
in engravings and stamped on mugs and medallions. The phenomenon
can be compared to the rage for souvenirs of John F. Kennedy and
Lady Di.
</P>
<P>
   A venerated hero while alive, he quickly became a near-deity
when he died in 1799. In the engraving, ``The Apotheosis of
Washington,'' he ascends to heaven like a saint. Through this show,
we know him as saint with two feet firmly planted in American soil.
</P>

 NEW YORK: to $3,000.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hand-made suits appeal to the kind of man who wants a walnut
dashboard in his car and a cherrywood floor in his dining room.
``The more prosperous the man, the more difficult it is to satisfy
his needs,'' said Lawrence Kudlow, a chief economist with Schroeder
bank and a commentator for CNBC and Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   Kudlow, who buys his hand-made pinstripe suits from Logsdail,
views the craving for hand-made apparel as the indicator of a
larger trend: ``Customization is a theme in all consumer goods,''
he noted. ``The suit business is part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kurt Salmon Associates, a New York consumer research
group, which conducted a survey of middle- to high-income shoppers
earlier this year, forecasts increases of 20 percent to 30 percent
in sales of custom-made apparel over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Younger consumers, men now in their 30s and 40s, whose notions
of style were honed on aggressively voguish labels like Prada,
Helmut Lang and Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, are among those giving
made-to-order suits a push. Disenchanted by the indifferent
construction and evanescent life span of designer brands, some have
discovered custom apparel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men's clothes are becoming so fashion forward that I can't
wear them,'' complained Giovanni Russo, one such recent custom
convert. Russo, 33, an art director and the head of his own New
York design firm, called No. 11, has mostly abandoned designer
suits, which he deems too flashy, for the subtlety of a
trim-fitting gray wool coat and pair of trousers, like those he
ordered last summer from Seize Sur Vingt, a downtown clothier to
the young and hip.
</P>
<P>
   Learning about the arcana of style _ the names of fabrics, the
types of stitching _ is part of the allure of a custom suit, said
Dan McCampbell, a Saks Fifth Avenue vice president and fashion
director, who based his observations on findings from a survey by
the store of 300 consumers aged 25 to 64 and earning $75,000 a year
or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are turning increasingly to a tailor or a knowledgeable
sales associate to inform them about how clothes are made,'' he
said. ``Why? They see clothes as an investment.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he might have added, an instant passport to James Bondian
self-assurance. Some tailors trade on their clients' eagerness to
become connoisseurs _ a trait hard-wired into many men, the same
instinct that leads them to become audio buffs _ while preying
slyly on their insecurities.
</P>
<P>
   One television executive, who declined to be named, told of
visiting the New York hotel suite of Gianni Campagna, a Milanese
tailor, who says he makes suits for the billionaire Ronald O.
Perleman and Henry Kravis, the financier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had on my best Zegna suit,'' the client recalled, laughing
ruefully, ``but they looked me over, and told me my cuffs were too
short, my shoulders too low and my buttons too high. All I could
think was, Oh my God, do I look that bad?''
</P>
<P>
   He succumbed just the same, buying one suit in solid gray wool
and another in a navy Prince of Wales plaid. Cost: $3,800 each. He
also bought a cashmere sportscoat for $2,600.
</P>
<P>
   Some men take the passion for personalization to extremes.
Logsdail, a Midtown tailor with a Savile Row pedigree, tells of one
client who asked to have his suit coat lined with a patchwork of
silk Hermes scarves.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans more often shun such display, opting for
refinements as faint and elusive as the scent of English lavender.
They include Jeffry Schneider, 31, an investment banker and
long-time patron of Paul Stuart.
</P>
<P>
   His latest purchase is a tasmanian wool suit decorated with
plaid so fine it is all but invisible. ``A hand-made suit is a
subtle thing,'' he said during a fitting the other day, pointing
out the hand-stitching along the edge of the lapel. ``But this is
my favorite detail,'' Schneider said, turning his jacket inside out
to show off his pen pocket _ a one-inch slash just beneath his left
breast pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers acknowledge that the advantage of such features may
well be in the wearer's eye. ``So much of this business is
psychological,'' said Grodd of Paul Stuart. ``A hand-sewn
buttonhole is a sign of status, sure, but one that is much
overrated. With all the technology available now, ``handwork
doesn't necessarily make something better.''
</P>
<P>
   True custom fans brush such reservations off like lint. Eager to
stand out from the herd and, at the same time, blend in with their
peers, some take a line from their tailors, contending, a bit
solemnly, that their suits are an addiction _ not to say the
plushest of security blankets.
</P>
<P>
   They certainly serve that purpose for Russo. ``I hate being
self-conscious,'' he said. ``I like to feel that my clothes aren't
wearing me. And when I find a suit I really can relax in, well, I
just go with it.''

JONBENET CASE FRUSTRATING _ BUT THAT'S LAW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't the headline most people were hoping for: ``JonBenet
grand jury returns no indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   No indictment? No charges of any kind against anyone? What in
the world is going on here?
</P>
<P>
   The media legal eagles are saying that it's not so uncommon,
really, this mind-boggling lack of anything remotely resembling a
prosecution in the nearly three years since 6-year-old JonBenet
Ramsey was found slthe basement of her family's home in
Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Homicides often go unsolved, say the experts _ including
homicides of children. Sometimes there's just not enough evidence.
</P>
<P>
   And lack of evidence is the problem in the Ramsey case,
according to Boulder County District Attorney Alex Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have sufficient evidence to warrant the filing of
charges against anyone who has been investigated at this time,''
Hunter said Wednesday after a grand jury concluded its 13-month
review of the case.
</P>
<P>
   For JonBenet's parents, Hunter's announcement was both good news
and bad news. Having lived under an ``umbrella of suspicion'' since
their daughter's death in December 1996, John and Patsy Ramsey were
relieved that neither of them was indicted.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Ramseys said in a statement released
after Hunter's announcement, ``We take no satisfaction in this
result because a child killer remains free and undetected.''
</P>
<P>
   Free? Definitely. Undetected? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   If the slaying was committed by an unidentified perpetrator who
invaded the Ramsey home and left JonBenet's battered body to be
found the day after Christmas _ well, that individual is as yet
undetected.
</P>
<P>
   But if the murder was committed by John and/or Patsy Ramsey _ as
so many experts and nonexperts alike have speculated _ then why are
the police, the prosecutors, a battalion of well-paid crime
consultants and a grand jury of Colorado residents unable to bring
the culprit(s) to justice?
</P>
<P>
   In a word: ``proof.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy enough for glib panelists on the Geraldo Rivera and
Larry King talk shows to declare a suspect guilty of murder, to
lambaste law enforcement officials for failing to file charges
against some individual who's been convicted in the media. But cops
and prosecutors aren't entertainers; they must operate under
certain legal constraints.
</P>
<P>
   It's an inconvenience to the police and the occasional lynch
mob, to be sure, but the Constitution of the United States
guarantees due process of law to criminal suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, neither John nor Patsy Ramsey has formally
been identified as a ``suspect'' in the death of JonBenet, although
Hunter has been holding the ``umbrella of suspicion'' over them and
the media have pretty much obliterated the Ramseys' presumption of
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everybody has a theory about the murder _ I have one,
but I'm taking the high road and keeping it to myself _ and all the
theories share a common flaw: They are based entirely on
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of Hunter's no-indictment announcement, a woman
identified as an advocate for crime victims was on ``Rivera Live''
expressing her outrage at the lack of prosecution when ``we know
that one of two people'' killed JonBenet.
</P>
<P>
   We ``know?'' Excuse me, folks, but if we ``knew'' that one or
both of the Ramseys committed this horrifying crime, then that
Boulder grand jury surely would have indicted one or both of them.
If the people who've been investigating this crime for three years
don't ``know'' who did it _ and they don't _ rest assured that some
talking head on ``Rivera Live'' doesn't know.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the bottom line. Nobody who's in a position to file
charges, make an arrest or pursue a prosecution ``knows'' who
killed JonBenet Ramsey. In the absence of knowing, the authorities
need evidence to support their suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   It's frustrating _ maddening, even _ to see this case go
unresolved. But the Boulder authorities deserve praise, not
criticism, for declining to stage a murder trial simply to quell
the impatience of the media and the public.

</P>
<P>
   ``If I can't be first, I won't be second at anything.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Samuel Colt, 1844
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   When he spoke those words 155 years ago, there was no way that
the man who revolutionized manufacturing in this country in the
mid-19th century could know that one day his corporate namesake
would be the first to crater to legal threats caused by a
hysterical response to the misuse of his product.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Colt's story of industrial genius and self-promotion,
gleaned from books, biographical narratives and historical papers,
is enough to make Donald Trump swoon with envy. Even the tale of
how he came up with the idea of the revolving breech pistol borders
on the fanciful.
</P>
<P>
   Sent off to see the world by his textile-agent father after the
death of his mother, young Sam Colt was aboard a Calcutta-bound
sailing ship when he conceived the idea for the rotating cylinder
that would make him famous. He reportedly got the notion from
studying the movement of the ship's wheel.
</P>
<P>
   After Colt returned to the United States in 1832, he spent the
next few years traveling the country under the name of Dr. Coult.
He would use any gathering of people he could find to demonstrate
and sell the latest medical discovery, nitrous oxide _ laughing
gas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1834, Colt signed a two-year contract with Baltimore gunsmith
John Pearson to work on various models of firearms. This would lead
to his eventual U.S. patent for the revolver. At the end of his
contract, the 23-year-old took his patent and, with seed money from
wealthy East Coast relatives, opened the Patent Arms Manufacturing
Co. in Paterson, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Success did not come quickly. Despite much wining and dining of
government officials _ on his relatives' nickel _ lucrative offers
never materialized, Colt was forced to declare bankruptcy six years
and 5,000 pistols and rifles later.
</P>
<P>
   From 1841 to 1846, Colt lived in New York City. While still
trying to find buyers for his guns, he shifted his attention to
other munitions and developed an underwater mine that could be
detonated by a telegraph signal. Although his demonstration of
blowing up a 500-ton schooner on the Potomac River wowed
spectators, it did nothing to garner a government contract.
</P>
<P>
   Enter 1846 and the Mexican War. Colt received a letter from
Capt. Samuel Walker saying that the guns he had made years before
in Paterson had changed the way that the Texas Rangers fought
Indians in 1839.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Jack Hays and 15 Texas Rangers had been ambushed by 80
Comanche warriors, reputedly the best light cavalry in this nation
at the time. Walker wrote that the soldiers finally had a weapon
that matched the Comanches' rapid-fire abilities with bows and
arrows _ and exceeded their accuracy. Walker needed that advantage
against the Mexicans and wanted to outfit his 500 men with two
revolvers each.
</P>
<P>
   By 1847, Colt was back in business. He set up shop in his
hometown of Hartford, Conn., which had developed as the industrial
capital of the country through the widespread introduction of
machine tools and precision measurements. Such technology could
produce assembly guns with interchangeable machined parts.
</P>
<P>
   Colt's system for mass-producing firearms helped spark a
revolution for other complex metal products, such as typewriters,
sewing machines, cameras and bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   From 1836 to 1870, the world was a volatile place. The Texas
Revolution had ignited the imagination of the public, with the
scrappy heroes rebelling against a foreign power. Wars for
independence dotted the globe _ Italy, Russia, Mexico. The Crimean
War. The Franco-Prussian War. The Civil War. Colt's firearms were
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good people in this world are very far from being
satisfied with each other and my arms are the best peacemaker,''
Colt said in 1852.
</P>
<P>
   The Peacemaker. Colt's products are considered anything but by
too many people in today's hyper-reactive society. Their use for
self-defense has been obliterated in the minds of people who focus
their rage on the guns and not on the purveyors of evil who misuse
them. Because of the precarious financial situation that liability
lawsuits have placed the company in, Colt officials said this week
they are dramatically curtailing the number of models that will be
available for sale to the public.
</P>
<P>
   A sad irony can be found in tomorrow's announcement that Samuel
Colt will be among the 21 larger-than-life personalities to be
added to the Texas Trail of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   His invention played a key role in shaping this nation's western
heritage and this state's unique character. It remains to be seen
whether Texans will continue to value the kind of self-reliance and
self-determination that are the hallmarks of the Lone Star State's
history.

MUSINGS ON THE MAKING OF A BOMBSHELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 17)  
(js) 
 By LAREN STOVER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The see-through ``Happy Birthday, Mr. President'' gown (Lot No.
55) may go for $1 million at Christie's auction of the personal
property of Marilyn Monroe, on Oct. 27 and 28. But for me, the far
more revealing relics are her colander and cheese grater (No. 401),
her dogeared books, many first-editions (Nos. 500 to 566) and all
the intimate, mundane remains from the life and legacy of a
bombshell.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, I have become entranced by bombshells _
those women present and past, famous and not, who instantly make a
devastating impression on men. Are they invariably blond and dim?
Are they born or made? Most crucially, could I be one?
</P>
<P>
   I read bombshell biographies, rented bombshell videos and talked
nonstop about what makes a bombshell. Some friends and I even
started holding bombshell roundtables earlier this year at our
apartments in an attempt to decode the secrets of this iconic
creature. We quickly concluded that every woman has an inner
bombshell waiting to be detonated. We made lists, jotted down
maxims. We outlined what makes her tick, from her shoes (any
peekaboo sandal, even in the coldest of weather), to the two types
of temper tantrums she is prone to (blondes pout; brunettes throw
breakable objects) to the bombshell's philosophy (optimism gives
her good posture). We decided her favorite film would be ``Bambi.''
</P>
<P>
   In the voluptuous 415-page catalog, there is evidence that a
bombshell's allure is not that she is, as doctrine dictates,
devastatingly dumb, but rather devastatingly complex. In this book,
which weighs almost as much as my unabridged Webster's, are objects
and biographical bits that reveal outrageous vanity, extreme
frailty and a restless intellect.
</P>
<P>
   For the famous dress in which Marilyn crooned ``Happy Birthday''
to President John F. Kennedy in 1962, she implored the couturier
Jean Louis to ``design a truly historical dress,'' the catalog
says, ``a dazzling dress that's one of a kind'' and that was
``sculpted'' on her body while she drank Champagne _ all for a
performance that would last less than half a minute. Yet amid the
furs and long gloves are things humble and sentimental, too: a worn
stuffed toy poodle (No. 469); Marilyn's certificate of conversion
to Judaism, for her third husband, Arthur Miller (No. 355); an
unglamorous Plexiglas tissue-box cover (No. 418), from which I can
imagine her pulling pink Kleenex to blot up heartbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who want to own these seemingly everyday objects
hope her shimmering, effervescent and breathless appeal might rub
off, as if owning something _ anything _ ``Marilyn'' (No. 147: a
battered picnic hamper) would give us a little va-va-va-voom.
Because a bombshell, as this tome clearly proves, is not made
entirely of slit-to-there dresses, wicked stilettos and false
eyelashes. No, being a bombshell is a state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   I first glimpsed this in the fourth grade, when my grandmother,
a Southern belle, gave me a bottle of Christian Dior's My Sin and
my first stockings and high-heels, in aqua blue brocade. I
practiced sashaying over the uneven brick path in her backyard,
repeating my bombshell mantra, ``Why don't you come up and see me
sometime?'' I was awed by the throaty power Mae West seemed to have
over men, but I adored Marilyn for her friendly femininity.
</P>
<P>
   Bombshells, however, were not highly regarded in my house. My
mother was a serious thespian. To her, Marilyn (and actresses of
her ilk, from Jean Harlow to Sophia Loren) was simply a body void
of talent _ and worse, she seemed to enjoy being ogled. My own
bombshell aspirations were squashed under my mother's prim pump.
</P>
<P>
   So, I grew up to lead a sensible life, a writer of fiction who
keeps an office job, too, and whose style signature was vintage
orthopedic shoes. My turnaround came after a breathy, voluptuous,
blonde began swishing into our morning advertising meetings. With
Veronica Lake hair, tight sweaters and 4-inch heels, she was the
kind of woman who could cross the street without looking. She was a
lush landscape, and her smile was an invitation to enjoy the view.
I had dismissed her as a vapid blonde, until I threw out a grammar
question to the room, and she was the only one who responded.
``Don't you have `The Chicago Manual of Style'?'' she asked in her
sultry tone. ``Here, borrow mine.''
</P>
<P>
   It was then that I realized a bombshell could be brainy. Later I
would discover it may even be a requisite.
</P>
<P>
   No longer inhibited by the conventional wisdom that intelligence
ruled out glamour, I traded in my black geek glasses for
tortoise-shell Gucci cat's-eyes not unlike Marilyn's (No. 121) and
started growing out my bangs. I picked up a few snug sweaters, and
had my A-line skirts taken in. I even bought a pair of marabou
mules (like No. 305: Plexiglas mules trimmed with white fox fur) to
parade in around the apartment, unable to dress like a slob under
any circumstances. I'd ask myself, would a bombshell be seen in
sweats?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What is and isn't a bombshell is, of course, up for grabs.
Harlow started it all with her 1933 film, ``Bombshell,'' in which
she portrays Hollywood's creation of the ultimate ``it'' girl, a
peroxide blonde with ``a pinwheel personality.'' But Marilyn
perfected the ideal, and the Christie's catalog reads like a
virtual bombshell bible.
</P>
<P>
   A bombshell, it reveals, is the kind of woman who turns heads
and yet is flawed, physically (a candid photograph, on page 54,
shows Marilyn's legs to be plump and curveless) and emotionally
(No. 499: a handwritten poem with the lyrics ``I've got a tear
hanging over my beer/that can't let go/it(s) too bad I feel
sad/When I got all my life behind me ... They say I'm lucky to be
alive it's hard to figure out _ when everything I feel _ hurts!'').
</P>
<P>
   She has dignity, often transcending a tragic childhood. Dorothy
Dandridge was beaten routinely with a hairbrush; Marilyn grew up in
orphanages and foster homes (No. 355: a white baby grand piano that
once belonged to her mother _ and that Marilyn spent years
searching for after her mother was institutionalized).
</P>
<P>
   ``The bombshell's library,'' my friend Nicole asserted, doesn't
always merit a room of its own. In fact, a bombshell's collection
may consist entirely of books on the floor surrounding her bed or
stacked so that she can, say, climb up on them to open a window.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole and the other members of our bombshell roundtable had our
own ideas about the books and authors a bombshell would or would
not read. Yes to Shakespeare's ``Anthony and Cleopatra,'' George
Bernard Shaw's ``Caesar and Cleopatra.'' No to T.S. Eliot, Carl
Jung and John Updike. We speculated that she would think Sylvia
Plath was pretty and would glance at ``The Bell Jar'' in a
bookstore, but after reading about her suicide would put the book
down. As for Anne Sexton, another beautiful poet, Nicole was
certain that no bombshell would ever read her after hearing that
she'd hugged an air-conditioner in her analyst's office. We figured
Marilyn had read F. Scott Fitzgerald's ``The Great Gatsby'' (No.
506) but were surprised by James Joyce's ``Dubliners,'' Faulkner's
``The Sound and the Fury'' (No. 549) and ``The Little Engine That
Could'' (No. 522).
</P>
<P>
   I was equally startled by Marilyn's domestic aspirations. I'd
always fantasized that a bombshell refrigerator was essentially a
vanity on ice used to store nail polish, perfume, hosiery (in the
freezer) and a bright blue eye mask. Marilyn may have only mastered
``toast, pasta and scrambled eggs,'' but her tattered ``New Joy of
Cooking'' (No. 523) looks like a happy wreck.
</P>
<P>
   A bombshell is resilient. A film that bombs, a marriage on the
rocks (No. 8: a photograph of Joe DiMaggio) are setbacks, but she
always bounces back, or at least puts up a good front. A bombshell
puts glamour before comfort. A nude leg on a cold day. The
constraints of boned underpinnings (No. 306: a group of corsets). A
bombshell lives, really lives, in her heels. She walks in them,
runs in them _ to arrive flushed and breathless was one of
Marilyn's secrets _ and dances in them in ballrooms and bedrooms
and onstage (No. 1: ravaged gold-leather high-heels worn to
entertain the troops in Korea).
</P>
<P>
   While she might have a temper, a bombshell is compassionate. She
likes to be photographed cuddling small fluffy dogs (No. 443: a
group of pictures featuring her pet Maltese). A bombshell is
obsessed with fuzzy things. Kim Basinger and Brigitte Bardot rescue
animals, but Marilyn at her height of fame in the 1950s wore white
ermine (No. 24), beige beaver (No. 175) and lynx (No. 181).
</P>
<P>
   After all, a bombshell has complexities to hide and an image to
project.
</P>
<P>
   Our roundtables led to a reading from our own ``Bombshell Manual
of Style'' at the Algonquin Hotel earlier this year. Too shy to
read, I introduced the evening, wearing my first pair of skinny
heels for the occasion. I had clipped on ``dress-up'' earrings, a
pair of dangly fakes I've probably had since I was 16 (like No. 3:
rhinestone earrings). By then I knew: a bombshell doesn't need real
diamonds to feel like a million dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ It is the first day of the semester, and
Harvey C. Mansfield has once again drawn a standing-room-only crowd
of Harvard students to his course on the history of ancient and
medieval political philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Courtly and serious in a dark gray suit, Mansfield paced in
front of the blackboard, gazing sternly into the faces of the more
than five dozen students who showed up, most of them white and
male.
</P>
<P>
   ``This course is trans-millennial,'' he began, gently ridiculing
the faddishness of millennium-related discussions. ``We're
interested in the permanent significance. We're interested in what
belongs to every millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The statements are as much of an introduction to his course as
they are to his world. At 67, Mansfield is probably best known
around the Harvard campus as a popular government teacher and a
famously conservative nag. He strongly opposes affirmative action.
He has warned against the dangers of not respecting manliness and
declared that homosexuality would undermine civilization if it were
made respectable.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the current issue of Harvard Magazine dubs him ``Prince
of the Conservatives''; on the cover, Mansfield adopts a Tom
Wolfe-like pose, wearing a panama hat, a cream-colored blazer and a
slight smirk.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Mansfield is more than a university gadfly. A kind of Father
Confessor to students of politics for nearly four decades,
Mansfield has quietly shaped the thinking of a generation of
conservative writers, academics and public figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intellectuals often have their greatest political influence
indirectly,'' said E.J. Dionne, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution and a Washington Post columnist who has written several
books on government. ``Somebody like Harvey Mansfield might not be
quoted by George W. Bush, but a lot of the advisers sitting in the
room with Bush would be influenced by Harvey Mansfield.''
</P>
<P>
   They include people like William Kristol, editor of the
conservative Weekly Standard and a former adviser to Vice President
Dan Quayle; Alan Keyes, a Republican presidential contender and
former Reagan administration diplomat; Gary Rosen, associate editor
at the conservative monthly Commentary; James Ceaser, a government
professor at the University of Virginia, and Nathan Tarcov, a
political science professor at the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself very lucky to have run into him when I was
18 years old,'' said Kristol, who was a student of Mansfield's in
the early 1970s. ``He really helped me understand how the questions
of political philosophy relate to practical political issues
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Sean Wilentz, a liberal Princeton University historian who
drew harsh criticism from Mansfield for his defense of President
Clinton during the impeachment proceedings, admitted, ``Some of us
would give essential body parts for that kind of influence.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, Mansfield sat serenely in his book-lined
office, surrounded by portraits of Dead White Males like John
Locke, Thomas More and the subject of decades of his scrutiny,
Machiavelli. Mansfield has produced translations of three works by
the Renaissance figure, including ``The Prince,'' in addition to
three books on the man himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is even more evil than he appears to be and he had
a plan to change our way of thinking, to make us realistic, more
willing to do dirty and nasty things for the sake of some good,''
he said of Machiavelli. ``It's with reason that he is considered
the first modern thinker, even the founder of modern thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield, who is trimly built and looks 20 years younger than
his age, is soft-spoken, even a bit shy in person. Machiavelli is
his speciality, but it is his exposition of the ideas of the
American philosopher Leo Strauss that has resonated in current
policy debates.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss, an unabashed elitist, was harshly critical of modern
political thinkers, arguing that they were unable to make value
judgments. He fervently celebrated the ancient Greek philosophers,
believing they should be treated not as historical figures but as
sources of wisdom today. ``He runs one of the intellectual
factories that has kept Leo Strauss' work alive,'' said Dionne.
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield says his provocative style is part of his appeal.
``People come to me because there are very few academic
conservatives and also because I answer,'' he said, confessing to
enjoying the center stage. ``If you're going to go out on the limb,
you might as well say, `Everybody look at me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Rosen, who once served as Mansfield's teaching assistant,
says that he is purposely ``naughty'': ``He wants to kind of shake
the humorless orthodoxy of the other side and encourage
discussion.'' Keyes, a staunchly conservative radio talk show host,
agrees: ``He does not compromise so that it will sound better to
your ear. He will present it in such a way so that your mind is
forced to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But for some, that is precisely the problem. His critics insist
that Mansfield's inflammatory remarks and reliance on stereotypes
often do more to polarize debate on campus than to encourage it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of Harvey Mansfield's problem is that he likes hyperbole;
he likes to state extremes,'' said Everett Mendelsohn, who is
chairman of the university's history of science department and
protested the Vietnam War as a Harvard graduate student. ``He takes
issues which might well need discussion and by overstating the
problem makes them undiscussable.''
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield, for instance, speculated that an increase in the
number of black students at Harvard had led to grade inflation,
even though he admitted he had no hard data to prove it. In his
office, he characterized affirmative action as ``a bad idea wrapped
up in one great mistake, self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He attacked the feminist movement, saying it was based on the
flawed notion that there are no essential differences between the
sexes. ``Men today are out of control because manliness is not
being respected,'' he declared. The only Harvard faculty member to
vote against a women's studies major in 1986, Mansfield is now
working on a book titled ``Manliness.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been quoted as saying that gay sex is ``shameful'' and
that homosexuality ``rightly causes most regular people to feel
repulsed.'' Mansfield said he became more outspoken after he
stepped down as chairman of Harvard's government department in
1977. He describes the late 1960s as a catastrophe for Harvard and
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Everything became ``directed toward the goal of social justice
rather than truth and learning,'' he said. ``Harvard is very trendy
these days. It does not want to be isolated, aloof in an ivory
tower. That's a big mistake we're making. We should be much further
from political and social questions. The purpose of the university
is not to produce solutions for these questions but to think and
raise questions and to challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield said he found it paradoxical that the counterculture
of the late 1960s had become the establishment culture of Harvard,
``even though many of them are very liberal or very far to the left
and oppose the idea of establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield was reared in a New Deal liberal household. His mother
was a homemaker, his father a political science professor at Ohio
State University who ended up at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   He has spent most of his own adult life at Harvard, however. He
graduated summa cum laude in 1953 and received his doctorate in
1961. ``I love it, but I'm angry at it,'' he snaps. He said he
became disaffected with liberals when he attended Harvard because
he was strongly anti-communist.
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield who has two grown sons, met his current wife, Delba
Winthrop, at Harvard when she was a graduate student in his
political philosophy class. She teaches political theory in
Harvard's adult education program. Together they run the
Harvard-based Program on Constitutional Government, which sponsors
public forums. (His former wife, his 28-year-old daughter and his
son-in-law were killed in a car accident a decade ago.)
</P>
<P>
   Amid the ivy and Georgian red brick at Harvard these days, there
is little of the political ferment of the late '60s, when students
held sit-ins, called strikes and took over campus buildings to
protest the Vietnam War, the ROTC presence and the lack of a black
studies department, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, in a referendum over a boycott of grapes
in support of migrant farm workers, Harvard students voted to
reintroduce the grapes to university dining halls. The campuswide
turnout was larger than in most student elections.
</P>
<P>
   Walking across Harvard Yard recently, Mansfield acknowledged
that there were more conservative students on campus. But he
complained that students now chose courses on the basis of the
professor's politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the students that I get are conservative students and
the ones that I don't aren't,'' he said, adding that he misses the
days when students were quick to challenge him. ``When I was
younger, they listened to me more. Now they respect me more.''
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield said he taught students not so much what to think as
how to think: ``That means going back to the origin of our thoughts
in the early liberals, people like Hobbes and Locke, but it also
means going back to the classical thinkers that they opposed, like
Plato and Aristotle. So I guess that says, `Don't be smug and don't
think that the dominant thoughts today are the only thoughts.'''
</P>
<P>
   John Couriel, a 21-year-old senior who was assistant policy
director to Florida Gov. Jeb Bush during his political campaign,
was among the many conservative students who packed Mansfield's
lecture hall the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of temerity at Harvard about thinking seriously
about hard questions, but professor Mansfield is not affected by
that,'' said Couriel, a social studies major. ``It makes him
controversial but also makes him the great scholar he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Another student, Jacqueline Newmyer, a 20-year-old history and
literature major who describes herself as a moderate Republican,
said she was drawn to his traditional approach. ``He's kind of a
breath of fresh air,'' she said. ``A lot of professors here are
kind of immersed in this politically correct, more stylish kind of
teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   But Melvin Priester, a social studies major who received an
A-minus in a contemporary government course with Mansfield last
fall, is less adulatory: ``Mansfield genuinely does believe he is
fighting to save Harvard and the sanctity of American academics.
The question is what really is he saving? I'd argue that he's
saving a tradition of patriarchy and white male dominance.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mansfield's outspokenness has gained him admirers from
the other end of the spectrum. Michael Sandel, a government
professor who has offered the liberal counterpoint in courses that
he has jointly taught with Mansfield, describes him as ``a one-man
antidote to liberal complacency'' at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saves the Harvard faculty from sliding into smugness and
self-satisfaction,'' Sandel said. ``He forces those of us who
disagree to defend our views and to never stop thinking.''

MODERN HUNTS FOR THE GREAT WHITE WHALE LEAVE AHAB ADRIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Skedded earlier as CONNECTIONS.)  
 (bl)  
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``What is it,'' Ahab cries in his last moments of reasoned
thought before the chase of the White Whale, ``what is it, what
nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what cozening, hidden
lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor commands me; that
against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep pushing, and
crowding and jamming myself on all the time?'' Ahab has his
Moby-Dick. But we have our ``Moby-Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   Melville's novel stands whalelike, imperious, encyclopedic,
containing multitudes. Ahab claims that one of the reasons he so
hates the White Whale _ aside from its having devoured his leg _ is
its stupendous mystery. In ordinary life, he tells his first mate,
Starbuck, each event, each deed is a ``pasteboard mask'' hiding
behind its stale form a ``reasoning thing,'' a sensible being. So
too with the whale. And, in his pursuit, Ahab intends to thrust
through this most gargantuan pasteboard mask of all, shove against
its inscrutable barriers and reveal that ``reasoning thing.'' Or
its devilish absence.
</P>
<P>
   And doesn't the novel mount such a challenge as well? While not
inscrutable, it does defy simple scrutiny, hiding its secrets while
proclaiming their immensity. Egyptian pyramids and Greek gods,
Macbeth and Lear, Khan and Jonah, all erupt through waves of
allusive prose. ``Moby-Dick'' can appear, at times, like the
tattoos on the cannibal Queequeg's body, ``a mystical treatise on
the art of attaining truth'' _ on the art, but also on the dangers.
</P>
<P>
   So is it any wonder that the novel also inspires obsessions,
inviting us to tame it, unmask it, strip it of its skin and see
what lies behind this account of a mad quest by a crippled man to
kill a demonic brute? Even in our own decade, so suspicious of
Ahabian imperialism, the challenge is being answered.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, for example, will be the last performance of
Laurie Anderson's ``Songs and Stories From Moby-Dick'' at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music. And a new novel, ``Ahab's Wife''
(William Morrow)'' by Sena Jeter Naslund is a main selection of the
Book-of-the-Month Club and has been hailed for its ``brilliance''
in early reviews. It imagines the life of the obsessed captain's
stay-at-home spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Melville's whaling ships were equipped with the most advanced
equipment of the early 19th century _ whaling was a $120 million
industry, its products ranking third in American exports _ but
contemporary artists come just as heavily laden in their ventures
into Melvillian seas, steering the frigates of 20th-century
invention.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Anderson, these are multimedia tools that turn the
book's cascading prose into showers of video images and replace its
musical cadences with somber, portentous sounds created by
instruments saturated with electronic circuitry. She does not
encircle ``Moby-Dick''; instead she stabs at it with her sardonic
declamations.
</P>
<P>
   And while Ms. Naslund ostensibly preserves Melville's literary
tools _ the exclamations, the alliteration, the sharply contrasting
chapters, the occasional archaic phrase _ she also chases her
subject in ardent 20th-century fashion, with self-conscious
proclamations of political virtue.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Naslund has said that in focusing on Ahab's wife _ a figure
barely mentioned by Melville _ she was attempting to ``redeem the
territory'' of the novel by providing a place in it for women. And
while Melville is in her words ``an advocate of cultural and
religious tolerance,'' she also wanted to suggest tolerance ``for
other people's realities.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Naslund's and Ms. Anderson's ventures both seek to turn the
resources of the novelistic whale to contemporary use, but their
hunts are flawed in different ways. Ms. Anderson is clearly humbled
by the brilliance and peculiarity of ``Moby-Dick,'' and one can see
why Ahab's quest resonates: In her best performance art she has
stripped away society's pasteboard masks, elegantly revealing the
oddities and delusions of modern culture. But her style of wry
commentary is best not at building myths, but at dismantling them.
For example, she turns Melville's astonishing tale of a harpooner
trapped in the sinking skull of a dead whale into a slight
anecdote, finishing with a playful suggestion that the novel is
``really about head size.''
</P>
<P>
   Melville was much more suggestive on his own, both tearing down
and building up, swerving between comic invocations of midwifery in
the rescue of the trapped seaman and solemn descriptions of the
skull's ``sanctum sanctorum'' within which the harpoonist
struggled.
</P>
<P>
   So Ms. Anderson, often despite herself, undercuts the mythic
novel she honors. But Ms. Naslund is intentional in her
dismantling. She rejects the very premises of Melville's universe.
Biblical beliefs are replaced by a good-natured agnosticism.
Metaphysical broodings are supplanted by sentimental musings. Grim
eroticism is turned into maudlin romance (``And here I let out a
little shriek followed unexpectedly by a flotilla of boohoos. `I'm
so happy,' I sobbed, `with Captain Ahab'''). Ahab's wife is an
abolitionist, a perky pacifist, a protofeminist and a sprightly
iconoclast who proudly sings praises of her own ``goat-nimble
mind.'' There is evil in her world _ cannibalism, suicide,
childhood deaths _ but it hardly registers against the sunny
determination to celebrate tolerance and healing.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, in contrast, Melville's tragic universe. No event or
word or action is arbitrary. Everything refers to something else.
Every decision carries with it the burden of consequence. Behind
every mask are hidden truths. His is a dark and precariously
balanced world; there is no escaping its burdens.
</P>
<P>
   And now, it is no more. We have overturned it, magnifying
Melville's sense of irony and diminishing his sense of myth. The
piquant high-tech skepticism of Ms. Anderson often promises that if
only we could see how much we are being manipulated or how much we
distort what we see, we would be able to lighten the world's
burdens.
</P>
<P>
   And the pop-politics of Ms. Naslund promise that if attitudes
were remade or masks changed, this whole Ahab thing might just go
away. Then, perhaps, we could stop all this pushing and crowding
and jamming. Call me Ishmael, but I doubt it.

CAROLE KING, HIGH PRIESTESS OF MELODY, IS HONORED BY HER PEERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANN POWERS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``There's only one universal currency in this
business, and that is melody,'' writes Lewis Shiner in ``Say
Goodbye,'' his new novel about the rock 'n' roll game. ``It's the
great unsolved mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   Carole King, honored Thursday night at the Theater at Madison
Square Garden at a concert that also served as the 25th-anniversary
celebration for People magazine, is that mystery's high priestess.
The hits she wrote with her ex-husband, Gerry Goffin, and others
have fed the legends of soul singers, girl groups, rock stars and,
most impressively, herself.
</P>
<P>
   When her old friend Reba McEntire took the stage, she recalled
how strange it had been to meet someone whose album cover was so
familiar. She was referring to the pensive portrait adorning
``Tapestry,'' the 1971 solo album that made Ms. King one of the
best-selling artists of all time.
</P>
<P>
   At 57, Ms. King still resembles that earthy hippie queen, albeit
in a blessedly wealthy incarnation. She claimed the stage with
friendly enthusiasm for the night's second half. Her voice revealed
raw spots, but remained warm and welcoming, ideal for songs with
which generations have grown up singing along.
</P>
<P>
   Representing those myriad fans was a firmly mainstream celebrity
cast. Mavis Staples offered a playful version of ``One Fine Day.''
Luther Vandross flirted expertly through ``Hey Girl.'' Chrissie
Hynde reminded the audience that this was rock 'n' roll with a
rousing ``Don't Bring Me Down.''
</P>
<P>
   Trisha Yearwood, Rickie Lee Jones, the groups 98 Degrees and
Boyz II Men and Brian McKnight, whose gospel croon on ``Way Over
Yonder'' was enhanced by a small choir, all performed loving takes
on King songs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. King's daughter Sherry Goffin Kondor also performed, and her
son-in-law, the pianist Robbie Kondor, played in the band. The
ensemble, replete with strings and horns, was conducted by Ms.
King's old friend Paul Shaffer. The jazz musicians Ronnie Laws, Don
Byron, Wallace Roney and John Pizzarelli joined Ms. King for a
rollicking version of ``Jazzman.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. King took time to thank the lyricists who gave her melodies
context and the musicians who lent them human dimension. More of
those original stylists would have enhanced the evening. One did
make a surprise appearance.
</P>
<P>
   James Taylor rushed on stage as Ms. King sang ``You've Got a
Friend'' with Babyface, a reigning superstar of pop songwriting.
Taylor and Babyface traded cool vocal lines as the song ended.
Their mellow intergenerational exchange proved that melodies like
Ms. King's are indeed beyond fashion, lodged in some proverbial
corner of the soul.

 &HT;    Ava Muhammad ushers in a new day for controversial muslim group
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since Malcolm X thrust the Nation of Islam into the
national spotlight in the 1960s, many people have viewed the group
as a collection of scowling men in bow ties who condemn whites as
``blue-eyed devils.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people know, though, that the Nation is undergoing a
profound transformation _ centered in Atlanta _ that promises to
drastically change its image.
</P>
<P>
   Minister Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam's leader, recently
appointed Sister Minister Ava Muhammad to lead the group's Southern
region. Farrakhan's appointment not only defied 1,400 years of
Muslim custom _ traditional Muslims do not allow women to lead men
in a mosque _ but it offered graphic evidence that the Nation is
moving away from its pit bull approach to race and religion.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad, a regal woman and an attorney, smiles more than she
scowls. She's formed alliances with black clergy. She insists that
she's still a Christian. And she declares that God welcomes people
of all colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all one,'' Muhammad, 48, says. ``It is the ego in us
that assigns labels and names and creates divisions. We can never
say that because you're Jewish, because you're Christian, because
you're Muslim, you're not going to heaven and you're not right.''
</P>
<P>
   At 7 tonight, the public can hear Muhammad when she delivers a
keynote address at the Berean Seventh-day Adventist Church on
Hamilton Holmes Drive. The address will commemorate the fourth
anniversary of the Nation-sponsored Million Man March on
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad is expected to discuss the Nation's ambitious plans:
The group will hold a Million Family March on the nation's capital
next October that's open to all races. And it is organizing a mass
pilgrimage to Mecca for the following year.
</P>
<P>
   The Nation's recent moves _ appointing a woman leader, calling
for a massive interracial march_ are all part of the group's
attempt to redefine itself, observers say.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Lee, author of ``The Nation of Islam'' (Syracuse
University Press, $17.95, 144 pages), says the Nation is modifying
its rhetoric because it no longer wants to be viewed as a fringe
religious movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems only natural that when a group wants to have a more
general political influence, the more extremist part of their
doctrine gets reinterpreted or discarded,'' Lee says. ``If you are
part of the mainstream, you get more people.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of that change was obvious when Muhammad spoke at an
Atlanta church one recent Sunday. She preached at the Imani Temple
on the Atlanta University campus. Ringed by impassive Fruit of
Islam bodyguards, she delivered a sermon that mixed apocalyptic
biblical passages with urges for community service.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two kinds of people _ it's not racial,'' Muhammad
told the group of about 200. ``There are those who do God's will
and those who don't. That's all he cares about.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad says her appointment has inspired both Muslim and
Christian women. Women battle sexism in the pulpit and the mosque,
she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (sexism) is so deep-seated in religion, not only in Islam
but in Christianity,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In the Nation of Islam, Ava Muhammad's appointment was greeted
as a pleasant surprise, says Wendell Muhammad, a Nation member.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minister Farrakhan has always taught us not to follow biology
but to follow wisdom, no matter what vessel it comes through,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Nation also accepted Ava Muhammad so readily because she was
already well-known for her legal work with Farrakhan, Wendell
Muhammad said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Ava Muhammad went to federal court and successfully
prevented the federal government from arresting Farrakhan for
traveling to Libya after President Reagan had issued an executive
order banning American travel to the country. And in 1994, Muhammad
successfully sued the New York Post for defamation of Farrakhan's
character.
</P>
<P>
   Ava Muhammad exudes a sharp intelligence combined with a
maternal warmth. Friends say she loves Motown music, books, and
trivia about the Negro baseball leagues. She is also a compulsive
moviegoer (her two recent favorites are ``The Matrix'' and
``Runaway Bride'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time I talk to her, I learn something new,'' Wendell
Muhammad says.
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan handpicked Ava Muhammad at a Chicago meeting of Nation
leaders last July. Muhammad said she was shocked when he turned to
her during a dinner meeting and asked her if she would accept the
position. The room fell silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually had someone else in mind,'' Muhammad says, but he
changed his mind on the spot. ``He said he knew in an instant that
I was the one. He stated that it was an act of inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan's inspiration is viewed with skepticism by some
observers. Imam Plemon El-Amin of the Atlanta Masjid of Al-Islam
says Islam does not allow a woman to be an imam, a position
reserved for mosque prayer leaders. ``In Islam, women can be
leaders, but the position of imam is established for men,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   In defiance of that tradition, as part of her new position,
Muhammad has authority over all of the Nation's mosques in the
Southern region.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic world has not traditionally accepted the Nation of
Islam, says Lee, whose book examined the Nation's mysterious
beginnings. Much of the Islamic community's opposition centers on
the Nation's doctrines.
</P>
<P>
   Lee traced the beginning of the Nation to Detroit in the 1930s,
when Wallace Fard _ a man who the Nation acknowledges was part
white _ first appeared. Fard, who sold silk door-to-door in the
black community, declared that he had come from Mecca to tell
blacks that they were actually lost members of an ancient tribe
called Shabazz.
</P>
<P>
   Fard's message attracted Elijah Poole, the poor son of a country
preacher. Poole, who saw Fard as God incarnate, joined Fard's
movement and adopted the name Elijah Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   After Fard mysteriously disappeared, Muhammad became the group's
leader. He refined Fard's message and, blending the Bible and the
Koran, preached a doctrine that mixes Islam, Christianity and, some
say, racial hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Under Elijah Muhammad, the Nation disdained getting involved in
American political life. He was imprisoned during World War II for
telling Nation members that they should not join the military. The
Nation also refused to get involved in the traditional civil rights
movement, often scoffing at leaders such as the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad also claimed that he was a prophet and that Fard was a
divine embodiment of Allah. But traditional Islam says that only
God is divine and the 7th century prophet Mohammed _ not Elijah
Muhammad _ was his last messenger, Lee says.
</P>
<P>
   The Nation split over questions of doctrine in 1975 when W. Deen
Mohammed, Elijah Muhammad's son, changed the group's name to the
American Muslim Society and asked members to follow traditional
Islam. Farrakhan, ignoring Mohammed, revived the Nation of Islam
name and preserved the teachings of Elijah Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin, who was once a member of the Nation, said more Nation
members are leaving the group because its doctrine does not conform
to traditional Islam. Late in his life, Malcolm X _perhaps the
Nation's most well-known symbol _ disavowed the group, partially
over questions of doctrine, and embraced traditional Islam.
</P>
<P>
   People who leave the Nation, El-Amin says, ``begin to study a
littler deeper and they realize that Islam is much bigger than the
small idea that God is black.''
</P>
<P>
   A symbollic message?
</P>
<P>
   Ava Muhammad, however, defends the Nation's Islamic credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a presumption, which is 100 percent wrong, that the
teachings of Elijah Muhammad are not in accord with mainstream
Islam,'' she said. ``Nothing can be further from the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Nation members insist that some of Elijah Muhammad's
teachings are simply symbolic, not to be taken literally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in many respects more in harmony with the requirements
of the holy Koran than many Muslim societies where people drink
alcohol, smoke cigarettes and women dress immodestly,'' Ava
Muhammad says.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad's background may help her handle the criticisms
directed at the Nation. She was raised to be a leader, she says. A
native of Columbus, Ohio, she grew up in a middle-class home where
her parents were teachers. Her early heroes were people like King
and Stokely Carmichael (later known as Kwame Ture).
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Georgetown University law school in 1975,
Muhammad eventually became a criminal defense attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Her turning point came at age 28, when she was diagnosed with
cancer. For comfort, Muhammad says, she returned to the Methodist
church where she was raised, but it didn't help her overcome her
fear of death. On a lark, she decided to go hear Farrakhan speak in
New York City. She had long admired the Nation's insistence on
black self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard him talk about Allah, it penetrated my very
being,'' recalls Muhammad, who says her cancer disappeared after
hearing Farrakhan speak. ``I knew that this was what I was born to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad envisions her current role as a bridge-builder among
women and people of different faiths. She is close friends with
Essence magazine editor Susan Taylor and with Iyanla Vanzant, the
best-selling self-help author. Muhammad's husband, Brother Darius,
is usually at her side during her public lectures.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad says she wants to refute the idea that the Nation is
filled with the ``lunatic fringe'' of society.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like being viewed as haters of people,'' Muhammad
says. ``It hurts. We're like everybody else. We like to go and see
films. We like to listen to music. We like to go on vacation. It's
difficult when you walk through places and some people look at you
_ sometimes your own people _ with hostility because of what
someone said to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Haney, a professor of religion at the Interdenominational
Theological Center, an Atlanta seminary, says that while the public
is fascinated by the Nation's stormy past, Muhammad represents its
best hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very smart woman and she plays her role very well,''
Haney says. ``She's articulate on any spiritual issue. The Nation
realizes that, in order for it to survive, it has to change its
theology.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad says, however, that the Nation's theology is simply
evolving.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an evolution in the message,'' she says. ``But
it is not changing and going into a different direction. It is
moving toward that which the Creator intended it to be.''

WOULD PAVAROTTI SING CAVARADOSSI? YES. 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The popular Franco Zeffirelli production of Puccini's
``Tosca'' returned to the Metropolitan Opera on Thursday night, but
the buzz in the house centered on one question only: could Luciano
Pavarotti, just two days after his 64th birthday, still sing the
role of Cavaradossi?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is a qualified yes, though his performance has to be
taken in context.
</P>
<P>
   First is the matter of Pavarotti's health. Last year he
underwent major knee and hip surgery correcting long-standing
problems that had severely limited his mobility and stamina.
</P>
<P>
   He recovered sufficiently to sing the gala performance in late
November commemorating his 30th season with the Met, but just
barely. His voice still had its distinctive color and beauty, but
lacked power. Then he returned in the spring for some quite
satisfying performances as Cavaradossi.
</P>
<P>
   By now this would appear to be one of the few roles he can still
handle. Though he had to husband his vocal resources strategically
to get through it, Pavarotti did some impressive singing. There was
not much in the way of character depiction, however.
</P>
<P>
   When Cavaradossi, after being brutally tortured by Scarpia's
henchmen, overhears the news of Napoleon's victory at the Battle of
Marengo, he is supposed to leap to his feet and sing triumphant
cries of ``Vittoria! Vittoria!''
</P>
<P>
   Pavarotti, hardly spontaneous, walked slowly to the rim of the
stage, planted his feet firmly in place, faced the audience,
composed himself, wet his lips and started to sing. But his
full-voiced, ringing high notes _ first F-sharp, then A-sharp _
were thrillingly unleashed.
</P>
<P>
   Having delivered, he had scant voice left for the rest of
Cavaradossi's outburst. In general, Pavarotti sounded patchy and
weak in his lower range. Still, there was that Pavarotti sound and
we are going to miss it when he is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Even with his shortcomings, Pavarotti gave the most complete
performance of the evening. Dramatically, the soprano Elizabeth
Holleque was an alluring and ardent Tosca. But her voice was sadly
tested by this role. Her high notes were short-breathed, harsh and
shouted. There was little legato in her phrasing.
</P>
<P>
   As Scarpia, the baritone Juan Pons had ample power, but it came
at a price: constant huffing and puffing behind nearly every note.
Daniel Oren conducted a fleetly paced and vigorous performance,
though sometimes the ensemble was inexact and the orchestral sound
overly thick.
</P>
<P>
   So will Pavarotti return next season for yet another try at
Cavaradossi? If so, there will surely be loyal fans eager to cheer
him on.
</P>
<P>
   He sings four more performances this month through Oct. 30. &QL;

NINERS QB'S FUTURE FUZZY AFTER CONCUSSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATTHEW YI AND DWIGHT CHAPIN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While Steve Young's future with the San
Francisco 49ers is uncertain, the likelihood that he will suffer
another concussion if he returns to the game is not. And the
cumulative effect of multiple concussions can be deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Although much about concussions remains a mystery and people
recover differently, neurosurgeons agree that it is not a good idea
for a person who has suffered one to be in a situation where
physical trauma is part of the routine. Young has had four
concussions in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Repetitive concussions cause cumulative brain injury, and
cumulative brain injury causes problems in the future for you and
your family,'' said Dr. Jay Rosenberg, neurosurgeon at Kaiser
Permanente in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg, co-author of the guidelines on concussions for the
American Academy of Neurology, said he could not determine Young's
condition without examining him, but it is no secret that multiple
concussions take a toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have repetitive concussions ... basically you're
losing your brain cells,'' he said. ``The issue is, how many brain
cells do you have to lose before you decide to quit?''
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old 49ers quarterback has been sitting on the bench
since he was knocked out in a game against Arizona on Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Young's doctor said Thursday that although tests show no
bruising of Young's brain, it still needs time to recover and he
will not play Sunday against the Carolina Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary Steinberg, chairman of the Department of Neurosurgery
at Stanford University Medical Center, said he made a medical
recommendation to Young regarding the concussion, but did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to figure out how many concussions a person may have
before suffering permanent damage is difficult, said Dr. Martin
Holland, a neurosurgeon at the University of California at San
Francisco who practices at San Francisco General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a million-dollar question,'' he said. ``Does one
concussion lead to permanent injury? Some do, and some don't. What
about multiple concussions? We don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult for doctors to advise injured athletes on
whether they should retire or continue playing, especially when the
concussions seem mild, Holland said. The final judgment usually
lies with the athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Young is a very intelligent man. He's a big boy. He's
responsible for his health and safety,'' Holland said. ``The only
thing that his physician can do is to let him know what the risks
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland said that, based on several studies, one thing that Is
clear is that people who have suffered concussions in the past are
more likely to have them again in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no answer why that may be true, one theory is
that aggressive players are likely to have concussions and will
suffer more in the future, unless they change their ways, Holland
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another reason may be that the first concussion has slightly
impaired the athlete and he's prone to get hurt again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a normally functioning brain, the cells constantly fire
neurotransmitters in a coordinated manner. A big enough blow to the
head could cause a massive release of neurotransmitters at one
time, causing the person to lose consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have loss of brain cells, which may lead to other
things like loss of memory, problems concentrating or handling
complex problems,'' Holland said.
</P>
<P>
   A severe blow can bruise the brain, leading to internal bleeding
and possible blood clots, which can be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Although full recovery is possible from mild concussions,
Holland and Rosenberg said they think there are residual effects
each time an athlete gets knocked out.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Concussions aren't a new problem for athletes. National Football
League players Merril Hoge, Al Toon and Chris Miller all were
forced to retire because of head injuries, although Miller returned
this season as a backup quarterback with the Denver Broncos, after
being away from the game for three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Hoge, who is now an ESPN radio sportscaster, left the Chicago
Bears in 1994 after suffering two concussions within six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Often players are almost fatalistic about the risks they face
when _ to use a long-popular football phrase _ they ``get their
bells rung.''
</P>
<P>
   Before returning to the NFL, Miller, who has yet to play in a
regular-season game this season, consulted a series of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Sure, you have a risk,''' he said. `You might have
a 4 to 6 percent chance of sustaining another concussion compared
to the normal player who hasn't had problems.' But I could get hit
by a golf ball walking down the fairway or get in a car wreck or
whatever.''

`MYTHOS': A DANISH THEATER COMPANY ESCAPES NARRATIVE THROUGH
RHYTHM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Denmark, Poland, Italy)  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rhythm is the soul of Odin Teatret's sumptuous
``Mythos''; music is a frayed thread barely holding the limbs of
the actors together as the rhythm threatens to shake them to
pieces, and language is a murmur of anger and wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``All dies, all is born again'' are among the few intelligible
words in this stunning performance, and they suffice. Eugenio
Barba, the Italian founder and director of Odin Teatret, Denmark's
most celebrated theater company, has sought for 30 years to escape
from narrative and its nagging companions, calendars and clocks. In
this work _ the centerpiece of a program of seven Danish plays at
La Mama through the end of the month _ the escape is complete.
</P>
<P>
   So perfect, in fact, that the performance can hardly be said to
have an audience, only individual viewers or participants. Some
look puzzled, restless; occasionally one will laugh, startling
others. A young woman sitting next to me on opening night got it
right: after a while one of her feet was unconsciously tapping;
rhythm is understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Barba carries the group theater idea further than his teacher,
Jerzy Grotowski, did in Poland or the Living Theater did here. He
presents a notion for a play and lets each actor develop a role,
drawing on song, verse, dance, chants, acrobatics, whatever; only
at the end does he try to draw a common progress (nothing so
definite as a plot) from the cast's sounds and movements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mythos'' rests on an image of Guilhermino Barbosa, one of
thousands of Brazilian soldiers who from 1925 to 1927 marched
15,500 miles through their country protesting government
corruption. Barbosa later barricaded himself in a jungle shack,
remaining until his death faithful to his revolution. Myths that
control civilizations also die, Barba says, and in ``Mythos'' Greek
mythical figures, who might themselves have just emerged from
graves, struggle with the question of whether Barbosa and his ideal
or we and our myths can be reborn.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers sit on two sides of an oblong stage paved with loose
black stones that are raked into labyrinths, oceans, graveyards or
gardens by the tireless stone-pusher Sisyphus and some others.
Orpheus, the great seeker, little more than an animal skull above
an empty cloak, drives fellow heroes into action. Cassandra, all
fire and seduction, finds giddy freedom in her incredibility, and
Medea's murdered children become countless legions in their
mother's laments. Fear alone impels Daedalus to fly lest he fall;
Oedipus survives, indeed thrives, on scorn for anyone with hope;
and that primal shape-shifter, Odysseus, is so enthralled with
human folly he never notices his own.
</P>
<P>
   Amid these gods Barbosa's endless march gives tragedy itself a
distinct gait until, in a surprisingly poignant moment, Orpheus
stabs the soldier right through his accordion and he is reborn in
an unforgettable vision of the accordion playing itself somewhere
above the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Some vocal effects produced in songs and chants are wildly
beautiful or terrifying, and one cannot quite imagine how they are
made. The words are by the Danish poet Henrik Nordbrandt. La Mama
announces that all plays but one in Odin Teatret's presentations
here are in English. Not quite. Most of the lines in ``Mythos'' are
not translated, but they don't really have to be; in ways it is
hard to put a finger on, the actors make the meaning transparent.
</P>
<P>
   One bit of translation not available might have helped: in
several talks Barba has mentioned the ancient practice of military
victors' cutting one hand off each prisoner no matter how many they
captured. People seeing ``Mythos'' should know that, since hundreds
of carved wooden hands have lives of their own in the play.
</P>
<P>
   Odin Teatret, which has a large following in Europe and Latin
America, has been seen here only once before, also at La Mama, 15
years ago. Since the very idea of group theater seems to have died
out in this country, experiencing the almost religious intensity of
``Mythos'' leaves one feeling that this surprisingly effective
meditation on death and resurrection is a fitting emblem for the
company.

`VICK'S BOY': SHALLOW BUT FUNNY MAYHEM

   NEW YORK _ Facts about Ben Bettenbender's play ``Vick's Boy'':
Its premise is as silly as its lines, many of them cliches of
television sitcoms; it is plotless, and if its jokes and occasional
slapstick are not as old as Aristophanes, any ancient Roman would
know them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet thanks to a smart, energetic cast and direction, by Bob
Balaban, that could make most video combat games look slower than
shuffleboard, the Rattlestick Productions version of ``Vick's Boy''
at Theater Off Park keeps an audience laughing for two hours.
</P>
<P>
   A Manhattan law firm is dominated by a real termagant called
Molly (Johanna Day), whose name has become a verb meaning to get
axed. An office manager, Vick (Rob Sedgwick), plots to get her into
bed and have their sex videotaped so he can blackmail her into
guaranteeing him a cushy lifetime job with no duties. He traps a
nervous clerk, Lester (Andrew Polk), into handling the camera.
Invading their scheme and vastly complicating it is Keith (Jim
Bracchitta), the office's cowardly sponge.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out Molly is a bit of a prude, and Lester, manning the
camera while hiding in a closet and under a bed, is, of course,
wildly claustrophobic. So the tape is a hilarious piece of
confusion. But Molly doesn't know that. She quits the firm and
retreats to a sleepy South Jersey town where a repentant Lester
finds her and gives her a totally improbable kind of consolation.
</P>
<P>
   The cast approaches all this nonsense like cutups at a party and
the atmosphere seems to take hold of the audience immediately.
Bracchitta and Polk, who run the Cape Cod Theater Project in
Massachusetts, are a fine pair of old-fashioned comics; when they
are together you know anyone who is rational will fall victim to
them _ as Sedgwick's and Ms. Day's characters do with exasperated
astonishment.
</P>
<P>
   It's shallow, but there are enough moments that are like Laurel
and Hardy without the mayhem to keep the laughter rolling.

 &HT;    America's art story, Part II, a little hazy
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 17.
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``The American Century'' at the Whitney Museum of Art
is a 100-year retrospective of art and its relationship to culture.
Part one, which examined the first half of the century, was an
absorbing interplay of the fine, decorative and popular arts that
told America's story. Ironically, as American art comes into its
own in the second half of the century, the exhibition itself loses
steam.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is inherent in modern and contemporary art. For one
thing, it's more difficult to make connections between the
historical narrative and abstract or even contemporary figurative
art, especially in the visual language of an exhibit. For another,
there may be little connection to make: Most of the art of the
second half of the century evolves in response to the art that
precedes it, not the Cold War or the hippie movement. In other
words, Andy Warhol influenced the course of art history more than
John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of being woven together, the strands of culture and
history seem to barely intersect. If part one of this exhibit was a
tapestry, part two is more like a map of Atlanta's highway system.
Even the visual art and other arts in the ``cultural sites'' _
displays of books, video and television clips, music, etc. _ no
longer seem like partners.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, part two becomes an art survey rather than a
cross-cultural exploration _ and a superficial, predictable one at
that. It even takes the traditional art historical approach of
excluding art forms considered minor, such as ceramics, industrial
design and outsider art.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are many occasions when art links up with life. You
could point to pop art and its relationship to consumer culture.
The broadening of the mainstream art world to include feminist and
ethnic artists in the '70s and '80s reflected (or in some cases,
preceded) stronger voices of women and minorities in society.
Artists who came to prominence during the '80s, like Cindy Sherman
and Barbara Kruger, took aim at our media culture. And photography,
which is put to many uses during the last few decades, never
abandons its documentary role, as affirmed by the series of images
that convey the events and emotions of the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   But, in large measure, art establishes its own context and its
own concerns. One sub-theme is art's ever-expanding formal
boundaries. Eva Hesse and Lucas Samaras are among those who use
everyday materials in unusual ways. For Robert Smithson _
represented by photos and a video of his great earthwork, ``Spiral
Jetty''_ Earth and sky, tides and erosion become his palette and
vocabulary. Video in many forms becomes a popular medium.
</P>
<P>
   Another sub-theme is the artist's position as outsider. This
stance _ or is it a natural inclination? _ liberates the artist to
criticize the center as well as to explore, and occupy, territory
at the edges. Nan Goldin's ``Ballad of Sexual Dependency,'' an
unflinching audiovisual presentation of dysfunctional lives of her
East Village friends, is one of the show's most moving pieces.
</P>
<P>
   But this path has led artists outside conventional morality, and
the chasm this creates between the art world and the rest of the
world is not without consequences. Indeed, as a time line on the
culture wars adjacent to Andres Serrano's ``Piss Christ'' reminds
us, the differing world views can be explosive and deleterious. It
can even divide the art community: The sexual antics and violence
in former Atlantan Kara Walker's ``Gone With the Wind''-era
silhouettes, one of which is included here, outraged fellow
African-American artists as well as members of the lay audience.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the achievements of so many artists and incendiary
quality of the most current art, the ``American Century'' is
missing a spark. Maybe it's because the first half of the century,
during which America experienced the Depression and two world wars,
was more eventful. Possibly it's because the seismic social shifts
of the second half are more difficult to convey. And certainly, the
aesthetic revolutions of the art world pale in comparison to both.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as the current controversy about the dung-adorned image of
the Madonna at the Brooklyn Museum of Art confirms, visual art is
still very potent as a set of symbols. Maybe the act of squeezing
the chaos of modern and contemporary art into a linear narrative
squeezed out the excitement.

 &HT;    Ava Muhammad ushers in a new day for controversial muslim group
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since Malcolm X thrust the Nation of Islam into the
national spotlight in the 1960s, many people have viewed the group
as a collection of scowling men in bow ties who condemn whites as
``blue-eyed devils.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people know, though, that the Nation is undergoing a
profound transformation _ centered in Atlanta _ that promises to
drastically change its image.
</P>
<P>
   Minister Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam's leader, recently
appointed Sister Minister Ava Muhammad to lead the group's Southern
region. Farrakhan's appointment not only defied 1,400 years of
Muslim custom _ traditional Muslims do not allow women to lead men
in a mosque _ but it offered graphic evidence that the Nation is
moving away from its pit bull approach to race and religion.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad, a regal woman and an attorney, smiles more than she
scowls. She's formed alliances with black clergy. She insists that
she's still a Christian. And she declares that God welcomes people
of all colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all one,'' Muhammad, 48, says. ``It is the ego in us
that assigns labels and names and creates divisions. We can never
say that because you're Jewish, because you're Christian, because
you're Muslim, you're not going to heaven and you're not right.''
</P>
<P>
   At 7 tonight, the public can hear Muhammad when she delivers a
keynote address at the Berean Seventh-day Adventist Church on
Hamilton Holmes Drive. The address will commemorate the fourth
anniversary of the Nation-sponsored Million Man March on
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad is expected to discuss the Nation's ambitious plans:
The group will hold a Million Family March on the nation's capital
next October that's open to all races. And it is organizing a mass
pilgrimage to Mecca for the following year.
</P>
<P>
   The Nation's recent moves _ appointing a woman leader, calling
for a massive interracial march_ are all part of the group's
attempt to redefine itself, observers say.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Lee, author of ``The Nation of Islam'' (Syracuse
University Press, $17.95, 144 pages), says the Nation is modifying
its rhetoric because it no longer wants to be viewed as a fringe
religious movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems only natural that when a group wants to have a more
general political influence, the more extremist part of their
doctrine gets reinterpreted or discarded,'' Lee says. ``If you are
part of the mainstream, you get more people.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of that change was obvious when Muhammad spoke at an
Atlanta church one recent Sunday. She preached at the Imani Temple
on the Atlanta University campus. Ringed by impassive Fruit of
Islam bodyguards, she delivered a sermon that mixed apocalyptic
biblical passages with urges for community service.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two kinds of people _ it's not racial,'' Muhammad
told the group of about 200. ``There are those who do God's will
and those who don't. That's all he cares about.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad says her appointment has inspired both Muslim and
Christian women. Women battle sexism in the pulpit and the mosque,
she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (sexism) is so deep-seated in religion, not only in Islam
but in Christianity,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In the Nation of Islam, Ava Muhammad's appointment was greeted
as a pleasant surprise, says Wendell Muhammad, a Nation member.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minister Farrakhan has always taught us not to follow biology
but to follow wisdom, no matter what vessel it comes through,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Nation also accepted Ava Muhammad so readily because she was
already well-known for her legal work with Farrakhan, Wendell
Muhammad said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Ava Muhammad went to federal court and successfully
prevented the federal government from arresting Farrakhan for
traveling to Libya after President Reagan had issued an executive
order banning American travel to the country. And in 1994, Muhammad
successfully sued the New York Post for defamation of Farrakhan's
character.
</P>
<P>
   Ava Muhammad exudes a sharp intelligence combined with a
maternal warmth. Friends say she loves Motown music, books, and
trivia about the Negro baseball leagues. She is also a compulsive
moviegoer (her two recent favorites are ``The Matrix'' and
``Runaway Bride'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time I talk to her, I learn something new,'' Wendell
Muhammad says.
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan handpicked Ava Muhammad at a Chicago meeting of Nation
leaders last July. Muhammad said she was shocked when he turned to
her during a dinner meeting and asked her if she would accept the
position. The room fell silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually had someone else in mind,'' Muhammad says, but he
changed his mind on the spot. ``He said he knew in an instant that
I was the one. He stated that it was an act of inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan's inspiration is viewed with skepticism by some
observers. Imam Plemon El-Amin of the Atlanta Masjid of Al-Islam
says Islam does not allow a woman to be an imam, a position
reserved for mosque prayer leaders. ``In Islam, women can be
leaders, but the position of imam is established for men,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   In defiance of that tradition, as part of her new position,
Muhammad has authority over all of the Nation's mosques in the
Southern region.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic world has not traditionally accepted the Nation of
Islam, says Lee, whose book examined the Nation's mysterious
beginnings. Much of the Islamic community's opposition centers on
the Nation's doctrines.
</P>
<P>
   Lee traced the beginning of the Nation to Detroit in the 1930s,
when Wallace Fard _ a man who the Nation acknowledges was part
white _ first appeared. Fard, who sold silk door-to-door in the
black community, declared that he had come from Mecca to tell
blacks that they were actually lost members of an ancient tribe
called Shabazz.
</P>
<P>
   Fard's message attracted Elijah Poole, the poor son of a country
preacher. Poole, who saw Fard as God incarnate, joined Fard's
movement and adopted the name Elijah Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   After Fard mysteriously disappeared, Muhammad became the group's
leader. He refined Fard's message and, blending the Bible and the
Koran, preached a doctrine that mixes Islam, Christianity and, some
say, racial hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Under Elijah Muhammad, the Nation disdained getting involved in
American political life. He was imprisoned during World War II for
telling Nation members that they should not join the military. The
Nation also refused to get involved in the traditional civil rights
movement, often scoffing at leaders such as the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad also claimed that he was a prophet and that Fard was a
divine embodiment of Allah. But traditional Islam says that only
God is divine and the 7th century prophet Mohammed _ not Elijah
Muhammad _ was his last messenger, Lee says.
</P>
<P>
   The Nation split over questions of doctrine in 1975 when W. Deen
Mohammed, Elijah Muhammad's son, changed the group's name to the
American Muslim Society and asked members to follow traditional
Islam. Farrakhan, ignoring Mohammed, revived the Nation of Islam
name and preserved the teachings of Elijah Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin, who was once a member of the Nation, said more Nation
members are leaving the group because its doctrine does not conform
to traditional Islam. Late in his life, Malcolm X _perhaps the
Nation's most well-known symbol _ disavowed the group, partially
over questions of doctrine, and embraced traditional Islam.
</P>
<P>
   People who leave the Nation, El-Amin says, ``begin to study a
littler deeper and they realize that Islam is much bigger than the
small idea that God is black.''
</P>
<P>
   A symbollic message?
</P>
<P>
   Ava Muhammad, however, defends the Nation's Islamic credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a presumption, which is 100 percent wrong, that the
teachings of Elijah Muhammad are not in accord with mainstream
Islam,'' she said. ``Nothing can be further from the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Nation members insist that some of Elijah Muhammad's
teachings are simply symbolic, not to be taken literally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in many respects more in harmony with the requirements
of the holy Koran than many Muslim societies where people drink
alcohol, smoke cigarettes and women dress immodestly,'' Ava
Muhammad says.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad's background may help her handle the criticisms
directed at the Nation. She was raised to be a leader, she says. A
native of Columbus, Ohio, she grew up in a middle-class home where
her parents were teachers. Her early heroes were people like King
and Stokely Carmichael (later known as Kwame Ture).
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Georgetown University law school in 1975,
Muhammad eventually became a criminal defense attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Her turning point came at age 28, when she was diagnosed with
cancer. For comfort, Muhammad says, she returned to the Methodist
church where she was raised, but it didn't help her overcome her
fear of death. On a lark, she decided to go hear Farrakhan speak in
New York City. She had long admired the Nation's insistence on
black self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard him talk about Allah, it penetrated my very
being,'' recalls Muhammad, who says her cancer disappeared after
hearing Farrakhan speak. ``I knew that this was what I was born to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad envisions her current role as a bridge-builder among
women and people of different faiths. She is close friends with
Essence magazine editor Susan Taylor and with Iyanla Vanzant, the
best-selling self-help author. Muhammad's husband, Brother Darius,
is usually at her side during her public lectures.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad says she wants to refute the idea that the Nation is
filled with the ``lunatic fringe'' of society.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like being viewed as haters of people,'' Muhammad
says. ``It hurts. We're like everybody else. We like to go and see
films. We like to listen to music. We like to go on vacation. It's
difficult when you walk through places and some people look at you
_ sometimes your own people _ with hostility because of what
someone said to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Haney, a professor of religion at the Interdenominational
Theological Center, an Atlanta seminary, says that while the public
is fascinated by the Nation's stormy past, Muhammad represents its
best hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very smart woman and she plays her role very well,''
Haney says. ``She's articulate on any spiritual issue. The Nation
realizes that, in order for it to survive, it has to change its
theology.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad says, however, that the Nation's theology is simply
evolving.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an evolution in the message,'' she says. ``But
it is not changing and going into a different direction. It is
moving toward that which the Creator intended it to be.''

   Campaign politics and increasingly sour relations between the
White House and the Republican-controlled Congress have dimmed the
prospects for a host of initiatives President Clinton had once
hoped to enact. Fifteen months before he leaves office, the
following Clinton proposals are at risk:
</P>
<P>
   - Social Security reform. The centerpiece of his 1998 State of
the Union address, Clinton called for a year-long bipartisan
conversation on how to adjust premiums, benefits or both to put the
giant federal retirement insurance program on sound financial
footing. The conversation took place, but Clinton and the
Republicans have not joined to hash out a plan for shoring up the
system, which is set to begin hemorhaging red ink sometime around
the year 2013.
</P>
<P>
   - Medicare reform. Another State of the Union promise was to
overhaul the massive federal health insurance program and to add a
prescription drug benefits package to it. Neither is moving
forward.
</P>
<P>
   - Tobacco tax increases. Clinton has proposed raising federal
cigarette taxes by 55 cents a pack _ a measure that would raise an
estimated $8 billion a year in revenues _ and use the money to
finance spending increases in areas such as education and law
enforcement. He's also proposed forcing polluting companies to pay
a larger share of the cost of environmental cleanup. Republicans
oppose measures, but the White House remains hopeful for some
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   - Hiring new teachers. Clinton pressed through a plan last year
to hire an additional 29,000 new teachers in an effort to reduce
class size in elementary schools. He wants to triple that number,
but even the current hires are under threat amid the ongoing 2000
budget battle. Republicans want to give the money to local school
boards and let them decide what to do with it. Clinton has
threatened a veto when the spending bill arrives on his desk as
early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   - World Trade Organization. Clinton will lead a summit in
Seattle at the end of November to kick off the ninth round of
global trade talks since 1947. His hand in the talks is weakened,
though, by his inability to win so-called ``fast track''
negotiating authority from Congress and by the global perception of
his standing as a result of the failure last week of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Clinton's biggest problem on trade,
though, comes from within his own party. It's Democrats, in the
main, who oppose ``fast track,'' and, as Vice President Al Gore
continues to woo the support of organized labor, even Clinton's
plans for negotiating China's admission into the World Trade
Organization face uphill sledding on Capitol Hill.

   Campaign politics and increasingly sour relations between the
White House and the Republican-controlled Congress have dimmed the
prospects for a host of initiatives President Clinton had once
hoped to enact. Fifteen months before he leaves office, the
following Clinton proposals are at risk:
</P>
<P>
   - Social Security reform. The centerpiece of his 1998 State of
the Union address, Clinton called for a year-long bipartisan
conversation on how to adjust premiums, benefits or both to put the
giant federal retirement insurance program on sound financial
footing. The conversation took place, but Clinton and the
Republicans have not joined to hash out a plan for shoring up the
system, which is set to begin hemorhaging red ink sometime around
the year 2013.
</P>
<P>
   - Medicare reform. Another State of the Union promise was to
overhaul the massive federal health insurance program and to add a
prescription drug benefits package to it. Neither is moving
forward.
</P>
<P>
   - Tobacco tax increases. Clinton has proposed raising federal
cigarette taxes by 55 cents a pack _ a measure that would raise an
estimated $8 billion a year in revenues _ and use the money to
finance spending increases in areas such as education and law
enforcement. He's also proposed forcing polluting companies to pay
a larger share of the cost of environmental cleanup. Republicans
oppose measures, but the White House remains hopeful for some
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   - Hiring new teachers. Clinton pressed through a plan last year

class size in elementary schools. He wants to triple that number,
but even the current hires are under threat amid the ongoing 2000

   HOMECOMING-DESEGREGATION _ COWETA COUNTY, Ga. _ Decades after

Caucasus Mountains was the Napa Valley of the Tsars. Georgian wines
were prized for their flavor and clarity. And then came the Soviet
industrial revolution. The Soviet's built mass-production plants in
the '50s with gigantic steel vats that reduced Georgian wines to
the mediocre. Now, hoping to revive their winemaking skills and
appeal to lucrative Western markets, Georgian winemakers are going
back to the future. They want to store their wines once again in
oak barrels. That's where Rubiko Batiashivili comes in. He learned
the craft as a teenager half a century ago, and now he's finally
putting the skill to work. (Holmes, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTO.

bamboo-forested mountains. But despite glowing reports of
conservation and scientific successes, wildlife experts are not at
all convinced the enchanting animals will survive to amble through
many new chapters in their 3,000-year history. Efforts are being
made to stop the encroachment of mankind that has cut up panda
territory and divided the panda population, making genetic
in-breeding a potentially deadly problem. And now the Chinese are
laying the groundwork for the precarious possibility of
reintroducing to the wild pandas born in captivity.

FIVE QUESTIONS FOR BERNARD ARNAULT  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 17)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After months of behind-the-scenes wrangling, a victor emerged
last week in the battle for Fendi SpA, the Italian luxury design
house best known for its Baguette bag, a wide Tootsie Roll-shaped
purse that fits snugly under the arm.
</P>
<P>
   The winning bid came from an unusual partnership of two bigger
luxury-goods companies, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Prada,
that have each been on an acquisition binge.
</P>
<P>
   This year alone, LVMH, which owns designer houses like Givenchy
and Celine, has gobbled up majority interests in Hard Candy and
Bliss SpA, while Prada has bought stakes in Jil Sanders and Helmut
Lang.
</P>
<P>
   LVMH and Prada did not disclose how much they were paying for 51
percent of Fendi, a privately held company, but people close to the
deal put it at about $520 million. That implies a value for Fendi
in excess of $1 billion, a stunning amount for a company whose net
income last year was estimated at $10 million to $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH and a leader in the
consolidation of luxury-goods brands, spoke about the deal last
week. Here are excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Leslie Kaufman
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you pay too much for Fendi?
</P>
<P>
   A. When I was offered Gucci five years ago, it was almost
bankrupt, and I was offered it for around the same amount, $1
billion. I made an offer at a lower price, because at the time it
was not making any money.
</P>
<P>
   So the question is, are we convinced we can do in the next five
years what has been done in the last five years with companies such
as Gucci and Prada? If we are convinced, which we are, the question
of price versus earnings does not mean anything, because five years
from now it will be a fantastique investment. If you are not
convinced of that, you should not touch it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the game plan to make Fendi grow rapidly?
</P>
<P>
   A. The problem is that they have not enough shops. They are
extremely successful, but people have to wait for the bags, because
they have not enough shops and not enough production capacity. With
our friends at Prada we will give them production in Italy, and
with Vuitton we will give them shops. This business should explode
in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Vuitton, Prada and Fendi all do a big leather accessory
business. You could be considered rivals. Won't there be conflicts
of interest?
</P>
<P>
   A. Fendi will be run by a team already in place. There is
already a very good managing director, but he was not given the
investment capacity to grow the business. We have spent a lot of
money, so we will do everything possible to make it a success.
</P>
<P>
   When you say we are rivals, I am not so sure. When we are
together, Prada, Vuitton or Dior in the mall, we do more business
than when we are isolated all over the city. It is in our common
interest to do something together.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there ways the new owners can help cut Fendi's costs?
</P>
<P>
   A. We will help them purchase raw materials or give them to them
at our price. With our ad-buying power, immediately they will save
20 percent. There are numbers of their products they can make in
Prada's factories in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   We will give them, across the world, some of the best locations
at the best price. Little Fendi alone trying to rent space in
Manhattan, it is difficult. When you arrive with Prada, Vuitton,
Dior and Givenchy asking for space, you get larger space at a lower
price.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there names of Fendi's caliber still out there to be
bought?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are not many. That is why we were so interested in
doing this deal. It is not a frequent phenomenon to have a brand
that is so hot and is still small.
</P>
<P>
   If you take Vuitton, it is hot, but big. Prada, it is hot, but
big. So from an investment standpoint it is better to get them hot
and small.

   After months of behind-the-scenes wrangling, a victor emerged
last week in the battle for Fendi SpA, the Italian luxury design
house best known for its Baguette bag, a wide Tootsie Roll-shaped
purse that fits snugly under the arm.
</P>
<P>
   The winning bid came from an unusual partnership of two bigger
luxury-goods companies, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Prada,
that have each been on an acquisition binge.
</P>
<P>
   This year alone, LVMH, which owns designer houses like Givenchy
and Celine, has gobbled up majority interests in Hard Candy and
Bliss SpA, while Prada has bought stakes in Jil Sanders and Helmut
Lang.
</P>
<P>
   LVMH and Prada did not disclose how much they were paying for 51
percent of Fendi, a privately held company, but people close to the
deal put it at about $520 million. That implies a value for Fendi
in excess of $1 billion, a stunning amount for a company whose net
income last year was estimated at $10 million to $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH and a leader in the
consolidation of luxury-goods brands, spoke about the deal last
week. Here are excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Leslie Kaufman
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you pay too much for Fendi?
</P>
<P>
   A. When I was offered Gucci five years ago, it was almost
bankrupt, and I was offered it for around the same amount, $1
billion. I made an offer at a lower price, because at the time it
was not making any money.
</P>
<P>
   So the question is, are we convinced we can do in the next five
years what has been done in the last five years with companies such
as Gucci and Prada? If we are convinced, which we are, the question
of price versus earnings does not mean anything, because five years
from now it will be a fantastique investment. If you are not
convinced of that, you should not touch it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the game plan to make Fendi grow rapidly?
</P>
<P>
   A. The problem is that they have not enough shops. They are
extremely successful, but people have to wait for the bags, because
they have not enough shops and not enough production capacity. With
our friends at Prada we will give them production in Italy, and
with Vuitton we will give them shops. This business should explode
in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Vuitton, Prada and Fendi all do a big leather accessory
business. You could be considered rivals. Won't there be conflicts
of interest?
</P>
<P>
   A. Fendi will be run by a team already in place. There is
already a very good managing director, but he was not given the
investment capacity to grow the business. We have spent a lot of
money, so we will do everything possible to make it a success.
</P>
<P>
   When you say we are rivals, I am not so sure. When we are
together, Prada, Vuitton or Dior in the mall, we do more business
than when we are isolated all over the city. It is in our common
interest to do something together.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there ways the new owners can help cut Fendi's costs?
</P>
<P>
   A. We will help them purchase raw materials or give them to them
at our price. With our ad-buying power, immediately they will save
20 percent. There are numbers of their products they can make in
Prada's factories in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   We will give them, across the world, some of the best locations
at the best price. Little Fendi alone trying to rent space in
Manhattan, it is difficult. When you arrive with Prada, Vuitton,
Dior and Givenchy asking for space, you get larger space at a lower
price.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there names of Fendi's caliber still out there to be
bought?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are not many. That is why we were so interested in
doing this deal. It is not a frequent phenomenon to have a brand
that is so hot and is still small.
</P>
<P>
   If you take Vuitton, it is hot, but big. Prada, it is hot, but
big. So from an investment standpoint it is better to get them hot
and small.

BSO MAKES AN ASTONISHING DREAM JOURNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The story goes that Dr. Samuel Johnson, standing by the
fireplace as he began to turn the pages of Henry Fielding's novel
``Amelia,'' was so enthralled that he didn't even move to a chair
until he had finished it. Afterward he said, ``This has enlarged my
experience of life.''
</P>
<P>
   This is pretty much how this listener felt after hearing the
world premiere of Peter Lieberson's ``Red Garuda'' with the Boston
Symphony Thursday night. Lieberson's association with the BSO has
been career-long: He composed his first orchestral work for pianist
Peter Serkin and the BSO in 1983, and the BSO also commissioned
``Drala''; other pieces of his have been performed during the
Tanglewood Festival of Contemporary Music. He is a known quantity,
but always a surprising one: Before this season opened, Seiji Ozawa
remarked that ``Red Garuda'' is the work of a composer utterly
changed.
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly an astonishing and masterly work by a composer
who has learned both to look inward and to turn outward; his music
describes inner experience in a public way that does not violate or
betray its integrity and intensely personal nature. The piece is a
response to a dream or vision about being lifted by a giant
red-orange bird above daily concerns so that Lieberson could see
whole, elemental landscapes _ literally so, for the landscapes are
of fire, water, and earth/wind. Technically, the piece unfolds as a
series of variations. The piano, played by Serkin again, is not a
concerto soloist but a prominent part of a continuously shifting
texture, as in Scriabin's ``Prometheus: A Poem of Fire''; the
emphasis is on the upper reaches of the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   The writing is vivid, kaleidoscopic both in color and in
texture; the piece sounds full throughout, but the full orchestra
is in fact never simultaneously heard. Water, first glimpsed in
clarinet tremolos, shimmers; earth, usually the bad guy in elements
pieces, sounds like a delightfully capricious place to be (or to be
soaring above) _ among other things, ``Red Garuda'' is almost
completely nonjudgmental. The piece as a whole traces an emotional
journey no less complete and compelling than the visual one; it
begins in one place and ends in another _ a final flap of wing
above the gleam of the crotales (bell-like tuned cymbals). Under
Ozawa's vigilant leadership the performance was wonderfully
persuasive, and Serkin has both the attack it takes to be heard and
the imagination and coloristic variety to be worth hearing; the
page turner was assistant conductor Federico Cortese, no less. The
audience greeted the appearance of the composer
</P>
<P>
   on stage with warmth, enthusiasm, and gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   The second half of the program was Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony,
a familiar choice when there is a challenging new work at hand. It
did not sound over-rehearsed _ there was even an early brass
entrance, the kind of anticipation you never hear at BSO concerts.
But the performance had intensity, fire, and inspiration, some
luscious playing, a delicious lilt in the waltz, and haunting
colors and dynamics in the eloquently phrased horn solo in the
second movement (James Sommerville). Ozawa has cleaned up his
interpretation, omitting many traditional taffy-pull rubatos in
which he used to indulge. The only problem was that too much was
too loud; one feels certain that Tchaikovsky, living before
airplanes, CDs, and amplified music, never heard anything this
loud; 20th-century man has chosen his ears for mutilation. Too
often Ozawa left himself nowhere further to go, and Tchaikovsky
always did.

HORROR THEME PARK SCARES UP SOME NEW HAUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ ``I'm alive!'' exclaims the round-faced man
in the rented trailer. Dave Bertolino, 45, the co-owner of Spooky
World, is ebullient, holding court in the modest hospitality area
at his theme park on this crisp autumn night. ``I am thrilled to be
alive again.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Spooky World _ which bills itself as ``America's Horror
Theme Park'' _ has risen from the dead. Unlike zombies in George
Romero movies, this was not exactly a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   Spooky World, the October-only, Halloween-themed attraction, has
relocated from its home of eight years, land owned or leased by
Bertolino in Berlin, Mass., and set up shop on 60 wooded acres near
Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It has hauled its interactive attractions, including the Haunted
Hayride and its haunted houses _ a 3D disco, a phantom mine shaft,
Tom Savini's House of Horror and a killer-clown riddled Cirque
Macabre _ down the pike, spent $4 million on construction, and is
beckoning New Englanders by promising to once again scare the wits
out of them with things that go bump in the night, at a rather more
advanced level than your local neighborhood Halloween spook house.
</P>
<P>
   And this much is true: Every time a ghoul barks at you in the
dark, you jump. Maybe not as much the 100th time as the first time,
but you do jump.
</P>
<P>
   Spooky World's second life has been immensely aided by Foxboro
Associates, which is helmed by the New England Patriots-owning
Kraft family. Bertolino, a self-proclaimed ``hauntrepreneur,''
calls Spooky World a ``joint venture with the Kraft family ... with
a partnership likely down the road.'' Adds Foxboro Stadium general
manager Dan Murphy: ``It's much more than landlord/tenant. We both
have a vested interest, and we're involved in marketing with
David.''
</P>
<P>
   Spooky World has about 140 actors on its premises, ranging from
maniacal clowns to deranged miners to premises-wandering spooks.
There are carny sideshows with huge snakes and deformed frogs.
There is an outdoor magic show. One of the more prominent
attractions is Ruth Phelps, a.k.a. Mouse Girl, who lies behind
glass in the Cirque Macabre, looking desperate and helpless as
scads of mice crawl over her.
</P>
<P>
   Spooky World's pull is timeless. Humans are fascinated by
horror. Almost everyone knows who Ted Bundy was and Charles Manson
is. Are we not riveted by the sad case of JonBenet Ramsey? Why did
the masses flock to ``The Blair Witch Project?''
</P>
<P>
   We pity the victims and thank God it's not us. We get vicarious
thrills from depictions of pain or suggestions of violence. Spooky
World organizes its horror. It controls it and confines it,
throwing a cloak of safety over our terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very skeptical,'' says actress Linda Blair, recalling
how she felt when Bertolino first approached her six years ago to
appear at Spooky World. The child star of ``The Exorcist,'' now 40,
was at the park two weeks ago as part of a promotion. She says she
is not a fan of horror anddoesn't get why people like to be jolted.
``But I came and found people of all ages having a good time,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Spooky World had a large chunk of its operations shut
down when a new building inspector for the town of Berlin decided
some of the attractions were fire hazards. Three of the exhibitions
were shut down by order of a Worcester Superior Court judge. Spooky
World handed out 40,000 refunds, attendance dwindled, and the
company was forced into Chapter 11, from which it has since
emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Bertolino got a call from the Don Law Co., owned by
entertainment giant SFX Entertainment. SFX was interested in buying
Spooky World. Then, the Kraft family entered negotiations, and
Bertolino struck a deal to locate the park next to the stadium. Not
only that, Bertolino plans to host three more annual events on the
site, including a Christmas theme park later this year (no killer
Santas, Bertolino promises), a Renaissance Faire and a Comedy
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Bertolino is clearly happy Spooky World has moved on. He says in
this first year at the new spot, ``We're paying our bills, but not
getting rich quickly.'' The park is drawing 5,000-plus people per
night, although it is open Friday-Sunday _ 15 dates total _ and not
all week. Also, Spooky World lost parts of last weekend because of
a freak power outage.
</P>
<P>
   Bertolino has a $12-million suit pending against the town of
Berlin. As to any concerns about safety in Foxborough, fire
department captain Gerry McNamara says he has none. ``I think
they've done an awesome job. We're happy to have them in
Foxborough.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertolino has gotten rid of the hay (a fire hazard?!) on the
17-minute Haunted Hayride, a Spooky World highlight _ the 50 or so
people hauled on one of the nine tractors now sit on artificial
turf as they trip through the horrors of time. They see a torso on
a crucifix and bodies on stakes, and a guillotine where the
condemned man's head doesn't fall off. (``He's a little attached to
himself,'' explains the executioner, when asked). They are
good-naturedly ``assaulted'' by an assortment of crazies and
zombies, staggering toward the tractors, wielding chainsaws,
clamoring for ``brains.''
</P>
<P>
   Spooky World has temporarily retired one particularly gruesome
exhibit _ wax figures in the throes of medieval tortures. There is
a gallery of wax figures drawn from real life _ Manson, Richard
Ramirez, Aleister Crowley, the Rev. Jim Jones. There's a ``black
hole'' catwalk that is only 24 feet but looks endless and will give
you vertigo. There is a gift shop for all your blood 'n' gore
needs, including a lovely inflatable coffin. There are Patriots
cheerleaders there to pose for pictures and sign autographs. No
one, cheerleaders included, could exactly explain how they fit into
the horror theme _ especially with the team doing well.
</P>
<P>
   Attractions are rated on a 1 to 5 skull basis, judging for how
extreme the exhibit is. We'd say the park operates between PG and
PG-13.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Lou Ferrigno (the Incredible Hulk) and R.A.
Mahaillof (Leatherface in the third ``Texas Chainsaw Massacre''
movie) will sign autographs.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of horror? ``In wrestling,'' the burly Mahaillof
says, ``they call it the `ritual re-enactment.' You have these
prototypes or archetypes, and in wrestling and in horror, they are
very similar. It is always good against evil and hopefully good
triumphs.''
</P>
<P>
   Spooky World is open Fridays to Sundays through the end of the
month, 6 p.m.-midnight. Admission is $23.50, with parking $5. Call
978-838-0200.

`SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER,' A NEW MUSICAL WITH A BRIGHT NEW ACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 17)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KRIS WORRELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is difficult to believe that James Carpinello
hasn't closely studied John Travolta's performance in the 1977
movie ``Saturday Night Fever.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpinello has the Brooklyn accent down cold. He has the
sculpted hair. He has the strut.
</P>
<P>
   And the attitude, certainly the attitude.
</P>
<P>
   But Carpinello, the newest sensation to swivel across a Broadway
stage, swears he didn't spend weeks copying Travolta's movie moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I've seen the movie a couple of times. But this is a
play, it's not a movie,'' he said of the new Broadway mega-musical
version of ``Saturday Night Fever.''
</P>
<P>
   In the production, which opens Thursday after three weeks of
previews, Carpinello plays Tony Manero, the role that made Travolta
a star two decades ago and lodged white polyester suits and disco
music forever in the national psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to re-create what they did. We're doing our
own thing,'' Carpinello said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, but that accent! Those pelvic thrusts! That swagger!
</P>
<P>
   Carpinello even delivered a little Brooklyn street talk when
asked about a recent New York Post article that called the play
``trash theater.''``(Bleep) 'em,'' he said, leaning his muscular
frame forward. ``As far as I'm concerned, they haven't seen it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his candlelit dressing room in the Minskoff Theatre
an hour before one recent preview performance, the 24-year-old
actor sank back into the plush couch and considered his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad said, `Don't swear as much in this interview,' said
Carpinello.
</P>
<P>
   His mouth and mannerisms might be like those of Manero, the
blue-collar dancer from Brooklyn, but his East Greenbush background
couldn't be more different.
</P>
<P>
   The son of New York State Appellate Court Judge Anthony J.
Carpinello and Sharon Carpinello, the executive deputy commissioner
of the state Office of Mental Health, James Carpinello began taking
dancing lessons at the age of 6, but dropped them after a few years
in favor of sports. Peer pressure, explained his mother.
</P>
<P>
   The only photograph in the actor's dressing room that isn't of
his girlfriend, Lacey Kohl, an actress in Los Angeles, is one of
Carpinello, about age 8, dressed in a neat suit, dancing and
smiling.
</P>
<P>
   In high school at Albany Academy, from which he graduated in
1993, Carpinello began studying voice and acting. In his junior
year, he attended the prestigious summer acting program at Carnegie
Mellon University in Pittsburgh and was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just fell in love with theater and found my home there,''
said the actor, whose 20-year-old sister, Amy, studies dance at
Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. ``Everything was
pointing in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents, however, were slightly less in love with the idea
of a life on stage. They had watched their son perform in countless
plays in the basement as a child, then later at school and Park
Playhouse's ``Brigadoon,'' but they never considered theater a
serious career path.
</P>
<P>
   ``As conservative parents, we were a little reluctant to see him
enter such a competitive business,'' said Anthony Carpinello. ``But
we decided if the professionals at a highly thought-of collegiate
program thought he had talent and could make it, that we ought to
let him pursue his dream.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Carnegie Mellon's theater program _ which
has produced such actors as Jack Klugman, Ted Danson and Holly
Hunter _ Carpinello went on to perform in ``Romeo and Juliet'' in
Atlanta, ``The Tempest'' in Cleveland and a provocative
off-Broadway play called ``Stupid Kids,'' which was a cult hit last
year in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Polland, general manager of ``Stupid Kids,'' called
Carpinello ``a born star. ... He has it. Plus, he's a very
intelligent and wonderful man.''
</P>
<P>
   While doing ``Stupid Kids,'' Carpinello went to a New York
audition for a stage version of ``The Rocky Horror Picture Show''
to play piano for a friend who was trying out. After his friend
finished, the director who was casting the show asked Carpinello if
he could sing. Carpinello said yes and performed ``Gethsemane,'' a
difficult song from the musical ``Jesus Christ Superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much cast him for (the role of) Rocky on the spot,''
said director Dennis Erdman. ``Visually, he's very magnetic in a
room, and he looked the part.''
</P>
<P>
   When ``Stupid Kids'' closed, Carpinello went to Los Angeles to
perform in what turned out to be a short-lived ``Rocky Horror.''
But Carpinello was getting noticed. In a review of ``Rocky
Horror,'' The Los Angeles Times said: ``James Carpinello, who
recently had New York panting over his appearance in the play
`Stupid Kids,' will soon have Los Angeles doing the same over his
comically vacant and oh, so beautifully sculpted gym god of a
monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpinello was chosen for the highly coveted role of Tony Manero
over hundreds of hopefuls nationwide (including Joey Lawrence of
``Blossom'' fame).
</P>
<P>
   The buzz on this darkly handsome actor is louder than a theater
bar during intermission. Already he's been featured in a fashion
layout in Harper's Bazaar and in ads for Bloomingdale's. He taught
Katie Couric how to do the Hustle on the ``Today Show,'' and he has
been interviewed in dozens of newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just look at it like everything else ... except now there's
a lot of people around, asking questions and wanting me to do
things,'' said Carpinello. ``I just feel really lucky. But I don't
feel like something was handed to me. I feel like it's the right
role, at the right time.''

A PERSONAL VIEW : WHAT CAUSES BRUTALITY? THE PEOPLE NURTURING IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
(AUTHOR ID: Richard Rhodes' most recent book is ``Why They Kill:
The Discoveries of a Maverick Criminologist'' published by Knopf
last month.) 
 By RICHARD RHODES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When what was formerly commonplace fades to rarity, we come to
think it bizarre. Whose mother still steps behind the house to
throttle a chicken for Sunday dinner? Who has seen a goiter or a
face ruined by smallpox? Serious private violence used to be
routine, a way people settled disputes in the ages before access to
courts of law and police protection brought such violence under
social control. Today, because many of us never experience such
violence directly even once in our lives, its origins seem
inexplicable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet theories abound. Sociologists often say that criminal
aggressiveness originates in exposure to the mass media, though
homicide rates declined across the centuries when children joined
eager crowds at public executions. Psychiatrists often say that
violent acts erupt unbidden from pathological mental states, though
the progressive decline of violence in the West as social control
increased and the disparity of violence rates between Europe and
the United States today implicate social experience rather than
individual psychology.
</P>
<P>
   I have personal experience of violence. For two years as a
child, I was beaten, starved and physically and psychologically
tortured by a stepmother whose amused malevolence authenticated the
wicked stepmothers of folklore. My older brother Stanley, a brave
13-year-old, saved us by going to the police wearing the fresh
welts of a beating. I gained 30 pounds in three months at the
beneficent private boys' home where we recovered. For people like
me, violence is the minotaur; we spend our lives wandering its
maze, looking for the exit.
</P>
<P>
   Before micro-organisms were shown to cause most diseases,
experts imagined that diseases arose from multiple external causes
_ mists and stinks, the influence of the stars _ or signaled
imbalances of bodily humors. Even though unsupported conjecture
similarly obscures violence prevention today, I believe the cause
of violent criminality has been authoritatively identified. The
explanation had been sitting on the shelf for half a decade when I
encountered it in 1997. An American criminologist, Dr. Lonnie
Athens, had extensively interviewed several hundred violent
criminals _ men and women of varied ages, ethnic and social
backgrounds, classified as sane or mentally ill _ and isolated the
distinctive pattern of noxious social development common to them
all. In his 1992 book ``The Creation of Dangerous Violent
Criminals,'' he called this four-stage process of social
development ``violentization.''
</P>
<P>
   They had all been brutalized _ had been violently dominated, had
witnessed intimates being violently dominated, had been coached
that a violent response to provocation was their personal
responsibility. Eventually, growing belligerent, filled with rage
and fantasies of revenge, they resolved to counter serious
provocation with serious violence themselves and discovered that
victory gained them the fearful respect of their intimates and
peers. This intoxicating experience of violent notoriety had made
them feel invulnerable and further deepened their resolve to use
violence not only in fear and self-defense but also in anger, in
frustration or merely as an expression of contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Athens' explanation fits the backgrounds of well-known violent
persons as diverse as the Darien, Conn., rapist Alex Kelly; Lana
Turner's daughter Cheryl Crane, who killed Ms. Turner's lover,
Johnny Stompanato, in a notorious 1950s Hollywood scandal; Lee
Harvey Oswald, and Mike Tyson. Violentization _ not media exposure,
genetic heritage, brain damage, mental illness or poverty _
demonstrably shadows every episode of serious private violence,
from school shootings to killings for hire, from the rampages of
disgruntled day traders to the parking-lot assaults of Saturday
night drunks.
</P>
<P>
   In her book about the Kelly case, ``Saint of Circumstance,''
Sheila Weller writes of witnesses' reports that Kelly's father beat
him and his older brother Chris with fists and belts and slammed
them into walls. The Kellys encouraged Alex to violence by
minimizing his crimes, paying some $100,000 in restitution for his
adolescent burglaries of neighbors' homes to reduce his time in
prison, then supporting their son's long flight from prosecution
for rape.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly first directed his resentment and anger at being
brutalized into athletics, where he got an early taste of the
rewards of even minor violent performances. At 14, Ms. Weller
writes, he perpetrated his first known rape, of a small,
preadolescent 13-year-old. No violent notoriety followed, because
the girl told only her sister, and the sisters kept their secret.
Kelly then turned to burglarizing houses and pursued a violently
abusive relationship with a girlfriend. Only after serving two
months of a three-year prison sentence for the burglaries and
returning to high school a dark hero, almost 18 years old, did he
rape again. No doubt those two months in prison contributed to his
violentization: prisons are champion finishing schools for violent
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the upbringing of the boys who killed their
schoolmates in April at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
have not been revealed, but one of them, Eric Harris, was breaking
windshields, posting death threats, building pipe bombs, flashing
weapons, getting into fistfights and planning mass murder for a
year before the massacre, evidence that suggests he had moved
beyond brutalization into belligerency and defensive violent
performances and was approaching virulency, switching from provoked
to unprovoked violence _ the Columbine horror itself.
</P>
<P>
   Luke Woodham, who stabbed his mother to death in Pearl, Miss.,
in 1997 before shooting his former girlfriend and nine other
students at school, said during a nationally televised interview on
ABC that his mother had harangued him for years about his
worthlessness. He also identified as his violence coach Grant
Boyette, the 18-year-old leader of an outcast group to which
Woodham belonged. At his trial, Woodham testified that Boyette had
told him to kill his mother and take revenge at school. Boyette was
charged as an accessory and pleaded guilty.

<P>
   Violent socialization is not exclusively a family matter. Gangs
use it to shape recruits; assigning novices to slash strangers on
the subway, as some New York gangs have begun to do, forces the
recruits from defensive to offensive violent performance and
rewards them with social success. So, for soldiers, does
encouraging rape in war.
</P>
<P>
   But families are the primary incubators of violence today, as
they have always been. Social control of violence, increasingly
effective in the larger society, has only begun to penetrate the
exempted zone of family privacy. Athens' research led him to
conclude that only people who had fully experienced and completed
all four stages of violentization became seriously violent. It
follows that supporting families at risk with home visiting
programs and family community centers, swiftly removing children to
safety from abusive homes, countering violent coaching with
nonviolent mentoring, and establishing alternative programs for
belligerent students in their early teens rather than expelling
them from school can reduce the number of seriously violent adults.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal violence emerges from social experience, most commonly
brutal social experience visited upon vulnerable children. Ignoring
it and tolerating the brutalization of children is equally violent,
and we reap what we sow.

DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS AWARDED NOBEL PEACE PRIZE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Ethiopia, Zaire, Tanzania, Kosovo, Angola, Rwanda,
Norway , Armenia, Haiti, Russia, China)   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Doctors Without Borders, which sends medical personnel
to some of the most destitute and dangerous parts of the world and
encourages them not only to save lives, but also to condemn the
injustices they see, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Founded here in 1971 as Medecins Sans Frontieres, by a band of
French doctors disillusioned with the neutrality of the Red Cross,
the volunteer group now has more than 2,000 personnel who are
treating the wounded, the sick and the starving in 80 countries,
including 20 war zones.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the group has been expelled from several
countries for denouncing what it saw as wrong. In 1985 it was
banned from Ethiopia for saying the government had diverted aid and
forced migration. In late 1994, the group withdrew from Zaire and
Tanzania and denounced the operation of the refugee camps, because,
it said, the camps were being controlled by Hutu leaders who had
been responsible for the genocide in neighboring Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   In recognizing the work of the organization, the Norwegian Nobel
Committee highlighted the willingness to send volunteers quickly to
scenes of disaster, no matter what the politics of the situation.
It praised the group for drawing the world's attention to the
causes of catastrophes, which ``helps to form bodies of public
opinion opposed to violations and abuses of power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In critical situations marked by violence and brutality, the
humanitarian world of Doctors Without Borders enables the
organization to create openings for contacts between the opposed
parties,'' the citation said. ``At the same time, each fearless and
self-sacrificing helper shows each victim a human face, stands for
respect for that person's dignity, and is a source of hope for
peace and reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   At the group's modest headquarters here, dozens of workers
gathered to drink Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Phillipe Biberson, the president of the group in France, said
the award was an occasion to shine some light once again on those
his group tried to help: the starving, those living in battle
zones, those suffering from diseases like malaria that rarely get
the world's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are not sure that words can save,'' Biberson said, ``We
do know that silence kills.''
</P>
<P>
   One in four of the doctors who travel with the group to trouble
spots each year are French, though in recent years volunteers from
45 other countries have taken part.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors and nurses, who get a stipend of about $750 a month,
often work under extreme conditions. For instance, in Angola this
year they have maintained a clinic in Kuito, a town that has been
repeatedly cut off by rebel fighters. While some of the work is in
hot spots like Kosovo, many of the projects are far out of the
limelight: family planning in Armenia, basic health care in Haiti,
care for the homeless in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the agency has also pulled off some logistical
triumphs. In 1995, for example, in response to a meningitis
epidemic in Nigeria, staff members vaccinated 4 million people in
just three months.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Nobel Peace Prize was first awarded in 1901, 18 other
organizations have been named as winners or co-winners. These have
included the International Red Cross, International Physicians for
the Prevention of Nuclear War and Amnesty International. The most
recent was the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines, which
shared the award in 1997 with its coordinator, Jody Williams of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nobel officials said there were 136 nominees for the prize this
year, of which 101 were individuals and 35 were organizations. The
committee members are highly guarded about their deliberations and
rarely let slip any advance word on the winner. But nominees for
the prize are often identified publicly by the individuals and
organization that put the candidates forward.
</P>
<P>
   On that basis, Norwegian newspapers have reported the
nominations of President Clinton, President Ezer Weizman Israel and
two Chinese dissidents, Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Oslo newspaper Dagbladet claimed it had learned
that the 1999 prize would be shared by the Chinese dissidents. The
false report spurred Chinese officials here to protest the supposed
choice with the Norwegian government, though the government has
nothing to do with the selection.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Doctors Without Borders is not expected to help
along some delicate peace process. But Francis Sejersted, the
chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said the committee hoped
it would inspire this and similar organizations to step up their
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is growing need for humanitarian organizations of this
kind in today's world,'' he said, singled out the group's
commitment to Africa because the misery there often fades from
public consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the agency, like many others, has complained of
growing difficulty in raising funds. On Friday officials there said
they would probably simply put the prize money _ nearly $1 million
_ into their budget.
</P>
<P>
   It is also more difficult to find volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many doctors today are facing economical constraints,'' said
Dr. Marc Gastellu Etchegorry, the group's medical director.
``Taking six months off when they have school bills to pay is hard.
And, yes, some of them are thinking more about playing golf.''
</P>
<P>
   The group grew out of the frustration of a group of young
doctors who worked for the Red Cross and treated the starving in
Biafra at the end of the 1960s. But Red Cross confidentiality
prevented them from speaking out. They organized themselves in 1971
in the aftermath of severe flooding in Bangladesh (then East
Pakistan). Poorly equipped and perhaps a little too media-hungry,
they were dismissed by some aid agencies as cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   That criticism is long gone now. But some aid agencies still
scorn Doctors Without Borders for its cozy relationship with the
news media and its sometimes glitzy image of attractive young
doctors in the field. It is sometimes cattily referred to by its
rivals as ``Publicite sans Limite'' (Publicity Without Limit).
</P>
<P>
   But many of the group's founders insist that speaking out about
atrocities would help prevent them. Bernard Kouchner, one of the
founders and now the senior U.N. representative in Kosovo, said
Friday that agencies like Medecins Sans Frontieres would help make
massacres impossible in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important that MSF does not offer shelter for
disgraceful acts and suffering,'' Kouchner said. ``We need to
convince people that the suffering of one man was the
responsibility of all men. This work is not done, far from it.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Hurricane Irene bore down on southern Florida on Friday,
winds gusted to 77 mph at Homestead Air Reserve Base near Miami
while heavy rain, estimated at rates of 2 inches per hour, doused
much of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, though likely downgraded to a tropical storm, Irene
will remain very dangerous as it produces prolific rains across
northern Florida, southeastern Georgia and, perhaps, southeastern
South Carolina. Isolated tornadoes may spin up, but the greatest
threat from this storm will be flooding rains.
</P>
<P>
   A cold Canadian air mass will tighten its grip on the northern
Rockies and northern Plains on Saturday. Snow will develop along
the Front Range from northeast Colorado to eastern Wyoming as moist
winds from the east circulating around a high-pressure system over
Idaho are forced to ascend the sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Cold air will spill west over the Rockies and into the Great
Basin, with temperatures falling toward 10 degrees Saturday night
over parts of Nevada. The expansive high over Idaho will also
produce offshore winds over parts of the California coast. Blowing
from the east, these winds will warm on descent from the Sierra,
paving the way for very warm weather along parts of California
coast, including San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, temperatures in the Northeast will rise above
seasonal levels after a chilly start as winds from the southwest
develop ahead of a slow-moving cold front across the Middle West.
The sluggishness of the cold front may invite Irene to move up the
East Coast on Sunday into Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Seeing an Eye &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friday, as the eye of Hurricane Irene passed over Key West,
Fla., winds subsided and clouds briefly broke. But Irene's eye was
not visible from satellite. In general, eyes of hurricanes are
visible from space roughly 50 percent of the time. The eye often
becomes visible on satellite images when the hurricane intensifies,
particularly when intensification is rapid. Under these conditions,
air sinking in the eye becomes more pronounced, helping to
evaporate clouds and exposing the eye to space. When a hurricane
reaches extreme strength, its eye is almost always seen from
satellite. &QL;

   The Piano Man Sings For Baron Shareholders &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to having a party, mutual fund types have never
been able to hold a candle to Hollywood _ or even to high-spirited
accountants who want to celebrate a revision in the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Baron of Baron Capital, a money manager, wants to change
that. A case in point is the annual investment conference he held
on Friday in Manhattan for current and prospective shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try and make the business younger all the time,'' Baron
said.
</P>
<P>
   The unannounced lunchtime guest performer was Billy Joel, who
surprised the 2,000 or so attendees with a rendition of ``New York
State of Mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Other stars were from companies in which the Baron funds hold
major positions. They included Sol Kerzner, chief executive of Sun
International Hotels, and David S. Pottruck, co-chief executive of
Charles Schwab. Baron said the purpose was to raise shareholder
confidence in the stocks Baron holds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a costly event,'' he said, hastening to add that Baron
Capital, not the funds themselves, picked up the bill.
</P>
<P>
   How will he handle the gate crashers likely to arrive at next
year's conference? ``I haven't figured that out yet,'' he said.

   &UR; SATURDAY'S KEY GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ratings by The New York Times computer. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 3 Penn State (6-0)
</P>
<P>
   After Penn State piled up 500 yards (341 rushing) against Iowa,
Coach Joe Paterno said, ``I think overall we've improved, but we're
certainly not good enough yet.'' Penn State is certainly better
than Ohio State, whose coach, John Cooper, admits, ``This is not
the best team we've had around here.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 11 Syracuse (5-1)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 10 Virginia Tech (5-0)
</P>
<P>
   Tech's defense, ranked second in the nation (allowing 206.8
yards a game), has an offense to go with it. Playing only the first
half against Rutgers last Saturday, Michael Vick, Tech's
quarterback, accounted for 311 yards. Syracuse could make it close
in this game between Big East leaders.
</P>
<P>
   No. 5 Michigan State (6-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Purdue (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State, 6-0 for the first time since 1966, faces a
three-game stretch against Purdue, Wisconsin and Ohio State. The
Spartans, fresh from an upset of Michigan, have the nation's best
rushing defense (36.7 yards a game) and must stop Drew Brees'
passing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EAST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers (0-5)
</P>
<P>
   at West Virginia (1-4)
</P>
<P>
   It should be easy for West Virginia, especially with Mike
McMahon, the Rutgers quarterback, sidelined indefinitely with
sprained ligaments in his passing shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Penn (2-2)
</P>
<P>
   at Columbia (2-2)
</P>
<P>
   Columbia has found a passer in Mike Glynn, Penn a runner in Kris
Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Dartmouth (0-4)
</P>
<P>
   at Yale (3-1)
</P>
<P>
   Dartmouth's nine-game losing streak, the longest in its 118-year
football history, will get longer.
</P>
<P>
   Lafayette (1-4)
</P>
<P>
   at Princeton (1-3)
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Princeton let James Perry of Brown complete 42
passes, an Ivy League record.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SOUTH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   No. 7 Alabama (4-1)
</P>
<P>
   at Mississippi (5-1)
</P>
<P>
   After Alabama upset Florida the last time out, a proud Coach
Mike DuBose said, ``There were lots of times where they could have
split and splintered.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 9 Florida (5-1)
</P>
<P>
   at Auburn (3-3)
</P>
<P>
   Florida held Louisiana State to minus 7 yards rushing last week,
and Auburn has the worst rushing offense in the Southeastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   No. 12 Georgia Tech (4-1)
</P>
<P>
   at Duke (1-4)
</P>
<P>
   Despite his four turnovers against North Carolina State, Joe
Hamilton of Tech may be the nation's best quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia (4-1)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 21 Vanderbilt (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee smothered Georgia's running game. Vanderbilt won't.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana State (2-3)
</P>
<P>
   at Kentucky (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   Dusty Bonner's passing gives Kentucky the edge in a close game.
</P>
<P>
   Clemson (2-3)
</P>
<P>
   at Maryland (4-1)
</P>
<P>
   Maryland has won more games than it did all of last season. This
one will be tough.
</P>
<P>
   Army (2-3)
</P>
<P>
   at Southern Mississippi (3-2)
</P>
<P>
   Army may struggle to get its usual big rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MIDWEST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   No. 22 Minnesota (4-1)
</P>
<P>
   at Illinois (3-2)
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, which has come down to reality, gets the edge here.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California (3-2)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 24 Notre Dame (3-3)
</P>
<P>
   Not the glamorous game it used to be. Notre Dame, its offense
coming together, should win.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana (3-3)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 25 Wisconsin (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   Indiana can run, but Wisconsin can run better.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FAR WEST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State (2-3)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 14 Washington (3-2)
</P>
<P>
   Washington got seven turnovers in beating Oregon State. Arizona
State lost six in losing to Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   No. 15 Brigham Young (4-1)
</P>
<P>
   at New Mexico (2-3)
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Feterik of Brigham Young keeps throwing touchdown passes
and keeps getting battered.
</P>
<P>
   No. 19 Utah (4-1)
</P>
<P>
   at Air Force (4-1)
</P>
<P>
   Air Force is favored despite a horrible first half before
beating Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State (3-2)
</P>
<P>
   at Stanford (3-2)
</P>
<P>
   Except for Ken Simonton's running, Oregon State is mistake
prone.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MISMATCHES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Wake Forest (3-2)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 2 Florida State
</P>
<P>
   Chris Weinke's passing should give the Seminoles their 28th
straight home victory.
</P>
<P>
   Utah State (2-3)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 6 Kansas State (5-0)
</P>
<P>
   Utah State's big running game runs into a buzzsaw.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas (2-4)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 23 Texas A&AMP;M (4-1)
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies' scoring drought is over, and the points should keep
rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Temple (1-5)
</P>
<P>
   at Miami (2-3)

<P>
   The Charles Schwab Corp., a pioneer of discount stock brokerage
and even cheaper on-line brokerage, is getting it from all sides
these days.
</P>
<P>
   After staking out a position between low-cost electronic trading
shops and traditional brokerage firms, Schwab finds that both ends
are moving toward the middle: Deep discounters like E(star)Trade
Group are adding services for investors, while full-service firms
like Merrill Lynch are offering on-line trades at a discount.
</P>
<P>
   The brewing storm of competition has frightened investors out of
Schwab's stock, which has fallen more than 60 percent from its high
in April, to $28.50 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Richard K. Strauss, an analyst at
Goldman Sachs Group, talked about Schwab's predicament, its
prospects and why he thinks it will hit $50 within a year. Here are
excerpts from the conversation: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why did Schwab go from being a darling to getting dumped so
quickly? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Schwab's stock tends to go through a bad period once every
couple of years. Typically, the cause is that Schwab is
transforming itself, facing a new competitor or there's a slowdown
that is either seasonal or cyclical. Those tend to be the things
that change the fortunes of Schwab's stock. However, the company
has an incredible track record of making those downdrafts into
buying opportunities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Which of those usual suspects is the culprit holding down
Schwab's stock this time around?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This right now is more of a seasonal slowdown. But it's also
a smoke screen of sorts from other E-brokers who are talking about
adding accounts but not talking about growing assets profitably. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Those competitors certainly are talking _ and advertising _
plenty. Isn't Schwab going to have to match the huge ad budgets of
these upstart firms? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you look at E(star)Trade and Ameritrade combined, their
marketing budget next year is going to be well over $500 million.
That's more than double what Schwab will be spending. Schwab has
over $600 billion in customer assets. E(star)Trade and Ameritrade
combined have no more than $50 billion. The economics speak for
themselves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. But by doing all that advertising and price-cutting, aren't
they putting pressure on Schwab's profit margins? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Not necessarily. Look at what Schwab has done in 1999. They
have brought in $75 billion of net new money and their profit
margin during that period has averaged close to 15 percent of
revenue, which is the highest their margin has ever been. Of the
$75 billion they've brought in, $25 billion came in this summer
during a slowdown that really was a stealth bear market. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How long can they keep up that pace of gathering assets in
the face of increasing competition late in a long bull market? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Schwab's customer-asset base has gone from $7 billion to $600
billion in 12 years. There have been some pretty hairy markets
during that time but Schwab has continued to take in assets during
those periods of turmoil. The company's profits have been growing
35 to 40 percent a year. My growth projection for them now is 25 to
30 percent. Even with the seasonal slowdown this summer, their
earnings should be up close to 60 percent this year. My forecast
for their long-term growth is higher than it's ever been. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is the new money rolling into Schwab in bigger or smaller
chunks? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The average new account they're bringing in starts out with
$44,000 and that's 42 percent bigger than their new accounts were
last year. The company's average account size now is about
$100,000. That's the kind of account that a full-service broker
like Merrill Lynch would be going after. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Speaking of Merrill Lynch, that firm is about to offer
on-line trades for $29.95 each, the same price Schwab charges. How
much of a threat is that to Schwab? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Financial services is an incredibly fragmented industry.
Merrill has $1.5 trillion of customer assets but that's only about
3 percent of the total investable assets in the U.S. The moves that
Merrill is making have been painful for Merrill in the short term.
But if anyone has the capital and the staying power to compete with
Schwab, it's not the E-brokers, it's the full-service brokers. It
will depend on how quickly they can get their cost structure down
so they can continue to offer great service but at a better price. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So Schwab is being smart in positioning itself as an
alternative to the traditional brokers rather than competing
against the little guys on price? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Schwab is competing with anyone who is trying to gather
assets. In the asset-gathering world, it's getting more and more
difficult to accumulate assets, in part because there are so many
competitors and partly because more people are choosing to do it
themselves. To a large degree, Schwab has enabled and empowered
that trend.

MANY IN CALIFORNIA FOREGO QUAKE INSURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The number of Californians with earthquake
coverage is falling as homeowners choose less costly alternatives:
retrofitting their houses or going without insurance at all.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry says the percentage of policy holders
taking earthquake insurance has dropped to 17 percent from the
state historic average of 20 to 25 percent. And the number of
policies since the state took control of coverage nearly three
years ago has dropped from 1.3 million in December 1996 to about
920,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Lepoutre-Baldocci took a look at earthquake insurance
premiums when she moved from Knoxville, Tenn., to Oakland in May
and decided to put that money and her faith in retrofitting her
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insurance made no sense. I find it prohibitively expensive and
it doesn't cover much at all,'' said Lepoutre-Baldocci, who feels
reasonably safe after completing a $5,000 retrofit in July.
``First, we want to be able to get out alive. And secondly, we
would like the house to stay intact _ especially since we have no
insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a game of chance many homeowners are playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have this dual mentality,'' said Mark Leonard,
spokesman for the California Earthquake Authority, created by the
state in December 1996 to provide a pool of money, now up to $7.2
billion, for losses from quakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing they think is if they've survived Loma Prieta
or Northridge, they don't need to do anything. At the same time,
they think if the Big One hits, there's nothing they can do about
it so they don't retrofit and they don't buy insurance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the drop may be due to the general apathy that
comes from a long time without a major quake, it's clear homeowners
are frustrated with the earthquake insurance options they have.
They complain the deductibles are too high, the coverage is too
limited and they doubt they will ever see a dime _ especially under
the state-run program.
</P>
<P>
   Private insurers say they're writing more and more policies, but
they are selective of their customers. All together, they cover
about a third of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Both insurers and seismic specialists recommend that homeowners
retrofit their homes and insure them for content and other damage.
But with the high cost of housing compounded by the price of
insurance premiums, many people say they cannot afford to do both.
</P>
<P>
   Retrofitting a home can cost anywhere from about $1,500 to
$15,000, depending on the size of the house and the amount of work
that needs to be done. Standard retrofitting involves bolting the
house to the foundation and installing plywood cripple walls to
brace the foundation to the floor framing.
</P>
<P>
   Rodeo resident Elda Fox, who works in San Francisco as a
paralegal, has not had earthquake insurance since 1994 when the
rates skyrocketed in the aftermath of the Northridge quake in
Southern California. The quake killed 57 people and caused $20
billion in damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided at that point it wasn't worth it, given the
deductible,'' said Fox, who has just decided to invest in a $6,000
retrofit on her 57-year-old home. She said she recently received an
offer in the mail for earthquake insurance but tossed it out:
``Now, getting the retrofit done, I don't think I'll even consider
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Mezey, who has lived in San Francisco for the past 40
years, bought another home in Berkeley about four months ago and
decided to spend $3,000 retrofitting the house instead of insuring
it. ``I've been told by our engineer that, short of some terrible
thing, this is probably going to protect it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry may be frustrated by such opinions, but
this public reaction grew out the industry's inability to deal with
the damage created by the Northridge quake, which is still
considered the nation's costliest natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   After that quake, some insurers refused to sell fire or
earthquake policies as required by state law because of the
potential loss. So the state created the earthquake authority.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen insurance companies have joined the authority,
including State Farm Fire &AMP; Casualty, Prudential Insurance, Liberty
Mutual Insurance Co., Farmers Insurance Group, Allstate Insurance
Co. and the California State Automobile Association. The authority
covers 70 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the criticism of the state authority centered on the
so-called mini- policy, which offered residents a 15 percent
deductible along with a bare-bones $5,000 in content coverage and
$1,500 in living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to clamors for a lower deductible and increased
coverage, the authority has made available another policy that
lowers the deductible to 10 percent and boosts content coverage to
$100,000 and living expenses up to $15,000. However, Leonard said
only two of the companies _ State Farm and Liberty Mutual _ offer
the supplemental coverage.

   INDIA-PAKISTAN-REVIEW (United Nations) _ India and Pakistan seem
to be taking starkly divergent paths into the next political era.
India anointed another democratically elected government and
Pakistan applauded yet another military coup. But beneath the
surface, are these events as diametrically different as they seem?
These two countries may be demonstrating a common trend. In their
search for identity, a new generation of Pakistanis and Indians are
unveiling the face of home-grown, grassroots politics _ pure Indian
and pure Pakistani, more inward-looking, less cosmopolitan. And,
perhaps, more likely to misunderstand each other. By Barbara

sordid impeachment scandal is still being written, there are
constant reminders of our long national nightmare in Americans'

   TRIANGULATION-POLITICS-REVIEW (Austin, Texas) _ There is no
higher praise from Bill Clinton's devotees than when they applaud
George W. Bush for proving himself a deft triangulator. Bush says
he does not know what the word means. The definition, according to
Dick Morris, the former Clinton adviser who invented the idea, is:
`A process of taking the best ideas from each party and combining
them into a coherent policy and program. It is not just splitting
the difference, but molding a creative synthesis which rises above
the doctrine of either party.' By Richard Berke.
</P>
<P>
   CYBERWARFARE-REVIEW (Undated) _ The addition of an
information-war fighting capability to the U.S. military arsenal is
a watershed event, both adding cyberwar to the quiver of the
Pentagon and at the same time taking a set of military activities
which have for the last two decades largely been confined to the
black secret side of the military and intelligence world and making
them part of the military chain of command. At the same time the
new military command is a public acknowledgment that as the worlds
most technically advanced nation, the U.S. is also potentially the
most vulnerable to foreign cyberthreats. By John Markoff.

<P>
   MATHEMATICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ There is no Nobel prize in
metaphysics. But if there were, it would surely go to the thinker
who could solve the stubborn mystery of why mathematics so often
mirrors the workings of the physical world. Rocks arc through the
sky in parabolic trajectories, planets swing in ellipses around the
sun. And inside atoms, tiny particles move according to the
mathematics of quantum mechanics. By George Johnson.

   ENVIRON-COSTSBENEFITS-REVIEW (Seattle) _ Amid a study of whether
or not to breach four huge hydroelectric dams on the Snake River in
eastern Washington, which would restore 140 miles of it to a wild,
free-flowing condition and could revitalize endangered salmon runs,
government economists are adding a factor known as ``existence
value'' to their list of costs and benefits. Aside from calculating
the proposal's effects on jobs, electric bills and shipping rates,
the government is now hoping to assign a dollar value to Americans'
knowledge that a piece of their wilderness might be regained. By
Sam Howe Verhovek.

   SPORTSWRITING-REVIEW (Undated) _ The 1920s were the golden age
of sportswriting. A handful of talented and ambitious journalists
who found other paths to literary fame blocked began to notice, as
indeed their editors had already noticed, that an increasingly
affluent middle class was responding more to the exploits of Jack
Dempsey, Babe Ruth and Bobby Jones than to what would come to be
known as ``hard'' news stories. Within three decades, TV would make
athletes smaller than life. Rarely again would sportswriters see

YOUNG DELAYS RETIREMENT DECISION AS HE SEEKS SECOND OPINIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Minn., Calif., Ariz.)  (dw) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Young was hit in the head. Knocked woozy. More than that,
it injured his brain, causing major consternation and concern among
his doctors, family, friends, teammates, coaches and fans. Many
warned of permanent danger if he returned to football. Many tried
persuading him to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it is a familiar story. Young has had four concussions in
three years. The latest came Sept. 27 in a Monday night game at
Arizona on a play in which Young was blitzed, pummeled in the head
by another player's helmet and then by another's knee. He has
missed the last two 49ers games. He will miss at least two more.
</P>
<P>
   This week his neurosurgeon, Dr. Gary Steinberg, told Young that
he could not immediately resume his role at quarterback. No serious
brain damage has been revealed, but Young still has dizziness and
headaches. Steinberg told him more, but neither Young nor his
doctor will publicly discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   This is a case of no news not likely being good news.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason he hasn't been cleared to play up until now is that
it's my opinion and the opinion of the 49ers that it's in the best
interest of Steve Young to allow his brain to recover,'' Steinberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers play at home against Carolina Sunday and at Minnesota
next weekend before a bye. That gives Young three weeks to seek
more medical opinions and, he hopes, time for his condition to
improve so that he could be free to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``My point to Steve is that five to 10 years from now when he's
feeling fit, he's going to say: `Why didn't I play football? I took
the advice of one physician, the consultation of one neurologist _
I should have really checked it out,''' said Bill Walsh, the 49ers'
president. ``So, I want to make sure he checks everything.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a telling statement. It certainly sounds as if Steinberg
told Young to retire, that the risks were too great.
</P>
<P>
   Young, 38, is a two-time league most valuable player and a Super
Bowl XXIX mvp and champion. He is the quarterback who replaced the
49ers legend Joe Montana, and his left-handed spirals, spinning
scrambles and spirited leadership became signatures of his game. He
already holds virtually every meaningful 49ers passing record. He
is a player of tremendous work ethic and desire.
</P>
<P>
   Quitting now? In the middle of the season? Quitting while still
a prime player and passer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve would want to retire on his own terms and even then it
would be difficult for him,'' 49ers receiver Jerry Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   But really, retire he must.
</P>
<P>
   After 169 games and 4,149 passes and 358 sacks and countless
other hits, it is time. Four concussions is a lot. Not only that,
but this season he also has been battered. In one game, Sept. 19
against New Orleans, Young was hit 21 times.
</P>
<P>
   Young should continue playing if he is medically cleared and if,
in his mind, he decides that the rewards are greater than the
risks. For most of us, they are not.
</P>
<P>
   But for a football player, for a man like Young who loves the
game and gives so much to it, maybe his happiness is tied so much
to the field that quitting now would slowly drain him. Defeat him.
Some people love what they do so much that they are willing to pay
a high price. That is Young's decision. It is his right.
</P>
<P>
   His parents and friends tried persuading him to quit after a
concussion two years ago, so imagine their fears. Imagine what they
are saying now.
</P>
<P>
   For Young, the next three weeks will be filled with pull and
tug. Doctors may solve the issue by saying he cannot play again. If
they allow him to play, then Young must measure his own fears
against his desire to play, mixed all the while with the constant
coaxing from those who want him to quit. It is not an easy road.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Steve's mind, there is some hope,'' said Steve Mariucci,
the 49ers' head coach. ``Somehow he's reaching for some hope that,
hey, I'll be back. That's what he's thinking about. That's all he
thinks about.''
</P>
<P>
   His heart is telling him yes.
</P>
<P>
   His brain should tell him no.

 &HT;    Soiled Mary art more Christian than a cross with diamond setting
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A diamond-studded crucifix is surely
more offensive to God than a portrait of Mary surrounded by
elephant dung. But cardinals and critics condemn the painting and
peddle the crosses.
</P>
<P>
   Christians often confuse their symbols. Unwittingly, they
trivialize their faith. Mary surrounded by dung is biblically
accurate. Crosses made of gold and worn as jewelry are at least in
bad taste if not blasphemous.
</P>
<P>
   They become decorative items replicating a hideous instrument of
death, and they are used to enhance one's appearance _ the crucifix
as fashion accessory. Hard to believe God had that in mind at
Calvary.
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, seem to want Mary linked with prostitutes and
manure. But politicians and religious leaders have long thought God
mistaken about that and have tried to clean up the faith.
</P>
<P>
   The current flap is over an exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum of
Art in New York. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Roman Catholic John
Cardinal O'Connor vehemently condemned a painting of the Virgin
Mary. The picture includes a scene filled with the body parts of
prostitutes and clumps of elephant feces.
</P>
<P>
   The painting may be bad art and the artist may even have a
malevolent intent, but he cannot make Christianity more offensive
than it already is or intends to be.
</P>
<P>
   Those who would sanitize Christianity, make it pretty,
culturally acceptable and dull miss the point. Christianity claims
that prostitutes, reprobates and everyone else who wallows among
the human debris of the world are precisely the congregation God is
looking for.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of the faith is that God embraces those poor souls
whom religious and political leaders find offensive. Jesus preached
_ and lived _ that message. He was crucified for it.
</P>
<P>
   The Bible makes the point graphically and poignantly in what
many consider the greatest story ever told. The Gospel of Luke
tells us that Mary gave birth to the Son of God in a cave filled
with sheep and cattle. The Christ child might well have been put
down on a bed of straw mingled with animal feces and dirt.
</P>
<P>
   The story paints a marvelous image of one who was intimately
associated with the dregs of society. The church claims Jesus was
murdered on their behalf. Yet critics find prostitutes in a
portrait of Mary offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The real offense is to deny God's association with the likes of
those whom proper society condemns.
</P>
<P>
   But many of us want the one we worship to be more
discriminating, more sensible, more like us. We want to transform a
blood-drenched cross into a thing of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   We don't like our gods to appear weak or poor or hang out with
those who are. But Jesus does just that. And the portrait of Mary
among prostitutes and feces is an accurate symbol of his ministry.
</P>
<P>
   That's the wonderful scandal of Christianity, the offensive
truth the faithful call good news.

 &HT;    Brothers outlive predictions, forcing family to pay for care
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Everyone said Dwight and Debbie Eldred's
boys would be dead by now.
</P>
<P>
   But they've lived longer than the doctors predicted. Longer than
the actuaries and legislators and insurance companies and Medicaid
experts thought was possible. Long enough, the way Dwight Eldred
sees it, to commit an unpardonable bureaucratic sin:
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Jr. and Christopher have survived to ages 24 and 21 with
DuChene's Syndrome, a form of muscular dystrophy that weakens the
spine, curls the limbs and usually kills its victims by age 16.
Medical advances extended their lives, but insurance laws have not
kept up. As a result, the money needed to keep them alive is about
to run out. Medicaid coverage for Christopher's at-home care
expired last month. It ends for Dwight in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the unintended penalty for survival,'' said Kathi
Deakyne, director of Just For Kids, a private agency that provides
home nursing care to the Eldreds and other families. ``Unless
someone like Bill Gates reads this and decides he wants to pay for
care for the rest of their lives, they're basically out of luck. ``
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Eldreds _ with help from local agencies _ have
wrangled with the system to get the hundreds of thousands of
dollars needed to care for their boys. There is no more wrangling
to be done. To qualify for Medicaid coverage now, Dwight and
Christopher must move into a nursing home. There's no guarantee
they'd be placed locally, since Medicaid can choose whatever
facility has an open bed. But location isn't the problem, Debbie
says.
</P>
<P>
   Even the best nursing home can be a breeding ground for
respiratory infections that could kill her sons, she says. At home,
where the air is purified, their lungs and skin remain clear and
clean. Their nurses take pride in keeping infections at bay. Along
with exposing their weakening bodies to new germs, there are
questions about whether they could live in a communal facility
after spending all their lives at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would kill them,'' she says. ``Here, they have a reason to
wake every day.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dwight Jr., who attends classes at Palm Beach Community
College twice a week, waking is an ordeal in itself.
</P>
<P>
   He sleeps in a hospital bed in his family's living room. His
brother is in an identical bed nearby. Two hours before Dwight must
leave for school, his nurse, who sleeps on a sofa next to the
kitchen, rouses him and gives him an array of medicines meant to
compensate for his muscular atrophy. Heart medications.
Antibiotics. Diuretics. Drugs with sterile, menacing names such as
Minoxine and Lasix.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes breakfast. Dwight usually doesn't get enough vitamins
because he's too weak to chew, so a can of Ensure vitamin
supplement is part of the morning routine.
</P>
<P>
   Then the hole in his windpipe must be unhooked from the
ventilator next to his bed. The ventilator forces air into his
lungs, which are too weak to breathe round-the-clock without
assistance. He can be disconnected from the device no longer than
eight hours at a time. Without it, he would slowly suffocate.
</P>
<P>
   He is then carried to the bathroom to be bathed and dressed and
eventually placed in a motorized wheelchair. Dwight has lost the
ability to raise his hands, so he navigates the chair with deft
clicks of small, clothespin-like fingertip controls that rest next
to his legs on the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's time for either the nurse or his mother or his father
to suction excess fluids that gathered in his throat during the
night. The suction machine, a small box with a clear tube that is
snaked into his windpipe, makes an awful sound, something you'd
expect to hear in a dentist's office. But it's a lifesaving sound.
Without the machine, he'd literally drown.
</P>
<P>
   Then he must wait for another nurse to meet him at the house so
she can tend to him while at school. If fluid collects and blocks
his breathing, she will suction it in the hallway outside a
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Then a van equipped to take him in his bulky wheelchair arrives.
The Eldreds live on a dirt road near the South Florida Fairgrounds.
The van drivers, from a medical transport service, sometimes
mistake the address for one downtown. No van, no school.
</P>
<P>
   Once at the campus, Dwight and his nurse meet a note-taker hired
by the college. Dwight's hands, curled by the disease, are useless
for writing, so he relies on the note-taker and whatever he
remembers from lectures.
</P>
<P>
   His mind is sharp, but his body betrays him. During one
economics class, the teacher asks if anyone knows the answer to a
difficult formula. Dwight knows and tries to say it loud enough to
be heard. But when he's disconnected from his ventilator, sounds
are difficult to make because the air doesn't reach his voice box.
Not even his note-taker can hear the whispers coming from the hole
in his throat.
</P>
<P>
   With so many indignities in his life, this is little more than a
glancing blow, and Dwight's stubborn nature lets him deflect most
emotional wounds with grace and humor. He's even strong enough to
joke about his wheelchair: a ``South Park'' ``I Killed Kenny''
sticker adorns the left side.
</P>
<P>
   It's a love of laughter shared by his brother Christopher, who
is housebound because he needs the ventilator full time to keep him
breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher is ``harder to get to know,'' Deakyne says, ``but
once you've made that contact, you find out that he has a wicked
sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has a natural gift for music, and he uses his computer
to write songs _ ``techno crap,'' according to Dwight Sr., who is
in awe of his son's talent even if he doesn't share his tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got an amazing ear for music,'' his dad says. ``As a kid,
he'd hear music in the car and come home and be able to play it. At
five or six he could play Jimi Hendrix. I was, like, 'Whoa.'''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher also has many friends online, where he spends many
late-night hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a night owl,'' Deakyne says, ``so he's quiet during the
day. He saves his antics for 1 or 2 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   But lately Christopher has needed to use voice recognition
software to help him use the computer. He no longer has the
strength to type on a keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see the frustration in his eyes,'' Debbie says.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their circumstances, those who know the Eldreds are
impressed by the job they have done raising their boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents could have treated them with kid gloves and the
kids could have become demanding and difficult, but they're exactly
the opposite,'' Deakyne said. ``They're all gracious. It's
something you wouldn't expect given their circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dwight has patience,'' Debbie says. ``I get frustrated by
small things, but he's so calm.''
</P>
<P>
   But the inevitable _ death _ is not discussed in front of
outsiders. It's too much to think about when it's such a large
struggle to get through each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any parent is truly prepared,'' Deakyne said.
``Even in situations when they know from birth what will happen,
they intellectualize it right up until the moment it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubling the pain is the realization that one son will die
before the other. Whichever survives, he'll likely find it
extremely difficult to come face to face with his own mortality.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll witness their parents' grief and get a glimpse of what
their parents will endure once he goes too,'' Deakyne said.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight and Debbie were high school sweethearts in Canton, Ohio.
The week after they graduated Canton High School, they were
married.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Jr. was born about a year later. While she was pregnant
with Christopher, Dwight Jr. was diagnosed at age 3 with muscular
dystrophy after his parents noticed an odd rhythm to his gait and
his difficulty climbing stairs. The diagnosis was repeated after
Christopher was born. She was devastated but not surprised because
the disease ran in her family. Doctors said the boys would live to
age 16, tops. A third boy, Nicholas, was not stricken. He now
attends the University of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early years, hospitals and doctors and bills have
dominated the Eldreds' lives.
</P>
<P>
   Together 25 years, the couple has endured crises that would have
torn some marriages to shreds.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Dwight was driving a medical van when he crashed
through the wall of a restaurant, killing 85-year-old Jack Dean, a
nursing home patient Eldred was transporting to a kidney dialysis
session. Eldred had a blood-alcohol level of 0.24, three times the
legal limit.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted of DUI manslaughter and sentenced to eight years in
prison, Gov. Lawton Chiles and the Cabinet granted Eldred clemency
in 1996 so he could serve his term on house arrest and support his
family. Along with destroying Dean's family, Eldred's recklessness
devastated his own. Without his income, Debbie and the boys had no
option but to go on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight is now home and helps care for his sons, but his
regimented lifestyle, which includes random drug tests, family
counseling, weekly Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and public
speaking about the dangers of driving drunk, is a constant reminder
of his crime. If he is seen outside even helping his wife unload
groceries, he could be returned to prison. Work and home, that's
it. Any deviation _ even a stop at a convenience store for gas _
could violate his parole.
</P>
<P>
   With Dwight's license revoked for life, Debbie must drive him to
and from his job as an alcohol counselor. Each parent takes an
eight-hour shift caring for their boys. At night, a state-provided
nurse allows them time to sleep. On weekends, Debbie works as a
secretary at the Hanley Hazeldon drug and alcohol treatment center.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we're afraid of is that Debbie will wind up
in the grave before the boys do,'' Deakyne said. ``She's just so
tiny and yet she lifts the boys into their wheelchairs, in and out
of the tub, on and off the toilet. But they're both extremely
dedicated parents.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 11, Christopher turned 21. On that day, Medicaid
stopped paying for his home care because he qualified as an adult
and because his IQ is greater than 70. Now the Eldreds rely on an
emergency $50,000 granted by the state Children's Medical Services
agency the morning before benefits were due to expire. How long
that will last is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight's coverage had been due to expire when he turned 21. A
loophole in Medicaid rules allowed his money to continue until he
turned 25. Some of that assistance also was used to care for
Christopher. That source of money expires in June.
</P>
<P>
   After June, barring some unlikely legislative change, it will be
up to the Eldreds to provide total care. Dwight and Debbie say they
each will take a 12-hour shift. They haven't figured out yet how
Dwight will get to work or whether Debbie will work weekends or
where the thousands of dollars for medicine will come from.
</P>
<P>
   They are the first family to deal with such a deadline in the
area but they will not be the last, Deakyne said. She said
legislators have been slow to act and haven't anticipated what she
expects will be a huge surge in money needed to care for disabled
children who outlive expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' she said, ``children don't vote.''

 &HT;    Austin Powers costumes a Halloween hit
 &HT;    By Stephanie Allmon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Along with ``Trick or Treat'' this Halloween, expect
to hear plenty of, ``Groovy, Baby! Yeah!''
</P>
<P>
   According to Halloween costume retailers, ``shagadelic''
shoppers are snagging Austin Powers costumes faster than they can
say, ``Oh, Behaaaaaave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything having to do with Austin Powers is selling really
good,'' said Ashley Charles, manager of Halloween Bootique.
Although it's most popular with 20- to 30-year-olds, even children
are dressing up as the International Man of Mystery, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Halloween costume trends are often driven by popular movies, and
this year, ``Austin Powers is what people are asking for,'' said
Doris Fugate, owner of Custom Costumes.
</P>
<P>
   The whole costume _ the velvet leisure suit, lace ascot, shaggy
brown wig, crooked teeth and black wire-rimmed glasses _ can cost
$80-$85, Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   Other characters from the movie _ Dr. Evil, Mini-me and Felicity
Shagwell _ are also going to be popular, costume shop owners said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of movie trends, retailers had expected sales of ``Star
Wars'' costumes to be astronomical, but so far, they haven't taken
off, Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Logan, manager of The Card and Party Factory, said the
store's home office began buying costumes at the beginning of the
year, before the release of ``Star Wars: Episode One.'' So far, he
said, Darth Maul, Queen Amidala, Anakin Skywalker and Jar Jar Binks
have been more popular with children than with adults.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road at Toys R Us, ``the Pokeman craze has hit,''
manager Carol Archie said. ``(Pokeman costumes) don't stay on
shelves that long.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pokeman costume consists of a foam rubber head and a
jumpsuit for the body, Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   But kids still love to be action figures for Halloween, with
Superman and Batman flying ahead of the pack each year.
</P>
<P>
   Action figure has a new meaning in 1999 now that WWF wrestling
and NASCAR racing are more popular than ever, Archie said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps to the dismay of some parents, costumes of pro-wrestler
Stone Cold Steve Austin are seeing a lot of sales action this
Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   And they may not have cars or even drivers licenses, but many
kids also want to dress up as NASCAR drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The world of music usually creates a trend or two in Halloween
costumes, with Madonna as the traditional fall-back '80s rocker
costume. Last year, little girls and teen-age girls were content to
be Spice Girls. This year, Kiss masks are flying off the racks,
Logan said.
</P>
<P>
   As far as masks go, ``the more gory, the better they sell,''
Charles said. She said masks and costumes from the ``Scream''
movies have also been good sellers. And back for a second year are
the Monica Lewinsky mask and cigar-smoking Bill Clinton mask.
Although parents can dress their children head-to-toe in
pre-packaged costumes that can often cost $20-$40, Halloween is the
one time of year when many busy mothers dust off their sewing
machines, said Judith Lusk, professor of home economics at Baylor
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I've been in fabric stores, I have seen mothers and
children choosing what they'd like to become,'' Lusk said. ``It
allows a mother and child to embrace the creative in both of them
and come up with costumes. The mothers are making sure the children
have that kind of experience with creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet may help busier people choose and buy costumes
this year.
</P>
<P>
   On such sites as www.every
</P>
<P>
   thinghalloween.com and www.coachhousegifts.com, shoppers can buy
costumes and props, get creative costume ideas and even post
questions about costumes.
</P>
<P>
   Fugate said no matter the costume craze, some people always take
more time in assembling Halloween costumes, while others know
exactly what they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's choice is different from the next person's,'' she
said.

 &HT;    Thriller baits secular hook to fish for souls
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When the Christian film industry makes
an evangelical film, it usually does pretty well _ with evangelical
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   But the
hit-them-over-the-head-with-Jesus-until-they-see-the-light-genre
hasn't worked as well with the vast swath of Americans who go to
the movies purely to be entertained.
</P>
<P>
   So when Stephan Blinn set out to write the screenplay for the
evangelical Christian thriller ``The Omega Code,'' which opened
Friday, he knew he had to walk a fine line between secular
storytelling and proselytizing. His hope is that the
action-adventure will hold together on its secular merits _ and if
it provokes some conversation about what's in the Bible, so much
the better.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude is gaining in the world of evangelical film
production, where function has often preceded form and doomed films
such as ``The Joyriders'' to early box-office graves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to make a film that would appeal to a secular
audience with the thought that we are planting a seed,'' Blinn
said. ``We want people to leave the film and say, 'Hey I didn't
know that was in the Bible. I need to pick that up and read it for
myself.'''
</P>
<P>
   Televangelist, Trinity Broadcasting Network founder and
president and executive producer of ``The Omega Code,'' Paul Crouch
is less circumspect. In a publicity package sent to clergy and
media, Crouch urges pastors to use the film as a teaching tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went generations letting the devil have the silver screen,
letting our enemy use it for the wrong purpose,'' Crouch said.
``Only lately have a few of us gotten ahold of this milieu and
said, `Let's make it work for the gospel. Let's make it win souls
instead of sending people to perdition.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Omega Code'' is a good vs. evil morality tale that roughly
follows the books of Daniel and Revelations, with some extra
special effects thrown in for good measure. The characters are all
essentially misguided, Blinn says, driven either by career
ambition, New Age philosophy, or a desire for power.
</P>
<P>
   The main character, Dr. Gillem Lane (played by Casper Van Dien
of ``The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'' and ``Starship Troopers''), is a
sort of square-jawed Everyman who works as a motivational speaker
and is eventually hired by Stone Alexander, the European Union
chairman (played by Michael York, of ``Austin Powers'' and ``The
Three Musketeers''). The story turns when Lane realizes his boss is
a megalomaniac who is trying to take control of a code that can
uncover the prophecies in the Bible and use them to dominate the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say even though the millennium is a good time
to offer an evangelical message to a mainstream audience, losses
within the genre in the past have made producers wary.
</P>
<P>
   Take ``The Joyriders,'' for instance. The Evangelical film,
released this spring, starred Kris Kristofferson and Academy Award
winner Martin Landau. Bankrolled by born-again millionaire Norm
Miller, the movie reportedly cost more than $5 million to produce
but grossed only $250,000 in its first month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Omega Code'' reportedly cost $8.5 million _ about
three-quarters of which was covered by TBN. The network also kicked
in another $3 million in free advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Said Todd McCarthy, chief film critic for Variety magazine:
``It's easy to blow millions and never catch the public's interest.
But the audience doesn't want to have someone's message stuffed
down their throat, so (an evangelical movie) has to be really slick
if it's going to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   To reach both secular and Christian audiences, producers hired
two marketing companies. The movie is opening in 350 cinemas
(compared with about 2,000 for the ``Star Wars'' prequel) in places
where the demographics favor an evangelical message. Those markets
were determined by taking the film into areas that have the most
donors to the TBN. Florida, Texas and California came out on top.
</P>
<P>
   The movie does not contain swearing or nudity, but received a
PG-13 rating for violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violent things happened in the Book of Revelations,'' Blinn
said. ``There's no way to get around that.''

 &HT;    Innocent-as-cop story has poignant moments
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Combine the frat boy craziness of
``Beverly Hills, 90210'' with the gritty realism of ``NYPD Blue''
and what do you get?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan Caulfield: Year One,'' a surprisingly tender, though
totally predictable cop drama. Ryan Caulfield (Sean Maher) is a
19-year-old rookie cop patrolling Philadelphia's toughest streets.
That means instead of getting hammered with college buddies at dorm
parties, Ryan's in the middle of deadly shootouts. No wonder his
friends thinks he's crazy for turning down a college scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   At 19, the boyish-looking Ryan doesn't look much like a cop.
When he's not chasing bad guys, he likes playing video games and
rolling in the mud with his friends. Hey, didn't you roll in the
mud when you were 19? Ryan even lives at home with his mom and has
G.I. Joes in his room. But that's the point. We're supposed to see
what it's like being a cop through a rookie's eyes. (But G.I.
Joes?) And most of the time those eyes are... scared. Ryan
nervously swallows hard before entering an apartment. He asks his
veteran partner Susser (``The Sopranos''' Michael Rispoli), ``What
should we do?'' And when a low-life gets popped in front of him, a
stunned Ryan says, ``It's not like you see in the movies. It's not
like what they tell you in the academy. It's not real unless you
smell it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan Caulfield: Year One'' certainly won't win any awards for
being the most original cop drama. All of the cop cliches we've
seen countless times are played out here. The seasoned partner
schooling the new cop, drug busts gone bad, gut-wrenching
slow-motion shots _ that sort of thing.
</P>
<P>
   But as the scared rookie, Maher is totally believable and
achingly earnest. He looks like Ray Liotta's younger brother. He
also has the same honey-dripped voice during his many voiceovers.
Maher is helped by a strong supporting cast, including Rispoli as
the world-weary cop and Clifton Powell as a hard-nosed lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   While Ryan has a girlfriend, he's already making goo-goo eyes at
a fellow rookie cop (Roselyn Sanchez) who's a Sandra Bullock
lookalike. If ``Ryan Caulfield: Year One,'' makes it to ``Ryan
Caulfield: Week Five,'' you can bet Ryan and that Sandra
Bullock-looking chick will be ripping off each other's bulletproof
vests.

BOSTON CURSES THE CURSE, HOPES AGAINST HOPE AND BEGS FOR TICKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Consider it the ultimate pompom waving of the cultural
elite: Seiji Ozawa, who has conducted the city's acclaimed symphony
orchestra for 27 years, plans to bring his black-clad virtuosos to
Fenway Park on Saturday to play the anthem among the crimson hose
and pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting 40 years for them to go all the way,''
Ozawa, an unreconstructed Red Sox fanatic since he came here from
Japan in 1960, said Friday. ``They've made it this far. They have
to go all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds like a plaintive note of hope-against-hope in
Ozawa's voice, he was in harmony with much of this Sox-mad city.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is well practiced in sports fever, particularly in this
year of the Ryder Cup and the All-Star Game, and all the customary
ticket-finagling, hotel-room-begging and minor mass hysteria of
major sports events have been at work in these frenetic moments
before the third Yankees-Red Sox play-off game opens on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But there was also a special bittersweet tinge to the obsession
sweeping the city, as hapless Bostonians struggled with the baggage
of past disappointments dating back to 1918, the last time the Red
Sox won the World Series. It did not help that the Sox had lost the
first two play-off games against the Yankees, either.
</P>
<P>
   James Stevens, a born-and-bred Bostonian of 48, said Friday that
he believed in all seriousness that the Red Sox had been cursed
ever since they sold Babe Ruth to New York some 70 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something,'' he said, looking skyward. ``God, I don't
know what we did, but please lift it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' he added, ``we should go and dig up Babe Ruth and
put him in Fenway.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Teitell, a humor columnist for The Boston Herald, lectured
Bostonians as would a therapist working on a woman who loves too
much: ``You say you can stop caring at any time,'' she wrote.
``Please. Look at yourself. Up late for the last three game days.
Wearing the same `lucky' underpants for an entire week.''
</P>
<P>
   It is time, she mock-chided, ``to stop enabling them.'' She
continued: ``Stop rewarding them with unquestioning love and
support for disappointing you.''
</P>
<P>
   But passion for the Red Sox runs so deep and wide here that
baseball seems to penetrate every corner of the city's life lately,
from screaming fights overheard in restaurant kitchens over whether
the Sox could win, to speculation by state political analysts that
the public was too Sox-mad to give a hoot about the budget, to
television weather reports focused mainly on predictions for
game-time, to women in health-club locker rooms discussing their
husbands' emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   Among local media, it is probably the tabloid Boston Herald that
has most abandoned all restraint, emblazoning ``We Hate N.Y.''
across its front page and calling New York in one column: ``The
city that never sleeps. Or bathes.'' But local television was only
too happy to chime in with elementary schoolers chanting ``We are
number one'' and a little boy who declared he'd like to throw out
his baseball signed by Roger Clemens but, with a grimace, ``My Mom
says it's valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the purely concrete effects of the convergence
of unscheduled cap-wearing masses on the city. Many hoteliers, are
already fully booked for the foliage season, yet are suddenly
facing waves of calls from longtime customers seeking rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball, y'know!'' said the unapologetic clerk at the
undistinguished Howard Johnson's hotel right near Fenway Park, when
asked why rooms there, which usually cost between $145 and $210 a
night, were suddenly going for $325.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm overwhelmed,'' lamented Robin Brown, general manager of
the Four Seasons Hotel. ``I haven't eaten in two days and I cannot
get up out of my chair without taking calls from people who want
rooms. Calls from all over the country and a lot from New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The hotel was fully booked, he said, ``and when you're that sold
out, and all of your best friends in the world call, and all the
relationships the hotel has spent years building are dependent on
finding a room, what you do is magical, mystical.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have been depending on magic as well; on Tuesday, about
200 people gathered outside Fenway Park hoping that some tickets
might go on sale, until the police insisted they leave.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game ``is definitely the most difficult ticket Boston
has seen,'' said Patrick B. Moscaritolo, president of the Greater
Boston Convention and Visitors Bureau. ``I'm afraid even some of
the people on the A list aren't going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the city as a whole could reap a bonanza from the games,
Moscaritolo said. If Boston hosts three games _ the two this
weekend for sure, and a third on Monday if the Sox are not shut out
_ it could see as much as $10 million in extra spending.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Boston is so riveted to the games that John Spence,
who sings in the band ``Common Street Trash,'' said the group could
not perform on Thursday night until the last out; there would have
been no audience. Radio hosts joke about the difficult choice faced
by expectant fathers whose wives may deliver during game time.
</P>
<P>
   That is not so funny to Sheldon Cohen, general manager of the
Sports Depot bar and restaurant in the Allston section of town. He
has tickets to the game Monday night. Monday is also his second
wedding anniversary, and his wife, who is seven months pregnant, is
not a big baseball fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting the old, `Oh, you can go, I don't mind,''' he
said. ``So what am I going to do? I'm going to give my tickets to
somebody else, do the right thing and not be miserable the rest of
my life.''

`GREED' IS GOOD: AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT THE NETWORKS THINK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's aptly titled, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greed'' is the newest prime-time TV game show, unless another
has popped up in the past hour or so.
</P>
<P>
   Greed is also the reason the hit-desperate networks are
scrambling to invent big-money quiz shows for an audience always
game for something new and on the odd side.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that and fear.
</P>
<P>
   Before ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' sent the industry
into shock by luring millions of viewers every night for two weeks
in August, prime-time network viewers hadn't seen them outside
syndicated programming in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Millionaire'' and its host, Regis Philbin, set to return
Nov. 7 for the all-important sweeps, when networks and local
stations dress up programming to influence advertising rates, the
other major networks are frantically piecing together game-show
concepts or putting contemporary spins on vintage ones. How far
will they go? CBS is betting on ``Survivor!,'' a program that
strands contestants on a remote island, promising $1 million to the
last one standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get out there as fast as possible,'' said Mike
Darnell, head producer of Fox's reality programming. ``Once five or
six of these are on the air, they won't be as special. In being
second in the market, we could still make an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   What Fox and every other network have planned is as spectacular
as you'd expect in a business where bigger really is considered
better.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is doubling the winnings of ``Millionaire'' to $2 million
for a show that shrewdly and shamelessly exploits our current state
of Jerry Springer abrasiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greed,'' slated for consecutive Thursdays beginning Nov. 7, if
the network can meet that fast-approaching deadline, will send a
much-hyped Fox show based on that very principle to the bench for
the month. The poor-performing comedy ``Action,'' about a heartless
film producer, is being shelved, as is the animated ``Family Guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Greed'' is the type of show that the fictional Peter
Dragon would watch on his time off. It will feature teams in a
``Family Feud''-type question-and-answer setting. But as stakes
rise, teammates are encouraged to turn on one another, freezing out
the people who helped them in order to take most, or all, of the
really big money. If no one wins one night, $100,000 is added to
the next week's pot, which could conceivably grow into millions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor!,'' a reworking of a show that's an international
sensation, is matching ``Millionaire's'' payoff but upping the ante
in drama. The concept involves 16 ``castaways'' on Pulau Tiga, an
island off Malaysia's Borneo coast. The group is whittled down by
secret ballot, with members voting every three days to expel a
fellow contestant. When the final two contestants are left, those
most recently voted out of the game will decide who wins.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, they are being asked to survive physically and thrive
socially on an island populated only by wildlife and a TV camera
crew hoping that something bizarre occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Not that something hasn't already. In a 1997 Swedish version of
the show, the first contestant who was asked to leave the island
committed suicide by jumping in front of a train a month after
returning home.
</P>
<P>
   The widow of Sinisa Savija told a Swedish newspaper that her
husband felt humiliated and became depressed after being the first
one kicked out by his team. Producers of the show, called
``Expedition Robinson,'' have denied any link between Savija's show
experiences and the suicide. CBS has said that contestants will
have criminal, medical and psychological background evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor!,'' scheduled to air in the summer, has been
teasingly referred to as ``The Real World's'' dramatic friction
crossed with ``Gilligan's Island's'' stranded-in-nowhere appeal,
and it's an accurate description.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the people selected, ``Survivor!'' is the kind of
strange-but-true undertaking that could lure the curious in droves.
At least initially.
</P>
<P>
   But with CBS ordering six episodes of a souped-up version of the
vintage ``What's My Line?'' and the classic ``The $64,000
Question,'' and NBC working on a remake of ``Twenty-One,'' the
genre may be oversaturated by the time ``Survivor!'' arrives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imitation is the sincerest form of television,'' says John R.
Rash, senior vice president and director of broadcast negotiations
for Campbell Mithun Esty, an advertising agency. He warns that the
newcomers risk diluting the audience not only for the other new
shows but perhaps even for syndicated shows already airing.
</P>
<P>
   A similar barrage helped halt the game-show run 30 years ago,
after the genre peaked in the late '50s and early '60s.
Well-publicized scandals merely contributed to pushing the shows
off a cliff.
</P>
<P>
   First a staple on radio, game shows like ``The $64,000
Question'' spawned a number of imitators in the mid-'50s, including
its own spinoff. ``The $64,000 Challenge'' offered ``Question''
alumni the chance to win even more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Tell the Truth,'' ``The Price Is Right,'' ``Keep Talking''
and ``Twenty-One'' triggered viewers' money-hungry glands with a
variety of lavish prizes (even losers sometimes won; runners-up on
``The $64,000 Question'' are said to have received Cadillacs).
</P>
<P>
   In the late '50s, though, a former contestant on the game show
``Dotto'' confessed to receiving answers beforehand; then Herbert
Stempel outlined his elaborate coaching on ``Twenty-One,'' igniting
a wide-ranging scandal involving intellectual golden boy Charles
Van Doren. The scandal, in which 10 people were convicted of
perjury, was introduced to a new generation with the 1994 film
``Quiz Show.''
</P>
<P>
   During the '60s and '70s, game shows such as ``The Joker's
Wild'' and ``Tic Tac Dough'' were relegated to daytime hours and
designed to be either cerebral or inane, to keep them above
suspicion. The joke was that contestants would have needed special
coaching to answer questions incorrectly. Currently, game shows can
be found in syndication and on The Game Show cable network.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the first of this new batch of game shows
experienced not a scandal but at least an embarrassment when it
goofed over a question worth, coincidentally, $64,000. David Honea
of Raleigh, N.C., correctly answered that Lake Huron is the second
largest Great Lake after Lake Superior but was told he was wrong
and sent home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire,'' which heightens the drama by having host
Philbin and a contestant sit facing each other while a live studio
audience gasps at every answer, later admitted its mistake. The
show apologized and invited Honea back to add to his $32,000
winnings
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, this renewed interest in prime-time game shows has
everything to do with the success of ``Millionaire,'' which was the
top-rated program during the last three nights of its run,
delivering a peak of 21 million viewers. (That's how many viewers a
new episode of ``Friends'' attracted two weeks ago.)
</P>
<P>
   But the $64,000 question now is whether ``Millionaire,'' or any
of the newcomers, will attract large audiences at a time when the
networks are airing glitzy miniseries, movies and ``special''
episodes of series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire'' received its huge ratings against summer reruns.
``Is that a concern?'' Fox's Darnell said. ``I don't know. We've
been really busy. We haven't gotten to that yet.''

 &HT;    Minister: Bible has place for gays
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Does the Bible say that homosexuality is a sin?
</P>
<P>
   A slew of books _ scholarly and otherwise _ have been written to
support both sides of this issue. But the Rev. Samuel Kader's book
brings something new to the argument: The perspective of a man who
is both gay and a member of the clergy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted this book to have the focus of ministry,'' says
Kader, pastor of Community Gospel Church in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Openly Gay, Openly Christian: How the Bible Really is Gay
Friendly'' (Leyland Publications, $15.95), Kader argues that
scripture commonly cited as proof that the Bible condemns
homosexuality are misreadings, at best, used by blatant homophobics
or by people who have a sincere intention to help homosexuals ``get
right with God.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the story of the city of Sodom is viewed by many
Christians as God's condemnation of homosexuality. A group of gay
men threatens to rape two visitors who have come to Lot's home in
Sodom. God saves Lot and his family, but rains burning sulfur on
the city, killing all its ungodly inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   In Genesis 19:4, the men of Sodom circle Lot's house and say to
him, ``Where are the men which came in to thee this night? Bring
them out unto us, that we may know them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kader argues that the verb ``to know,'' can mean ``to know
carnally,'' but it can also mean ``to be acquainted with.'' Later,
Lot offers the crowd his daughters instead, saying ``you can do
what you like with them.'' Why would Lot offer his daughters to a
crowd of gay men, Kader asks.
</P>
<P>
   His book sets out to deconstruct anti-gay interpretations of
other biblical passages, such as Leviticus 18:22: ``Do not lie with
a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.''
</P>
<P>
   He makes his points in a readable manner, using ``Strong's
Concordance,'' a book that alphabetically lists and defines words
in the Bible based on their original Greek and Hebrew meanings.
It's a reference that anybody can use and that's the point. Kader
doesn't want his argument obscured by layers of scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Farmer, an Old Testament professor at United
Theological Seminary, has not read Kader's book, and she warns that
``the whole area of Biblical interpretation depends upon the
assumptions you come with.''
</P>
<P>
   But she is familiar with the Biblical passages commonly used to
support the argument that homosexuality is wrong. Of the story of
Sodom, she supports Kader's view that the use of the verb ``to
know'' is ambiguous. ``There is no way of knowing from the text''
which meaning the author intended. But a clue is offered in Ezekiel
16:49, in which the word of God is being delivered to Israel. Sodom
is described as having done ``abominable things,'' the worst of
which appears to be ``injustice to the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Kader, 48, founded the Community Gospel Church in 1986. It has
20 members, not all of whom are gay. But it is what he calls a
``reconciling church,'' a term that describes a ministry that
reaches out to those who have been hurt by churches in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Raised a Roman Catholic, he was swept up in the charismatic
Christian movement, ``But I was unable to accept Christian doctrine
from heterosexuals. I knew they had a hidden agenda. If they knew I
was gay, they wouldn't accept me.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other gay Christians, he tried to change his sexual
orientation through prayer, fasting and the laying on of hands.
Finally, a friend told him, ``Any God who made you won't condemn
you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what started me on my journey with God,'' Kader says.
``I knew I was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   He received his call to ministry in 1976. Ministering to gays,
and to heterosexuals who have misconceptions about gays is his
ministry, he says. ``Many people say they're ex-gay to get the
affirmation of a traditional Christian church. But I'm the one who
gets the phone call in the middle of the night from people saying,
'I can't live this way anymore.'''

DAVID CONE: `STABLE INFLUENCE' ON THE YANKEE MOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The closer he gets to the December of his career, the
more he savors his Octobers. David Cone tells himself every
postseason to take none of it for granted, that it isn't going to
last forever, that he and the New York Yankees never made any
until-death-does-them-part arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   He just never understood the wisdom of his admonitions.
</P>
<P>
   And how little he meant the part about one day giving up
Octobers in pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year I think I can honestly say, `This may be my last
chance to pitch in the playoffs for the Yankees,''' Cone said.
``Now, more than ever, I realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   The realization has been hounding Cone for weeks, casting a pall
over a season that could have been so gratifying. At 36, Cone
became the second-oldest pitcher to throw a perfect game. He
pitched in his fifth All-Star game. He finished with the lowest
earned-run average (3.44) of any American League pitcher not named
Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night at Yankee Stadium, Cone had to leave his worries
and insecurities behind him. Cone took the mound for Game 2 of the
AL Championship Series against the Boston Red Sox feeling strong,
feeling rested. He hadn't pitched in 12 days, giving him plenty of
time to contemplate the sort of things that pitchers do when
they're his age and are overdue on their 2,500-inning checkup.
</P>
<P>
   How much does someone with 180 career victories and arm
operations have left? How could somebody with so much pitching
know-how struggle so mightily during the stretch run? Would the
Yankees decide that Cone hasn't done enough for them lately to make
him a part of their plans after this season?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sort of at a crossroads,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Cone just made it a lot harder for the Yankees to move on
without him. Lest anybody have forgotten what a big-game hunter
Cone is, he provided an emphatic reminder in a 3-2 victory against
the Red Sox. Cone out-dueled Red Sox right-hander Ramon Martinez,
sparing the Yankees of the daunting prospect of a tied series and
the best pitcher in the Martinez family lurking.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 57,180 cheered Cone through seven innings of
seven-hit, two-run, nine-strikeout craftsmanship. Yankees manager
Joe Torre had to Rolodex his way through four relievers to get the
next three outs before turning over the ninth inning to Mariano
Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Cone and the Yankees have been constants in the past five
postseasons. When Cone joined the Yankees in July of 1995, he had
the reputation as a hired gun who couldn't tie himself down with
allegiances. Have arm, will travel to highest bidder or neediest
contender. Cone has re-upped with the Yankees twice since then.
</P>
<P>
   Given the leverage of a 20-7 record last season, Cone settled
for a one-year contract just so he could stay and help the Yankees
defend their World Series title. The Yankees anted up $8 million
plus incentives, but Cone could have gotten a multiyear deal
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't done a good job of controlling my emotions down the
stretch,'' Cone said. ``I've let a lot of little things bother me.
I've just got to come to the point where I put all those issues to
the side for now. How do you do it? I don't know. I haven't been
very good at it to this point. I've got to find a way to just
forget about all the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let a big year get away from me. I really thought I should
have pitched better in the second half. I took the one-year deal
with the Yankees in order to stay here, and now I find myself in a
position of uncertainty. It's nobody's fault. It is what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   What it was on July 18 was absolutely perfect. Twenty-seven
Montreal Expos came up, 27 went down, on only 88 pitches. Cone's
record at that point was 10-4. His ERA was 2.65. He went 2-5 with a
4.82 ERA in his final 13 regular-season starts. At one point, Cone
went eight consecutive starts without a victory _ the longest
drought of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confidence is a fleeting thing even among veterans and guys
who have had success,'' Cone said. ``There were times in the second
half where I did have some self-doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   If any of those doubts accompanied Cone to the mound, he hid
them well. Cone got a big break when Jason Varitek lashed a drive
off the top of the right-field wall _ missing a home run by inches
_ with one out in the second. Triple. That piece of luck wouldn't
have done Cone any good if he hadn't skillfully maneuvered out of
the jam. With the infield drawn in, Cone got Darren Lewis to lunge
at an off-speed pitch and pop weakly to short. Trot Nixon flied to
right, ending that threat.
</P>
<P>
   The only blemish was Nomar Garciaparra's two-out, two-run homer
in the fifth. Cone bought the Yankees time to come back from a 2-1
deficit by hanging tough through the sixth, through the seventh,
all the way to his 128th and final pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``David was sensational,'' Torre said. ``I always love looking
up and seeing him. He has been such a stable influence on the
pitching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cone has been around enough not to be naive about the
business of baseball. Traded four times. Former Cy Young winner and
high-ticket free agent. Active member of the Players Association.
Whether or not he spends any more Octobers in a Yankees uniform
isn't entirely in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't hurt,'' Cone said. ``It's just harsh reality
setting in. I think I've proven I've got some life left. There's no
guarantee where it's going to be.''

THE SOUNDS OF MUSIC LIVE ON IN STRADIVARI'S HOMETOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL NUCKOLS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CREMONA, Italy _ If you don't hear music in Cremona, you're not
listening.
</P>
<P>
   Opera, chamber music, movie music, even Celtic music _ you can
hear all of them in this small city 75 miles southeast of Milan.
</P>
<P>
   But the violin reigns. For Cremona was the home of Antonio
Stradivari, maker of the most renowned violins the world has known.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1666, when he finished his apprenticeship to Niccolo
Amati, until his death in 1737, Stradivari made more than 1,000
violins and other stringed instruments. But it is the violin for
which the great master is most famed. His innovations, including
decreasing the arch of the top of the violin and altering the sound
holes, might sound like overly technical and perhaps irrelevant
details to the average listener, but the changes improved the tone
and projection of the instrument. Stradivari's instruments are
still revered as the ultimate.
</P>
<P>
   Stradivari's hometown, a 1 1/4-hour train ride from Milan, is an
easily reached destination for aficionados of the stringed
instrument that many believe sounds most like the human voice.
</P>
<P>
   Instruments by Stradivari and his predecessors in the Cremonese
violin-making tradition _ members of the Amati and Guarneri
families _ are on view in the Sala dei Violini in the Palazzo
Comunale (Municipal Palace).
</P>
<P>
   The Museo Stradivariano (Stradivari Museum) contains none of the
1,000-plus instruments made by the great master. But on display are
other instruments, including such oddities as a 19th-century violin
constructed in the shape of an eighth note, and tools and patterns
for the violins, violas, cellos and other stringed instruments
Stradivari made.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there are paper patterns for cutting out bridges,
scrolls and f-holes (sound holes); calipers for measuring the
thickness of the top or back of an instrument; and scrapers for
shaping the wood.
</P>
<P>
   Violin making hasn't changed much since the golden era of the
mid-16th through the mid-18th centuries, says Bruce Carlson, an
American who makes and restores instruments in the Cremonese studio
of Carlson Cacciatori Neumann.
</P>
<P>
   ``The violin was perfected in the 1500s, and it is still
essentially the same instrument,'' he says. A computer might be
able to measure the thickness of the wood, but ``in the final
analysis, it's a question of experience. Your sensitivity, your own
feeling about what you're doing are very important.''
</P>
<P>
   When Carlson is planing the wood for the top of a violin, for
instance, ``the sensation of how the wood is _ hard, soft, mushy _
tells me what I have to do to this piece of wood.'' The violin's
curved top and back are carved, not pressed, into shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very complex instrument. There are so many variables,''
Carlson says. ``Until you've strung up the instrument, you never
really know how it sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes approximately 200 hours to make a violin or viola,
twice that for a cello, says Carlson, who came to Cremona to study
at the Scuola di Luteria (violin-making school) and stayed. He and
his colleagues sell mostly to violin dealers, but also to
violinists who visit Cremona in search of a fine modern instrument.
Prices run from around $10,000 for a violin to $20,000 for a cello.
Most world-famous soloists prefer older instruments, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson considers Cremona an ideal place for a violin maker to
work. ``It's very inspiring knowing that these makers were here,''
he says. And it's not just the musical tradition. Dating more than
2,200 years, when it was a Roman colony, Cremona is permeated with
history and art.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the duomo (cathedral), construction of which began in
1107. Though not as big as Milan's famous duomo, it confers just as
much of a sense of height and grandeur. It contains bright
16th-century frescoes; elaborate altars; an enormous 15th-century
silver cross; a 13th-century rose window; and a floor laid in pink,
black and white marble squares. Looming over the cathedral is the
campanile (bell tower), built between 1267 and 1305.
</P>
<P>
   The entire town glows with charm and sophistication, a contrast
between old and new. Red brick buildings are interspersed with
others of umber or a peachy terra-cotta stucco, adorned with iron
grillwork and brown shutters and topped with red tile roofs.
</P>
<P>
   Some townspeople ride bicycles, but the late 20th century also
intrudes: A bus from the train station takes travelers past
sophisticated shops displaying Italian fashions and avant-garde
home furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the church where Stradivari was buried no longer stands
(his body and those of others interred there were moved); in its
place is a city park. And on the site of his home, across the
street from the church, a McDonald's stands.
</P>
<P>
   But Stradivari's statue holds court in the piazza in front of
the duomo, and his spirit lives on in the instruments crafted by
his hand.

   General Electric's Tribute To the Master Inventor &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As he nears the end of his career, Jack Welch is returning to
General Electric's roots. He has agreed to raise $80 million to
preserve historic sites associated with Thomas Alva Edison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, GE should be heavily involved in this campaign,''
Welch said last week, ``because several of GE's modern businesses,
including lighting, power generation and industrial systems,
essentially were invented by Edison.'' The Edison General Electric
Co. merged with the Thomas-Houston Co. to form GE in 1892.
</P>
<P>
   As if all his inventions weren't enough, Edison has come to be
revered as the founder of modern technological enterprise _ the
first techie-turned-business-baron.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Welch gave $5 million on behalf of GE to preserve
Edison's laboratories in West Orange, N.J., and his home nearby. &QL;

   Ebit Wachner, the Yorkshire terrier belonging to Linda J.
Wachner, the boss of both Warnaco and Authentic Fitness, would be
the first to benefit if Ms. Wachner's plans for merging the two
companies went through. Ms. Wachner said last week that she would
use her $47.9 million proceeds from the deal to further cancer
research and to buy Ebit a new collar.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparently paw-written note to a reporter on Ebit
Wachner's personalized stationery, signed with a paw print, Ebit
herself expressed appreciation last week for the publicity given
these plans, adding, ``Now I'm certain to get my new collar on
time.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Steven A. Ballmer, the president of Microsoft, may not be quite
as wealthy as Bill Gates, his boss and college classmate, nor have
his philanthropic endeavors been followed in anywhere near as much
detail. But he recently gained all the attention anyone could want
when his comments about a ``gold rush'' mentality in
high-technology stocks drove down the market, trimming his personal
stake in the company by $1.2 billion in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   As for his donations, one of the chief beneficiaries so far has
been Harvard University. (He graduated in 1977, while Gates
famously dropped out.)
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ballmer returned to Harvard for the dedication of the
Maxwell Dworkin building, a center for computer science and
electrical engineering. He and Gates together donated $25 million
in 1996 for the building _ bearing the maiden names of Gates's and
Ballmer's mothers, respectively _ and a new professorship.
</P>
<P>
   At the dedication, Ballmer put in a backhanded plug for his
school: ``I hope the building and the new faculty help make Harvard
as much a center of computer science as MIT is a center of computer
science,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Harvard Crimson, Ballmer questioned students
about Microsoft's image and how it could be improved among young
people. Showing off a computer program that, with the click of a
mouse on a Microsoft media player, could easily edit a video of a
two-hour Seattle Mariners game to about five minutes of action, he
said the real innovations of the computer age were still to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really just at the beginning of the Internet
revolution,'' he said. _Sam Howe Verhovek &QL;

   At age 7, most of us were doing well enough if we could add and
subtract. Richard K. Anderson Jr. has already rung the opening bell
at the New York Stock Exchange (while still in kindergarten), and
testified before Congress, the youngest person to do either.
</P>
<P>
   At a Manhattan conference next Saturday, H. Carl McCall, the New
York State Comptroller, plans to give him and his father, Richard
K. Anderson Sr., what McCall calls the ``Empower Your Future
Award'' to honor their role in promoting savings and investments.
</P>
<P>
   The father has a financial planning and money management firm,
Anderson Financial Services, in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Young Richard, a second grader, has learned from his father
about stocks, bonds and mutual funds, and how, in interviews, to
say things like, ``If you don't save, you're going to have to work
for a long time, and nobody likes that.'' Anderson says his son
began taking to finance as a 3-year-old, when he was made to watch
CNBC as a punishment instead of cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson says they are intent on promoting investment and
financial security, particularly among black people.

RUSSIA SAYS ITS TROOPS HAVE MOVED FARTHER INTO CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Markedly expanding their operations in the rebellious
republic of Chechnya, Russian troops have crossed a strategic river
and apparently control a ridge from which they could bombard the
airport and suburbs of the capital, Grozny, Chechen officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the Russian Defense Ministry confirmed that their
troops had crossed the Terek River, which roughly divides
Chechnya's ethnically Russian north from the predominantly Islamic
south.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Chechen president, Aslan Maskhadov, said
Russian artillery and other vehicles are trying to occupy the
highlands south of the Terek, 15 to 20 miles north of Grozny, so
that ``long-range artillery can control Grozny's northern and
northwestern outskirts and the airport.''
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said Chechen troops were seeking to repulse the
Russians, but no details were available.
</P>
<P>
   The Interfax news service quoted Russian military officials as
saying that the offensive would continue until they were confident
that Chechen fighters could not break into a so-called security
zone that the Russians have established in the north.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Russian ambitions extend further was not clear. Other
reports have suggested that the Russians plan an assault on Grozny
itself. Russian artillery and jets virtually leveled the city in
1996 in a secessionist war that ended in a debacle for Moscow, and
it is not known whether Russian troops, emboldened by their success
this time, have the appetite for a rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials have said they are fighting a smarter war
than in 1996, having learned that they must coordinate troop
movements more closely and use their resources more efficiently.
And in fact Russian troops generally seemed to have performed
better than in the last conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chechnya is so dangerous that few journalists have been
able to report personally on the war, and officials of both sides
often give distorted views of their forces' successes and failures.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian offensive began last month with a plan to cordon off
the Chechen border with Dagestan, the republic to the east where
fighting originally broke out in August when Islamic militants from
Chechnya tried to extend their influence to the Caspian Sea. But
Moscow's ambitions have expanded as Russian troops have moved
successfully onto Chechnya.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Russian military aides quoted by Interfax said troops would
try to solidify their command of occupied areas by scouring towns
for terrorists and mercenaries.
</P>
<P>
   The aides said counterterrorist operations would be mounted
against ``several hundred mercenaries who have arrived in Chechnya
from Moslem countries, CIS states, and Russia itself.'' CIS, the
Commonwealth of Independent States, is made up of nations that were
part of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians estimate publicly that they face some 25,000
Chechen troops, adding that 8,000 of them come from the armed gangs
that rule much of Chechnya outside the capital.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Russians are so deeply involved in the
Chechen operation that they have told European military officials
that Russian troop strength now exceeds the regional limits set by
the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe, a crucial 1980s
agreement that limits the number of weapons in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   From the West's standpoint, the accord was aimed at minimizing
prospects that Soviet troops could mass for an invasion of Europe
or Turkey. Russian officials have told European military attaches
that they are exceeding limits on armored equipment in southwestern
Russia _ perhaps by hundreds of units _ but that the breach will
last only until the Chechen situation is under control.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Ministry said Friday that 179 Russian servicemen
have died in action in Dagestan and Chechnya since fighting broke
out this summer, including 47 in Chechnya. Antiterrorist officials
in Moscow say they have also seized 515 tons of explosives, 4,000
explosive devices and 7,000 guns.

REPORT OF RISE IN PRODUCER PRICES PROMPTS SELLING ON WALL STREET

(DW) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prices at the producer level shot up 1.1 percent in
September, the biggest monthly increase in nine years, the
government reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The report stoked fears among investors that inflation might be
accelerating, and helped to set off a wave of selling on Wall
Street, which was already jittery following comments on Thursday
night by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, about the
difficulty of determining whether stock prices are too high.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the increase in the producer price index, while
nearly three times larger than anticipated, overstated the
inflation threat. The rise in the index, they said, was largely
driven by increases in a few categories, including oil, tobacco and
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   But the jump in the price index was substantial enough that it
increased the odds of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates at
its next meeting on Nov. 16. Fed officials are leaning toward
increasing rates for the third time this year, said Mark Vitner, an
economist at First Union Securities, and Friday's figures ``give
them the cover they need to do so at their mid-November meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``core'' price index, which excludes food and
energy, rose eight-tenths of a percent in September, after being
roughly flat for most of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding food, energy, tobacco and cars, the index rose just
one-tenth of a percent in September, suggesting that there is no
broad-based increase in prices paid by producers for finished
goods. There did not appear to be much inflation pressure in the
pipeline, with the core index on intermediate goods _ a stage of
production between raw materials and finished goods _ rising
three-tenths of a percent in September after jumping eight-tenths
of a percent in August and six-tenths of a percent in July.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices have been rising for months as global demand has
grown. Tobacco companies have been raising prices to pass along the
costs of their settlement with the states over the health effects
of smoking. Car prices often jump in September, reflecting the
start of a new model year. The jump in all three categories is
likely to flatten out this month, analysts said, but will show up
in the consumer price index for September, scheduled to be released
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed said in a separate report Friday that industrial
production fell three-tenths of a percent in September, largely
because of the disruption created on the East Coast by Hurricane
Floyd. Excluding the effects of the storm, the Fed said, production
would have increased slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Although the chances of another rate increase from the Fed are
growing, the decision is by no means a foregone conclusion,
analysts said. Among the factors that might persuade the central
bank to hold off is the decline in stock prices and the rise over
much of the year in the long-term interest rates set in the bond
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that to a large degree, the markets are
doing the Fed's job,'' said Stephen D. Slifer, an economist at
Lehman Brothers. ``Eventually the cooling off in financial markets
should result in a cooling off in economic activity. The Fed must
be asking, why tighten when jawboning works so well?''
</P>
<P>
   With Wall Street waiting anxiously for any further sign from
him, Greenspan spoke publicly again Friday, but confined his
remarks mostly to preparations for the Year 2000 computer problem.
Investors, however, continued to chew over the remarks he made
Thursday night, in which he discussed the complexities of measuring
financial risk.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has been trying for the last several years to assess
how swings in the price of stocks and other assets affect consumer
confidence, the long-term health of the financial system and
economic growth _ and how and when the Fed should respond to them.
</P>
<P>
   He has generally concluded that the central bank should not try
to second guess investors about whether stocks are overvalued,
especially at a time when technology is reshaping the economy.
Rather, Greenspan has said, the Fed should be prepared to act
quickly if financial markets run into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Greenspan and other Fed officials have been
increasingly vocal in telling banks and other financial
institutions not to assume that the good times will continue
forever.
</P>
<P>
   It was against that backdrop that Greenspan spoke to a
conference on Thursday night sponsored by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan noted a decline in recent years in the ``equity
premium,'' or the additional return demanded by investors to buy
stocks rather than relatively less risky securities like government
bonds. The decline in the equity premium, Greenspan told the bank
regulators, ``should prompt careful consideration'' of assumptions
about how well financial institutions could cope if asset prices
should plunge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key question is whether the recent decline in equity
premiums is permanent or temporary,'' Greenspan said, touching on a
debate over whether the economy has been fundamentally strengthened
by technology or is simply in the midst of an unsustainable bubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is at issue is how much of the decline reflects new,
irreversible technologies, and what part is a consequence of a
prolonged business expansion without a significant period of
adjustment,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has considerable experience with financial crises,
having taken office just before the October 1987 stock market crash
and having weathered the problems of last fall, when global markets
all but seized up as financial problems in Asia spread to Russia
and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I have indicated on previous occasions, history tells us
that sharp reversals in confidence occur abruptly, most often with
little advance notice,'' Greenspan said. The bursting of a bubble,
he said, is ``incontrovertibly evident only in retrospect.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson, he said, is that regulators should insist that
financial institutions set aside enough money to weather ``the
losses that will inevitably emerge from time to time when investors
suffer a loss of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These reserves will appear almost all the time to be a
suboptimal use of capital,'' Greenspan said. ``So do fire insurance
premiums.''

SHOOTING SUSPECT, 103, REFLECTS ON JAIL, HIS LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By MELODY McDONALD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ He lived through World War I, the Depression
and the days of Jim Crow. He married five times and outlived two of
his three children.
</P>
<P>
   For 103-year-old Ben Collier, jail wasn't so bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got a nice jail,'' Collier said, flashing a grin. ``They
fed good. I tell you, they run me off.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a white shirt, blue pants held up by suspenders, and red
house shoes, Collier sat in his lawyer's office on Thursday and
reflected on his long life, including three days behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Collier is accused of shooting his grandson, Tyrone Collins,
four times after the younger man awakened him, complaining about
conditions at the duplex Collins rented from him. Collier, who has
been charged with attempted murder, was released Wednesday from the
Tarrant County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   At times Thursday, his thoughts got away from him, bouncing from
his release from jail to the time during the war when black
soldiers couldn't eat in mess halls with their white counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   As Collier recalled events in his lengthy life, his 45-year-old
grandson was recovering from surgery at a hospital. He remained in
serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   Collier's attorney, Jim Lane of Fort Worth, told him not to talk
about the shooting, saying a grand jury will probably hear the
evidence next week.
</P>
<P>
   But Collier couldn't help himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry this happened,'' he blurted out, his voice cracking.
``I wouldn't shoot that boy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, Benny,'' Lane said, interrupting his client. ``We can't
talk about that. We're not going to go into all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Collier did speak candidly about his life, his family _ 11
grandchildren, 14 great-grandchildren and eight
great-great-grandchildren _ and his stay in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've all been good to me all the way through,'' he said,
referring to the people he has met since his arrest. ``I don't know
what all this fuss is about. All I want is for my grandson to get
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives said Collins arrived at the house about 1 a.m., angry
and drunk, cursing at his sleeping grandfather and calling him a
slumlord.
</P>
<P>
   Collier grabbed a gun, fired four bullets into his grandson and
then went back into his room to load another weapon, relatives
said. His daughter Viola Collins, 75, snatched the bullets away.
</P>
<P>
   ``One minute he was just standing there, and the next minute he
comes back with a gun and bang, bang, bang,'' Viola Collins said
Wednesday. ``After Tyrone fell, he stood over him and pumped
another bullet into his chest.''
</P>
<P>
   Collier was released from Tarrant County Jail after Lane posted
$20,000 bail. State District Judge Scott Wisch released Collier on
the condition that he not possess firearms or have contact with his
grandson. He must also remain at the home of his nephew David
Swanson, except to go to church, court, doctors' appointments or
his attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Thelma Byrd, who lives across Galvez Avenue from the house
Collier shared with his daughter, granddaughter and Tyrone's twin
brother, Jerone, said she doesn't blame Collier for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``These old people are just scared,'' she said. ``Someone comes
and knocks on your door at 1 o'clock in the morning drunk, and you
don't know what is going on. This old man rides up and down this
street all day long on his scooter, not bothering no one.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1896 in Granger, Texas, to parents who made their living
picking cotton and cooking, Collier said he moved to Fort Worth
when he was 4. He said he went to boarding school in Oklahoma and
joined the Army in 1918. As World War I raged in Europe, Collier
was in the 18th Company of the 165th Depot Brigade at Camp Travis
in San Antonio, waiting to be transported overseas.
</P>
<P>
   He never went, but he made it back to Fort Worth, where he held
a variety of jobs throughout his life, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he mainly lives off the money and rental property he
inherited from his fifth wife, Early, whom he described as a
``businesswoman in real estate.''
</P>
<P>
   Collier said his biggest regret in life is selling some of those
properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me to keep them until I died,'' he said. ``And I
didn't do it. My wife left all that stuff to me and I messed it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Collier said he doesn't know how much longer he will live. And
right now, he said, he doesn't know how much he has to live for. He
refuses to return home.
</P>
<P>
   He is thinking about getting an apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have no job,'' he said. ``I done lived my life. I've
walked in these shoes for 100 years. I've been there.''

INVESTING WITH LISA B. NURME: MFS EQUITY INCOME FUND

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How is a value investor like Lisa B. Nurme doing at a
growth-oriented money management firm like MFS Investments? Very
well, thank you. As portfolio manager of the $141.4 million MFS
Equity Income fund, which is intensely focused on the shares of
inexpensive companies, Ms. Nurme has managed to stay competitive
with her MFS peers at a time when most value managers are
struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Standing apart from the crowd, she said, is part of the
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Value investors have to traffic in unpopular areas of the
market,'' she said, acknowledging that she usually eats lunch alone
in her Boston office, overlooking the Charles River. ``Company is
not necessarily something you want or need.''
</P>
<P>
   Her independent stance has paid off for investors. MFS Equity
Income has returned 20 percent a year, on average, for the three
years through Oct. 8, compared with 15.5 percent for its large
value peers, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's Barra Value Index, which tracks
large-capitalization value stocks, returned 19.2 percent over that
period, reinvesting dividends weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nurme, 36, looks at those United States companies with
market capitalizations of more than $1 billion and dividend yields
above the average for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, now
1.35 percent. That results in a universe of 2,200 domestic
companies. She is far less formal in her screening of foreign
companies, tending to focus on blue-chip European stocks.
</P>
<P>
   A stock's dividend yield is key to her analysis, but not because
of the quarterly checks. ``I use income as a tool to measure
value,'' she explained. ``Relative yields show whether a stock or
industry is cheap compared to its history.''
</P>
<P>
   She whittles the group to about 350 companies by eliminating
stocks with price-to-earnings ratios that are more than 75 percent
of that of the S&AMP;P 500, 22.7 for 2000. ``It's a very expensive
market, so a nice discount to market is warranted,'' she said. ``In
a less highly valued market, the discount might be smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of her value rivals, she avoids distressed companies
and so-called turnaround situations, preferring less risky
businesses. ``These are companies with solid business franchises,
healthy balance sheets and good cash flow,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To pick the fund's 100 to 125 stocks, Ms. Nurme and 31 MFS
analysts spend about one day out of five visiting companies. The
goal is to gauge management's mettle. ``When you deal with what
looks like a cheap stock,'' she said, ``you don't want management
that will stand in the way of your realizing value.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nurme said she also used such visits to help assess a
company's business franchise. She looks at the potential market of
a company, its ability to gain market share and whether it has a
competitive edge, like a better product.
</P>
<P>
   Cash flow is a key, too. ``We like to see companies that
generate excess cash, which is returned to the shareholders in
dividends or share repurchases, preferably both,'' she said. She
tends to own stocks in slower-growth industries like utilities,
where excess cash is typically not needed to expand.
</P>
<P>
   She recently added to her position in Bell Atlantic, having
initially bought shares in March at $54.42 each. ``Bell is evolving
from a regional Bell operating company, traditionally a provider of
local telephone service with modest growth rates and high dividend
yields,'' she said, ``into a company that provides the full range
of services, including local, long distance, wireless and data.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Bell Atlantic enters a planned joint venture with Vodafone
Airtouch of Britain and completes its merger with GTE, she said,
about one-third of revenues should come from wireless and data _
far more profitable areas than traditional, land-based voice
services.
</P>
<P>
   The stock, now yielding 2.41 percent, trades at $63.875, or 19.7
times her 2000 earnings estimate of $3.25 a share. She expects the
stock to reach $85 in 12 months and sees a three-year earnings
growth rate of 15 percent a year, starting in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Ms. Nurme bought shares of Akzo Nobel, a chemical and
pharmaceuticals company based in the Netherlands, for 40.26 euros.
Akzo Nobel's business mix, she said, ``is changing from a cyclical
mix of chemicals and fiber to higher-profit-margin specialty
chemicals and drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Its pharmaceutical division is producing two new profitable
drugs _ Puregon, a fertility drug, and Remeron, an antidepressant.
The stock yields 2.55 percent. She expects annual earnings growth
of 15 percent annually for the next three years and thinks the
stock could hit 56 euros in 12 months; it is now at 38.25 euros, or
13 times her predicted 2000 earnings of 2.95 euros a share.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Ms. Nurme paid $42.48 a share for National Fuel Gas, a
natural-gas utility serving western New York and northwestern
Pennsylvania. In addition to its distribution business, it has an
oil and gas operation, largely on the Gulf Coast, and operates a
gas pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Shares are cheap, she asserted, ``because the company is viewed
as a boring gas utility.'' However, production from its oil
operation on the Gulf is increasing 20 percent in 1999 and 2000,
she said, adding: ``We expect gas pricing to remain strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The natural-gas pipeline business is consolidating, she noted.
National Fuel ``is one of the few remaining large independent
distribution and pipeline companies,'' she said, ``and could be
very attractive as a takeover candidate.''
</P>

 &HT;     MURDER RATE FALLS TO LOWEST LEVEL IN MORE THAN 30 YEARS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's murder rate plummeted to its lowest
level in more than 30 years as serious crimes reported to police in
1998 declined for a seventh consecutive year, the FBI said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's news is great for citizens across the nation,''
Attorney General Janet Reno said. ``For seven years now, we have
seen serious crime go down in each region of the country, and in
cities and towns, large and small.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of murders in the United States fell to 17,000 in
1998, a 7 percent drop from the year before and 28 percent lower
than in 1994. The murder rate of 6 offenses per 100,000 inhabitants
was the lowest since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Final FBI figures for 1998 released by the Justice Department on
Sunday showed a 6 percent drop from 1997 in the number of violent
crimes and serious property crimes reported to more than 17,000
police agencies around the nation. The total number of serious
crimes in 1998 was 12.5 million, 12 percent below the number a
decade earlier and 5 percent below the 1997 figure.
</P>
<P>
   The crime rate, adjusted for population growth, dropped even
more. Last year's rate was 4,616 crimes per 100,000 residents, down
6 percent from 1997, 14 percent below 1994 and 20 percent lower
than 1989.
</P>
<P>
   All violent crimes _ murder, rape, robbery and aggravated
assault _ and all the far more numerous property crimes _ burglary,
auto theft and larceny-theft _ dropped in both number and rate.
</P>
<P>
   The violent crime rate was down 10 percent from 1997 to its
lowest level since 1987, led by a 10 percent decline in robberies
and the 7 percent drop in murders. The aggravated assault rate was
down 5 percent, and the rape rate declined 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The property crime rate dipped 7 percent _ down 8 percent for
auto theft, 5 percent for larceny-theft, 5 percent for burglary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is good news,'' said James Alan Fox, dean of
Northeastern University's College of Criminal Justice. But he
cautioned, ``People should remember that these numbers are only
part of the story. The country needs to watch out because these
drops in crime could turn quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said two dominant trends are influencing the nation's crime
rate.
</P>
<P>
   First, the aging of the baby boom generation _ those born
between 1946 and 1964 who make up 25 percent of the population _
has pushed down the number of crimes because adults tend to be less
violent than juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the number of crimes committed by teen-agers
has risen sharply since the mid-1980s. The number of murders
committed by teen-agers increased 145 percent from 1985 to 1995.
And although the number of violent crimes committed by juveniles
has fallen slightly in the past two years, the number of teen-agers
will grow quickly over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   There are 40 million children under the age of 10 nationwide.
Fox said future crime rates will be determined by how society deals
with the rising tide of teen-agers over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, crime rates peak in the couple of hours between the
end of school and when most parents get home for dinner,'' he said.
``That tells you that our children are not getting enough
supervision from their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno agreed, saying that the nation should not become
``complacent.''
</P>
<P>
   All regions saw crime rates fall in 1998, with the Northeast and
West experiencing the largest drop, 7 percent, the FBI report said.
The crime rate in the South declined 5 percent, while the Midwest
saw a drop of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The South remained the nation's most dangerous region with 5,223
offenses per 100,000 people in 1998. The West had 4,879 offenses
per 100,000 inhabitants, with the Midwest and Northeast reporting
4,379 and 3,474 respectively.

   RAWALPINDI, Pakistan _ If there is such a thing as a good coup,
this one is winning raves in the bazaars of Rawalpindi.
</P>
<P>
   A decade of crooked and incompetent civilian rule before the
takeover this week, a decade of competently brutal dictatorship
before that, and life keeps getting harder for Pakistan's 138
million souls. A Pakistani poet, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, once was asked
what would become of his nation. ``My great fear,'' he said, ``is
that nothing will happen. Things will go on the way they are.''
</P>
<P>
   There is not much passion for politicians or for going to the
polls again. There is a thirst for leadership, or even something
stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there should be any elections,'' said Kalsoon
Syed, an elementary school principal. ``There should be a strong
dictator.''
</P>
<P>
   The American ambassador, William Milam, met Friday for 90
minutes with the coup leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, at the army's
general headquarters here just hours after the general declared
himself the country's chief executive, suspended the Constitution
and dismissed Parliament. The general's government also froze the
assets of more than 500 political figures, among them Nawaz Sharif,
the ousted prime minister, and his predecessor, Benazir Bhutto.
Western diplomats said the ambassador had given the general a
message from President Clinton calling on him to return the nation
to civilian rule as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may be calling for a return to democratic principles in
Pakistan, but politicians here have rarely practiced them. For 11
years, since the end of the last military dictatorship, most of
them have behaved like medieval barons, plundering most of what
remained of the nation's wealth.
</P>
<P>
   What was left was not enough to run a civil society. The
principal export of Pakistan today is Pakistanis. The most
talented, the best educated, the potential leaders are gone. So
nostalgia for a strongman fills the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling may support the military government of Musharraf,
who seized power this week, becoming the latest in a series of
rulers who have led and misled the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan was created in 1947 out of the violent partition of
India. While it often has been ruled by military dictatorships, it
has also had the trappings of democracy: a Parliament, a lively
press, political debate.
</P>
<P>
   But to many Pakistanis, democracy is a facade. Waheed Zaman, 30,
the well-spoken owner of a trophy shop in Rawalpindi, said his
middle-class family was ``like other people; we are fed up with
politicians; we have love for our armed forces despite their
checkered history.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaman and others in the teeming bazaar in this city, 25 miles
southwest of the national capital, Islamabad, spoke in heroic terms
of a man who was once a national demon: Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq.
He ruled Pakistan for 11 years until he died in a plane crash in
1988, a still unexplained midair explosion that also took the life
of Arnold Raphel, then the American ambassador to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Zia was an angel,'' said a grizzled rickshaw driver
named Amir Khan, 59. ``Then there was no inflation. Crime was under
control. When I heard he was killed, I thought Pakistan was an
orphan.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment is sometimes tinged with blood; many Pakistanis
want their political miscreants punished. ``These smugglers, these
bribe-taking people should be behind bars or hanged,'' said Mrs.
Syed, the school principal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pervez Musharraf, my prayers and my best wishes are with
him,'' she said ``This man is a general. He knows law and order and
how to get things done. We expect him to do things for the common
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Much needs to be done. Pakistan is a basket case, and the coup
may make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   Today two-thirds of the country's wealth goes to the military
and to paying its debts. Three-quarters of the aid Pakistan
receives from the International Monetary Fund goes to pay off IOUs
to the I.M.F. That aid was immediately suspended after the coup, as
was a trade agreement with the European Union that Pakistan
desperately needed. Pakistan has only $1.4 billion in foreign
reserves _ just enough to buy three weeks of imports.
</P>
<P>
   In the troubled 2{-year tenure of Sharif, Pakistan's currency,
the rupee, lost half its value against the dollar. Everything in
the bazaar seems to cost far more than it did in 1997. And the $600
million in annual military and economic aid Pakistan received from
the United States in Zia's day, during the 1980s, ended after he
died and when the Cold War was over, blocked by law after the
United States acknowledged that Pakistan was building a nuclear
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is now uneasily contemplating the prospect of dealing
with a dictator in Pakistan once more. Western diplomats said the
general had given Milam a preview of the speech he is to give on
Saturday, which those diplomats expect will set forth his plans for
dealing with Pakistan's crushing problems.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans may include a slow return to what the West would
like to call democracy. It may come, but for now the bazaar has
spoken, and in much the same voice as that of Talat Massoud, a
retired lieutenant general who served as defense secretary from
1988 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coup was a good thing,'' he said, in a voice devoid of
happiness or anticipation. ``It gave us a sigh of relief. There was
no choice left for the military. Our politicians put us on the
brink of disaster. They were making a mockery of democracy. The
prime minister had corrupted every institution. The judiciary was
bought off; there was no justice. The police were run as a fiefdom.
What kind of democracy was that?''

TOP RUSSIAN SECURITIES REGULATOR RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By NEELA BANERJEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's top securities regulator resigned in
frustration Friday, the latest in a series of troubling signs that
the country is ill equipped to defend the interests of shareholders
and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Vasiliev, chairman of the Federal Securities Commission,
said that Russia was failing to protect investors from abuse and
expropriation, and that other government agencies had obstructed
his efforts to uphold shareholder rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's perfectly clear that we haven't gotten the support of
other government agencies we need in connection with some recent
shareholder disputes,'' Vasiliev said.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the commission since it was formed in late 1994,
Vasiliev has been among the few proponents of foreign investment
and U.S.-style securities markets to have survived the frequent
purges of President Boris N. Yeltsin's government. Investors said
he tried to help establish the rule of law in a realm where
powerful local business interests use friends in the government to
solve their problems, and where courts are notoriously corrupt. A
successor has not been named.
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign shareholders see Vasiliev's departure as a sign
that their tenuous rights have eroded further. ``People felt that
Vasiliev was the only one in the government paying attention to an
agenda to protect shareholder rights,'' said Andrea Rutherford, a
director of Brunswick Warburg, a Moscow brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   Other ambitious Russian bureaucracies, including the Central
Bank, had sought to oust Vasiliev or wrest oversight of the market
from him over the years. He defeated such campaigns and even built
a securities commission that, despite its shortage of staff,
resources and political influence, succeeded periodically in
protecting shareholder rights.
</P>
<P>
   The commission this year suspended dozens of Russian companies
from over-the-counter trading because they had failed to report
financial information on time. The suspensions prodded many
companies to disclose results quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But after surviving many attacks, Vasiliev said he had begun to
consider resigning several months ago, when some ugly fights over
shareholder rights erupted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of those cases involves the Russian oil company Yukos,
accused of authorizing shares to company insiders that would
unfairly dilute minority shareholdings. Although Vasiliev objected,
a court on Monday approved the share issue for a Yukos subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision, Vasiliev said, ``is just another argument
that shows that the system here doesn't protect investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign investors believe Vasiliev's resignation is tied to
the commission's inability to rein Yukos in. ``There's a great deal
of concern that the share issue was approved, because it is such
blatant abuse of shareholders' rights,'' said Chris Weafer, who is
in charge of research at Troika Dialog, a Moscow brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a small meeting with Western journalists Friday,
Vasiliev told of the indifference and obstruction he had
encountered at other government agencies. In the Yukos case, for
example, the dilutive shares are to be sold in a closed offering to
four offshore companies that many analysts and minority
shareholders believe are owned by Yukos management. Vasiliev said
he had appealed in vain to tax authorities and the Interior
Ministry to help him get information about a possible link between
Yukos and the offshore companies.
</P>
<P>
   Vasiliev's decision to leave was eventually clinched by a St.
Petersburg court's decision on Monday to re-nationalize the
Lomonosov porcelain factory, a move that annulled a 51 percent
stake held in the company by executives of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
&AMP; Co. and the U.S.-Russia Investment Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, which the fund plans to appeal, marks the first
major re-nationalization in Russia since economic reforms began.
Vasiliev called it ``an extraordinarily dangerous precedent.''

   NEVE EREZ, West Bank _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak's soldiers are
unlikely to face much resistance when they arrive to dismantle this
illegal settlement, a funky hilltop community of beat-up caravans,
young back-to-nature types and goats.
</P>
<P>
   The community leader, Erez Maman, 27, who wanders around the
rocky site playing a recorder, is an unusually mellow Israeli. Five
months ago, five days after Barak was elected, he and some friends
grabbed this land because it seemed to be in the middle of nowhere,
the views were fabulous and the rent was free.
</P>
<P>
   They were assisted by the nearest established settlement, Maale
Michmash, which wanted the hilltop seized to further the right-wing
dream of solidifying Israel's hold on the West Bank. But Maman and
friends have no hard-core political motives themselves, and they
made it clear that although they do not want to leave, they will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be moved to violence, that's for sure,''
Maman said. ``Maybe we'll stand on the roofs, maybe we'll puncture
a tire? You have to stand up for what you believe in, but that
doesn't mean fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak defused a politically explosive situation late Wednesday
night when he reached a compromise with settler leaders, who are
growing increasingly pragmatic and moderate as the peace effort
marches forward.
</P>
<P>
   Testing a new approach to a destabilizing issue, Barak charted a
middle ground between settlers and peace advocates, both of whom
emerged proclaiming victories. Out of 42 outposts established in
the West Bank in the last year, he agreed to evict residents from
only 12, including Neve Erez, rather than the 15 he had initially
proposed.
</P>
<P>
   To the Palestinians, some of whom privately expressed
satisfaction that any action was being taken, it still seemed a
very small first step in the dismantling of an enterprise that they
consider entirely illegal. It left intact 30 of the outposts
created in the last year, not to mention the 145 previously
existing settlements.
</P>
<P>
   ``This way of deceit _ saying that there are 15 that are legal,
or illegal _ this is not the way to build trust for
permanent-status negotiations,'' said Ahmed Qurei, known as Abu
Ala, who is speaker of the Palestinian Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But, from the perspective of many Israelis, Barak not only made
an extraordinary move against illegal settlements but also managed
to secure the settler leaders' unusual cooperation. The leaders
promised to help make the evacuations ``voluntary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time that settlements will be removed by
agreement with the settlers, not in a confrontation with them,''
Yossi Beilin, the justice minister and a leftist, said Thursday on
Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
   For all parties, it served as a kind of social preparatory class
for the year ahead, when the ultimate fate of the settlements will
be decided in final-status negotiations. Even if the Palestinians
accede to Barak's desire to preserve large settlements in blocs,
many small or isolated ones are likely to end up similarly slated
for evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   In his compromise with the settlers, Barak agreed to save three
hilltop communities from eviction, to preserve a school in a fourth
and to allow livestock to remain in a fifth. He also left them with
the impression that they could seek to legalize and repopulate
several outposts after the evacuation and move the mobile homes
from others into existing settlements, according to Yehoshua
Mor-Yosef, a spokesman for the settlers.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, he gave the settler leaders a way to proclaim
victory and to calm down some of their more radical followers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this means that the evacuation, scheduled to start next
week, will take place smoothly remains to be seen, since at least
one makeshift settlement contains a quite militant population.
</P>
<P>
   But, following their representatives' lead, most settlers said
Thursday that they would protest peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be no physical resistance in terms of
violence against Israeli soldiers,'' said Yiftach Sapir, 24, a
second-generation settler who lives in Mitzpe Danny, an outpost
removed from the evacuation list. ``There will be passive
resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying his evacuation plan was not directed at ``the settlement
enterprise'' as such, Barak presented it instead as an effort to
put decision-making in such a sensitive arena back under government
control.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``I am convinced that it contributes to the
fortification of the rule of law and strengthens the understanding
that a government cannot allow itself to be led by groups of
private citizens _ as dear as they may be and as much pain as they
are experiencing.''
</P>
<P>
   While Yitzhak Rabin, the late prime minister, cracked down on
rogue outposts in confrontations that shook up the country, they
tended to be overnight installations and not sites like these with
deeper roots.
</P>
<P>
   The 42 newest West Bank outposts were all established since the
Wye River peace agreement was signed in Washington last November.
Mitzpe Danny, for instance, was created two days after the signing
at the White House. Maman established Neve Erez just after Barak
won the May 17 elections.
</P>
<P>
   All 42 are tiny settlements, most with fewer than 20 residents _
and four of the ones to be closed are by now uninhabited. Because
the living conditions are primitive, the sites have been
intermittently occupied at capacity, mostly by people in their 20s,
including many devoted second-generation settlers, some militants,
some nature lovers and some loners.
</P>
<P>
   Using criteria that some in Israel found incomprehensible,
Defense officials recently decided that seven of the 42 were
actually legal extensions of existing settlements. They found seven
to be overtly illegal.
</P>
<P>
   And the remaining 28 were in the process of being legalized.
</P>
<P>
   They recommended that 15 be shut down: the seven overtly illegal
ones and eight that were either sparsely populated or isolated and
hard to protect.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who serves as his own defense minister, accepted the
recommendations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At first, this provoked a fierce reaction from all sides.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial in Ma'ariv, a leading tabloid, excoriated the prime
minister for ``laundering'' the 27 outposts that would be allowed
to remain open.
</P>
<P>
   From the right, Ariel Sharon, former foreign minister and head
of the opposition Likud Party, asserted that Barak must have made a
secret deal with Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the settlers, calling Barak's plan
``anti-Zionist,'' warned that they would fight every single
evacuation, while leftist leaders promised to respond with large
counterprotests.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday morning, however, after the compromise on evacuating
just 12 had been reached, plans to revive the old internal Israeli
battle over the West Bank had been suspended. After saying on
Wednesday that he wanted a ``civil rebellion, nonviolent for the
moment,'' Elyakim Haeztni, an outspoken longtime settler, said
Thursday, ``We won't get into a conflict over it.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sharon, after touring the West Bank, conceded that Barak had
accomplished much by avoiding a confrontation with the settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Neve Erez sits on a barren hilltop about 1,800 feet above sea
level, overlooking rippling hills, dun-colored now before the
winter rains start.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, the heat got so intense that the residents cooled
one another down with water pistols.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about our level of violence,'' said Amy Abels, 30, a
new immigrant from the Upper West Side of New York, who fingered a
visitor's shirt and asked, ``Is that Banana Republic?''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven free spirits, including several new immigrants who met in
Hebrew language school, the Neve Erez residents form a tightknit
collective. Some write, some paint, some make music, some study
scholarly Jewish texts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love each other very much, and we are very much in love
with this place,'' Maman said. ``It has a special rhythm and I
still hope we will not be removed. We're not bothering anyone. It's
not like there are Arabs around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Maman seemed oblivious to the Bedouin Druse tents just down the
hill, and said, ``Oh, true,'' when it was pointed out that an Arab
village could be clearly seen from his back porch.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fantasy is that all the governments butt out and we'd just
invite the Druse over for tea,'' Ms. Abels said.
</P>
<P>
   The land that Neve Erez occupies was slated to be a cemetery for
a nearby settlement, and, like ruins, tracks for the graves are
growing weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Even to the residents, it seemed a bit glaringly metaphorical
Thursday, as if it represented a burial place for the settlers'
dreams of expansion.

TEXAS FRONT-RUNNER IN RACE FOR SPACEPORT

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Texas congressional delegation sent a letter
Thursday urging a space launch company to choose a Texas site for a
spaceport.
</P>
<P>
   An executive from the California-based Space Access Co. said
Friday that Texas is the front-runner, although obstacles remain
before a spaceport for reusable launch vehicles can move forward.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, Florida and California are vying to attract the fledgling
spaceport industry. At least three companies _ Lockheed Martin,
Kistler Aerospace and Space Access _ are making plans for possible
spaceports. Texas has presented two possible sites, one in Brazoria
County and another near Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Texas congressional delegation wishes to express to you
our desire that the site for the spaceport be Texas,'' said the
letter to Steve Wurst, president of Space Access.
</P>
<P>
   Before Space Access can build, it must pass environmental
inspections and receive approval from the Federal Aviation
Administration to launch. But so far, Space Access likes the idea
of locating in Texas because the state offers takeoff routes over
the Gulf of Mexico and large amounts of sparsely populated land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas entered the game late as far as spaceports go, and
they've made up a lot of ground,'' said Michael Wade, a vice
president at Space Access. ``They are very energetic in making this
happen. If I had to say who was in the lead right now, I would have
to say Texas has a clear lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gene Green, D-Houston, one of 23 lawmakers who signed the
letter to Space Access, said local tax breaks as well as federal
assistance will be key to luring space launch companies to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you look at the competition in other countries,
China, France and Russia, we have to be able to match that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A bill introduced in the Senate would offer government-backed
loans to the space launch industry.

MANY BRAZILIANS OF JAPANESE DESCENT MIGRATING TO JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ What urges someone like Nobotoshi Uski, a
41-year-old dentist whose grandparents emigrated to Brazil in an
exodus that formed the largest community of Japanese descendants
outside Japan, to reverse that trajectory and move to the homeland
of his ancestors?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of yen,'' said Uski as he waited in a winding line in
front of the Japan Airlines counter at Sao Paulo's international
airport, where he planned to board a midnight flight to Tokyo. Uski
said he hoped to earn the equivalent of $2,500 a month at a job
awaiting him at a Japanese auto parts factory, or about double what
he earned as a dentist in his home town about 200 miles west of Sao
Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   Uski will join an estimated 220,000 Brazilians who have moved,
at least temporarily, to Japan in the last decade. Coming almost
entirely from a Japanese-Brazilian community numbering 1.3 million,
many of these immigrants do work that is snubbed by the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese-Brazilians began arriving in Japan in 1990 after Tokyo
eased its immigration laws to allow people of Japanese descent to
work in the country. They now form the third-largest immigrant
group in Japan, after Koreans and Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, in a trend that underscores the nascent recovery of
Japan, the world's second-largest economy, and the strengthening
yen, as well as the stagnating economy in Brazil, the rate at which
Brazilians are moving to Japan appears to be rising. While some of
these immigrants are merely replacing countrymen returning home to
celebrate the New Year with their families, there are abundant
signs of a stronger Japanese job market for Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the pages of the Sao Paulo weekly newspaper Jornal
Nipo-Brasil are now full of help-wanted ads from the 100 or so
companies that serve as intermediaries for corporations in Japan
wanting to hire Brazilians. ``Minolta, Toyota, you name it,'' said
Ricardo Sumida, the owner of one go-between company with offices in
Liberdade, this city's Japanese district. ``They want more
Brazilians and were working overtime to find enough people.''
</P>
<P>
   Longer lines in front of the Japanese consulate's work-visa
section and in the waiting rooms for flights from Sao Paulo to
Tokyo also indicate an increase in the number of Brazilians moving
to Japan, said Sumida. Aid agencies that follow such immigration
have perceived a pick-up in interest as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if 40,000 Brazilians move to Japan in
the second half of this year, compared with 20,000 in the same
period of 1998,'' said Masato Ninomiya, president of the
Information and Aid Center for the Worker Abroad, a group based in
Sao Paulo and supported by the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
   A Brazilian who moves to Japan is called a ``dekasegi,'' a word
that originally referred to sojourners from remote regions in Japan
who left their homes to work in urban factories, according to Raul
Takaki, the publisher of Nikkei Shimbun, one of Sao Paulo's two
Japanese-language daily newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the word `dekasegi' is used to describe a wide variety of
Brazilians, from the guy mopping the floor to the well-off kid
working for a few months at a ski resort,'' Takaki said.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the role dekasegis play in supplementing the
incomes of relatives back home has become as significant as that of
Mexicans laboring in the United States. Dekasegis sent home an
estimated $1.09 billion in the first half of this year, helping to
ease concern over the current account deficit, a wide measure of
foreign transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Some dekasegis also eventually return to Brazil to invest
savings in the purchase of their first home or in business
ventures. Ademir Kimura, for example, worked for seven years in
Japan before returning to his home city of Maringa in southern
Brazil to establish an Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   ``To become an entrepreneur I needed my own capital,'' Kimura,
31, said.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration to Japan is an escape valve for unemployment
pressure, with Brazilian joblessness near an all-time high and
inflation-adjusted wages in decline. ``I want my boys to have a
taste of what Brazil can't give them, which is opportunity,'' said
Keite Nakamura, 52, the owner of a small Brazilian construction
company. Nakamura accompanied his two sons, 18 and 21, to the
airport for their flight to a new life in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The planeloads of Brazilians heading to Japan reflect a somber
twist to a 91-year saga that has resulted in one of Brazil's most
successful immigrant groups. While the Japanese came to Brazil in
search of opportunity, many of their descendants, who are often
well-educated yet members of a struggling middle class, choose to
leave Brazil for economic reasons.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first group came to Brazil in 1908 _ nearly 800 immigrants
who arrived on a boat named Kasato-Maru to work on the coffee
plantations, which were also attracting laborers from Italy, Spain
and elsewhere. Their arrival was partly a result of informal
policies in the United States that sought to limit the entry of
non-European immigrants. (These policies became law in the 1920s).
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan needed to alleviate population pressure, and with access
to the United States closed, the agricultural opportunities in
Brazil were the best alternative,'' said Karen Tei Yamashita, a
Japanese-American writer from California whose 1992 novel,
``Brazil-Maru,'' describes a group of Japanese who moved to Brazil
in the first decades of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Japanese community grew larger than similar
communities in the United States and Peru, the other big South
American outpost. Although most Japanese immigrants to Brazil
started out as field hands or small farmers, many moved to cities
as the country was transformed from a rural to an urban society.
Most Japanese-Brazilians live in Sao Paulo and in the southern
state of Parana.
</P>
<P>
   In Sao Paulo's Japanese district, a neighborhood near the city's
crumbling city center, the streets are lined with sushi
restaurants, karaoke bars, Japanese grocery stores, newsstands with
Japanese publications and even a McDonald's, with menu items
written in Japanese as well as in Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the indelible mark the Japanese have made on Sao
Paulo's cityscape, they have influenced contemporary Brazilian
society as a whole. Japanese-Brazilians have been successful in
politics and business and in the arts. Modern Brazilian painting,
for instance, is largely defined by names like Manabu Mabe, Tomie
Ohtake and Flavio Shiro. Filmmaking, ceramics and architecture have
also been heavily influenced by Japanese-Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
   Still, though they have, as a group, integrated so much into
Brazilian society, their entry into Japanese culture is often not
smooth. Lili Kawamura, a Brazilian sociologist and visiting
researcher at Tsukuba University who has written a book on the
dekasegis, said the culture clash could be immense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although our appearances are so similar, there is little
contact between the groups,'' said Ms. Kawamura. ``Brazilians end
up creating their own peripheral economy within Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Many dekasegis who have gone to Japan and returned to Brazil
said their relations with the Japanese were strained. Some
dekasegis said the resentment in part reflects the insularity and
homogeneity of Japanese society, which historically has viewed
outsiders _ including descendants of Japanese emigrants _ with some
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I had `dekasegi' written on my forehead, but
when I opened my mouth and the Japanese noticed my accent, I was
treated as second-rate,'' said Clarice Onaka, 40, a professor of
Brazilian literature who returned to Sao Paulo last year after
eight years of factory work in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you expect when the jobs we do there are described by
the three k's?,'' said Ms. Onaka _ ``kitsui,'' ``kitanai'' and
``kiken,'' the Japanese words for ``hard,'' ``dirty'' and
``dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Jeffrey Lesser, a professor at Connecticut College
who has studied Brazilian immigration to Japan, these feelings of
alienation are exacerbated by Japanese policies that make it
extremely hard for descendants of Japanese born abroad to attain
citizenship. Though many dekasegis who move to Japan remain there,
he added, they do so first on work visas and then on permanent
visas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while many Brazilians complain of discrimination in
Japan, others, like Joe Hirata, chalk up their success to their
experiences on the archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   Hirata, 31, worked for several years in factories in Okinawa and
Nagoya while also pursuing a career as a country music singer. In
1994, he won the televised NHK Nodogiman contest, singing romantic
ballads in the Japanese he had polished.
</P>
<P>
   Hirata went on to record a CD back in Brazil, ``Sonho de um
Brasileiro,'' or ``Dream of a Brazilian,'' and now divides his time
between Japan and Brazil, singing tunes that evoke rural life and
lost loves, the mainstay of Brazilian ``sertaneja'' music, itself
heavily influence by American country music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan took me in and treated me well,'' said Hirata, whose
everyday attire includes a suede cowboy hat, striped leather pants
and snakeskin boots. ``I learned there that success comes from
being true to who you are and that I'm far more Brazilian than
Japanese.''

 &HT;    House panel to keep pressure on IOC
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One day after a heated Congressional hearing on the
Olympic bribery scandal, the panel's chairman said he and other
lawmakers would keep up the pressure on the International Olympic
Committee to reform its process for selecting host cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message I think was certainly received that if they back
away from these reforms, we are going to act pretty swiftly,'' said
Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), chairman of the House Commerce
subcommittee on oversight and investigations. ``We are going to be
staying on top of them. Our effort is not to trash the Olympics. We
want to clean it up.''
</P>
<P>
   As Thursday's hearing on Capitol Hill indicated, there is
widespread bipartisan concern about the culture of greed and
corruption that has consumed the Olympic movement. Despite
assurances from IOC officials, few on Upton's panel think the IOC
will clean up its act without a vigilant Congress overseeing the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Upton's subcommittee has been examining the extensive gifts and
favors provided IOC members during Atlanta's winning bid for the
1996 Summer Games. Panel members submitted Atlanta Olympic
officials Billy Payne and Andy Young to pointed questions about
lavish travel, medical care, scholarship offers and potentially
illegal accommodations they provided IOC members and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   After the daylong hearing, the members had more questions for
Payne and Young. They plan to submit them in writing and they
expect quick responses, Upton said.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Congress intends to put the Atlanta bid
activities behind it and is concentrating on the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The period of discovery is over,'' said Upton, who believes a
report documenting Atlanta's bid activities and comments by Payne
and Young at the hearing provided the necessary evidence of
widespread corruption of the host city selection process.
</P>
<P>
   If the IOC has not enacted sweeping reforms of the process and
its organization by the end of the year, Congress will not hesitate
to act, Upton said.
</P>
<P>
   While it has no jurisdiction over the IOC, Congress could
cripple the organization by putting its cash cow _ U.S.
corporations and television networks _ out to pasture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the cutoff of American corporate money will get the IOC's
attention,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), who has proposed
legislation, co-sponsored by Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), prohibiting
U.S. corporations from financially supporting the Olympics if the
IOC rejects reforms proposed by an independent ethics commission
headed by former Sen. George Mitchell (D-Maine).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced if the IOC does not adopt those Mitchell reforms
in December, the Congress is not going to have any patience any
longer to leave the IOC to reform itself,'' Waxman said at the
hearing
</P>
<P>
   The two IOC members from the United States, Jim Easton and Anita
DeFrantz, did not endorse congressional action. In fact, Easton was
flippant when asked by Waxman if he thought Congress should
intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we wish to pass a bill that no Americans can participate in
the Olympic Games, that would solve the problems also,'' he said,
``But I don't think that's what we want to do. What we want to do
is try to reform what we have. I think we are headed in that
direction and I don't think we need any other incentives to do
so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a really insulting answer,'' Waxman shot back, an
indication of the antagonistic atmosphere during the hearing. ``We
don't do anything that would affect the athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would simply eliminate the revenue from U.S.
corporations ``that is subsidizing the lifestyle of Mr. (Juan
Antonio) Samaranch and some of the others at the IOC in addition to
the booty that they collect every time a city wants to attract the
Olympics,'' Waxman snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Although IOC President Samaranch was spared what would surely
have been a hostile attack had he attended the hearing, he plans to
attend a second hearing Dec. 15, two days after a special IOC
session at which reforms will be put to a vote. Former Sen. Howard
Baker (R-Tenn.), who serves on the IOC's new ethics commission,
also will be called, Upton said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the IOC adopts reforms at its meeting in Lausanne,
Switzerland, Upton still wants to summon Samaranch to Washington
for assurances that the IOC will enforce the policies. ``You can
have the standards, but if you don't have the enforcement
mechanism, it doesn't work,'' Upton said.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, U.S. Olympic Committee President Bill Hybl, a
member of the IOC's reform commission, said there is a ``little
better than a 50 percent chance'' of all recommendations passing.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch told The Associated Press on Friday that he thought
the odds were better. ``I am very confident that the most important
recommendations will pass,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that pressure from Congress will have no impact on the
fate of reforms. ``I don't like to enter into what the Congress is
thinking,'' Samaranch said. ``I have to take care only of the
IOC.''

BIG GAMES, LITTLE IMMEDIATE FINANCIAL PAYOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a major event in Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox versus the New York Yankees, arguably the
greatest rivalry in the long history of the game, is being played
out in a best-of-seven-game series for the American League pennant.
And yet the Red Sox face the possibility of making only a couple of
million dollars from the postseason appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, the revenues are not likely to be significant,'' said
Robert C. Furbush, chief financial officer of the Red Sox. ``I
would hestitate to say that it would make the difference between
making a profit and not making a profit this year.''
</P>
<P>
   In an odd twist, determined by the economics of Major League
Baseball, franchises that play in postseason stand to make
comparatively small amounts of money directly from the highly
anticipated, much-watched games. The postseason instead presents a
remarkable marketing opportunity in their pursuit of future
season-ticket customers, corporate sponsors and advertisers. It
also enhances their bargaining positions for the next round of
broadcast negotiations, a singularly important piece of the revenue
pie for sports franchises.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps most importantly to the Red Sox, success in the
postseason in the major sports has often proven to help franchises
in their efforts to building new stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   The major reasons for the revenue that will trickle into the Red
Sox front office is that most of the money from gate receipts goes
directly to the players, Major League Baseball and the American and
National Leagues.
</P>
<P>
   By agreement with the Major League Baseball Players Association,
60 percent of gate receipts from the first three games of the
best-of-five divisional series and the first four games of the
league series and the World Series benefits the players alone. In
1998, that pool of money was at an all-time high of $39.3 million,
up from $23.4 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The money is then divided among the teams with specific portions
going to participants in the World Series, the League Championship
Series and the Divisional Series, based on whether they win or
lose. The players on the individual teams then vote on each
player's share of the purse.
</P>
<P>
   Of the remaining gate receipts _ the 40 percent for the first
three or four games, depending on the series; and all of the
receipts from any additional games that are played _ most is
distributed to the offices of Major League Baseball, in the case of
the World Series, or the American League and the National League
offices, in the League Championship and Divisional Series.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there also is no extra money from the national
broadcasting contracts for teams that play in postseason, officials
of Major League Baseball said. And the Red Sox, like most teams in
the major leagues, charge no extra fees in the postseason for
corporate sponsorships, stadium advertising or the rental fees on
premium seating, Furbush said.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves teams like the Red Sox to make most of its revenue
in postseason from the residual gate receipts and concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much a team makes depends almost entirely on whether you
go deep in to postseason, and then continue to play after Game 4 of
the World Series,'' said Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist and
professor at Smith College.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that the Red Sox, if they go deep in the league
championship series with the Yankees, win, and then go deep again
in the World Series _ and given that they play in Fenway Park _ are
in the $6 million to $8 million range,'' Zimbalist said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Sox are eliminated by the Yankees, and in fairly quick
order, chances are the club will have trouble clearing $2 million,
observers said.
</P>
<P>
   Furbush and other Red Sox officials refused to discuss details
of the teams financial status, in postseason or otherwise. But CEO
John Harrigton recently told the Globe that the Red Sox lost money
this year and, without commenting directly, Furbush indicated that
even in if the Red Sox play deeply into the postseason the
franchise may still not turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   But for a team that many observers thought would not play in
postseason at all, the Red Sox surprising success may well pay
dividends of a different sort, observers said.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the impact on the Red Sox' big ticket item _
the proposed new Fenway Park. The Red Sox, success in the
postseason in the major sports has proven to be a magical elixir
for teams proposing to build new stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it makes a huge difference to a team talking about
building a ballpark, because there is such a positive environment
when a team does well in the playoffs _ especially when it is
exceeding expectations, like the Red Sox clearly are doing this
year,'' said Marc Ganis, a consultant with SportsCorp Ltd. in
Chicago. ``Those things are not lost on either the fans, the press
or the politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres and the Seattle Mariners recently received
approval for stadium plans and public financing after successful
appearances in the postseason, said Mark Rosentraub, a professor at
Indiana University and author of a book on the business of
baseball. It works in other sports, too, Rosentraub said, with the
Denver Broncos building a new stadium after their win in the Super
Bowl and the San Antonio Spurs dramatically increasing their
chances for a new stadium after winning the NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   But Red Sox officials and their spokesmen were reticent to claim
any greater support for the stadium proposal, based on the success
of the team, and some of the notable government officials involved
asserted that success on the field will not play a substantive
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great, all of the excitement that it's producing and
it's a lot of enjoyment,'' said Mayor Thomas Menino. ``But the
stadium is going to come down to their financial plan and how they
treat the community. That's what's going to decide this.''

 &HT;    Lowe's issues Internet challenge
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lowe's Cos. is beefing up the troops to go
head-to-head with Home Depot in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkesboro, N.C.-based Lowe's said Friday it will hire nearly 40
people for a separate Internet business group. That will quadruple
the staff dedicated to www.lowes.com and match the size of the
Internet team at Atlanta-based Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's already sells a limited number of products through links
to other Web sites. Both Lowe's and Home Depot have company sites
that provide do-it-yourself home improvement tips.
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales on those primary company sites won't come until
next year. Both companies have delayed original plans as they
grapple with the challenges of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Home Depot said it was pushing back its debut by
several months because of a major shift in strategy. Instead of
testing limited sales, which would have begun this fall, the
retailer plans to offer its entire inventory of more than 50,000
products on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's seems to be taking the opposite tact. It plans to offer
6,000 to 8,000 products on its site next year, then gradually add
more items.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have been selling over the Web site next month with a
catalog-based offering,'' said Greg Bridgeford, senior vice
president of business development at Lowe's. But as the company
prepared to offer its inventory over the Internet, executives
decided a ``solution-based'' approach made more sense, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, some product sales on lowes.com will match the
retailer's existing ``how-to'' information on 1,000 current Web
pages. Shoppers could opt to buy a project kit or pay to have
Lowe's install it, Bridgeford said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Lowe's products on the Web will be targeted to specific
customer groups, such as contractors or ``serious
do-it-yourselfers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's expects to start selling products during the first half
of next year. The company started selling certain tools, ceiling
fans and steel doors through manufacturer Web sites last year.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot has let its rivals get the jump on it when it comes
to online sales. Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. and regional retailers such
as 84 Lumber and Scotty's have launched online sales. A slew of
pure Internet companies dealing in hardware and building products
have popped up as well.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry observers are wondering whether Home Depot is
taking too long to execute its game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every delay in getting a ... product-selling site up and
running gives all the many new retailers a better chance of
building customer lists and gaining name recognition,'' said a
recent editorial in National Home Center News.
</P>
<P>
   ``What should have been a slam dunk for Home Depot is beginning
to look like a wild and competitive game now,'' the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, at least one recent report suggests that the
do-it-yourself market is not as frenzied for Web sales as other
sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most DIYers consider themselves novices, not pros, and
therefore need the comfort of seeing the product before taking it
home,'' said analyst Dan Wewer of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.
Customers mainly want to use the Home Depot and Lowe's Web sites
for advice, not to shop, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot declined to elaborate on its strategy Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Internet plans have gotten a lot of attention,
particularly after it warned suppliers not to sell directly to
customers through their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeford of Lowe's said none of its suppliers plans to sell
products over the Internet.

   PRESIDENT'S AGENDA THREATENED BY TENUOUS RELATIONS WITH CONGRESS
</P>
<P>
   With Sidebar: Clinton-Data
</P>
<P>
   Moving on Washington (w) and Political (P) categories
</P>
<P>
   By Bob Deans
</P>
<P>
   Cox Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After accusing his Republican foes on Capitol Hill
of turning their backs on the rest of the world, undermining the
national economy and attacking the nation's teachers, police,
environment and the poor, President Clinton suddenly shifted gears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to work with Congress,'' Clinton said Thursday,
standing beneath the crystal East Room chandeliers during an
hourlong White House press conference. ``We can put an end to
reckless partisanship, to gimmicks and gamesmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes Clinton's political nemesis, Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., called his own press conference on
Capitol Hill. Not only are he and Clinton not working together,
Lott stressed, they're not even speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I talked to the president about the budget and
the appropriations bills was the middle of July,'' Lott fumed.
``Hadn't had a single call from him, not any contact, no
suggestions, other than a few missiles fired over from the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the state of relations these days between the respective
banner carriers of the Democratic and Republican parties and, of
more immediate import, between the president and the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's acrimonious,'' said presidential scholar Wayne Steger.
</P>
<P>
   ``My big question is, 'Are they ever going to, as long as
Clinton is in the White House, be able to work together and
compromise,''' wonders Steger, a political science professor at
Chicago's DePaul University in Chicago. ``I'm not sure that's going
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It's increasingly unlikely to happen in the week ahead. Next
Thursday is the latest deadline set for Clinton and the Congress to
complete work on the discretionary spending bills guiding the $1.8
trillion federal budget for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That work should have been finished by the start of the fiscal
year, Oct. 1. After extending the deadline for three weeks, Clinton
is expected to sign another temporary spending measure, called a
continuing resolution, to keep the government hobbling along for
another week or so in the hope that the White House and the
Congress might finally come to terms.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing particularly new about partisan confrontation.
The annual budget wrangling makes fights between the White House
and the Capitol something of a rite of autumn. And politicians from
both parties are busy hardening their positions as part of the
posturing that precedes every presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to watch Clinton and the GOP-controlled Congress face off
and fall out utterly over issues ranging from tax cuts to health
care, from judicial nominations to the fate of the world's nuclear
non-proliferation efforts in the short space of several weeks is to
wonder what chance there is for the sort of comity and compromise
generally thought to form the heart and soul of politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just no give and take, there's no willingness to sort
of bend the other guy's way at all,'' said political science
professor Cary Covington of the University of Iowa in Iowa City.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly two terms of idealogical bickering hardened by the
polarizing impact of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, said Covington,
``The president's just worn out his welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the executive and legislative branches aren't
completed paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly half of the 13 spending bills for 2000 have made their
way to the White House, and been signed, even as Clinton vetoed the
centerpiece of the Republican budget agenda: a $792-billion tax
cut.
</P>
<P>
   The core of Clinton's so-called ''patients' bill of rights,''
strengthening consumers' hand in dealing with health maintainence
organizations, has passed the House. Though the White House remains
unsatisfied with a similar Senate version, there's room for
possible compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Lott promised Friday to move expeditiously toward a vote on a
pair of low-bore trade bills aimed at boosting U.S. commerce with
impoverished African and Caribbean states.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton insists his door is open to Republicans willing to
sit down and negotiate tax and budget priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president wants to get things done,'' said White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart. ``He is not someone who relishes
confrontation. He relishes cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, seven years of bitter fighting over policies,
priorities and personalities have left Clinton and the Congress all
but immobilized on a host of bigger picture issues ranging from
Social Security and Medicare reform to tobacco tax hikes and
teacher hires.
</P>
<P>
   The situation threatens to leave Clinton, with 15 months left in
the White House, as a classic lame duck: unable to work with
Congress enough to advance his centrist agenda in the twilight of
his term.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts cite several reasons for the malaise.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans alike appear in recent years to have
migrated away from the sort of centerline policies and attitudes
that foster compromise. That trend has been accentuated by the
onset of presidential politicking, Steger said, as leaders in both
parties begin to perceive greater gains from sticking to their guns
than from the sort of split-the-difference horse trading required
to get things done in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And so, when Clinton said last month he was willing to go along
with up to $300 billion in tax cuts _ a good reason to believe he
might be persuaded to accept slightly more _ Republicans decided it
would be better to stiff the president and force him to veto their
larger package, a move that's certain to feature prominently in
next year's Republican campaign ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can't get what they want,'' Steger said, ``at least
they can score points with their Republican constituencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, though, there's been something more to
the equation than politics.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton looks down Pennsylvania Avenue toward Capitol Hill,
he's facing 223 Republicans in the House and another 50 in the
Senate who voted to remove him from office. The House prevailed,
forcing him to go down in history as only the second president in
the history of the republic to be impeached, while the Senate
narrowly acquited on a distinctly party-line vote.
</P>
<P>
   Despite public appeals from both sides to move on, Clinton
remains mindful of those who threw a spear at the king, just as his
opponents can't forget how narrowly he slipped the noose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their ability to speak and be civil and polite and sympathetic
and listen to each other, thahas to have been compromised by
this experience,'' said Covington, an expert on
presidential-congressional relations. ``Their willingess to give
this president any benefit of the doubt appears unlikely.''

   ACCRED: Missouri joins a growing number of states to intervene
in struggling urban school districts. So far, such efforts have
produced mixed results. While the intervention helps ensure that
the districts clean up their finances, fix their buildings and
eliminate favoritism in hiring, there's not a lot of evidence that
yanking accreditation does anything to improve what's going on in
the classroom, according to various studies and education experts.
We share the experience of cities that have been through this, such
as Cleveland, Jersey City and Newark. We also touch on whether the
loss of accreditation by Missouri's two largest districts will harm
economic development and the state's efforts to rank among the top
public school systems in the nation by 2010. Photos, graphic. Phil

   PRESIDENT'S AGENDA THREATENED BY TENUOUS RELATIONS WITH CONGRESS
</P>

<P>
   Moving on Washington (w) and Political (P) categories

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After accusing his Republican foes on Capitol Hill
of turning their backs on the rest of the world, undermining the
national economy and attacking the nation's teachers, police,
environment and the poor, President Clinton suddenly shifted gears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to work with Congress,'' Clinton said Thursday,
standing beneath the crystal East Room chandeliers during an
hourlong White House press conference. ``We can put an end to
reckless partisanship, to gimmicks and gamesmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes Clinton's political nemesis, Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., called his own press conference on
Capitol Hill. Not only are he and Clinton not working together,
Lott stressed, they're not even speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I talked to the president about the budget and
the appropriations bills was the middle of July,'' Lott fumed.
``Hadn't had a single call from him, not any contact, no
suggestions, other than a few missiles fired over from the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the state of relations these days between the respective
banner carriers of the Democratic and Republican parties and, of
more immediate import, between the president and the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's acrimonious,'' said presidential scholar Wayne Steger.
</P>
<P>
   ``My big question is, 'Are they ever going to, as long as
Clinton is in the White House, be able to work together and
compromise,''' wonders Steger, a political science professor at
Chicago's DePaul University in Chicago. ``I'm not sure that's going
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It's increasingly unlikely to happen in the week ahead. Next
Thursday is the latest deadline set for Clinton and the Congress to
complete work on the discretionary spending bills guiding the $1.8
trillion federal budget for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That work should have been finished by the start of the fiscal
year, Oct. 1. After extending the deadline for three weeks, Clinton
is expected to sign another temporary spending measure, called a
continuing resolution, to keep the government hobbling along for
another week or so in the hope that the White House and the
Congress might finally come to terms.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing particularly new about partisan confrontation.
The annual budget wrangling makes fights between the White House
and the Capitol something of a rite of autumn. And politicians from
both parties are busy hardening their positions as part of the
posturing that precedes every presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to watch Clinton and the GOP-controlled Congress face off
and fall out utterly over issues ranging from tax cuts to health
care, from judicial nominations to the fate of the world's nuclear
non-proliferation efforts in the short space of several weeks is to
wonder what chance there is for the sort of comity and compromise
generally thought to form the heart and soul of politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just no give and take, there's no willingness to sort
of bend the other guy's way at all,'' said political science
professor Cary Covington of the University of Iowa in Iowa City.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly two terms of idealogical bickering hardened by the
polarizing impact of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, said Covington,
``The president's just worn out his welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the executive and legislative branches aren't
completed paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly half of the 13 spending bills for 2000 have made their
way to the White House, and been signed, even as Clinton vetoed the
centerpiece of the Republican budget agenda: a $792-billion tax
cut.
</P>
<P>
   The core of Clinton's so-called ''patients' bill of rights,''
strengthening consumers' hand in dealing with health maintainence
organizations, has passed the House. Though the White House remains
unsatisfied with a similar Senate version, there's room for
possible compromise.

 &HT;    UPS earnings up 28% in third quarter
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ United Parcel Service reported a 28.5 percent increase
in third-quarter earnings, helped by a strong U.S. economy and
improving conditions overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's earnings announcement would be the last as a private
company for UPS, assuming shareholders approve a plan to go public.
Shareholders, most of whom are employees, will vote on the issue
Oct. 25 in Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   UPS expects to complete its planned public stock offering in
November if shareholders give it the green light, said spokesman
Norman Black.
</P>
<P>
   The Sandy Springs-based package delivery company earned $577
million, or $1.03 a share, in the three months that ended Sept. 30.
A year ago, UPS earned $449 million, or 81 cents a share. Revenue
rose 9 percent to $6.72 billion in the latest quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The company's domestic package delivery had operating profit of
$879 million in the third quarter, up 16.1 percent. The company
defines operating profit as revenue less operating costs, and
excluding interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
</P>
<P>
   International operations produced an operating profit of $38
million, against a loss of $15 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe and Asia had a very strong quarter,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Like competitor Federal Express, which reported its results last
month, UPS noted increasing fuel costs. Those costs rose $32
million, or 22.5 percent, in the latest third quarter, UPS said.
For the first nine months, fuel costs are up a lesser amount, by
$24 million, or 5.4 percent, the company added.

SOX HOPES TO NET TICKET SCALPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Red Sox were busy surfing the Internet on Friday. By the
time they were finished looking for what they wanted, a whole lot
of season tickets-holders figure to be caught in a ``net.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who has resold even a single ticket to these playoffs,
will have their season tickets taken away permanently,'' said Sox
public relations director Kevin Shea, passing on the direct word of
Sox CEO John Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our staff is going through the Internet right now,'' said
Shea, adding, ``and Major League Baseball is conducting its own
investigation. We are well aware of what has been going on, and we
are going to take the appropriate action.''
</P>
<P>
   Ticket scalping, in the guise of an auction, is what is going
on.
</P>
<P>
   The search by the Red Sox and MLB center on eBay, an Internet
auction site, which first started to gain attention Thursday when
four tickets to Saturday's classic matchup between Pedro Martinez
and Roger Clemens in Game 3 of the American League Championship
Series sold for $12,100.
</P>
<P>
   The tickets are in Field Box 34, Row K, Seats 1-4. If you own
those tickets. . . you don't anymore. These are prime seats,
located 10 rows back from the field between home plate and the Red
Sox dugout. The person that owns those seats as season
ticket-holders will lose them. The person that sold the seats will
also come under the scrutiny of the Internal Revenue Service, who
will be looking to collect taxes on the profit made by the seller.
The face value of the four tickets is $260, which means the seller
has realized a profit of $11,840.
</P>
<P>
   This is not just a random sale. As of Friday afternoon, there
were 86 people trying to ``scalp,'' sell for a profit, tickets to
this Red Sox-Yankee series in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Someone going under the name of ``boston-baseball-bob'' sold the
tickets to a doctor named ``Neil Pearson.'' The doctor should have
his head examined because no one else is bidding anywhere near what
he did, and there are tickets available all over eBay. Also, on the
street in Boston Friday, good seats were going for $1,500 each.
</P>
<P>
   One seller, looking for $4,400 for two tickets to Saturday's
game, couldn't get a single bid on eBay. While the top bid for
another set of two tickets was up to just $630, or $315 each. The
good doctor, paid at the rate of $3,025 per ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these tickets for sale, of the 86 listed, had no
bidders. The highest number of bidders on any set of tickets was
28. The price for four tickets to Sunday's game at Fenway, was up
to $1,025 dollars, with 15 people in the bidding.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox' policy under Harrington has been that anyone
selling tickets for profit would lose those seats. It was the same
notice sent to all season ticket-holders during the All-Star Game
in Boston in July.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox do not have control over all of the postseason
tickets. The American League office distributes tickets to each
team in the league, league officials, television and radio
advertisers, etc. This is why MLB security is also involved, to see
if anyone involved with the league, or teams in the league, has
been scalping tickets through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox late Friday afternoon were also considering removing
anyone from the ballpark who had purchased a scalped ticket. They
were garnering this information from the Internet, where you could
punch into the seller's account and get the exact location of the
ticket. The Red Sox were recording all of the seats by section, row
and seat number, and then researching their records to see who
those seats belonged to. If it turns out that they belonged to a
season ticket-holder, they will not be a season ticket-holder any
longer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, who have the same policy, said Friday they would
investigate their tickets being sold on the Internet. There were 34
Patriot sales available on eBay, and almost all of them for home
games. Dallas, Denver, and the Jets were the hot games remaining on
the Patriots' schedule. A top Patriots official said Friday night
that the team was investigating, and will pull the tickets from any
season ticket-holder found to be selling the tickets.

   This little story should tell you what kind of a guy Wilt
Chamberlain was. The Globe's Bob Duffy was doing a story with Wilt
about coming to the Bill Russell tribute in May, where the people
putting on the show wanted to fly Wilt in via a private jet that
would have cost $25,000. Wilt turned it down, saying he would pay
his own way because the event was for charity. And he did.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bates, who was the Patriots' trainer for years, starting in
1961, was close to Wilt when they were young. Bates was a Philly
guy, who knew Wilt through high school, college, and later as a
trainer with the Warriors, who changed their name to the 76ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilt was a nice guy,'' said Bates, who like everyone else that
knew him, was stunned with the news of Wilt's sudden death Tuesday.
``His death is surprising because he always kept himself in good
shape. When he was younger, he was a shy guy, but once he was in
the dressing room, he was very much one of the guys kidding around
with the other players. One year he won the MVP trophy in the
league (NBA) and he got a Volkswagen. Imagine that, 7-2, 300
pounds, a Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was working the game he scored 100 points in Hershey (Pa.).
When there was games in Hershey, I worked with the visiting team,
the Knicks that night. The arena had a lot to do with it. We played
in the Hershey Park Arena, and I remember the rims being loose. A
lot of guys on both sides scored big numbers in that game. Wilt got
59 in the second half. They couldn't stop him. When he made up his
mind to go to the basket, that was it. But he loved that fadeway
jump shot, and the teams we played loved him to take it. He could
do anything but shoot fouls. One day after practice I bet him $5
dollars I could beat him shooting fouls. He got 5 of 10. I got 8 of
10. When it was all over, Dolph Schayes, who was the coach at the
time, came over to me and says, `Bill, would you mind not beating
our star player shooting fouls? It doesn't do any good for his
confidence.' I remember one year, Guy Rodgers, who used to lead the
league in assists, telling Wilt he didn't pass the ball enough. So
Wilt led the league in assits the next year (1967-68).
</P>
<P>
   ``He never got the credit he deserved. Someone told me that
Michael Jordan holds three NBA records, and Wilt holds 58. If he
had the players around him, that Russell had in Boston, Wilt would
have won all those championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Russell, he left Boston and working with the Celtics
to attend Wilt's funeral. It is nice that they patched up the
friendship before Wilt died. Wilt was mad at Russell after Bill
knocked him for not finishing the seventh game of the championship
series vs. Boston in 1969. The Celtics beat the Lakers, and Wilt,
injuring his knee, couldn't play the closing minutes of the game.
Russell critized Wilt for that and Chamberlain wouldn't talk to him
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Russell went to lunch with Antoine Walker while he was here,
talking about a commitment to winning and how to make the team, and
his teammates, better. Russell said he asked Walker to lunch
because he wanted to go with a millionaire, in a millionaire's car.

   If the town fathers of Foxborough think they have the Patriots

Foxborough. That's the deal. It won't happen. Some in Foxborough
feel they can vote in a stadium without the access road, and that's
good enough, but they are wrong. The league is already mad because
it thought this entire deal would be finished by now, and a new
stadium would be under construction and ready for the 2001 season.

NOTHING MINOR ABOUT MOUNT UNION'S SHOT AT SUPPLANTING SOONERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
Nothing minor about Mount Union's shot at supplanting Sooners
<TEXT>
<P>
   Either way, Otterbein College will be part of history today. The
Cardinals will either be the team that ends Mount Union's winning
streak. Or they will be the Purple Raiders' 48th consecutive
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Union's 47-game streak equals Oklahoma's in the 1950s for
the longest streak in college football history.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Otterbein plays at Mount Union. For the home team, it's a
chance to make history. For the visitors, it's a chance to simply
assert themselves as a team to be reckoned with in the Ohio
Athletic Conference. The Cardinals (4-1, 3-1 overall) haven't had a
winning season since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``We happen to be playing Mount Union by the luck of the draw,''
Otterbein coach Wally Hood said. ``We just happened to be the team
sitting here, playing this team at this time when they're trying to
set a record. For us, the record doesn't mean a thing. Fifty years
from today, kids will be able to say they played in that game, win
or lose. But for us, it's a game that could put us in first place
in the Ohio Athletic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we beat Mount Union, we're tied for first with destiny in
our hands. Our goal for 1999 was to have the best record at the
school in the last 16 years. We're not trying to win a game to stop
a streak. We're trying to win to be No. 1 in our conference.''
</P>
<P>
   The Purple Raiders have won the past three NCAA Division III
national championships. They have become a small-school power. And
with that comes the Bull's Eye Syndrome. Everybody is gunning to
end the streak. Two weeks ago, John Carroll, also an Ohio Athletic
Conference school, nearly did the deed. Mount Union needed three
overtimes to survive and continue the winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never feared losing a game,'' Mount Union coach Larry
Kehres said. ``We have feared losing ground in the conference race,
because winning the title leads to so many other good things, such
as getting into the national playoffs. But we overcome fear
associated with losing by teaching our players to be consistent and
poised.''
</P>
<P>
   Otterbein will be no pushover. Mount Union is leading Division
III in total offense (587 yards per game) and scoring (55 points
per game), but the Cardinals are 13th in total offense and are
averaging 36 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otterbein's an up-and-coming team in our league,'' Kehres
said. ``They've had a couple of big victories and a close loss
\R27-24 to John Carroll\S, and are a team that is confident they
can beat us. We've talked to our players about how difficult
Otterbein will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this isn't that big a deal. There are those who say this
is a major-league/minor-league comparison. That it is unfair to
compare Oklahoma's 47-game winning streak against major-college
competition to Mount Union's 47-game winning streak against
small-college teams.
</P>
<P>
   Hood doesn't buy that argument. A winning streak of that length,
in any sport, against any competition, is an outstanding
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you understand how good they've been it's amazing,'' he
said. ``But if you understand Mount Union's program, it's not that
amazing. Success breeds success at this level. This league is as
good as any in the country at Division III.''
</P>
<P>
   If Mount Union wins today and closes out the season with its
fourth consecutive Division III title, its winning streak will be
at 56, the same as Joe DiMaggio's hitting streak _ another record
that might never be broken. If the Purple Raiders lose, they will
have equaled a record most thought was unreachable.
</P>
<P>
   After Oklahoma's 47-game streak ended with a 7-0 loss to Notre
Dame in 1957, Sooners coach Bud Wilkinson told his team: ``This is
a record that will never be broken by a major-college team. The
only ones who never lose are the ones who never play.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the level of competition.
</P>
<P>
   LOTS OF VICK'S OFFENSE IS HOKIES' PRESCRIPTION
</P>
<P>
   When No. 16 Syracuse plays at No. 4 Virginia Tech today in a
crucial Big East Conference game, the Orangemen will be facing
redshirt freshman quarterback Michael Vick for the first time. But
Vick should look familiar. He's being compared to former Syracuse
quarterback Donovan McNabb, who was a four-year starter and a
dangerous run-pass, pass-run threat.
</P>
<P>
   Vick had been the missing piece in the Hokies' offense. With
running back Shyrone Stith (116 yards rushing per game) and a
receiving duo of Andre Davis and Ricky Hall, Virginia Tech needed a
trigger man. Last season, the team used three quarterbacks _
including a converted safety _ and relied on defense and special
teams play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's good enough right now to be in the Heisman Trophy race,''
Virginia Tech defensive end Corey Moore said. ``In my opinion he'll
be a Heisman Trophy winner in the next year or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick, a 6-foot-1, 211-pounder, has made the difference with his
ability to run and throw. He is completing 67 percent of his
passes, has thrown for five touchdowns and has rushed for 203
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so doggone happy to see McNabb graduate,'' West
Virginia's Don Nehlen said. ``But this guy Vick looks even better;
throws like a rocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech is 4-0 and is in position to have a shot at the
national championship. Syracuse's only loss came at home to
Michigan. This will be the Hokies' first big test. Last season, the
Hokies lost at Syracuse on a last-minute touchdown pass by ...
McNabb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively, they're so good,'' Virginia Tech coach Frank
Beamer said of Syracuse. ``We had a hard time moving the ball last
year, and it's going to be tough this year. Michael Vick is coming
along quickly; he's making better decisions and consistently doing
it, but I think he's going to have to make them faster this week.`'
</P>
<P>
   Vick's mother, Brenda Boddie, wanted her son to attend Syracuse
and become the next Donovan McNabb. Vick, instead, chose Virginia
Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be the next anyone,'' Vick said.
SIZE MATTERS
</P>
<P>
   When Wake Forest plays Florida State today, it will match one of
the nation's smallest schools against a perennial football
powerhouse. Wake Forest's enrollment is listed at 3,600; Florida
State's is 30,200. This week, one of the Demon Deacons' players
voiced his displeasure at playing the top-ranked Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything about them irritates me,'' Wake Forest linebacker
Dustin Lyman said. ``They could never possibly understand what it's
like to be like most other teams in the country, having to scratch
and claw for everything they get.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they play their games, they have little respect for
their opponents. They'll be doing halfback passes on their own
5-yard line. That kind of arrogance is, obviously, fun for them.''
TWO-WAY STREET
</P>
<P>
   Two coaches, two approaches, one game.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State coach Joe Paterno decided to limit to three the
number of Nittany Lions who could meet with the media this week.
No. 2 Penn State (6-0, 2-0) will be playing host to Ohio State in a
key Big Ten Conference game. Paterno, perhaps is beginning to tire
of his team's status and the media attention that draws.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ohio State coach John Cooper doesn't seem to have
much faith in his Buckeyes, who are 4-2, 1-1 and nearly
two-touchdown underdogs to the Nittany Lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can win the football game, but I think we have to
play far and away the best ballgame we've played so far this year
and probably have to have a little bit of help from Penn State
along the way,'' Cooper said. ``It's pretty obvious if we play our
best game and they play their best game and neither team makes any
mistakes, they'll probably win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper often has riled Buckeyes fans with his honest assessments
of his team. And this week, his players didn't particularly
appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's a fair assessment,'' wide receiver Reggie
Germany said. ``If that's the case, we don't need to play the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go over there with a winning attitude,'' defensive
tackle Mike Collins said. ``If we don't expect to win, we might as
well not go at all. Wow. That fires me up. It gets me a little
upset to hear that.''
AROUND THE NATION
</P>
<P>
   --Scott McInnis, a state representative from Colorado, plans to
sponsor legislation that will prevent athletes at the service
academies from dodging their five-year commitment to the military
in order to play pro sports. ``The bottom line is that this is
special treatment for athletes and not just any athlete, but the
top athletes,'' McInnis said. Former Air Force players Beau Morgan,
Steve Russ and Chris Gizzi all served less than five years in order
to play in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   --When No. 21 Brigham Young plays at New Mexico today, it will
match quarterbacks from the same high school. New Mexico's Sean
Stein was a year behind and served as the backup to BYU's Kevin
Feterik at Los Alamitos (Calif.) High School. Stein played a year
at Long Beach City College, where he threw passes to Jonathan
Pittman, who is now one of BYU's top receivers.
</P>
<P>
   --There's not much buzz to the Southern California-Notre Dame
game today. While this is regarded as one of the nation's best
intersectional rivalries, neither team is ranked. That's only the
seventh time in 71 meetings that has been the case, but it's the
second time in the past three seasons that neither team has been
ranked when they played each other.
</P>
<P>
   --Max DeLuca, a punter for NCAA Division III Baldwin-Wallace,
was involved in a statistical oddity in Saturday's game with Ohio
Northern. He punted 10 times and his net average (46.3 yards)
exceeded his gross average (45.7). Three of his punts were returned
for a negative 6 yards, and two were fumbled.
</P>
<P>
   --According to research by The Associated Press, the last time
that the Pacific-10 Conference didn't have a team ranked was Oct.
6, 1985 (when the AP ranked 20 teams). Southern California dropped
out of the top 25 this week. The last time the Pac-10 didn't finish
with a team in the final AP rankings was 1963, when only 10 teams
were ranked.
</P>
<P>
   --Now you know, Part One: Illinois claims to have staged the
first homecoming on the weekend of Oct. 14-16, 1910. In the first
homecoming game, the Illini beat the University of Chicago, 3-0.
Illinois has celebrated homecoming for all but one of the past 89
years (the 1918 event was canceled because of a flu outbreak).
Today, Minnesota plays at Illinois in this year's homecoming game.
</P>
<P>
   --Now you know, Part Two: In Temple's 24-14 victory over Boston
College, Owls freshman defensive end Dan Klecko had six tackles,
including two sacks. He's the son of former New York Jets defensive
lineman Joe Klecko, who also attended Temple. OVERHEARD

<P>
   John Cappelletti, who won the Heisman Trophy for Penn State in
1973, on the arrest and suspension of Florida State's Peter
Warrick:
</P>
<P>
   ``Has the Heisman become, `If I win it, fine, if I don't, I'm
still going to be the fourth pick and make $50 million?' I think
it's getting that way. I think money starts to overshadow the fact
you were chosen the best player in the country.`

   North Carolina quarterback Ronald Curry, who will be out six
months after surgery to repair a torn Achilles' tendon, putting his
availability to the Tar Heels' basketball team this season in
doubt:

<P>
   ``I'm all right emotionally. I'm a strong believer that
everything happens for a reason. Maybe I need this rest. I haven't

   Minnesota coach Glen Mason on a holding call on a second-down

   ``I've been around here almost three years, and you don't hear
me whine very much, but I tell you one thing, fellas. It's amazing
to me that you watch 60 minutes of football without a holding call,
not one, and you go into overtime and one flies. It's truly
amazing. I hope it really was a holding penalty. I really do.''

PATIENCE PAYS OFF FOR TEXAS A&AMP;M'S BERNARD (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Sometimes, the best counsel for a
friend in need is the unspoken word. Show support in your actions,
but suggest no solutions unless asked.
</P>
<P>
   That worked wonders for Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum in dealing
with tailback Eric Bernard. The fifth-year senior averages more
yards per carry (5.3) than any tailback on the Aggies' depth chart
and figures to be a central figure in the gameplan for today's
11:30 a.m. contest against Kansas in Kyle Field.
</P>
<P>
   But that hardly seemed a likely scenario at this point last
year, when Bernard considered ending his football career and Slocum
stood ready to second the motion. Slocum said he is glad Bernard
never asked his opinion on what to do after suffering a
season-ending knee injury for the second time in 14 months on Oct.
4, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard, A&AMP;M's third-team tailback at the time, tore the
anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee while preparing for a
game against Nebraska. During two-a-days before the 1997 season, he
tore the ACL in his right knee. Both injuries required
reconstructive surgery and a minimum of 10 months in
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I had the second one, I started thinking, `Why am I even
trying to play football?,''' said Bernard, who contemplated telling
Slocum that he planned to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he'd asked for my advice, I'd probably have advised him to
do that,'' Slocum said, reflecting on the prospect of a downcast
Bernard rehabilitating a different knee in hopes of playing in a
crowded backfield. ``I really was at a loss for words. He was so
dejected. The year before, I'd given him my best pep talk about
coming back. ... Now, he's facing more surgery. He's got one more
season to play football and the rest of his life to do something
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great example of a guy who had every reason to throw in
the towel and wouldn't do it. I'm so proud of Eric.''
</P>
<P>
   When No. 13 A&AMP;M (4-1, 1-1) meets Kansas (2-4, 0-2), Bernard is
expected to handle the brunt of the carries because of injuries to
starting tailback Dante Hall (back) and fullback D'Andre Hardeman
(groin). Bernard rushed for 81 yards on 15 carries and scored his
first touchdowns since the 1996 season in last week's 45-13 rout of
Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the Baylor game, Bernard had 127 rushing yards in
A&AMP;M's previous 31 games. Now, he leads A&AMP;M tailbacks in rushing
yards (168) and rushing average (5.3) at the midpoint of his final
season. Although the master plan calls for Hall (156 yards, 3.1
average) to return to his starting spot when healthy, Bernard has
given A&AMP;M coaches some food for thought when distributing playing
time in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum said Bernard, even after two rounds of knee surgery,
``looks like the player we always thought he could be. That's quite
an accomplishment for someone who's hardly played for three
years.''
</P>
<P>
   To teammates, he stands as an inspiration. Offensive guard Chris
Valletta said the guys in the trenches tend to play harder when
they know Bernard will be carrying the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do our best job for him. He deserves it,'' Valletta
said. ``What Eric did shows so much character and so much heart. He
knows what it means to not play football. He had it taken away
twice. He runs every play like it's the last time he'll ever touch
the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard said he developed that determination during his second
stint of rehabilitation. It began while contemplating his departure
from football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prayed a lot and got my answer. All that hard work and the
negative things I've gone through made me grow up,'' said the
5-foot-9, 190-pounder from Tulsa, Okla. ``It's been worth it. I
didn't know how much I'd play this year, but I knew I wanted to get
back in position to where I could help, if \Rcoaches\S needed me.
This is my last year to play football. So I wanted to put every
ounce into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, that's proved to be enough to inspire teammates and
keep an A&AMP;M ground game headed in the right direction during a
difficult stretch with injuries. Quarterback Randy McCown said
there's a deeper lesson here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric's a great example of good things happening to good
people,'' McCown said. ``He's been back in the shadows and could
have griped about a lot of things that went against him. But he
never did. He kept his nose to the grindstone, and it's paying off.
He deserves every bit of credit he gets about making us a better
football team.'' nn

 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In one long day of their regional tour, American
executives were whisked into an unscheduled meeting with Prime
Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and chauffeured by armored vans into
a walled Ramallah compound to break bread with Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian market will be a free market,'' Arafat,
attired in his traditional keffiyah and olive-drab military garb,
promised the potential investors as they sat for a sumptuous Middle
Eastern feast.
</P>
<P>
   The visit marked the first U.S. Department of Commerce business
mission to the Middle East to include the West Bank, part of an
American effort to reward regional peacemakers with investment and
trade.
</P>
<P>
   So far this effort has met with only limited success, American
officials concede. But they assert that one major obstacle has been
removed: the previous Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who
resisted pressure to ease the movement of Palestinian and Jordanian
goods through Israeli security checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulty in the last government kind of blocked
everything,'' said Commerce Secretary William Daley, who led the
delegation. In the first three months of the Barak government,
Daley said, Israeli trade officials have demonstrated a new
willingness to work with Palestinian and Jordanian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings this week, the American visitors, who included
executives from Merck &AMP; Co., Lucent Technologies and Enron, heard
Israeli officials promising to do more to help the Jordanian and
Palestinian economies, and implicitly recognizing that they have
obstructed trade in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In response, they also heard Jordanians and Palestinians
acknowledging that they cannot entice investment and trade without
addressing their own problems, including a rigid bureaucracy and
the flaunting of intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most encouraging, Israeli and Palestinian trade
officials politely suggested they no longer need such active
American mediation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tone was so different,'' said Daley, who was paying his
third extended visit here in less than a year. ``They said we
appreciate your doing this, but we have our relationships. Our
ministries are talking back and forth every day on specific
problems and issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference comes from the top,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in Amman, Jordan, last weekend, the Commerce delegation
moved on to Israel and the Palestinian territories, and then Cairo,
for the first joint gathering of the Jordanian, Israeli,
Palestinian and Egyptian chambers of commerce. Officials hope the
regional meeting will help set the agenda for a Middle Eastern
economic summit meeting tentatively scheduled for Egypt next
spring. Past plans for annual regional business conferences were
suspended after Arab complaints about Netanyahu's stance on peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Daley and other American officials have sought to
coax Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority to eliminate
barriers to cross-border trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, for its part, gave the Palestinians duty-free
access to the U.S. market, a status previously enjoyed only by
Israel, Mexico and Canada. But intraregional trade remains
marginal, and cross-border business ventures are rare. Despite
three years of free trade privileges, Palestinian exports to the
United States are still so paltry that they do not even show up in
Commerce Department statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Though much has to do with the quantity and quality of export
goods, American officials agree with Palestinian merchants who say
their problems have been compounded by stringent and sometimes
seemingly arbitrary security measures at Israeli ports and customs
posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have a duty-free, quota-free relationship with the
United States, but if you can't get your goods to a port, it's
pretty tough,'' Daley said. ``If you don't have a free flow of
people and goods, you don't have an economy.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jordan, the immediate concerns are Israel's quotas on its
exports to the West Bank _ once Jordanian territory _ and its
requirement that these goods be meticulously inspected and reloaded
onto Palestinian or Israeli trucks. Despite repeated Israeli
pledges to ease these restrictions, Jordan's exports to the West
Bank remain stalled at an insignificant $20 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Daley says some Israeli rules have more to do with protectionism
than security. ``There is a $2.5 billion market in the West Bank
and Gaza that a lot of people would like to keep a stranglehold
on,'' he said.

TEXAS AIMS TO IMPROVE OUTSIDE SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas basketball coach Rick Barnes said he hopes there is one
constant from last season, and he's not just talking about the
Longhorns winning another Big 12 title.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hope is that teams defend us like they did a year
ago,'' Barnes said as the defending conference champions prepared
to open practice tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Division I-A schools can begin basketball practice after
midnight tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' inference is that such a strategy could _ and should _
backfire for teams that expect to reprise the sagging, inside
double-team strategy to stop the Longhorns' top player, center
Chris Mihm.
</P>
<P>
   Texas couldn't counter that strategy last season because of a
lack of consistent outside shooting. Barnes vowed to correct that
flaw and believes that he has by signing guards Lawrence Williams,
Darren Kelly and Roosevelt Brown and guard/forward Chris Ogden. He
has also worked with Mihm and senior forward Gabe Muoneke in the
open court and added some wrinkles to his offense to take advantage
of their outside shooting ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be a better shooting team than we were a year ago,''
Barnes said. ``I am excited about our new guys. And to be honest,
some of them were underrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Blending the new _ which includes sophomore forward Chris Owens
_ with returning starters Mihm, Muoneke and point guard Ivan Wagner
will be the main focus of the Longhorns' preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner reportedly looks like a new player after having
arthroscopic surgery on his left knee. Brown is expected to be his
backup, although Barnes said all three of his new guards are good
ball handlers. Williams _ who is described as a slasher with
3-point range _ will probably open as the shooting guard. He, Kelly
and Ogden can double as shooting guards and small forwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches have high expectations for all \Rthe new players\S
right off the bat,'' Mihm said. ``And I've been really, really
impressed with everyone they've brought in. The new players have

<P>
   Owens, 6-foot-8, sat out last season after transferring from
Tulane. He will combine with the 7-foot Mihm and 6-7 Muoneke to
give the Longhorns a formidable rebounding and scoring trio.
</P>
<P>
   Texas fans again can expect a contender _ as can those of
Kansas, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State and maybe Missouri. All made the
NCAA Tournament field last season and have received preseason Top
25 mention. nn

THREE FORMER PLAYERS ALLEGE PHYSICAL, VERBAL ABUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three former women basketball players at the University of
Massachusetts, all of whom left the team due to problems with coach
Joanie O'Brien, sued the university in federal court Friday,
charging they were subjected to physical and verbal abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Kara Trent, Nicole Vallieres and Tori Grant, and the parents of
the three players, are seeking $15 million in damages. The civil
rights suit filed in U.S. District Court in Boston charges O'Brien
constantly harassed, intimidated and degraded them during their
brief stint at the university and that school officials did nothing
to stop it. Those are violations of Title IX as well as the NCAA
Constitution, the suit charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a hostile environment and the university didn't do a
thing about it,'' said attorney Brian J. Woolf, who represents the
women and their families. ``There was unwanted and excessive
touching, yelling and screaming, and the result was that all three
suffered severe emotional hardship.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from the university. A call
placed to the office of associate counsel, Deirdre Heatwole, who
had a brief communication with Woolf last June, was not returned.
In addition to the university, 12 individuals are named as
defendants including O'Brien, Chancellor David Scott, UMass
President William Bulger and Athletic Director Robert Marcum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no verbal communication of any substance,''
Woolf said. ``My opinion is that the university is putting its head
in the sand and hoping it goes away. Well, it's not going away.''
</P>
<P>
   Trent, Vallieres and Grant were teammates on the 1997-98 UMass
team. Trent and Vallieres, both freshmen at the time, were on the
active roster while Grant, a transfer from Seton Hall, practiced
with the team while sitting out the season due to NCAA transfer
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Trent, who emerged as a starter during that season, subsequently
left the team at the start of her sophomore year over differences
with O'Brien. Grant was kicked off the team for violating team
rules. Vallieres transferred to Division II American International
College, where she played last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe reported on the problems the women had with O'Brien in
a Dec. 13, 1998 story. At the time, O'Brien dismissed the women's
charges and said it was simply a matter of her coaching style,
which she admitted was intense.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs think it goes further than that. All three
players have needed counseling because of their basketball
experiences at UMass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be done,'' said Robert Cernik, Vallieres' mother.
``For what Nicky went through. For what we, as parents, went
through. I lost my daughter for a year. One whole year.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Kara Trent, ``I grew up playing basketball and it was
something I loved. Once I got to the UMass campus, all that changed
severely. This is what goes on behind closed doors at a lot of
colleges and it has to stop because it takes a lot away from the
game and it takes a lot away from us as people.''
</P>
<P>
   While the three women each cite O'Brien's behavior as abusive,
ranging from streams of profanity to pushing, grabbing and shoving
the players, they also have independent claims in the 37-page
complaint. Trent also is alleging medical malpractice, charging the
university ignored a knee injury during her freshman season and
gave her inadequate medical care and advice. She subsequently
needed surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Grant said O'Brien accused her of being gay in a lengthy meeting
in the spring of 1998, six months before the coach dismissed her
from the team. In the fall of 1998, the complaint states that
O'Brien confronted Grant about rumors that the player had smoked
marijuana. Grant admitted to O'Brien she had done so on one
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien then dismissed Grant from the team although, the
complaint said, there was no such action taken against other
teammates who also admitted smoking marijuana. Grant also said she
was not offered any counseling following O'Brien's decision and
that her parents were rebuffed by Marcum when they asked to discuss
the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Trent is the only one of the three still at the university.
Grant is living at home in New Jersey, but plans to re-enroll at
UMass in January. Vallieres remains at American International.

BLIND, DISABLED WORKERS GET TEMPORARY REPRIEVE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Fore release Sunday, Oct. 17) 
 
By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The jobs of 1,400 blind and severely disabled &UR;  &LR; workers were
temporarily spared last week when the head of the General Services
Administration in Washington scuttled plans to phase out eight
government supply depots.
</P>
<P>
   The decision prolongs at least 150 manufacturing jobs at Texas
affiliates of the National Industries for the Blind, including
Lighthouses for the Blind in Houston and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The Lighthouses have been reliant on government contracts for
decades, employing blind and severely disabled people who make
products ranging from pencils to floor polish, all used in federal
offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very, very pleasantly surprised,'' said San Antonio
Lighthouse president Bob Plunkett.``It gives us time to find other
options and be better prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Technological changes, the Internet and greater privatization of
supply systems were cited by GSA administrator David J. Barram in
July when he ordered the closing of eight regional depots that
funnel supplies to federal agencies. One of the depots is in Fort
Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Almost overnight, the decision caused a drop in orders and lower
income at dozens of NIB affiliates, including those in Texas. At
the San Antonio Lighthouse, where office supplies are made, about
25 blind part-time workers were dismissed last month. Supply
officials said they were so well stocked with some items, they
couldn't justify placing new orders.
</P>
<P>
   About 120 full-time workers at the San Antonio Lighthouse have
been on a voluntary four-day work week since August, and officials
there were bracing for more manufacturing layoffs in coming months
due to the downturn in orders. Houston has about 30 blind workers
whose jobs were endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Barram announced Wednesday that he had reached a pact with the
federal employees union ``to examine the problems and directions in
our distribution system.'' A final decision should come by the end
of this month, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Union president Bobby L. Harnage said the depot shutdown was
opposed by federal workers because ``it did not appear economically
justified and because it failed to respect the interests of the
blind, the handicapped, victims of disasters and U.S. military
forces overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   The reprieve may be postponing the inevitable, though, according
to a blind man in Houston who advocates placement of blind workers
in service jobs over low-paying assembly tasks.
</P>
<P>
   James O. ``Jim'' Skelton, Jr., president of the Houston Chapter
of the National Federation of the Blind of Texas, said the
Lighthouse approach is sometimes outmoded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked there 11 years and I got laid off and I'm glad I
did,'' said Skelton, who is now a computer instructor at Houston
Community College. ``A lot of blind people are not getting out and
reaching their potential.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The workers _ they're not sharing in the profits,'' he said.
``You get in there and you say, `I can't do any better than this,'
and so they're stuck and all of a sudden they're put out to
pasture.''

 &HT;    Bush outspends all foes, still has $38 million left
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The five most expensive presidential campaigns
already have spent $68 million, more than three months before the
first votes are cast and before heavy television advertising has
begun.
</P>
<P>
   At the same point four years ago, the top five campaigns had
spent $42 million.
</P>
<P>
   The latest campaign finance reports, filed Friday with the
Federal Election Commission, show Texas Gov. George W. Bush
continuing to obliterate records in his pursuit of the Republican
nomination. Bush has spent $19 million out of $57 million raised
through the end of September, leaving him with $38 million.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Steve Forbes also has spent nearly $19 million, but
most of that came from his own fortune.
</P>
<P>
   To get an idea of the scale of Bush's totals, Bush spent $7
million just to raise money. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), second to
Bush in polls in New Hampshire, has spent $7.3 million on his
entire campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was second among Republicans in contributions, raising $3
million in the past three months and bringing his total for the
year to $9.3 million. That includes $2 million he transferred from
his Senate campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's numbers obscure the robust finance operations on the
Democratic side, where Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley have spent $14.5 million and $8.5 million, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Gore continues to spend money at a faster rate than Bradley,
reporting expenses for the third quarter of $6.4 million, compared
to $4.2 million for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also has spread his money over many more states, including
Georgia, an indication of organizational strength that extends
beyond early primary states like New Hampshire, California and New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has spent more than $10,000 this year in only 10 states,
spending the most in New Jersey, site of his campaign headquarters,
Illinois, California and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, by contrast, has spent more than $10,000 in 34 states.
Gore has spent nearly $500,000 in California, a key primary and
general election state, and more than $330,000 in New York. Both
states hold primaries on March 7, as does Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has moved slightly ahead of Gore in terms of available
cash, $10.7 million to $10.3 million
</P>
<P>
   Despite the massive numbers posted by the campaigns and their
appeals to $1,000 donors, the candidates continue to paint
themselves as the choice of average, working Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore boasted an average contribution of $187. Bradley's figure
was $334, while Bush's was $386.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Republicans, Gary Bauer, Patrick Buchanan, Elizabeth
Dole and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah each raised more than $1million
from July to September, according to the Associated Press.

FLOOD OF SYMPATHY UPLIFTING, PASTOR SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (Wash. State ATTN.) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REBECA RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The hallway is draped in e-mail printouts,
posters, banners and poetry from all over the world, each
expressing a singular thought: You are loved.
</P>
<P>
   Peace has returned to this place.
</P>
<P>
   One month ago on Friday, Larry Gene Ashbrook walked down the
hall at Wedgwood Baptist Church in Fort Worth, shooting at church
members before entering the sanctuary and firing at hundreds of
young people gathered for a rally. He left seven dead, seven
injured, and a building scarred by blood and bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Now the scars have been replaced with sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I walk into church and I see the new banners and
letters hanging on the walls, I'm encouraged,'' said Wedgwood's
pastor, Al Meredith.
</P>
<P>
   The families of the victims are equally touched.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only word we can come up with is `overwhelmed,''' said
David Griffin, whose 14-year-old daughter, Cassandra, was killed in
the shooting. ``We're at a loss as to how to show our gratitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin said he and his wife, Tralissa, learned this week that a
circle of trees was planted in Israel in memory of the slain. And
shortly after the shooting, grocery stores donated trays of
prepared food and paper goods and the Tandy Corp. donated cellular
phones to the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   In the quiet hallways of Wedgwood, one senses the jarring
juxtaposition of pain and compassion born of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 feet from where Kevin Galey, a 38-year-old church
counselor, was wounded hangs a brightly colored mosaic of messages
from students at Oakmont Elementary School, a few miles from the
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this won't bring back (those) who died, but I'm
sorry,'' read the words, scrawled on a bright yellow sheet of
construction paper. ``I hope they go to heaven. From: Bridgette.''
</P>
<P>
   A letter from the Mount Baker Baptist Association in Sedro
Woolley, Wash., north of Seattle, is posted steps from where Sydney
Browning was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted them to know that someone outside the state of Texas
cares about them,'' said Mary Davis, who works at the association.
``I thought if, heaven forbid, this should happen to us, how much
we would appreciate the rest of the world praying for and thinking
about us.''
</P>
<P>
   And in front of the church, an unknown donor has arranged eight
metal crosses bearing the names of the dead, including Ashbrook,
who fatally shot himself after he ended his rampage.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the overwhelming number of messages displayed at
the church, more than $100,000 has been raised through memorial
funds, and proceeds from several planned concerts and benefits are
going directly to the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   Near the entrance to the sanctuary, a bold orange poster
proclaims, ``We've Been There 2 _ Littleton, Colo.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly six months since a tragic shooting at
Columbine High School near Littleton snuffed out the lives of 12
students and a teacher. The two student shooters also wounded 22
people and then turned the guns on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And the love keeps pouring in, said Rick Kaufman, director of
communications for the Jefferson County Public School District,
which includes Columbine High.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still get letters, cards, e-mails, flowers, teddy bears,''
Kaufman said. ``And millions of dollars have been distributed''
through individual and corporate funds set up after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman said the spontaneous outpouring of affection filled a
large section of Clement Park, which adjoins the school. The
district eventually rented an empty store in a shopping center to
store the items and has moved everything to a federal warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The compassion has helped the community feel loved, Kaufman
said, but there are times when the media revisit the nightmare at
Columbine, forcing people to relive a day that changed many lives.
</P>
<P>
   Several days ago, CBS TV aired a grainy clip of video taken by a
surveillance camera in the Columbine High cafeteria. It shows a
gunman kneeling in a rifleman's pose and firing across tables and
chairs. No bodies are shown and no deaths occurred in the
cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine what it's doing to some of the families,''
Kaufman said. ``Enough has been written about this that it does not
add any benefit, and the negative impact is far greater.''
</P>
<P>
   At Wedgwood, flowers still grace the front lobby, church
services are still attracting hundreds, and members feel loved,
Meredith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to know people from all over the world are praying
for us.''

IS INDONESIA INCHING TOWARD DEMOCRACY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The president's head snapped up in
surprise. In the middle of his speech late Thursday night, someone
was pointing a finger and shouting.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers were roughing up demonstrators on the streets outside,
shouted the man, a member of the electoral assembly listening to
the speech that could determine the political future of the
president, B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later another delegate interrupted with a shout
about the student demonstrators, and then another.
</P>
<P>
   As never before, the outside world was intruding into what for
decades was an insulated and oblivious political process. And the
process was responding, not only with shouts from the floor but
with the stirrings of innovative lawmaking that reflected public
demands for change.
</P>
<P>
   Both the violent demonstrations and the parliamentary session
continued Friday as delegates began presenting formal responses to
Habibie's speech, in which he sought their votes next Wednesday
when they select the next president. Most were harshly critical.
</P>
<P>
   Many people portray next week's vote as a choice between
candidates representing the past and the future, with Habibie's
main challenger, Megawati Sukarnoputri, seen as offering a fresh
start. But already the past is being left behind as Indonesia
experiments with representative democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Like two wary strangers, the country's government and its people
are inching tentatively closer together.
</P>
<P>
   In a gesture of respect that signaled the possibility of a new
relationship, the assembly's speaker, Amien Rais, walked into the
streets Thursday night and escorted four of the student
demonstrators inside to observe the session. A parliamentary
official said more students would be invited to attend in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is going on inside the assembly now is really very
important,'' said Daniel Lev, an expert on Indonesia who is a
professor at the University of Washington in Seattle. ``Whether you
want to call it a process of democracy or whatever, the point is
they are responding to some pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   These pressures, from the press, from newly formed civic groups
and most insistently from the students, are keeping alive an agenda
of reform that could have sunk, in Parliament, under the weight of
inertia and self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   The reform agenda is affecting not only the presidential
selection but a newly vigorous legislative process. Overshadowed by
the clamor of the presidential race, legislative committees are
drafting laws and constitutional amendments that would limit
presidential power and institute a degree of democratic checks and
balances.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the green-roofed parliament building, there is a sense of
excitement and empowerment as legislators work to craft the future
outlines of their government.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking a taboo, they are preparing to amend the constitution,
created when the nation was founded in 1945. Proposed changes would
limit a president to two five-year terms and hand over to the
legislature the power to pass laws.
</P>
<P>
   Among other issues, nine draft decrees address the reform of the
judiciary and law enforcement systems, which are now riddled with
corruption and are subservient to the president.
</P>
<P>
   The legislature has faced particular difficulty in formulating a
constitutional change that would relinquish Indonesia's claim on
East Timor, which it invaded in 1975 and which voted Aug. 30 to
become independent. After the vote, the people of East Timor were
terrorized by violent militias who drove them from their homes.
Because of the emotional heat of this issue, analysts say a
parliamentary vote could be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   The vigor of the current criticisms of Habibie may also partly
reflect this mood of liberation from the decades-long grip of the
autocrat, Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers, the airwaves and the assembly hall were filled
with criticisms of Habibie's speech, in which he sought to win
support by outlining what he said were the accomplishments of his
17-month term in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deceitful grandstanding,'' the English language daily Jakarta
Post called it, in what seemed a giddy break with the
obsequiousness that had been required during Suharto's 32-year
rule. The newspaper further characterized the address as
``pathetic;'' ``a shameless bid to stay in power,'' a display of
``arrogance and contempt towards our long-suffering people'' and
``nothing short of disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   When Suharto was forced to resign in May 1998, Habibie, as his
vice president, took over as an interim president. He did in fact
make a number of immediate democratic reforms, freeing the press
and labor unions, opening up the political process and setting in
motion the transition to a new elected leader that is now taking
place.
</P>
<P>
   The main criticisms of Habibie are that he failed to pursue a
corruption investigation against Suharto, that he allowed
corruption to continue and flourish, that abuses by the military
continued during his administration and that he created the debacle
of East Timor's independence vote.
</P>
<P>
   The distant shouts of students on the streets and the passions
of the newly empowered legislators seemed to drown out Habibie's
plea on Thursday: ``We have tried our best. I fully realize that we
cannot resolve the crisis _ which was an accumulation of damage and
problems over so long a time _ within 512 days.''

WHO WERE THE FIRST AMERICANS? BONES OF `KENNEWICK MAN'
INCONCLUSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (bl) 
 By TIMOTHY EGAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The prehistoric bones of Kennewick Man, found in the
banks of the Columbia River in Washington state three years ago and
hailed as one of the most significant archaeological finds of the
decade, cannot be linked to any modern American Indian tribes or to
Europeans, a scientific panel has concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The remains, estimated to be about 9,300 years old according to
earlier radiocarbon dating, most closely resemble Asian people,
particularly the Ainu of northern Japan, and to Polynesians from
the South Pacific, the scientists said. Both groups are descendants
of people from southern Asia, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are likely to hurt the case of American Indians
seeking to control the bones under a federal law that requires
native skeletal remains to be returned to people who can show
affiliation with them. But the conclusions also put a damper on
claims of some scientists and pagan religious groups that Kennewick
Man came from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Because Kennewick Man had features that seemed to be neither
modern American Indian nor contemporary Asian, the find has held
the possibility that it could lead a broader theory about how the
Americas were peopled.
</P>
<P>
   The new research, which was made public by the Interior
Department on Friday in response to a lawsuit by scientists who
want to study the bones, does little to resolve the ongoing
anthropological question of who were the first Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But some scientists said the new analysis bolsters the case that
some of the first Americans may have come to the continent by boat,
crossing the Pacific or following islands and the coast from north
of Japan to the Bering Sea and then south along West Coast of North
America. The Ainu, indigenous to the Sakhalin Islands of northern
Japan, were known as a maritime people.
</P>
<P>
   The long-held view has been that migration came from northern
Asia over a Siberian land bridge and then down the interior of the
continent by foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kennewick Man fits into an emerging pattern that these earlier
American people are not like the modern people of today,'' said Dr.
Joseph Powell, a physical anthropologist at the University of New
Mexico, and a member of the panel.
</P>
<P>
   If, as the studies indicate, Kennewick Man is not a distant
relative of modern Europeans or American Indians, then it points to
two interpretive conclusions, Powell said. One is that people from
Kennewick Man's age in the late Pleistocene era left no descendants
_ that they were wiped out at some point. The other is that they
had features from all over the Pacific Rim that have diversified
over time.
</P>
<P>
   The studies were done by comparing the skull size of Kennewick
Man with that of all the known ethnic groups. The closest match was
to Ainu and Polynesians. The most distant matches were to Africans
and Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Kennewick Man was found, with his skull and bones
more than 85 percent intact, a number of anthropologists speculated
that he was Caucasoid _ referring to people from Europe or
modern-day India. In a reconstruction of the skull by Dr. James
Chatters, the anthropologist who first analyzed the find, Kennewick
Man was made to look like Patrick Stewart, the British actor best
known from ``Star Trek: The Next Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's report debunks most of the ties to Cacaucasoid
background, when the term is meant to define people who live in
what is now Europe, the Middle East and India. ``When defined this
way, Kennewick is clearly not a Caucasoid,'' the panel concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Asatru Folk Assembly, a pagan religious group from
California which had claimed that Kennewick Man may have been a
descendant of ancient Norse people, will press forward with its
legal attempt to gain control of the bones, according to the
group's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still think there is a distinct possibility that it could
be a proto-European,'' said Michael Clinton, the attorney for the
pagan group. ``Next step is a DNA analysis. That's the bottom line
that will determine everything.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear if the judge hearing the case over Kennewick Man,
U.S. Magistrate John Jelderks will order DNA testing. But he has
given the government until March to decide whether the bones will
be open to a group of leading anthropologists for study.
</P>
<P>
   Indian tribes in the Columbia Basin area say Kennewick Man is an
Indian ancestor, and that his remains should be properly buried.
But in order to make such a determination, the government must find
``a shared group identity'' or a ``cultural affiliation'' with a
modern Indian tribe. The panel assembled by the government will do
a radiocarbon dating to check against the initial reports of
Kennewick Man's age, and may do DNA testing if ordered by the
court.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the bones are at the Burke Museum in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was made public today makes it very difficult for the
government to claim that Kennewick man belongs to modern Native
Americans,'' said Alan Schneider, a Portland, Ore., attorney who
represents eight scientists who are suing for access to the bones.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is an extremely important discovery,'' said Dr. Douglas
Owsley, who heads the physical anthropology section of the
Smithsonian Institute, and is a plaintiff in the lawsuit. ``We have
never said Kennewick Man was this or that. But we do feel that it
was far too important a discovery not to learn something from it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Umatilla Indian Nation, which claims Kennewick Man as a
descendant, did not respond to telephone requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Included in Friday's report was a compelling description of
Kennewick Man's age and health. He was described as a robust man of
45 to 50 years old, about 5 feet-9 inches tall, with no
deterioration of his joints. His bones are so well preserved that
he may have been deliberately buried, suggesting a funeral ritual
among the oldest in America.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had a 3-inch spear point imbedded deep in his
pelvis, the scientists say it was probably in him for a long time,
and never caused serious infection. ``He was one tough guy,'' said
Powell.

Cal touchdown stopped the music (For use by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
By CARLOS MENDEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The headline in the ``Berkley Gazette'' the next day was a
confession, and it best summed up the events of Nov. 20, 1982 on a
football field in Berkley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no words.''
</P>
<P>
   California's five-lateral kickoff return for a touchdown on the
last play of the game would be a stirring memory. But the
freakishness of the play _ the near tackle at the 44-yard line, the
leg cramp Mariet Ford suffered on the way to the end zone, the
Stanford trombone player crushed in the end zone _ lifted the
sequence from amazing to surreal.
</P>
<P>
   Cal-Stanford 1982 produced one of the most unbelievable plays in
college football.
</P>
<P>
   The 89th meeting of the Pac-10 schools looked like it would be
simply another entry in Stanford quarterback John Elway's Heisman
Trophy campaign. He had rallied Stanford from a 10-0 first-half
deficit to a 20-19 lead with four seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Play,'' as it's known around Cal, came next.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford had been penalized 15 yards for excessive celebration
after its go-ahead field goal, so Cal had at least a small
advantage for its kickoff return.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Stanford band had started making its way to the
south end of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Cal kickoff return captain Richard Rodgers told his teammates:
``Just keep lateraling the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Moen picked up the squib kick at the Cal 43-yard line and
took it into Stanford territory. He heard Rodgers yelling for a
lateral and fired a pass behind him that freshman Dwight Garner
caught at the Stanford 48.
</P>
<P>
   Garner was surrounded, and replays show his knee was close to
the ground as he lateraled to Rodgers at the Stanford 48. Without a
whistle, play continued.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the band had streamed on to the field.
</P>
<P>
   Upfield, Rodgers lateraled to Mariet Ford, who was about to
throw a block. Ford raced toward the end zone but suffered a leg
cramp on the way and pitched the ball behind him at the 25, where
Moen grabbed the final lateral.
</P>
<P>
   Moen weaved through the band and found the end zone, landing on
a trombone player, and waited for a ruling as 70,000 in the
stadium, both teams and the band stood around wondering, ``What
happened?''
</P>
<P>
   Touchdown, the officials said. Cal won, 25-20.
</P>
<P>
   Cal linebacker Ron Rivera had the final word: ``I still can't
believe it. It was an act of God.''

RECRIMINATIONS FLY IN WAKE OF TREATY'S DEFEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration and Democratic leaders
on Friday intensified their attacks on Republicans for defeating
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, but Republicans answered that
the oratory showed once again that Democrats were more interested
in a political issue than a treaty.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said that Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott had ``fixed the process'' to keep public
pressure from influencing senators while the Republican Party
committed itself to ``Fortress America isolationism.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said the United States had
been damaged and that Lott could have prevented it but felt boxed
in by conservatives in his party.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans focused their criticism on Vice President Al Gore
and the television commercial he started showing Thursday
condemning the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., for example, said the advertisement
confirmed Republican suspicions about Democratic motives. ``Who is
the first person out of the box to run a political ad?'' he asked
at a meeting with New York Times reporters and editors. ``I haven't
seen a Republican ad on the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, the Republican national chairman, denounced Gore
for ``shamelessly politicizing America's national security to
bolster his faltering campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   But the long-range implications of the vote _ whether it was
poisoned by antagonism between President Clinton and most Senate
Republicans or reflected a decisive retreat by the GOP from
cooperation on international security _ are beginning to attract
thoughtful attention.
</P>
<P>
   McCain faulted both Clinton and his own party for the bad
relations, and compared the situation to that of two cartoon
characters: The Republicans are Wile E. Coyote, he said, whose
single-minded pursuit of the Roadrunner, in this case Clinton,
caused the party to rush blindly off a cliff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we get so focused on the president that it has a
tendency to obscure, perhaps, what might even be in our own
interest,'' McCain said. He gave that as an explanation of why
Republicans went ahead with a treaty vote that many of them knew
was unwise.
</P>
<P>
   But he faulted Clinton, too, saying that ``he didn't call up
Trent Lott'' in a personal effort to work out a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination,
said, ``We have a poisoned atmosphere in Washington, which I think
can only be cured by a new administration.''.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But some students of diplomatic history were more inclined
toward Lockhart's view that Senate Republicans were rejecting
cooperation on international affairs, and would not be swayed by
smiles from the next occupant of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pastor, an Emory University political scientist who
worked on the Panama Canal treaties in the Carter administration,
said the antagonism between Clinton and Senate Republicans recalled
the battle over the League of Nations covenant in President Woodrow
Wilson's time, when Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge, R-Mass., and Wilson
``hated each other so much that they drove the country over the
brink.'' The Treaty of Versailles, which included the League of
Nations covenant, was rejected by the Senate in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   But Pastor said the feud is not the fundamental issue; rather,
it is an effort of the Republican Party to define itself in foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
   This week, as with the League of Nations vote, outright
isolationists joined with those who felt ``we have a role in the
world, and we are going to do it ourselves,'' he said. Any future
Republican president, he added, would be ``pulled back by that
isolationist wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles E. Jones, a retired political scientist at the
University of Wisconsin and a student of the Carter administration,
said he thought the week's events were essentially personal,
reflecting the contempt that Senate Republicans feel for Clinton.
``They simply don't trust him'' and do not respect his judgment on
foreign policy, he said. The senators' demand that Clinton promise
not to pursue the treaty next year, he added, was founded in a
belief that Clinton would try to make it a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   President Jimmy Carter started out facing some of the doubts,
Jones said, but ``he knew what he had to overcome.'' Carter
carefully enlisted support of past presidents for the Panama Canal
treaties and cultivated Sen. Howard Baker of Tennessee, the
Republican minority leader at that time. That last step, Jones
allowed, was easier than trying to cultivate Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Silbey, a Cornell historian, said the personal animosities
made things much worse but were not central. He called this week's
vote ``an extraordinary moment'' _ the first event since the end of
the Cold War that showed the divisions between Republicans who
believe in collective security and those who advocate a ``kind of
inward-looking, keep-America-safe-from-foreign-contamination''
approach.
</P>
<P>
   From the end of World War II until the dissolution of the Soviet
Union, he said, the collective security forces were in control, but
in the 1920s and '30s the isolationist forces dominated the
Republican party, and they were doing so again.
</P>
<P>
   There was no actual movement on the treaty Friday, but the
American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organ,
called a sudden symposium to explain why U.S. nuclear weapons
required occasional testing to provide a valid defense. Underground
nuclear explosions as part of a testing program would be banned
under the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   James Schlesinger, who was secretary of defense during the Nixon
and Ford administrations, said that without testing, confidence in
weaponry will certainly decline. ``Overall system reliability is
what gives the deterrent against major foes the level of confidence
that must be there,'' he said.

   From I.M.F. to IMF: A Trademark Battle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's a trademark dispute with a difference: A small California
mortgage bank and brokerage is being sued by, of all things, the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is the brokerage's name: IMF Loans Inc. ``My maiden
name is Eisenberg, which is German for `iron mountain,''' said Jan
Pasternak, the company's owner. ``So we started as Iron Mountain
Financial. But that is too long to be an Internet domain name, so
when we went on line, we shortened it.'' Ms. Pasternak didn't think
there would be any confusion. ``Nobody in the United States knows
what the IMF is, or cares,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There certainly is no overlap in customer base. The fund
supplies multibillion-dollar loans to member national governments
to help them stabilize currencies and capital flows; it cannot
legally lend to individuals. As for IMF Loans, ``Poland has never
applied,'' Ms. Pasternak said, adding that her company ``is just a
blip,'' with just $135,000 a month in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   So why sue? Kathleen White, a spokeswoman for the fund, said:
``There are an increasing number of fraudulent financial schemes
around the world where people use the fund's name or imply some
sort of connection, to mislead investors or add credence to some
product. We're not saying that is what is going on in this case.
But if we failed to take adequate measures, it could weaken the
protection of the trademark in general. We have to be consistent.''

JURY ORDERS DAMAGES FOR EXPERIMENTAL NUCLEAR TREATMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal jury Friday ordered Massachusetts General Hospital and
a retired neurosurgeon to pay $8 million in damages to the families
of two brain tumor patients who died 38 years ago from experimental
nuclear treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict could bolster efforts by lawyers for the families to
bring a class-action suit against the hospital and doctor on behalf
of another 60 patients who received the deadly treatments in the
1950s and 1960s as part of a government-funded cancer research
project.
</P>
<P>
   Wiping away tears after the jury awarded her $2.5 million,
Evelyn Heinrich of Westwood, whose husband George, 35, died from
the treatments in 1961, said, ``I have absolutely felt that the
passage of time has not diminished these crimes, not for one
minute. Human experimentation, what could be worse?''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Sienkewicz, whose family was awarded $5.5 million for the
1961 death of his mother, Eileen, said, ``We're grateful to the
jury for listening to us and believing in us.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing three weeks of testimony and deliberating for five
days in US District Court in Boston, the four-man, five-woman jury
found that MGH and its former chief of neurosurgery, Dr. William
Sweet, now 89, were negligent and caused the deaths of George
Heinrich and Eileen Sienkewicz. The jury rejected claims that the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which had also been named in
the suit, was also liable for the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Joseph L. Doherty Jr., who represents MGH and Sweet and
argued that they made a good-faith effort to save terminally ill
patients, said he will urge US District Chief Judge William G.
Young, who presided over the trial, to set aside the jury's
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a surprise based upon the evidence,'' Doherty
said. ``I think the amounts are excessive. It will be appealed.''
</P>
<P>
   But a team of lawyers from Washington, Vermont, Colorado, and
Massachusetts who represented the families, said the jury sent a
powerful message to the medical community that patients always come
first.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont Attorney Anthony Z. Roisman, who represents the
families, said ``good intentions are not enough,'' and medical
ethicists and review boards should prohibit experiments ``unless
it's clear that the benefits you are going to deliver are greater
than the risk you are going to cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you don't know, then go back to the drawing board.
Don't make the decision to experiment on patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accused MGH, Sweet, and MIT of using Heinrich and
Sienkewicz as ``human guinea pigs without their consent'' in
painful, unproven medical experiments that were of no therapeutic
value to them.
</P>
<P>
   Heinrich, the father of a 3-year-old daughter, and Sienkewicz, a
40-year-old mother of three, were afflicted with fast-growing brain
tumors when Sweet and MGH decided to administer boron neutron
capture therapy, an experimental treatment that was partially
funded by a grant from the US Atomic Energy Commission.
</P>
<P>
   They were injected with boron, a chemical that concentrates on
brain tumors, then placed in a nuclear reactor at MIT where they
were zapped by a neutron beam. The treatment destroyed their
tumors, but also scorched healthy brain tissue, hastening their
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a wonderful mother and a wonderful sister, and she
didn't deserve to die the way she died,'' said Sienkewicz's sister,
Marie Denning. ``She deserved to die with dignity and peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors rejected the claim that MGH and Sweet failed to inform
Sienkewicz and Heinrich about the procedure and get their consents,
but found they were negligent and wrongfully caused the deaths. The
jury rejected all claims against MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Attorney Owen Gallagher, who represents MIT, said, ``I'm
glad the jury recognized from the evidence that MIT entered into
this with the best intentions and were able to differentiate
between the two parties (MIT and MGH).''
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher said MIT provided technical assistance to MGH for what
it believed was promising therapy and its involvement was as
``experts in nuclear energy, not in medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for MGH, Sweet and MIT had argued unsuccessfully prior
to trial that the case should be dismissed because the claims were
so old. Massachusetts law in 1961 required malpractice claims to be
filed within two years. But the families said they didn't learn
details of the experiments until 1995 when the President's Advisory
Committee on Human Radiation Experiments released previously secret
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Roisman said they've learned that up to 200 patients
were injected with boron without their knowledge during the 1950s
and 1960s, while some 60 patients received the same treatment that
killed Heinrich and Sienkewicz.
</P>
<P>
   Roisman said he'll urge Young to allow him to file a
class-action suit on behalf of other victims. If the judge grants
that request, MGH and Sweet would be forced to identify other
victims who underwent the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Roisman is also ready to move forward with a negligence suit
against the federal government, on behalf of the families of
Heinrich and Sienkewicz, for funding the deadly treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was all government funded with taxpayers' dollars,'' said
Evelyn Heinrich. ``The public should know this.''

ARE THE GLORY DAYS OVER FOR THE DIP-BUYERS?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 17) 
</HEADLINE>

Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling (888)
603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.) 
(af) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Will they or won't they buy the dip?
</P>
<P>
   It has become a Wall Street truth that whenever share prices
drop, bargain hunters throng to the stock market, providing a floor
to equity prices and relief to damaged portfolios. Investors who
have courageously waded in to buy the dips in recent years have
saved many trading days from disastrous falls. And they've made big
dough doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, last week, the dip-buyers did a disappearing act.
The question is, will they be gone long?
</P>
<P>
   During the week, the markets certainly gave bargain hunters
plenty of opportunities to buy. The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 5.9 percent, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index fell
6.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some market strategists think that the week was an indication
that the days of the dip-buyer may be over. According to these
people, investors today are less likely to jump in when stock
prices fall.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons for this. Most important, the level of
cash that investors have on hand to put into the stock market is
low. For most of the major investor groups, cash reserves are near
the low end of their 45-year ranges, according to Christine A.
Callies, chief United States market strategist at Credit Suisse
First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, cash in American households stood at 3.59
percent of total financial assets, a new low and well down from
3.96 percent in the third quarter of 1998. Borrowings to buy
securities, meanwhile, are at a record $155 billion, compared with
$78.6 billion in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors have diminished cash holdings as well. Cash held
by managers of mutual funds stands at around 2 percent of funds'
total financial assets, down from 2.56 percent in the third quarter
of last year. And cash available for investment at non-life
insurance companies is 4.51 percent of total financial assets, the
lowest since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The only investors with a greater cash hoard are life insurance
concerns, a group not known for aggressive forays into stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Even if investors had more funds to devote to stocks, Ms.
Callies suspects that they would not be the asset of choice. ``I
think that some investors will still buy the dips but less than
would have been the case four or five months ago,'' she said.
``Confidence in high valuations tends to erode once investors
realize that interest rates are going up.''
</P>
<P>
   Dip-buyers have been AWOL in mutual funds as well. Robert Adler,
president of AMG Data Services, said equity funds had net outflows
of $1.1 billion in the seven days ended on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have also been abandoning high-yield bond funds, a
place where they had been happy to park their funds during previous
periods of market turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, for instance, when the Russian collapse roiled the
stock market, investors still felt comfortable putting money into
high-yield funds. But in the week ended on Wednesday, 168 funds
reported net outflows while 125 funds reported inflows.
</P>
<P>
   So, it seems that well before Thursday, when Alan Greenspan
wondered aloud whether investors were aware of increased risks in
stocks, mutual fund investors had been recoiling from risk.
</P>
<P>
   As Adler said: ``When the stock market collapsed last year,
money that left the equity markets was re-allocated to debt. This
October, there is no evidence of a re-allocation. Risk aversion is
spreading.''

FIXES TIME REFERENCE IN THIRD PARAGRAPH!
TEXAS AIMS TO IMPROVE OUTSIDE SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas basketball coach Rick Barnes said he hopes there is one
constant from last season, and he's not just talking about the
Longhorns winning another Big 12 title.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hope is that teams defend us like they did a year
ago,'' Barnes said as the defending conference champions prepared
to open practice tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Division I schools could begin basketball practice Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' inference is that such a strategy could _ and should _
backfire for teams that expect to reprise the sagging, inside
double-team strategy to stop the Longhorns' top player, center
Chris Mihm.
</P>
<P>
   Texas couldn't counter that strategy last season because of a
lack of consistent outside shooting. Barnes vowed to correct that
flaw and believes that he has by signing guards Lawrence Williams,
Darren Kelly and Roosevelt Brown and guard/forward Chris Ogden. He
has also worked with Mihm and senior forward Gabe Muoneke in the
open court and added some wrinkles to his offense to take advantage
of their outside shooting ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be a better shooting team than we were a year ago,''
Barnes said. ``I am excited about our new guys. And to be honest,
some of them were underrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Blending the new _ which includes sophomore forward Chris Owens
_ with returning starters Mihm, Muoneke and point guard Ivan Wagner
will be the main focus of the Longhorns' preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner reportedly looks like a new player after having
arthroscopic surgery on his left knee. Brown is expected to be his
backup, although Barnes said all three of his new guards are good
ball handlers. Williams _ who is described as a slasher with
3-point range _ will probably open as the shooting guard. He, Kelly
and Ogden can double as shooting guards and small forwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches have high expectations for all \Rthe new players\S
right off the bat,'' Mihm said. ``And I've been really, really
impressed with everyone they've brought in. The new players have
brought an aspect to our team we really needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens, 6-foot-8, sat out last season after transferring from
Tulane. He will combine with the 7-foot Mihm and 6-7 Muoneke to
give the Longhorns a formidable rebounding and scoring trio.
</P>
<P>
   Texas fans again can expect a contender _ as can those of
Kansas, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State and maybe Missouri. All made the
NCAA Tournament field last season and have received preseason Top
25 mention. nn

 &HT;    Bush preparing for media assault
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a sure sign that the airwave war is about to
begin, Gov. George W. Bush reported Friday that he has already
spent more than $1 million on his TV ad campaign that will begin in
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has sent $600,000 to WMUR, New Hampshire's dominant TV
station, for airtime. Bush, the frontrunner for the GOP
presidential nomination, also has paid more than $420,000 to
Maverick Media, the Austin-based company producing his ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sends a signal that we intend to spend money to be
communicating our message on their station,'' Mark McKinnon,
Maverick Media's president, said of the payment to WMUR. ``By doing
so early we are trying to get the premium time slots.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Friday report to the Federal Election Commission shows he
has raised more than $57 million since beginning his campaign in
March. He has spent $19 million, more than double the amount any of
his GOP opponents have raised. So far, the heaviest spending _ 37
percent of the $19 million _ has gone for fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   The production of TV ads and buying time to air them has eaten
up just 5 percent of the expenditures. By the time the campaign
ends, TV ads will become the largest single expense.
</P>
<P>
   The ad spending will be driven in party by his GOP foe Steve
Forbes. Forbes has collected only $4.5 million in contributions but
has dipped into his pocket for $16.3 million. Forbes has spent $19
million, including more than $4 million on TV ads. So far, the ads
have been self-promoting and on issues. The Bush campaign expects
that to change in coming weeks with Forbes airing ads challenging
Bush's record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to shy away from engaging in a robust
discussion,'' Forbes adviser Greg Mueller said Friday when asked if
anti-Bush ads will begin running soon. ``We are confident this has
boiled down to a Bush-Forbes race.''
</P>
<P>
   But new poll numbers indicate Arizona Sen. John McCain, who has
raised $9.3 million, could be the biggest beneficiary of a
Bush-Forbes crossfire, at least in the crucial New Hampshire
primary.
</P>
<P>
   A Zogby International poll, commissioned for Reuters and Boston
television station WHDH and conducted Oct. 8-10, showed Bush
maintaining a stout, but shrinking, lead over McCain in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor topped the GOP field with support from 40
percent of the 608 likely voters in the state's Feb. 1 GOP primary.
McCain was second with 21 percent. Forbes was third with 12 percent
and Elizabeth Dole trailed at 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll has a margin of error of four percentage points,
meaning results could vary that much in either direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will happen when Forbes' negative ads on Bush hit full
swing?'' asked John Zogby, director of the polling company.
``Bush's support is leveling off while McCain's has increased. Bush
could be aided by a victory in Iowa (where McCain is not competing)
while McCain could be the beneficiary if Bush stumbles there. The
book is not closed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zogby poll includes other numbers that could cause concern
in the Bush campaign. Fifty-six percent of the respondents to this
month's poll said they did not know enough about him to nominate
him for president. Thirty-nine percent said they did.
</P>
<P>
   A Zogby poll in New Hampshire in late April showed Bush at 38
percent, Dole at 15 percent and McCain in third place with only 9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Former New Hampshire Sen. Warren Rudman, a national co-chairman
for the McCain campaign, said the new numbers show his man is in
``a solid second-place position.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zogby numbers align with a recent Franklin Pierce College
poll, conducted Oct. 3-6 , that showed Bush at 43 percent and
McCain at 23 percent, and all others in single digits. A September
poll by the college showed Bush at 48 percent, and McCain, Dole and
Forbes all at 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``While support for Governor Bush has fallen off slightly,
McCain's surprising strength seems to have come at the expense of
the other GOP contenders,'' said Robin Marra, director of the
Franklin Pierce College Polling Institute.

 &HT;    High school ends segregated election of homecoming queen
 &HT;    By Paul Donsky
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thirty years after East Coweta High School's
classrooms and school buses were integrated, one last segregated
tradition went by the wayside Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   One student was crowned homecoming queen, ending a three-decade
practice of naming two winners each year _ one black and one white.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on Southern culture and history say racially segregated
social functions like homecoming and prom are not common but still
occur, mainly in small towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``People involved in it found it as a way of being inclusive,''
said Dan Carter, an Emory University professor who specializes in
Southern history. ``They were concerned that minority students who
came to majority institutions would become invisible.''
</P>
<P>
   East Coweta students say they think it is about time the school
crowned only one queen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's how it should have been all the time,'' said
senior Krista Kneuer, a member of the homecoming court, who is
white. ``If everybody is supposed to be equal, then there shouldn't
be two queens.''
</P>
<P>
   For many students, the racially divided homecoming court was an
embarrassing, backward tradition that reflected badly on their
school, located 40 miles south of Atlanta in Sharpsburg. It was a
true-life brush with segregation, something most students
experience only second-hand, through grainy pictures of ``colored''
water fountains in their history books.
</P>
<P>
   The change ``is for the better,'' said senior Emily Thompson, a
member of the homecoming court, who is black. ``Everything else is
present day. Homecoming court should be also.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-queen system began after the merging of the Coweta
County, Newnan city and black school systems. School officials at
the time felt it was a fair way to ensure that black female
students would be recognized during homecoming festivities, East
Coweta Principal Eddie Lovett said.
</P>
<P>
   Students lobbied for the change last fall. Student government
leaders began talking up the issue, and stories appeared in the
school newspaper, Smoke Signals. In a poll conducted by the paper,
64 percent of students who responded said the two-queen system
should be abolished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our school is so culturally diverse ... that that way just
wouldn't work anymore,'' said editor Jillian Brogan. ``To put
people in a category because of their race is just awful.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue came to a head in part because a Laotian student was
nominated last year for the homecoming court. She asked to be
placed in an ``other'' category rather than be classified as black
or white, which forced students to confront the issue, Brogan said.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, students at nearby Newnan High School
voted to end their practice of naming black and white homecoming
queens. Next weekend the school celebrates its first homecoming
since that change.
</P>
<P>
   Students at Claxton High School in southeast Georgia voted to
end its two-queen system several years ago, said Assistant
Principal Joy Collins. Since then, students have elected both black
girls and white girls as homecoming queen.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone at East Coweta High is in favor of the change. Some
black students say a black queen won't be named at the school as
long as it remains a mostly white school. About one-third of the
school's 1,570 students are black.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of black students feel we should leave it the way it
was, because that's the only way there will be a black queen,''
said Melvenette Lowe, a black member of this year's homecoming
court.
</P>
<P>
   The current homecoming court has six members _ three white and
three black. It wasn't planned that way; that's just who the top
six vote-getters were, said Lovett.
</P>
<P>
   Some students sounded an optimistic tone, saying they believe
personality, not skin color, determines who becomes queen. As
proof, they note that half of this year's homecoming court is
black.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes down to how your classmates feel about you,''
said senior Shawn Reaves, a member of the homecoming court. ``I
don't think that (the queen) is going to always be a white person.
Hopefully, there will be a fair chance for both.'' East Coweta and
Newnan students are to be commended for requesting the change, said
Ted Ownby, a professor at the University of Mississippi's Center
for the Study of Southern Culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a hopeful sign,'' he said. ``They're making the
precise decision that racial segregation belongs to another
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Parent Laurie Voss, who has daughters in the 10th and 12th
grades at East Coweta, said the old segregated homecoming was
simply out of step with modern times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy with the decision not to have the separation
anymore,'' Voss said as she manned a refreshment stand at a
pre-homecoming carnival on Thursday. ``It brings us into the
'90s.''

RUSSIAN TROOPS DRIVE TOWARD CHECHEN CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Federal troops and tanks drove to the outskirts of
Chechnya's capital Grozny on Friday as Russian commanders said they
were stepping up their effort to wipe out Islamic rebels in the
breakaway Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
   But Moscow's campaign to win the hearts and minds of civilians
in Chechnya suffered a setback when it was reported that Russian
troops were forcing refugees from the fighting back into the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicting reports about Russian losses also undermined the
generals' upbeat descriptions of the campaign, which Moscow has
insisted would avoid the costly mistakes of its 1994-96 war in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Federal commanders announced that Russia's campaign was entering
a second stage after troops occupied the strategically situated
town of Goragorsk after a heavy four-day bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What started as an antiterrorist operation has grown into a
military one, with the appropriate tactics and weapons,'' General
Vyacheslav Ovchinnikov, commander of Russia's Interior Ministry
troops, said at a Moscow briefing Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Taking Goragorsk removed a major obstacle on a main route into
Grozny. News agencies said a large Russian column had moved to
within 10 miles of the capital, where Chechen militia were
reportedly putting up heavy resistance.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of Russian forces in the North Caucasus, General
Viktor Kazantsev, said his troops had completed setting up a
``security zone'' covering the northern third of Chechnya. With the
rebels trapped in the south, he said, federal forces would attack
and destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to expect us anywhere, any time, and they must
constantly suffer losses,'' Kazantsev said.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen commanders acknowledge that they are losing ground to
the larger, better equipped Russian forces in the steppes of
northern Chechnya. But, mindful of the huge casualties they
inflicted in the last war after federal troops stormed Grozny and
entered the hilly southern regions, they seem to be waiting for the
Russians to try it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the Russians shoot at us some more, we are a patient
people,'' rebel commander Shamil Basayev said in an interview
published on the rebels' Web site. Basayev is wanted by Russian
authorities for leading attacks on Russian regions outside
Chechnya, and Moscow blames him for a wave of deadly apartment
bombs that killed 300 last month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, evidence emerged that the Russians are once again
wildly underreporting their losses. Friday, Russian generals said
they had lost 47 regular army troops and seven Interior Ministry
troops in Chechnya since fighting began last month. But another
officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, put the toll of
Interior Ministry troops alone at 116.
</P>
<P>
   ``I counted the death certificates myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kazantsev also acknowledged that Russian forces had lost a third
jet in the conflict, a Su-25 attack plane, after the air force
initially denied it had been shot down.
</P>
<P>
   While Kazantsev threatened the rebel fighters, the Kremlin named
its new envoy to federal-controlled Chechnya, Nikolai Koshman.
</P>
<P>
   Koshman, who was prime minister of the pro-Moscow government
that was chased out when the rebels won back Grozny in 1996,
already faces a humanitarian crisis. Some 170,000 civilians have
fled Russian airstrikes and artillery bombardments. Friday, the New
York-based Human Rights Watch said Moscow was turning back Chechens
who tried to leave for other parts of Russia.

 &HT;    Once you get past controversy, Brooklyn museum's `Sensation' an
interesting experience
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 17.
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's aim was off when he attacked
``Sensation,'' the notorious exhibition of contemporary British art
showing at the Brooklyn Museum. There's plenty here that is much
more offensive than the unobtrusive dung affixed to the painting of
the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition has more range than the controversy would have
you think, but it is dominated by a confrontational group of
artists. They practice what you might call either gross-out
hyper-realism or ``Duane Hanson does the British tabloids.'' In my
book, Jake and Dinos Chapman's mutant mannequins _ lifelike
sculptures of little girls with penis noses _ take the prize in the
disgusting category. Damien Hirst's piece with live maggots is a
close second.
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, important to make the distinction between works
that shock with no redeeming value, which the Chapman pieces
exemplify, and the ones that are interesting once you get past your
nausea, such like the Hirst. Among the biggest names of the group,
Hirst is definitely a showman, best known for pickling fish and
farm animals in large, white, framed tanks of formaldehyde. All his
sculptures here, including ``A Thousand Years,'' in which maggots
turn into flies that hover around a fake cow's head, are
meditations in one way or another on death. Indeed, life, death,
sex and religion _ art's fundamental topics _ are the main subjects
in the show.
</P>
<P>
   After such a recitation, you may wonder whether all of these
British artists consider nausea a necessary prerequisite to
understanding. No. The best work evokes other feelings:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Richard Billingham's sad, unflinching but loving photographs
of his blowsy mother, pathetic alcoholic father and their unkempt
home are hard to take because they are so powerfully truthful.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rachel Whiteread's elegiac room-size installation, 100
translucent resin casts of the space beneath chairs, makes absence
present, caught in time like a bug in amber.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Jenny Saville, taking a page from Lucian Freud's paintings of
corpulent nudes, blows up the scale and focuses on the headless
fleshy torso or arranges bodies in abstract patterns, creating an
engaging tension by painting unlovely rippling skin with sensuous
abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Too often the shrillest work is the worst _ derivative or banal,
goosed up with electric shocks. Mona Hatoum has set a table and
replaced a plate with a video of the inside of her throat making
swallowing motions. This is in keeping with her exploration of
innards but is neither moving nor insightful. Perhaps that's why
she added the salacious title, ``Deep Throat.'' Like willful
children, these artists push the buttons of propriety. Giuliani,
the gullible parent, fell for it.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Ofili's Madonna was destined for oblivion until the mayor
stepped in. Now, it is installed behind glass as if it were
``Guernica'' or the Mona Lisa. Basically, it's a colorful image of
a black Madonna surrounded with shimmering striations like a
latter-day mosaic. The dung, presented in varnished balls, would
have been difficult to identify before the brouhaha. The clippings
from porn magazines, more offensive than the dung, also are
difficult to discern.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the artist's explanations about his African heritage and
the hip-hop updating of the image, both gestures seem gratuitous.
Judging from the patterns and colors of his other pieces in the
show, Ofili is a very good decorative painter. But you don't get
any respect for that in the art world. Is it possible that Ofili
added transgressive materials and imagery in order to be taken
seriously? Or to be noticed in a world bombarded with images?
</P>
<P>
   Because it makes us think about such things, visiting
``Sensation'' is ultimately an interesting experience. The museum's
labels and audio tour, narrated by David Bowie, create a context
for looking at the art. In a departure from the norm, both
regularly pose questions, emphasizing that it is up to the viewer
to make a decision about the work.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming you don't consider it the height of moral turpitude,
``Sensation'' is also naughty fun, on the level of, say, a whoopee
cushion.
</P>
<P>
   During my visit, ``Sensation'' was quite crowded, and the gift
shop was doing a brisk business selling ``Art-Danger'' pins,
body-part soaps, ``Health Warning'' T-shirts and Zoo Doo. Whatever
people thought of the art, the fact that they came seemed a rebuke
to Giuliani for trying to shut down the show.
</P>
<P>
   Said Damien Leebold, as he refilled the shelves with catalogs,
``People like to decide for themselves.''

   BRAZIL: OIL GIANT REVISES ACCOUNTING
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's big oil company, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, reduced
shareholders' equity by about 4.8 billion reais, or $2.4 billion,
as it shifted its accounting practices to U.S. standards in
preparation for listing its shares in New York. Petrobras, as the
company is called, changed the way it accounts for drilling
operations, pensions and health plans. The government, which owns a
controlling stake in Petrobras, is opening the country's
oil-exploration industry to competition from outside companies.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL: LEGAL THREATS
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice of Brazil's Supreme Court, Carlos Velloso,
threatened to sue The Economist in British courts over its coverage
criticizing the court's annulment of government measures to tax the
pensions of retired civil servants. Justice Velloso called the
criticism unfounded. The magazine is published by the London-based
Pearson PlC. In another legal skirmish over a sensitive financial
issue, Minas Gerais, the Brazilian state governed by a former
president, Itamar Franco, has sued Arminio Fraga, president of the
central bank. Fraga has cautioned foreign investors against placing
money in Minas Gerais.

   CANADA: INFLATION PRESSURE
</P>
<P>
   Canada's consumer price index rose by three-tenths of a percent
in September, a 2.6 percent annual inflation rate, which is the
highest since June 1995, Statistics Canada reported. Economists
noted that the core inflation rate, excluding energy and food
prices, also was 2.6 percent. The Toronto-based investment dealer
Nesbitt Burns Inc. said the core inflation rate, which was less
than 1 percent at the beginning of the year, ``appears poised to
move higher as rising energy costs spill into other prices.''

   The Canadian Auto Workers union said it had won a certification
vote at a seating plant owned by Magna International Inc., a
leading automotive parts maker. A ruling on the outcome of the vote
at the plant in Windsor, Ontario, which makes seats for Chrysler
minivans, is in the hands of the Ontario Labor Relations Board. But
if the union is certified, it will be the first successful union

   The South Korean conglomerate Hyundai put on hold its plans to
send a survey team to North Korea in preparation for construction
of an industrial complex. A 16-member Hyundai team had been
scheduled to arrive in North Korea this weekend for a 10-day survey
of possible sites. In a visit earlier this month, Chung Ju-yung,
the honorary chairman of Hyundai, met the country's top leader, Kim

TAKE 3 FOR KERKORIAN: THE REBUILDING OF MGM  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 17) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOANNE LEGOMSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This time, it looks as if Kirk Kerkorian wants to build his film
studio into a player.
</P>
<P>
   When Kerkorian, the billionaire investor bought
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1996, it was the third time he had done so.
After the previous purchases, he unloaded assets before reselling
the company. Many analysts assumed that MGM was in for a repeat
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some of them believe that Kerkorian, 82, wants to return
the studio that was once home to the likes of Clark Gable and Judy
Garland, _ and which counts last quarter's ``Stigmata'' and ``The
Thomas Crown Affair'' among its hits _ to its former glory.
</P>
<P>
   After two and a half years of mediocre performance, the company
installed new management in April: Alex Yemenidjian, former
president of MGM Grand, a casino-hotel company that is controlled
by Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp., was named chief executive. MGM has
also bought the Polygram and Orion film libraries, tripling its
holdings to 5,200 titles.
</P>
<P>
   And it recently began talks with cable operators and satellite
broadcasters _ it will not identify them _ aimed at creating new
MGM-brand cable networks.
</P>
<P>
   If these moves generate sufficient cash flow and stanch MGM's
losses, which come largely from its film and television production
and which totaled $157.6 million last year, the rewards could be
considerable.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for entertainment is growing, said Frederick W. Moran, an
analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``MGM is one of few pure plays in filmed
entertainment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a public offering in 1997, Tracinda sold 10.9 percent of MGM
for $20 a share, and although the stock rose as high as $27 in
early 1998, it finished last month at just $17.50.
</P>
<P>
   A key factor weighing on the stock price was a secondary
offering planned for this month that would have raised $750
million, most of it to pay down debt. On Oct. 5, MGM canceled the
offering, instead announcing a $720 million rights offering that
allows shareholders to buy additional shares for just $14.50
apiece. That sent the stock higher; it closed at $22.5625 on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Since Kerkorian has pledged to exercise his rights, he will kick
in the largest part of the money being raised _ something that
Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst at the Seidler Companies, calls
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   The stock, trading at 18 times analysts' estimate of 2000 cash
flow, is not cheap. But Logsdon said his 12-month price target of
$26 did not include potential cable alliances. Analysts say these
could add up to $17 to the current price.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to securing wider distribution for MGM titles,
Yemenidjian, 43, said the company would release MGM movies on
digital video disks and the Internet. ``We inherited a company with
the best content and the weakest distribution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the studio's production business on a profitable footing
will be tougher than improving distribution, analysts said. But
they regard two recent co-production deals as steps in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from those deals, the newest James Bond film, ``The World
is Not Enough,'' is expected to generate $100 million to $125
million for MGM in domestic theaters. It is to be released on Nov.
17.
</P>
<P>
   But there are risks. Unlike its rivals, MGM has no theme parks
or television stations to fall back on.
</P>
<P>
   Others are encouraged by the positive cash flow MGM reported
last Tuesday. Mary Chris Gay, a fund manager at Legg Mason, said
that could be attributed in part to Yemenidjian's success in
cutting marketing costs.

COMPANY WITHDRAWS DIARRHEA VACCINE FOR INFANTS AND CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ American Home Products, the manufacturer of the only
licensed vaccine to prevent the most common cause of severe
diarrhea among infants and children, announced Friday that it was
withdrawing the vaccine from the market because of concerns that it
could cause a painful, potentially fatal bowel obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   The diarrhea is caused by the rotavirus, and last year the
government recommended that every infant in the United States get
the protective vaccine. One million children swallowed three doses
of the vaccine, RotaShield, at 2, 4 and 6 months of age, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   But in July the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said
no one should get the vaccine because a program monitoring side
effects suggested a link between the vaccine and the bowel
condition, called intussusception.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, prompted by more than 100 reports of intussusception to
the agency _ more than half of them within a week of vaccination _
American Home Products has asked doctors and health workers to
return all unused vaccine immediately. It said it would wait for
completed studies to determine whether withdrawal of the vaccine
would be permanent.
</P>
<P>
   The drug company's action leaves the United States without a
rotavirus vaccine just at the time when the virus tends to occur
most often, from November to May. Rotavirus infects more than half
a million American children, usually from 3 to 35 months of age,
and leads to 500,000 doctors' visits, 50,000 hospitalizations and
about 40 deaths, officials at the disease control centers said.
</P>
<P>
   Rotavirus is also said to be the biggest diarrheal killer of
children around the world, accounting for 600,000 deaths a year,
chiefly from dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   RotaShield has been approved for use in Europe but has not been
marketed there, said Doug Petkus, a spokesman for American Home
Products. Researchers are working on half a dozen other rotavirus
vaccines, but they are still in experimental stages.
</P>
<P>
   The developments are highly embarrassing to federal health
officials. The vaccine was developed at the National Institutes of
Health. Even before the Food and Drug Administration licensed the
vaccine to Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, a subsidiary of American Home
Products, the centers for disease control promoted it as the new
weapon against rotavirus.
</P>
<P>
   The situation with RotaShield is the latest in a series of
problems for American Home Products, of Madison, N.J. Last week the
company agreed to pay at least $3.75 billion to settle claims that
its half of the diet drug combination fen-phen caused heart
problems. And over the last year, it withdrew the painkiller Duract
because it caused fatal liver problems; agreed to a
multimillion-dollar settlement of lawsuits claiming that the
contraceptive Norplant caused side effects, and recalled more than
half a million kits used to treat deadly allergic reactions because
they were apparently not potent enough.
</P>
<P>
   The company's action comes one week before an advisory committee
to the CDC on vaccines is scheduled to meet in Atlanta to review
studies to determine whether the vaccine led to bowel obstruction.
Full data will not be complete by the time of the meeting on Oct.
22, CDC and drug company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As of Sept. 24, the CDC had received reports of intussusception
among 108 infants, and nearly 100 were confirmed or strongly
suspected cases. Among them, 56 had onset of symptoms within one
week of receiving the vaccine and an additional 9 had onset within
the second week.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, the CDC director, said the findings would
still be discussed at the meeting because the scientific review was
continuing and would not be affected by the product's withdrawal.
``As planned, CDC will seek a recommendation from the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices regarding the use of this
vaccine among children in the U.S.,'' Dr. Koplan said.
</P>
<P>
   Available information shows no on-going risk to children given
RotaShield in the past, Dr. Koplan and the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the CDC and American Home Products have shared data on
the vaccine's side effects, the company did not consult the disease
centers before withdrawing RotaShield, according to Barbara
Reynolds, a CDC spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA called the voluntary withdrawal ``an appropriate
action,'' said Larry Bachorik, a spokesman for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Intussusception results when a section of bowel slides inward,
like a telescope, into another part of the bowel. In severe cases,
a previously healthy infant suddenly screams in pain.
</P>
<P>
   Other symptoms include persistent vomiting and a bowel movement
that appears black. A doctor can often feel a knot from the
telescoped bowel and make a tentative diagnosis. Confirmation comes
from giving a child a barium enema and then X-rays. In some cases
the enema itself can straighten out the telescoped bowel. But in
others surgery is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a vaccine, the CDC urged parents to teach
children the importance of hand washing with soap to reduce the
spread of rotavirus.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating that the rotavirus vaccine problem might renew
criticisms of vaccines in general, Dr. Koplan said that ``continued
immunization of children with licensed vaccines is critical to
their well-being.''

 &HT;    Final destination for Geronimo's headdress up to federal courts
 &HT;    By Milo Ippolito
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Whether Geronimo's headdress ends up in a museum, with
an Indian tribe or back in a Gwinnett County lawyer's house will be
for the federal courts to decide.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which seized the headdress this week from Leighton
Deming of Suwanee, has had numerous inquiries about it since
Deming's arrest Tuesday, FBI spokeswoman Linda Vizi said.
</P>
<P>
   Adorned with eagle feathers, the headdress belonged to Deming's
family for three generations, but the FBI says he violated federal
laws protecting the endangered birds by trying to sell it on the
Internet for $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is going through forfeiture proceedings to acquire the
headdress as government property. In the meantime, it is
temporarily holding the headdress as evidence in criminal cases
against Deming and Thomas Marciano, who helped Deming arrange a
transaction for the headdress.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is forfeited to the government, the determination will
be made as to who best should have it, whether it be a museum, the
tribes,'' Vizi said. ``It's really an important piece of history.''
</P>
<P>
   Geronimo, a famed Apache chief, wore the headdress in 1907 to
the last powow in the Indian territory that is now Oklahoma.
Geronimo is believed to have given the headdress to a friend of the
Deming family.
</P>
<P>
   Deming, who hopes to resolve the legal mess by donating the
headdress to a national museum, referred further inquiries to his
attorney in Philadelphia, who said Friday that Deming will plead
not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has no plans to drop the charges, which carry a maximum
penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, Vizi said.
</P>
<P>
   Deming had enlisted his friend, Marciano, who had experience
selling antiques, to find someone interested in the headdress. The
two were to meet a buyer _ who turned out to be an FBI agent _ in a
Philadelphia hotel to close the deal. Aware of laws regarding eagle
feathers, they took several precautions, Deming said: As the legal
owner, he carried it across state lines. They offered to charge
$1.2 million for a set of sketches and throw in the headdress for
free.
</P>
<P>
   Vizi said it does not matter that the headdress predates laws
passed in the 1930s against selling eagle feathers. The laws
attempt to take away the feathers' value and thereby deter the
killing of the birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is protection of the American eagle,'' Vizi
said. ``When these laws were enacted, the eagle was on its last
stand.''

49 DEATHS LINKED TO GHB, THE `DATE RAPE' DRUG  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., N.Y., Calif., Fla., Pa., Colo.)   By KEITH BRADSHER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBRALTAR, Mich. _ Students from the Oscar Carlson High School
here say that when they go to parties these days, they try to keep
an eye on their drinks at all times, put caps back on bottled
beverages between sips and never accept a cup from someone they do
not know.
</P>
<P>
   The precautions follow the death last January of Samantha Reid,
a 15-year-old freshman who drank a glass of Mountain Dew laced with
GHB, an increasingly popular recreational and ``date rape'' drug
that is colorless, odorless and virtually tasteless. Samantha's
death, one of 49 linked to the drug nationwide since 1990, has
galvanized an effort to crack down on GHB, gamma hydroxy butyrate.
</P>
<P>
   Two Michigan Republicans, Rep. Fred Upton and Sen. Spencer
Abraham, have sponsored bills in the U.S. House and Senate that
would put GHB to the federal government's list of the
most-controlled substances, joining heroin and LSD as a so-called
Schedule 1 drug.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed its bill on Tuesday by a 423-1 vote with little
debate. The Senate bill, introduced two months ago, is in committee
but is also expected to win passage. The bills would make GHB
trafficking punishable by a sentence of five years to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The bills would not only ban GHB but also similar chemical
compounds, including some dietary supplements for body builders
that can be used to make the drug. GHB ``is easily synthesized by a
lot of people who can get the recipe off the Internet,'' said Dr.
Felix Adatsi, the chief toxicologist of the Michigan State Police.
</P>
<P>
   Small quantities of the drug produce a temporary euphoria or
sometimes hallucinations, while slightly larger quantities produce
lassitude, unconsciousness or even respiratory failure and death.
The drug can be lethal in even tiny doses, or if poorly prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha was an average student who loved to play basketball at
Carlson High School in this small factory town on the outskirts of
Detroit. She encountered the drug on a Saturday night when her
mother thought she was going to a movie. Instead, Samantha and two
other freshman girls joined four young men, two of whom were
seniors at Carlson, and went to the apartment of one of the men to
watch rented videos.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Judi Clark, was summoned to the local hospital in
the middle of the night, where she found her daughter dead. ``I
fell asleep on the couch and was woken up by the phone at 3 or
3:30,'' said Ms. Clark, who resumed using her maiden name after her
divorce from Samantha's father in 1986. Ms. Clark raised Samantha
and Samantha's older brother, Charles, now 18.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas M. Baker, the Wayne County deputy chief prosecutor for
drug crimes, said that one of the young men at the party with
Samantha, Joshua Cole, 19, later told police that he had secretly
put GHB into all three girls' drinks to make the party more
``lively.'' Cole also told police that two of the other three young
men had agreed to the plan and helped carry the drinks to the
girls, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha died a few hours later. One of her friends went into a
coma but was revived. The third girl never touched her drink. All
four men, ranging in age now from 18 to 26, have been charged with
involuntary manslaughter and poisoning, and, if convicted, could be
sentenced to life in prison. Cole and the other three young men
have pleaded not guilty. Lawyers for the other three young men have
contended that Cole was solely responsible for the death.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clark has turned her daughter's death into a crusade for
limits on GHB. Ms. Clark took six months off from her job as a
unionized construction worker after Samantha's death to study the
drug and write letters to politicians seeking controls on it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clark has not touched her daughter's room. Samantha had
strewn clothes on her bed and floor in choosing what to wear when
she went out on the night she died. The clothes are still there. So
are the black lava lamp, the white strobe lamp, the posters of
Leonardo DiCaprio and the movie ``Titanic,'' the stuffed animals
and the stacks of magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't even dusted,'' Ms. Clark said. ``It's just like the
night she left, except more dust.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan is not alone in having a GHB problem. The use of the
drug has been spreading in New York, California, Florida,
Pennsylvania and other states. According to the Drug Enforcement
Administration, hospitals and law-enforcement officials have
reported at least 5,500 cases of GHB abuse in 42 states, in
addition to the 49 deaths, fiveof which occurred in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no one is certain of the true extent of the problem. Because
GHB is not yet on the federal list of controlled substances, the
DEA does not actively pursue cases involving it, said E. David
Jacobson, an agency spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has helped with local investigations in some of the
29 states where the drug is a con- trolled substance, including
Michi- gan.
</P>
<P>
   GHB breaks down quickly in the body, and is extremely difficult
for laboratories to detect even before it breaks down. Only four
laboratories in the country even have the equipment to detect GHB,
and they can do so only if a blood or urine sample is gathered
within a few hours after the drug is ingested, Adatsi said.
</P>
<P>
   Because kits for making GHB are illegal in Michigan but legal in
many other states, the state attorney general's office reached
across state lines to combat it. The office bought kits over the
Internet from two vendors in Florida and Colorado last summer, then
filed criminal charges against the two men and extradited them for
trial here. They have pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   GHB prosecutions are, ``an extremely high priority, in that this
substance has popped up at these rave parties, and kids can't
detect it in a drink,'' said Jennifer M. Granholm, Michigan's
attorney general, adding that she planned to speak on the subject
when the nation's state attorney generals gather in January in
California for a conference on Internet-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Gamma hydroxy butyrate is a highly addictive chemical compound
that depresses the central nervous system. Toxicologists say that
in carefully measured quantities, with the ingredients prepared in
very precise ratios, GHB produces a mild euphoria followed by
sleep, with no hangover.
</P>
<P>
   But GHB is seldom prepared with clinical care or administered in
precise amounts. Kitchen chemists use caustic liquids like paint
remover, furniture polish remover or drain clearing agents to
prepare the drug, which, when poorly mixed, can cause severe
chemical burns to a user's throat. The drug is also such a powerful
sedative that an error in dosage of a tiny fraction of a gram can
cause a coma and eventually death, as the person stops breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Because GHB can render someone unconscious or unable to remember
what happens next, the drug has been used for several years by
sexual predators across the country, who put it in women's drinks,
Jacobson said. But more recently, young people have been taking the
drug even more often for the euphoria it can produce, and in the
mistaken belief among men that it builds muscles, toxicologists
say.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence of sexual misconduct in the Samantha Reid
case, Baker said. Her death now appears to have been an early
warning for the state, because overdoses have become more frequent
since. Eight people overdosed on GHB in one weekend three weeks ago
in Ann Arbor. While some overdoses since Samantha's have produced
temporary comas, none have been fatal.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Clark has returned to work, installing heating ducts
in new office buildings and factories, she continues her fight
against GHB in the evenings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying as hard as I can to make some purpose out of my
daughter's death,'' Ms. Clark said. ``She can't die without a
purpose, or I'd go out of my mind.''

CITY RIVALRY A ONE-WAY AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rudy Giuliani had just ended his daily news
conference and was walking briskly toward the door when I shot out
the question I had traveled so far to ask: ``Do you regard Boston
as the major cultural rival to New York?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No more questions,'' an aide barked in a typically New York
way. Giuliani paused in the doorway and stared back bemused, his
coterie of advisers pausing silently around him.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the eruption that was no doubt to come at the very mention
of his archrival city, his patience breaking like a pane of glass,
the seething quotes that would tumble forth. Boston? You think that
glorified little cowtown peopled by puritanical nerds could even
hold a church candle to my teeming metropolis?
</P>
<P>
   He opened his mouth. I squinted in delighted dread.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Boston very much,'' he said, smiling. ``It's a very
nice city. But my attitude is that you can't rival New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Like it very much? Very nice? That scum. How dare he!
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the mayor has gone soft, so I quickly punched out the
number to a real New Yorker, Ed Koch, a guy who would just as soon
disembowel Bambi as tell you how to find the 4-train up to the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Boston,'' he says. ``But there are no rivals to New
York. We're the capital of the world in commerce, culture,
capitalism, everything. But if it spurs you on, that's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Love? Spurs you on? The temerity. The ruthless brass!
</P>
<P>
   OK, next up: Donald Trump. His assistant announced that he was
unavailable. Aha. The man is so obviously outraged and threatened
at the mere mention of his metropolitan nemesis that he can't find
his way to speak a few civil words. Finally, we're getting to the
moody core of this dark rivalry. So I approach someone of equal
importance: Trump Tower doorman John McDwyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big Brahmin hello to you,'' I said, knowing that would get
him _ the history he doesn't have, the refinement we do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston's a beautiful city,'' he offered.
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful? I am incensed, almost irrational. In a last-ditch
effort, I take myself up to Game 1, where I find a man named Carl
Marino from Tinton Falls, N.J., walking around the outfield stands
in a T-shirt that, politely paraphrased, says, ``Boston is not a
nice place.'' Here we go (wink, wink). The rivalry lives on. You
just have to know where to look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never been,'' he shrugs when asked what he so despises about
Boston. ``My wife wants me to take her there. I just haven't gotten
around to it.''
</P>
<P>
   As I walk away despondent, he calls out sympathetically,
``Boston's all right.'' No, you don't understand.You don't
understand that because we hate you, you must hate us. We draw
life, fullness, validation from your hatred.
</P>
<P>
   We want to hear all the cliches. We want to hear you call us
dorks, geeks, simpletons who marry our own cousins (for the money)
and look at fish and chips as a gastronomical triumph. The men
among us, such as we are, wear brown shoes with blue suits, right?
The women look at Talbot's as the height of fashion. We are Timex
to your Rolex. We want to hear this because it makes us matter.
</P>
<P>
   And we'll strike back. Will we ever. You are predatory and
unsavory and uncouth, not to mention unfriendly. So there. Your car
breaks down on I-95, give it 20 minutes before it's stripped of its
stereo, tires, for God sakes, its dignity. So many of you wear
black that the entirety of Manhattan Island looks like a seminary
school for wayward priests with cell phone addictions. You are
personified by this mananimal Joey Buttafuoco.
</P>
<P>
   All else aside, you do hate our baseball team, don't you? We're
your worst nightmare, right? True enough, you got our goat back in
1920, all for the benefit of ``No, No Nanette.'' You killed us in
September of 1949. You stole our hearts on Oct. 2, 1978. And, OK,
your Yankees have 24 world championships in a span of time in which
the Red Sox have none. But now we have arrived on the doorstep of
history.
</P>
<P>
   We are, as novelist Alexander Theroux writes about this fierce
rivalry, ``natural enemies, threatening entities.'' I call Theroux
for encouragement. Just kidding, he says. ``The rivalry is all in
the minds of Bostonians. It's an amazing hubris on your part.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're like our little brother,'' said Sal Cozzupoli, another
Yankees fan in a ``Boston is not a nice place'' shirt.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes me hate them even more. Is it really too much
to ask that they hate us in return?

N.H. GETS APPROVAL FOR FEB. 1 PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a healthy dose of grumbling, the Democratic
National Committee gave New Hampshire's Feb. 1 presidential primary
the go-ahead Friday despite the contretemps over scheduling with
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa will hold its first-in-the-nation caucuses on Jan. 24,
eight days before New Hampshire's primary, the country's first
primary. The two states faced off after New Hampshire Secretary of
State William Gardner scheduled the primary for Feb. 1 to avoid a
conflict with Delaware Republicans. That, in turn, forced Iowa to
move back its caucuses, to maintain the traditional breathing room
with New Hampshire's primary.
</P>
<P>
   The Rules Committee of the DNC voted to approve the two dates,
even though they are earlier than the party's rules permit. In
fact, the committee could have voted to punish New Hampshire by
taking away 25 percent of of its district-level delegates to the
party's nominating convention and refusing to seat the state's DNC
members at next summer's convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Under the party's rules, no state is allowed to hold its primary
or caucus before March 7, 2000, without a waiver, except for Iowa
and New Hampshire. Iowa is allowed to hold its caucuses 15 days
before that date, and New Hampshire is allowed to hold its primary
seven days before March 7.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who has long
opposed the two states' special status, protested Friday that no
other state in the country is so well-treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bizarre to me,'' said Levin. ``It gives new definition to
chutzpah. For those who don't know the definition, it's Iowa and
New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   And Don Fowler, a former DNC chairman, said the party's
treatment of other states is ``patent, stark, gross unfairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said the committee should allow Michigan, South Carolina,
Arizona, and Washington to hold their primaries before the March 7
date because Iowa and New Hampshire are going earlier next year.
His motion was set aside until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, New Hampshire and Iowa officials all blamed
Gardner, a Democrat, for their predicament, asking the Rules
Committee members to forgive their requests for a new date.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of us were a little surprised when he set that
date for Feb. 1,'' said New Hampshire Governor Jeanne Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Sullivan, New Hampshire's Democratic chairwoman, was
apologetic. ``We regret that we have to come to you,'' she said.
``A lot of this was outside our control.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa Democratic Chairman Rob Tully said Gardner's move ``created
havoc and hardship on both Iowa and New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, New Hampshire law requires Gardner to set the date
seven days before any comparable event. Since Delaware Republicans
decided to hold their primary on Feb. 8, that forced Gardner to
schedule New Hampshire for Feb. 1, creating the domino effect.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee does not have similar rules
overseeing the scheduling of state's primaries and caucuses.

BRADLEY REBUTS CHARGE THAT HE ABANDONED DEMOCRATS BY LEAVING
SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1995, Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey gave one
of the most bittersweet speeches of his 17-year political career,
announcing to a roomful of stunned and tearful supporters that he
would retire at the end of 1996. Wearily, he declared that
``politics is broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bradley is back in politics, running for the Democratic
presidential nomination. And with the former basketball star now
locked in a tightening race with Vice President Al Gore, those
words and that action are suddenly being used by his rival as
ammunition against him.
</P>
<P>
   With escalating harshness, Gore and his allies have recently
accused Bradley of abandoning, even disavowing, his party in the
months that followed the Republican takeover of Congress after the
1994 elections. They say he considered running for president in
1996 as an independent, an unpardonable act of disloyalty in their
eyes. And they suggest that his retirement in his party's hour of
need demonstrates that he would not stand up well under the
adversity of a long campaign or a problem-fraught presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In his quiet, methodical way, Bradley has tried to dismiss those
attacks as ``the politics of the dart board.'' But having clearly
felt their sting, he has begun defending his record as a loyal
Democrat who campaigned for Democratic candidates after he retired
and who left Congress to search for ways to revive his party, not
undermine it.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week, Bradley described his life since 1996
as a time of rejuvenation, of reconnecting with voters and of
learning about life beyond the cloistered world of Washington _ a
world, he asserts, that Gore remains trapped inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had I not left the Senate, I don't think I would be doing a
presidential campaign now,'' he said. ``The fact that I had
returned to private life, working in the private sector, that I was
teaching and once again writing and speaking all over the country
were all things that I wanted to do and each of them refreshed me
in a new way.''
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted that he had not thought seriously about leaving
the party, or of running on a third-line for president. ``I knew I
was Democrat,'' he said. ``I figured if you were going to make a
difference, you had to work within the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many democrats feel a lingering bitterness toward Bradley
because of both the timing of his retirement and the way he
announced it. The Republicans had won control of Congress in
November 1994 and were just 8 months into a campaign of rolling
back Democratic programs when Bradley announced his plans to
retire.
</P>
<P>
   And then, as if losing one of the party's best known senators at
that low moment was not enough, Bradley gave a speech attacking not
just the Republicans, but the beleaguered Democrats as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are infatuated with the `magic' of the private
sector and reflexively criticize government as the enemy of
freedom,'' Bradley said in that speech. ``And the Democrats
distrust the market, preach government as the answer to our
problems and prefer the bureaucrat they know to the consumer they
can't control. Neither party speaks to people where they live their
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats, including some of Bradley's friends, felt
betrayed by those words. But in the interview, Bradley said he had
been surprised by their responses, since he had expressed similar
thoughts before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt many politicians were not leading from core
convictions, but from polls,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In questioning Bradley's party loyalty, the Gore campaign has
focused on more than just the retirement speech. On the day after
his announcement, Bradley told reporters who asked about it that,
``I have not ruled out an independent route'' to the White House.
He also acknowledged making phone calls to retired Gen. Colin
Powell and Ross Perot to discuss his plans.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, Bradley participated in two conference calls
with six other prominent politicians, four of them Democrats and
two of them independents. Two had run for president, former Sens.
Gary Hart and Paul Tsongas, both Democrats, and at least one other,
former Connecticut Gov. Lowell Weicker, an independent, had been
mentioned as a possible third-party presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley now contends that media coverage of those conversations
was overblown. The discussions were part of an effort by the group
to define the major issues facing the nation, he says. But he
claims they did not discuss mounting an independent campaign for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he refused to rule out a third-party candidacy in
1995, he chalked it up partly to frustration with the two-party
system, which he has likened to a broken thermostat: ``You turn the
dial and nothing happens.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said vanity may have also played a role. ``I think I was
having a little difficulty moving off stage,'' he said. ``From my
standpoint, it was never really a serious possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said his decision to step down was not prompted by any
particular event, but was more the result of a gradual realization
that Congress had become overly partisan and that money had become
too important in politics.
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of his dismay were actually sown in 1990, when he
nearly lost his Senate seat to an upstart Republican, Christine
Todd Whitman, despite outspending her 12-to-1 and lavishing more
than $1 million on polling over several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can have too much money, and I had too much money
in 1990,'' he said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   What helped crystallize his disenchantment with politics, as
well as his desire to move onto other things, was writing his
memoirs, ``Time Present, Time Past,'' which he completed in 1996,
he said. Drawing an analogy to his 10-season basketball career, he
noted that he decided to retire from the New York Knicks in 1977
shortly after finishing a book about playing professional
basketball, ``Life on the Run.'' He won his Senate seat the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as in basketball, where my interest in political life
began to go up as the interest in basketball began to go down, my
interest in politics began to go down as my interest in the other
things went up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his friends and aides say they think that Bradley
retired from the Senate largely to prepare for a Presidential
campaign. ``It's not easy to be in the Senate and campaign,'' said
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., who has endorsed Bradley. ``I
know he left meaning to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley asserted that he was not seriously thinking about
running for president in 1995. ``I was thinking about going out and
doing what I ended up doing,'' he said, which included writing a
book, lecturing at Stanford, Notre Dame and the University of
Maryland, and giving speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I do things, I kind of live in the moment and then the
moment evolves into something else,'' he said. Though he is known
as a meticulous planner who carefully deliberates every decision no
matter how small, he added, ``I don't try to set some kind of
target and then shape life toward that achievement. Because that
kills spontaneity and creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought the Gore campaign's attacks on his loyalty
and his toughness were unfair, Bradley demurred. But an aide called
the assertions ``laughable,'' contending that Bradley was
considered a fearsome competitor as a basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democratic members of Congress whom Bradley helped in
those campaigns said in recent interviews that they thought the
Gore camp's attacks on Bradley's loyalty were unfair and
potentially divisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same old political industrial complex,'' said Rep.
Rod Blagojevich, D-Ill., who has not endorsed anyone in the race.
``Gore ought to tell us what he's for and where he'd like to take
America. He has to make a case for why he should be president. Many
of us are waiting for him to do that. It is not helpful that he
attacks Bill Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Udall, D-Colo., , said, ``I think part of Senator
Bradley's appeal, frankly, is that he is extremely comfortable with
himself. He seems to have a vision that he is going to share with
Democrats and the nation. And that comes, in part, from taking a
bit of time out.''

THE RAMS BECOME HOT COMMODITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - After five weeks of the NFL season, the hottest
fantasy players around play for the (drumroll optional):
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis Rams?
</P>
<P>
   Stunning as it might seem, the Rams have built an almost
unstoppable offense. In fantasy leagues across the land, St. Louis
players are being snapped up quicker than refunds on Diamondbacks
playoff tickets.
</P>
<P>
   In my league, they're even asking about owner Georgia Frontiere,
though she's clearly lost a step.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit has gone to St. Louis quarterback Kurt
Warner, the former Iowa Barnstormers (of the Arena Football League)
star who leads the league with 14 touchdown passes in four games.
</P>
<P>
   It took an injury to big-money free agent Trent Green to get
Warner in the lineup, and he may never come out. He's taking full
advantage of his chance to start, which is especially sweet after
he was cut by the Packers and played in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's wide receiver Isaac Bruce, the oft-injured enigma
who has stayed healthy this year and caught four touchdowns Sunday
against the hated 49ers (hated by me anyway, I don't know about the
Rams).
</P>
<P>
   Bolstering the receiver corps are first-round pick Torry Holt
and Az-zahir Hakim, who scored four touchdowns two weeks ago and
forced a legion of grumpy sportswriters to learn how to spell his
name.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget running back Marshall Faulk, another fan of
adhesive tape who has given the Rams a threat at running back. The
St. Louis passing attack is so potent, Faulk at times has been
reduced to a decoy.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dick Vermeil, who is undoubtedly weeping somewhere at this
moment, has also drawn his share of kudos for leading this group
into contention in the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of those guys deserves the real credit.
</P>
<P>
   That goes to the Rams offensive line, which has given Warner
enough time to balance his checkbook and have high tea while he
peruses the field for an open receiver.
</P>
<P>
   The line is led by left tackle and man-mountain Orlando Pace,
the former Ohio State star and the first overall pick in the 1997
draft. The Rams also added guard Adam Timmerman, a former Packer,
to solidify the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in a tough defense that keeps getting the ball back, and
you have a pretty decent team.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you could argue that the Rams are a house of cards,
waiting to topple at the first sign of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Warner is unproven and could end up being a one-year wonder, a
la Jeff Blake, Scott Mitchell and scores of others now toting clip
boards around the NFL. NFL teams are great at adjusting to
overnight sensations (Jake Plummer comes to mind), and the real
test will come when Warner must overcome defenses designed to stop
him.
</P>
<P>
   On the wide receiver front, Bruce is injury-prone, and if he
goes down, the Rams' ability to stretch defenses will be seriously
hampered. The other receivers are either inexperienced or Ricky
Proehl.
</P>
<P>
   At running back, Faulk is always a question mark. He can
dominate one week and disappear the next, depending on his mood.
</P>
<P>
   If you like to roll the dice, you might want to trade away a top
St. Louis player, say Faulk or Bruce, with the idea that it's all
downhill from here.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, the Rams already have exceeded everyone's expectations,
so there. All these guys who are always hurt may stay healthy. And
Warner may lead the league in passing. And the Rams may go to the
Super Bowl.

TORIES THINK THAT THEY HAVE FOUND A CAMPAIGN ISSUE: THE EURO 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Sensing that his beleaguered party has found an issue
to cut into the governing Labor Party's domination of Britain's
public life, the Conservative leader, William Hague, said Friday
that he would tour the country to rally Britons against the
European common currency.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would appear in cities, towns and villages
broadcasting the message ``vote Conservative to save the pound''
from the back of a flatbed truck emblazoned with the slogan,
``Battle for the Pound, Battle for Britain.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea recalled the soapbox that former Prime Minister John
Major, also a Conservative, successfully used to win support when
he was lagging in the polls before the 1992 election.
</P>
<P>
   With little else going their way since their overwhelming defeat
in 1997, the Tories have found favor with the public by demonizing
the European Union as ``the federal superstate'' and characterizing
the Labor Party policy of keeping open the option of adopting the
euro as one of ``scrapping the pound,'' a resonant symbol of
tradition and nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair, in starting up his own campaign on
Thursday to emphasize the benefits to Britain of membership in the
European Union, acknowledged that the Conservative attack on the
single currency had proven ``often effective.'' Reacting to the
Conservative appeal to nationalistic instincts, he insisted that
the real patriotic cause was embracing Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Though Blair was joined by Michael Heseltine and Kenneth Clarke,
both heavyweight members of the last Conservative government, and
Charles Kennedy, leader of the Liberal Democrats, in a rare
cross-party start-up for his Britain in Europe campaign, he played
down the thorny issue of monetary union and focused instead on the
merits of closer association with other European nations.
</P>
<P>
   He said nothing that changed the government's so-called plan and
decide policy, whereby the British are encouraged to prepare for
the possibility of the country's adopting the euro some years from
now while an actual decision is postponed until there is more
economic justification and the British public is more accepting.
</P>
<P>
   Hague was quick on Friday to depth-charge that effort, saying
the new campaign was clearly one promoting the euro itself, not
just Europe. `` Blair has finally, if halfheartedly, joined the
debate on the single currency,'' the Tory leader said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether to join the 11 other nations that agreed Jan. 1 on the
euro as legal tender is the biggest political decision facing
Britain, and in the last week the Conservatives have turned it into
the one on which they hope to work their way back into power.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hague, the Conservative position has been to discourage
thoughts of ever entering monetary union and to rule it out
absolutely through the next elected Parliament, or until 2008. But
at the Conservative conference last week in Blackpool, he moved the
party into an even more hostile stance, placing it not just in
opposition to the common currency but also at greater distance from
the European Union itself. He suggested that the founding treaty of
1957 be renegotiated in Britain's favor and that the country refuse
to participate in any new arrangements that do not allow the
country the right to escape rules it does not like.
</P>
<P>
   Blair saw in this an opportunity to portray the Conservatives as
intent on disengaging entirely from the Continent, an extremist
position that would command little support in Britain, instead of
one of shunning the common currency, now the wish of most Britons.
``We believe that by being part of Europe, we advance our own
self-interest as the British nation,'' he said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns, though, have little to do with economics and
everything to do with public opinion. The Conservatives oppose
swapping the pound for the euro, even if it becomes economically
justifiable. Labor favors the idea and will find it economically
justifiable once it becomes clear that the British public supports
it.

 &HT;    Ex-Atlanta Mayor Young diagnosed with cancer
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Kurylo
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young has prostate cancer
and is scheduled for surgery in early December.
</P>
<P>
   Young's cancer was diagnosed in late September, when a routine
blood test prompted doctors to do an ultrasound and biopsy. His
prognosis is good because the cancer was caught early, said Lee
Echols, a spokesman for Young.
</P>
<P>
   The 67-year-old former U.N. ambassador was traveling Friday to
the Virgin Islands, where he was scheduled to speak and spend the
weekend, Echols said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy is very optimistic about his prognosis,'' Echols said.
``He is a man of very strong faith. Fortunately, this is a curable
disease. It will force him to slow down his pace and his schedule
for several months so that he can take care of himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgery will be at Emory University Hospital, and afterward
Young's doctors will determine what other treatment might be
necessary, Echols said.
</P>
<P>
   Young is chairman of Atlanta-based GoodWorks International, a
consulting company that brings together investors and
entrepreneurs, particularly in Third World countries. He helped
bring the Summer Olympic Games to Atlanta in 1996 and testified
about that effort before Congress on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Friday, Young said he wanted to go public
with his diagnosis partly to encourage middle-aged and older men to
have regular prostate screenings.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of my friends and colleagues have had this operation _
and at a much younger age _ that I consider it a blessing that I've
made it almost to age 68 with no difficulties,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer is the most common cancer, excluding skin
cancer, of American men. The American Cancer Society estimates
179,300cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed in the United
States and 37,000 men will die of the disease this year.
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans have a prostate cancer rate nearly twice that
of whites, and black men are twice as likely to die of the disease.
Treatments include surgery, radiation, hormone therapy and
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Young has had regular blood tests _ PSA tests _ to
screen for prostate cancer. ``Andy's commitment to prostate
screening has enabled him to detect this early,'' Echols said.
</P>
<P>
   Young will curtail his activities in the first couple months of
next year, Echols said. ``This is major surgery and will require
some additional recuperation time.''
</P>
<P>
   Young's first wife, Jean, died of cancer in 1994. They had been
married 40 years. In 1996, he married Atlanta schoolteacher Carolyn
Watson in a ceremony in Cape Town, South Africa.

CHECHEN WAR LEADER TALKS OF `LIBERATION' FROM RUSSIAN RULE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia _ Spitting sunflower shells or plucking them from
his broad, black beard, Shamil Basayev evinced little concern for
the reports from Moscow branding him an Islamic terrorist and the
mastermind behind the bombings of apartment buildings that killed
nearly 300 people last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not care what they say,'' Russia's most wanted man said
on a recent afternoon, sitting on the doorstep of his house in the
Chechen capital. ``Part of me wants people to know the truth and
why we fight. But people are all confused about terrorists and
explosions now.''
</P>
<P>
   Basayev, 34, insisted that he was waging a ``struggle for
national liberation'' to free Chechnya and the neighboring republic
of Dagestan from Russian rule, but that he was not involved in acts
of indiscriminate terror. He denied any role in the bombings in
Russia and said he had no idea who was behind them. Dagestanis
could have done it, he said, or the Russian special services.
</P>
<P>
   To Moscow, Basayev is not only responsible for the bombings: He
and his lieutenant, an Arab guerrilla named Khattab, are also
regarded as dangerous Islamic militants behind a new challenge to
Russian rule in Dagestan, a province bordering on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Basayev was already branded a terrorist by the Russians for his
prominent role in Chechnya's last war against Russia, from 1994 to
1996. His best-known exploit was a hostage-taking raid into the
Russian town of Budyonnovsk.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Basayev led 400 Dagestanis and Chechens into Dagestan
to fight Russian forces that had surrounded a Dagestani nationalist
leader known as Bagaouddin and his men in his home village, high in
the mountains near the Chechen border.
</P>
<P>
   Bagaouddin had returned to Dagestan from self-imposed exile in
Chechnya, and quickly fell into confrontation with the Dagestani
authorities. When Russian troops surrounded him and his men in
their village, Basayev, as head of a Dagestani and Chechen
congress, threatened to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   When the Russian forces turned their firepower on two other
villages that had been taken over by Islamic militants, Basayev and
Khattab burst back into Dagestan on Sept. 5 and fought for six
days, pulling out after the Russians allowed the villagers to
escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a national liberation movement, a struggle for
independence for Dagestan from colonial rule,'' Basayev insisted.
Stalin annexed part of Chechnya to Dagestan in 1944 and deported
the Chechen people to Kazakhstan. ``We have freed part of our
lands,'' he said, meaning Chechnya. ``Now we will free the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   That most Dagestanis do not seem interested in being thus
liberated does not appear to worry him. There are enough who are,
he said, including an emerging new generation of leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Basayev said he was not surprised that Chechens were accused of
the apartment-house bombings, in part because Chechens had
blackened their name by the many high-profile kidnappings that have
become a big business in the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he said neither he, nor any other Chechen, had any reason to
bomb civilian targets at this moment. He only staged his hostage
raid on Budyonnovsk, he added, when pushed close to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we are forced into a corner, we are capable of anything,
like Budyonnovsk,'' he said. ``But we are not in a corner right
now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He did not appear to be, as he joked with his men and played
with his small niece. Dressed in camouflage fatigues, a green
velvet beret on his shaved head, he showed off two Chechen-made
heavy machine guns capable of piercing Russian armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed little moved by the heavy casualties his fighters have
taken already this year; 97 died in the fighting in Dagestan and 45
in the last three weeks in Chechnya, he said. He himself lost 11
members of his extended family when their house was bombed in the
last war.
</P>
<P>
   As for the scores of refugees and civilian casualties already in
evidence here, he answered, ``People see their house being
destroyed today, but I see what will happen to their house next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   He also sees what happened to them in years past. Basayev
describes how every generation of men in his family have fought the
Russians going back six generations, how his ancestor five
generations back was a lieutenant of Imam Shamil, the legendary
leader of resistance against the Russians in the last century. Now,
he says, he is just playing out the last chapter in 300 years of
Chechen resistance to Russian rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``My aim is to rebuild our destroyed state, and then my wish was
always to create a confederation of Caucasus states, that will make
it easier for us all to live,'' he said. -

COURT REJECTS N.H. PLAN FOR STATE PROPERTY TAX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N. H. _ New Hampshire's Supreme Court dropped a bomb on
the State House on Friday, rejecting the statewide property tax
that underlies the public school funding plan agonizingly crafted
last spring by the legislature and Gov. Jeanne Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
   The news ignited emergency meetings around the capitol building
Friday as lawmakers faced the prospect of finding a way to raise
some $440 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   The court declared unconstitutional a part of the funding plan
that phased in the property tax for some towns. Without that
provision, though, it is not clear whether political leaders, who
took months of bitter debate to agree on the formula rejected
Friday, could easily find a new compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``By striking down the statewide property tax, the court has
endangered our ability to keep schools operating,'' Shaheen said in
a terse statement after the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over how to pay for public schools has been the most
divisive political issue in modern state history. In 1997, the
state Supreme Court ruled that the state's traditional financing
system, which relied heavily on local property taxes, unfairly
discriminated against less affluent communities.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers then scrambled to find a new way to raise money, with
some even suggesting that New Hampshire impose its first ever
income tax. To the shock of many and horror of some both houses of
the legislature passed versions of an income tax, but the effort
then failed in the face of threatened Shaheen veto.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the fight looked to be settled, though the solution was
under legal attack from rich and poor towns alike. Yet after
Friday's court ruling many, including the governor, were dismayed
that the battle will now escalate instead of abate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate that the supreme court was unwilling to give
the education-funding plan time to work. Taxpayers across the state
were seeing property tax relief and communities were making major
new investments in their schools,'' Shaheen said.
</P>
<P>
   Property tax bills under the new system have already been mailed
in many towns. School districts are counting on the money and most
residents in the state are looking forward to Christmas season tax
bills hundreds and in some cases thousands of dollars less than
last year's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought it would go this way,'' the state's revenue
commissioner, Stanley Arnold, said after reading the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of an income tax hope that the court decision will
give them added ammunition. The state senate was already scheduled
to take up the income tax issue again on Tuesday. It will now do so
on Thursday, said Senate President Beverly Hollingworth with the
House planning to convene as soon as the Senate takes action.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen would not say whether the ruling had changed her
opposition to the income tax. ``The question was asked,'' said
Hollingworth who met with Shaheen, House Speaker Donna Sytek and
other state officials. ``She said that she did not want to see the
schools closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Shaheen's support, an income tax would probably not
become law, because, said lawmakeres, it would be extremely
difficult to convince two-thirds of the Republican-controlled
400-member House to override a Shaheen veto of an income tax.
</P>
<P>
   If the legislature is not able to come to a quick agreement the
state's bond ratings could be threatened. Last spring, after the
state missed a court-imposed April 1 deadline to find a solution,
bond rating agencies put the state on their ``watch lists'' - a
warming to investors that ratings could drop.
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders were quick to stress that they would not,
under any circumstances, permit a shutdown of the state's public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the schools close. No the schools will not close,''
Hollingworth said. ``What will happen is that the money will come
from the general fund.'' All other state services save the running
of prisons ``will have to wait in line,'' for their money, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the state's poor school districts, meanwhile, said
that they were frustrated that the issue has taken years to settle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This chaos is really unfounded,'' said Andru Volinsky, lead
lawyer for the coaltion named for the mill town of Claremont that
first sued the state in 1991. ``This is inexcusable and it's
happened to them every time. When will they finally learn to plan
for alternatives?''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Sytek, an income tax opponent, predicted that
lawmakers will impose a new statewide property tax, restructured to
make sure that it passes constitutional muster.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever lawmakers do, they should do it quickly, said the man
in charge of collecting the Live Free or Die state's taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislature is going to have to take action rapidly if
they want to have any sense of normalcy,'' Arnold said.

   ALMATY, Kazakhstan _ After the government of Kazakhstan asked
the Swiss to look into foreign bank accounts held by one of the
opponents of the Kazakh president, the Swiss wound up freezing an
account kept for the benefit of the president himself.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Devaud, the investigating magistrate in Geneva, froze an
account in August at Credit Agricole Indosuez, the Swiss affiliate
of a French bank, that Devaud believes is available for the benefit
of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, people with knowledge of the
inquiry said. However, it could not be determined if the
president's name is actually on the account.
</P>
<P>
   The exact source of the Kazakh money held in Switzerland could
not be determined. Kazakhstan, a Caspian Sea nation of 15 million
people about five times the size of France, has received more than
$2 billion in signing bonuses from foreign companies for rights to
explore and develop its vast oil fields in recent years. At least
some of the money was deposited in government accounts in Swiss
banks, people with knowledge of the bonuses said.
</P>
<P>
   The freeze on the bank accounts followed a request by Kazakh
government prosecutors who asked Devaud to examine the assets of a
vocal opponent of Nazarbayev, the self-exiled former prime
minister, Akezhan Kazhegeldin, who served from 1994 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Devaud widened the money laundering inquiry that had
focused on high officials of the Russian government, and ended up
freezing several Kazakh accounts in at least two Swiss banks,
people with knowledge of the order said.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss lawyers for the Kazakh government have appealed to a
Geneva court to lift the freeze order, and the case is pending. A
spokesman for the Kazakh government declined comment, as did
Devaud.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been the main focus of Swiss investigators, but
because of suspicions about money laundering in other former parts
of the Soviet Union, the Swiss have begun looking at bank accounts
held by the governments of Ukraine and Kazakhstan and some of their
leading politicians.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>
   The examination of Kazakh assets is separate from a Swiss
investigation of a construction company, Mabetex Project
Engineering Group of Lugano, that performed major construction work
in both Russia and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   Mabetex won large contracts to renovate the Kremlin and,
according to investigators, paid kickbacks to Russian officials. It
is also accused of providing credit card accounts for President
Boris N. Yeltsin and his two daughters, which Yeltsin has denied.
</P>
<P>
   Mabetex also did construction work in the past few years in the
new capital city that Nazarbayev has built in Astana, located on
the country's vast steppe. Among Mabetex's work was the
construction of a new Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss authorities are looking into whether Mabetex may have paid
kickbacks or provided other benefits like credit cards to Kazakh
officials in return for construction contracts, according to people
with knowledge of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Nazarbayev, 59, Kazakhstan's former Communist Party leader
during the Soviet period, rules his republic autocratically. He has
formed strong friendships with power figures in both the Democratic
and Republican parties in the United States, Kazakhstan's main
guarantor of independence from Russia, and most recently visited
the White House in April.
</P>
<P>
   Since August, the State Department has been considering
sanctions against Kazakhstan because it sold some 40 MiG fighter
aircraft to North Korea, a rogue nation that the United States
views as a supporter of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Washington has criticized Kazakhstan for its
treatment of Kazhegeldin, the former prime Minister and opponent of
the president. Kazhegeldin, 47, was barred from running for
president in January, failed to qualify for last Sunday's
parliamentary elections, and last month was briefly arrested in
Moscow on a Kazakh accusation of corruption and abuse of power. He
was later released without being charged.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakhstan has accused Kazhegeldin of enriching himself as prime
Minister, and as part of its campaign against him the government
asked Switzerland to disclose any bank assets held by him or his
family. Kazhegeldin has denied the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Kazhegeldin also held $4.5 million in deposits at Pictet &AMP; Cie,
a Geneva bank, at least until 1997. But he withdrew most or all of
the funds from Switzerland and moved them to an undisclosed
destination, according to documents of the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   When the Swiss investigators responded to the request for
assistance from the Kazakh government they turned up several Kazakh
accounts in Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   One set of transactions particularly caught their attention: the
movement in the summer of between $80 million and $85 million from
a Kazakh government account at Credit Agricole Indosuez to what
appeared to be a personal account at the same bank held for the
benefit of the president.
</P>
<P>
   In August, after Devaud initiated his inquiry, the money was
suddenly transferred from the personal account to a Kazakh
government account at Pictet &AMP; Cie, according to people with
knowledge of the accounts who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at both banks said they were barred by Swiss bank
secrecy laws from commenting. Swiss law strictly prohibits
officials, lawyers and bankers from discussing such criminal
investigations.

<P>
   Since May, the Brazilian real has been declining. At the end of
last week, it was at 1.98 to the dollar, not far from its low for
the year of 2.15, in March.
</P>
<P>
   But the decline has caused much less concern among investors
than one might think. After all, the 1999 low came after Brazil
made headlines by suddenly devaluing its currency in January.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, four other worrisome events this month have passed
without a major outcry in emerging markets, which just a year ago
were teetering on the brink of disaster.
</P>
<P>
   First is the default, by Ecuador, on Brady bonds, something that
has never happened before. It was those bonds that helped pull
Latin America out of its debt crisis in the 1980s. Second is the
threat of another interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve _ a
move that would steepen borrowing costs of already heavily indebted
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Third is the downgrade by Moody's Investors Service of
Argentina's long-term-debt credit rating to B1, four notches below
investment grade. And fourth is the rejection by Brazil's Supreme
Court of new taxes on retired and active government workers that
would have cut the deficit in the country's social security
program.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one barometer of sentiment is improving. The spread, or
difference, between the yield on emerging-market bonds and the
yield on comparable United States Treasury bonds has narrowed since
August, to 10.87 percentage points from 12.34, according to J.P.
Morgan Securities. The spread has also narrowed for Latin American
bonds alone.
</P>
<P>
   Most Latin American stock markets have also fared reasonably
well. In Brazil, the Bovespa index has rallied 9.3 percent since
August, while in Argentina, the Merval index is up 9.0 percent,
despite recent selloffs in both markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has been strong, given how negative the fundamental
developments have been recently,'' Joyce Chang, global head of
international fixed-income research at Chase Securities, said of
Latin American bond markets. ``If this happened in July, there
would have been a selloff.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this performance, she said, is that ``the
increase of cash inflows into emerging markets is outweighing
negative fundamental developments.''
</P>
<P>
   For investors, this should be a yellow flag. The new cash inflow
is not a result of the improvement in the long-term outlook.
Instead, it is an asset-allocation call. Because expected returns
elsewhere are not looking so good, especially in bonds, global cash
that can go anywhere is finding its way back to Brazil and other
Latin American markets.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman Brothers is recommending a position in Brazil just
because the spread over United States Treasuries there is about 2
percentage points wider than the spread over Treasuries in
Argentina. The belief is that the Brazilian spread should move back
toward the level of Argentina's, which would push Brazilian bond
prices higher.
</P>
<P>
   But as more new money comes in, it may set up another sharp
decline if, as some analysts expect, the news gets worse on Brazil
and Argentina next year. It was the flight of this kind of global
cash that added to the big selloff in emerging markets in the fall
of 1998, when the world financial crisis reached its worst point.
</P>
<P>
   A quick look at Brazil shows that the view into the new year is
not so rosy.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the government is moving to close the deficit gap opened by
the supreme court decision. But the country still has an enormous
debt burden, faces budget deficits in the years ahead that will be
just as difficult to bridge and has a government that could lose
the political will to continue with very painful economic reforms,
especially with important municipal elections next October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil remains vulnerable to swings in confidence and, more
importantly, to political and fiscal shocks,'' said Jose M.
Barrionuevo, director of global market strategy at Lehman Brothers.
``As we move into next year, if there is economic growth higher
than 3 percent in the first quarter, Brazil has a shot at easing
the political pressures.'' That is because the spending cuts and
tax increases needed to balance the budget would be less severe.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if growth is weaker,'' he said, ``the social pressure will
build going into the municipal elections.''
</P>
<P>
   So why recommend Brazilian bonds? ``We are likely to see some
improvement in the short term,'' he said, referring to the interest
rate spread between Brazil and Argentina. But that is not an
enticing invitation for the average investor.

DECLINE IN CANADIAN DOLLAR HELPS LURE U.S. STUDENTS OF FRENCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., N.Y., Wis., Ill., Canada)  (dw) 
 By JAMES BROOKE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   TORONTO _ When Thomas Stasko, a University of Maryland graduate
student, signed up for a French language immersion program in a
foreign university, he decided to go to there by car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was convenient getting up to Quebec,'' he said of his
semester at the Universite du Quebec at Chicoutimi. ``They all
spoke French and were very friendly people.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Canadian dollar trading a near historic low, American
teachers of French are promoting language studies in Quebec
universities and summer camps. By looking north to Canada, French
language teachers are borrowing a tactic from Spanish language
teachers who have long looked south to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   This discovery of Quebec is one of several new tactics aimed at
making French more appealing to an increasingly diverse American
study body. Hoping especially to interest African-Americans,
colleges offer courses in the literature of the French-speaking
countries of West Africa and the Caribbean, as well as study trips
to these regions.
</P>
<P>
   French teachers in Louisiana and the Mississippi River Valley
teach language students about local French history. Study of Quebec
and the Acadian diaspora appeals to many of the 17 million
Americans who are descended from French Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   At stake in this battle for relevancy is the future of language
training in American universities. Over the last 30 years, the
portion of American college students studying a foreign language
has dropped by half, to 7.9 percent in 1998, according to a survey
released on Thursday by the Modern Language Association in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   But the survey indicates a slowing in the sharp erosion of
French, which ranks behind Spanish as the nation's second most
widely taught language. During the first half of the 1990s, French
language enrollments in American colleges dropped by one quarter.
But since then, enrollments have dropped only 3.1 percent, to
199,064 college students last year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, foreign language enrollments were up 4.8 percent. But
this was largely due to Americans' growing interest in Spanish. An
additional 60,000 students took Spanish in 1998, for a total of
656,690. About 30 years ago, Spanish began to surpass French in
popularity among students, and today it attracts more than three
times as many students as French does. The survey showed minor
gains for Italian, Chinese and Portuguese. Losses were recorded for
German, Japanese and Russian.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest news appeared to be the stabilization in French
enrollments, which had dropped by almost half since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of American schools we work with that 10 years
ago had four French teachers and two Spanish teachers, and now it
is the reverse,'' said Woodruff Halsey, executive director of
School Year Abroad, a program that sends about 60 high school
juniors a year to France and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, the number of American college students
studying overseas nearly doubled, hitting 113,954 last year. But
France as a study destination has slipped from second to fourth
place, attracting fewer than 10,000 Americans today. Now, fewer
American college students study French in France than study Spanish
in Mexico and Costa Rica combined.
</P>
<P>
   Quebec was long overlooked as an American study option because
of the province's distinctive accent and because of the heavy
English influence. The twangy regional accent has not softened, and
some students said they did not want it to replace the Parisian
accents they had learned in college. But the nationalist government
in Quebec has worked to purge English from signs and from public
places.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Quebec connection has become quite marked now,'' said
Elaine Marks, a French professor at the University of Wisconsin.
``There are students who are interested in going to Quebec over the
summer, who are unable to go to do the summer in Europe because of
the expense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian dollar trades at 68 American cents, an exchange
rate that makes Quebec a bargain, helping to attract almost 15
million American tourists to Canada last year. The linguistic
bastion of French in North America, Canada has seven million native
French speakers.
</P>
<P>
   With the strengthening of French in Canada, the American
Association of Teachers of French has started to alternate its
annual meetings between France and Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quebec is affordable,'' said Jayne Abrate, the association's
executive director, who teaches French at Southern Illinois
University in Carbondale. She said that elementary school teachers
``who are intimidated about taking a group to France will start out
by taking them to Quebec.'' Every year, more than 100 American
college students study French at the university at Chicoutimi, a
French-speaking city about 225 miles northeast of Montreal. For
programs under 12 weeks, Americans do not need student visas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids come back happy and speaking French,'' said Tom Carr,
a lecturer at the University of Maryland. ``It's so much more
economic, and they can get there by car, which gives them a certain
amount of mobility.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Summer language camps in Quebec are also attracting more and
more Americans. On the American side of the border, a high school
French language camp now takes students on regular trips to
Montreal and Quebec City from the Potsdam campus at the State
University of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the old tourism slogan of Canada as ``friendly,
familiar, foreign and near,'' Americans can go through a bit of
culture shock in Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cuisine is definitely different,'' said Alanna Prisby, a
22-year-old French major from Central Michigan University, who is
spending the fall semester in Chicoutoumi with a family that has
some distinctive favorite dishes. ``For one meal we had cabbage
rolls with potatoes, but with vanilla ice cream on top,'' Ms.
Prisby said. ``We've also had fried bologna with creamed corn on
top.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A jittery stock market moved sharply lower Friday
after an inflation report showed prices rising at an unexpectedly
rapid rate and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve,
alarmed investors by warning that the stock market might be riskier
than many people believe. The market suffered its worst week in a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average traded below 10,000 for the
first time since April, but rallied a bit to close at 10,019.71.
Still, it was down 266.90 points, or 2.59 percent, on Friday. The
weekly decline of 5.9 percent was the worst since a fall of 7.8
percent in the week ended Oct. 13, 1989. That problems are
happening again in October _ a month that has seen crashes before
_added to the market's nervousness.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks fared even worse,
dropping 2.8 percent on Friday to close at 1,247.41, and falling
6.6 percent during the week. That index is now up just 1.48 percent
since the end of 1998, while the Dow, which has a larger
representation of energy issues that have benefited from rising oil
prices, is still up 9.13 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The market has been unusually volatile in the last few weeks,
reflecting concerns that the Fed might raise short-term interest
rates again when it meets next month. At the same time, the market
has been pushing up long-term interest rates, although they fell a
bit Friday. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which set a
two-year high of 6.32 percent on Thursday, slipped to 6.26 percent
Friday as investors sought safety.
</P>
<P>
   All this has come against the backdrop of a booming economy,
which has produced strong corporate profits. ``Earnings have been
good, but interest rates have surprised people by rising,'' said
Byron Wien, an equity strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
``Inflation is not dead, and that has been the undoing of the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   The government reported Friday that the producer price index
rose 1.1 percent in September, the largest monthly climb in nine
years. Most of that could be explained by rising prices of tobacco,
cars, food and energy, but the so-called core rate, which excludes
food and energy, was up only eight-tenths of a percent. Still, the
rise was larger than expected, and that contributed to the
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, addressing a banking conference Thursday night in
Washington, was careful to express no opinion on whether stock
prices were justified by the current economic outlook. But he
cautioned that stock prices had increased in recent years in
significant part because investors think equities are far less
risky than they were historically thought to be, making prices
vulnerable if such confidence were to fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``History tells us that sharp reversals in confidence occur
abruptly, most often with little advance notice,'' he said. ``Panic
reactions in the market are characterized by dramatic shifts in
behavior that are intended to minimize short-term losses.'' He
warned that banks should carry high levels of reserves to protect
themselves against such an occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's telling bankers to be prudent,'' said Hugh Johnson, an
economist at First Albany Corp. ``That is extremely benign. Does it
signal a change in policy? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed is widely expected to raise short-term interest rates by
a quarter-percentage point when it meets Nov. 16. If it does, that
would be the third increase since June, completely erasing the
three cuts it made last year, when the Fed feared world recession
in the wake of the Asian and Russian financial crises. Asian
economies have since recovered much of their losses, and many
European countries are also doing better.
</P>
<P>
   ``When global growth recovers from a significant period of
weakness, inflation and interest rates tend to go up,'' said Doug
Cliggott, an equity strategist at J.P. Morgan Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig &AMP; Co., said he
believed the producer price figure ``ended the debate'' about
whether the Fed would raise rates again. ``They recognize the
economy is growing too fast, and they are going to raise rates
until they slow it down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Greenspan said little in his speech about what he was
going to do, markets around the world weakened as soon as reports
of it were distributed Thursday night. Major stock markets in both
Europe and Asia fell by at least 1 percent Friday, although none
performed as badly as the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the NASDAQ composite index has been a beacon of
strength in the market, reflecting its heavy concentration of
technology issues that have been market leaders. In fact, that
index hit a record high on Monday. But it fell 2.67 percent, or 75
points, on Friday, to 2,731.83, and is now down 6.7 percent since
the Monday high, as leading technology stocks have slipped. On
Friday, Microsoft, Cisco and Intel all lost at least $2 per share.
Still, the NASDAQ composite is up 24.6 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The market has been unusually volatile this year, and that
volatility seems to have intensified in recent weeks. Fane Lozman,
chairman of Scanshift, a Chicago research firm, noted that the Dow
had lost more than 200 points on seven days this year _ four of
them since Sept. 21. ``This shows there is a change in mentality
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That nervousness stems in part from the memories of past
Octobers. The 12th anniversary of the 1987 crash arrives on
Tuesday, 10 days before the 70th anniversary of the worst day of
the 1929 crash. The last week this bad, exactly 10 years ago, came
as the market was shocked by the collapse of a proposed buyout of
United Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Since World War II, only 16 weeks have been worse than this one,
in terms of percentage decline for the Dow, according to Birinyi
Associates, a research firm.
</P>
<P>
   While it is misleading to pay attention to Dow points, given
that the index has gone up so much in recent years, this week's
decline was the largest ever by that measure. The 630.85-point
decrease surpassed the drop of 524.30 points set in the week ended
Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   The market's jitteriness has so far not stopped the booming new
issues market. An Internet stock called Women.com went public
Friday at $10 a share and closed at $18.50, although that was down
from a high of $23.375 reached in midafternoon. Companies scheduled
to go public next week include Martha Stewart Omnimedia and World
Wrestling Federation Entertainment.

BUSH FINDS A FEW CRITICS DURING SCHOOL VISIT IN WASHINGTON STATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Presidential candidate George W. Bush was a hit with
the children at Kimball Elementary School on Friday, but some of
their parents flunked the Texas governor on his visit.
</P>
<P>
   Some grown-ups, who acknowledged they were Democrats, said they
believed the governor was using their children and their school for
his political advantage without trying to understand the school's
funding problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we were being used as his whore,'' Mary Austin, a
self-described ``raging Democrat'' and mother of two Kimball
students, told reporters after Bush had left the school
</P>
<P>
   Other parents said they believed the governor added insult to
injury by turning a student walk-a-thon _ a major fund-raising
event for school supplies _ into a photo opportunity and then
contributing only $20.
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination,
Bush has stopped at schools throughout the country. They are
carefully staged photo opportunities in which the governor usually
answers questions from students and reads to them.
</P>
<P>
   Kimball was Bush's second school Friday. He began a two-day
campaign trip to Washington state with a visit earlier in the day
to an elementary school in Yakima. Later Friday, he addressed the
National Federation of Republican Women convention in Seattle and
planned to attend a Republican fund-raiser Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At the mostly Hispanic school in Yakima, Bush said ``it's muy
importante'' for him to capture the Hispanic vote. He also read
aloud to the class the children's book ``The Very Hungry
Caterpillar.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush followed his normal script at Kimball, a well-respected
school with a large minority, mainly Asian-American, enrollment.
When one fourth-grader asked what Bush would do for education if
elected president, he replied that he would first ``pass power back
from Washington, D.C., to the states'' because he believed in
``local control.``
</P>
<P>
   But the governor's parent-critics said his answer did not offer
them any assurance that he cared about the funding problems that
plague many public schools in their state. Student-teacher ratios
in classes at Kimball range from 28-to-1 to as high as 32-to-1,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   And the parents were at the school Friday to help teachers with
their classroom-related chores.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kovar, a physician and a Democrat, said he did not even
know that Bush was going to visit Kimball and was surprised when
the Republican presidential front-runner showed up as Kovar was
stapling homework assignments for his son's first-grade class.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'Hiya, fella,' like a frat guy,'' Kovar told
reporters later. Bush belonged to a fraternity at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   He said he told Bush that Kimball needed more federal help but
that Bush dismissed his plea. The federal government now
contributes about 7 percent of a school district's budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to call my state legislator. He said the real
problem is federal meddling,'' Kovar added. ``That tells me more
about that man than anything else I can imagine.``
</P>
<P>
   Not all the parents were critical of their visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was thrilling to see the man who might be the next
president of the United States,'' said Mary Wikel-Chauncey,
co-president of the school's Parent, Teacher and Student
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Foreman, the school principal, said she did not know
why Seattle school officials chose Kimball for Bush's visit, but
she said she welcomed the governor's arrival as a ``wonderful
learning experience'' for the students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't matter which candidate came. Some parents would be
thrilled and some wouldn't,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said the governor ``knows when we
have high expectations, high standards and real accountability, our
schools will rise to the challenges and no child will be left
behind.``
</P>
<P>
   Among other education changes, Bush has proposed that schools
that are rated low-performing for three years in a row lose part of
their federal funds. Parents would be allowed to use the funds to
send their children to other schools, including private facilities.

 &HT;    2 CDC doctors share in Nobel Peace Prize
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They might not be at the podium when the award is
formally presented, but in a large way, Drs. Susan Goldstein and
Suzanne Cotter shared in the Nobel Peace Prize announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Both doctors work at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta,
and both are among the thousands of physicians who have volunteered
for Doctors Without Borders, the French-based medical relief group
that won the prize.
</P>
<P>
   Ten idealistic and somewhat brash young doctors from France
started the organization in 1971. Today, thanks to volunteers like
Goldstein and Cotter, Doctors Without Borders provides medical
assistance in more than 80 countries. In all, about 2,000
physicians and medical personnel from 45 countries are working with
the organization. Projects include performing surgery on gunshot
victims in Sierra Leone, improving sanitation in East Timor,
providing anesthesia in Kosovo and striving to prevent cholera in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   The staff and volunteers are famous for working with little
regard for their personal safety. The organization _ which is also
known by its French name, Medecins Sans Frontieres _ has taken
risks as well, defying governments that hinder humanitarian
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In following that committed path, Doctors Without Borders ``has
adhered to the fundamental principle that all disaster victims,
whether the disaster is natural or human in origin, have a right to
professional assistance,'' the Nobel committee said, announcing its
decision in Oslo, Norway.
</P>
<P>
   The award confirms ``the fundamental right of ordinary people''
to medical care and protection, said Dr. James Orbinski, president
of Doctors Without Borders. He quickly added that the honor goes to
many people, especially donors and ``each of our volunteers and
national staff who every day ensure that the right to humanitarian
assistance remains a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Offered congratulations for her share in that recognition, the
CDC's Goldstein laughed. She said her mother called to wake her up
Friday morning with news that the group had won.
</P>
<P>
   A medical epidemiologist in the CDC's hepatitis branch,
Goldstein volunteered with Doctors Without Borders last year. She
spent seven months in a remote area of Ethiopia, where she
developed a program for diagnosing and treating a parasitic disease
called visceral leishmaniasis, or kala-azar.
</P>
<P>
   Through such programs, Doctors Without Borders has saved
thousands of lives in Ethiopia, she said. Joining in the effort
``was one of the best experiences of my life, the best thing I ever
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Cotter, who is from Dublin, Ireland, but currently a fellow in
epidemiology at the CDC, volunteered with Medecins Sans Frontieres
on the other side of the globe from Goldstein. In 1989, she spent
six months helping provide health clinics for Vietnamese boat
people in Hong Kong refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   The organization might have been better known in Europe than in
the United States when she was participating, said Cotter, 39. But
she was impressed with its sound organization then. In the years
since, it has filled in the gaps in so many medical emergencies
that it definitely deserves the Nobel, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing medical services and training, Doctors
Without Borders has assumed another important role, too, added
Goldstein, 38. Witnessing and speaking out about human rights
violations is a major emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   The group's founders _ impatient with the timidity of some other
organizations _ have always said the right to intervene is a moral
imperative. They believed some humanitarian groups were too
reticent to challenge governments that hindered their efforts, and
they valued the role of the media in shedding light on the plight
of people in peril.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that belief, Doctors Without Borders volunteers have
spoken out over the years against genocide, war crimes and crimes
against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel committee recognized that role by praising the group
for helping ``to form bodies of public opinion opposed to
violations and abuses of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, far from every Doctors Without Borders program is likely to
grab headlines. While the group is active in such high-profile
crises as Kosovo and East Timor, Goldstein said, it is just as
vigorously attending to health needs in places far from the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   There could be more of those places soon: The Nobel Peace Prize,
to be presented in ceremonies in Oslo on Dec. 10, is worth nearly
$1 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this amount of money,'' the group's Secretary-General
Jean-Marie Kindermans told the BBC on Friday, ``we will work more
for forgotten populations, which is the more difficult situation to
get funds for.''

MURDOCH SAYS HE'S IN TALKS TO BUY A STAKE IN KIRCH GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, France, Britain, Australia)  (dw) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Rupert Murdoch confirmed Friday that his News Corp. was
in talks to buy a minority stake in the Kirch Group media company
of Germany and might purchase part of Deutsche Telekom AG's cable
business.
</P>
<P>
   But he denied speculation that British Sky Broadcasting Group
PLC, which is 40 percent owned by his company, might purchase or
merge with Canal Plus, the French pay-per-view company that the
French utility giant Vivendi SA owns a large stake in.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch, whose vast media holdings have given him a dominant
presence in Britain's print and broadcast businesses, made the
disclosures to reporters after B Sky B's annual meeting in London.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear from his remarks that he was frustrated over News
Corp.'s unsuccessful efforts so far to gain a prominent foothold
elsewhere in Europe, and he appeared to place part of the blame on
official French obstinance.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling out a B Sky B merger with Canal Plus, Murdoch said: ``It
is nothing to do with Vivendi or Canal Plus. It's purely French
politics. We learned from the behavior of the French politicians
that it wasn't a suitable climate for a British company to be
operating in.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It is the very insistent, bipartisan position of the
French political establishment that television must remain strictly
controlled and regulated in every sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi, which owns 49 percent of Canal Plus, acquired 24.5
percent of B Sky B over the summer, contributing to speculation
that an outright merger might come next. Friday was the first time
Murdoch had publicly discussed the possibility of the tie-up of the
two largest pay television companies in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Concerning speculation that B Sky B was negotiating to buy a
minority stake in Kirch, Germany's second-largest media company and
was eyeing Deutsche Telekom's cable unit, Murdoch said: ``There
have been talks going on, on both fronts. There's absolutely
nothing concrete to announce at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom has been actively soliciting bids to sell its
cable unit in an effort to placate European Union regulators.
Murdoch declined to offer much detail, but he said B Sky B would
not try to acquire Deutsche Telekom's entire cable unit, which
consists of nine regional cable businesses valued somewhere between
$11 billion and $17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't plan any total bid like that,'' he said. ``We may
join with partners, but we don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The B Sky B annual meeting coincided with the release of its
first-quarter results, which showed the company lost 12.1 million
pounds, or $20 million, in the three months ended Sept. 30. A year
earlier it earned 38 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
   B Sky B has been aggressively trying to attract new customers to
use its new digital satellite service by subsidizing much of the
cost of the set-top boxes. Shares of B Sky B fell 3 percent to
592.5 pence, or $9.78.

STARR IS LEAVING, BUT HIS OFFICE IS SAID TO INTENSIFY INQUIRIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID JOHNSTON and DON VAN NATTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a time Clinton administration officials had
hoped that the Whitewater independent counsel office would soon
shut down, lawyers involved with the inquiry said Friday that the
office has intensified its investigation into matters that could
still prove difficult for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The surge of activity in recent weeks has been accompanied by a
change in leadership at the independent counsel's office. The
federal judicial panel that supervises independent counsel issues
has appointed Robert Ray, an aggressive racketeering and gang
prosecutor who joined the office five months ago, to succeed
Kenneth Starr, who plans to step down, possibly as soon as next
week, after holding the job for five years and two months.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Starr, Ray, 39, is relatively obscure in
Washington's political and legal circles. But his appointment
suggested that prosecutors may hope to accomplish more than simply
writing a final report and closing down.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation has recently racheted up, the lawyers said
Friday, as prosecutors have centered renewed attention on trying to
determine whether White House aides played any role in what a
former White House volunteer, Kathleen Willey, has said was an
effort to persuade her to deny that the president made a sexual
advance to her in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the lawyers said prosecutors are continuing to
pursue what they see as their still-open inquiry into the
dismissals of White House travel office employees in the early
months of the Clinton presidency. They are also investigating
whether anyone involved in the matter at the White House misled
investigators about who had ordered the ouster of the employees.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential aides have long denied any wrongdoing in either the
Willey or the travel office matter.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have seemed particularly active in their inquiry
into Ms. Willey's accusations. Specifically, prosecutors are
examining her accusation that Nathan Landow, a high-profile
Democratic fund-raiser and Maryland real estate developer, tried to
influence her testimony in a deposition she was preparing to give
in Paula Jones' sexual misconduct lawsuit against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors from the independent counsel's office have
subpoenaed several associates of Landow to testify before a federal
grand jury in Alexandria, Va., away from the media glare of the
District of Columbia federal courthouse, said one lawyer with
knowledge of the activity.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, agents from the FBI assigned to the independent
counsel's office have recently subpoenaed Landow's telephone logs
and business records in what appears to be an effort to find a
connection between him and White House aides, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Landow has repeatedly denied Ms. Willey's accusation; he would
not comment on the matter Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this renewed activity, it remains uncertain what the
prosecutors hope to achieve in their continuing inquiry and whether
they might plan still more indictments. The lawyers said they
suspected that some prosecutors have never abandoned their goal of
somehow implicating senior White House officials in a crime, even
Clinton or his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton. But others said that
there was scant concrete evidence and little legal basis to support
such an effort.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Starr, who is expected to resume his law partnership
in the Washington office of Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, seems to be drifting
out of public view after a tumultuous tenure in which the
independent counsel's office presided over the investigation of
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Starr's inquiry
culminated with Clinton's impeachment by the House of
Representatives in December and the president's trial and acquittal
in the Senate in February.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House on Friday, the residue of bitterness over
Starr's investigation was apparent even as the prosecutor was
stepping aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as Starr goes, I think Americans will be glad that from
now on, he'll be taking his garbage out each morning in private,''
said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, independent counsels nearing the end of their
inquiries have turned their cases over to deputies who operated as
legal caretakers with the primary jobs of handling appellate issues
and shutting down the office. But Ray is a courtroom-hardened
veteran of criminal trials, and his credentials do not suggest that
he will be a passive legal administrator.
</P>
<P>
   He was an assistant U.S. attorney in New York, where he helped
prosecute a gang known as the ``142nd Street Lynchmob'' under
federal racketeering statutes. He also helped prosecute a
49-defendant organized crime and narcotics case and supervised
``kingpin'' wiretap investigations of large scale drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   His biography, furnished by the independent counsel's office,
said he had conducted ``multi-defendant prosecutions involving
public corruption, organized crime, violent crime and narcotics
trafficking at all levels and stages of federal courts.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Ray moved to Washington to work as a deputy in Donald
Smaltz's independent counsel investigation into whether former
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy had accepted improper gifts from
companies with a financial stake in decisions of the Agriculture
Department. Espy was indicted, but after a lengthy and expensive
investigation and trial, he was acquitted of all charges.
</P>
<P>
   But Ray was the lead prosecutor in the case against Archie
Schaffer, a senior employee at Tyson Foods, the huge Arkansas-based
poultry producer. Schaffer was convicted of two counts of providing
illegal gifts to Espy. The trial judge threw out both convictions,
but an appeals court reinstated one of the counts. A sentencing
hearing is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Just five months ago, Starr named Ray the office's ``senior
litigation counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Lockhart questioned whether experience in the Espy and
Schaffer cases qualified a prosecutor to take over as independent
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's somewhat of a dubious proposition that someone involved
both in the Espy investigation and the Starr operation'' is
``getting a promotion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Lockhart said he had no ``particular concern'' about Ray,
but said there was a broader concern ``that we're continuing to
keep going and keep going and people are moving up.'' He added,
``We think they ought to find a way to wrap this up.''
</P>
<P>
   But another prosecutor in the Schaffer trial, Barry Coburn, said
Ray was a professional, apolitical prosecutor who handles complex
cases like the Espy case with aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were moments during the course of the investigation that
were extremely stressful,'' he said. ``The level of tension was
unlike anything I have experienced. He handled it with calmness,
poise and tact.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ Hurricane Irene brought heavy rains and strong wind
gusts to southern Florida Friday, causing flooding in some areas as
well as traffic tie-ups and power failures.
</P>
<P>
   Friday evening, a 150-foot freighter was washed onto the beach
in Broward County, and a tornado sent several people to hospitals
and did minor damage in Fort Lauderdale. By midafternoon, Florida
Power and Light officials had reported 400,000 households without
power in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. Most of Key
West, in Monroe County, lost power late on Thursday or early
Friday, but by Friday evening, service had been restored. Major
flooding was reported in Miami-Dade and Broward counties and in Key
West.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane, classified as category 1, hit Havana and western
Cuba on Thursday night, destroying more than 10 buildings, causing
scattered power failures and leaving at least four people missing
and feared dead, Cuban officials said. Government offices and
stores were closed, and about 130,000 people from western and
central Cuba were evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane also hit the Bahamas, where four people drowned
when their truck slid into the ocean off a slippery pier in a heavy
downpour, emergency officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The storm reached Florida Friday near Cape Sable, on the
southwest tip of the state, 75 miles from Miami. On Thursday night,
Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida declared a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters are predicting that rainfall from the storm could
top 20 inches in the Miami area. They expect the hurricane to move
northeast across the Everglades before leaving the state overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Mayor Alex Penelas of Miami-Dade County and other
tri-county officials urged people to go home early from work.
Officials also urged thousands of tourists in Key West to leave.
</P>
<P>
   In the Florida Keys, officials issued mandatory evacuation
orders for residents of mobile homes and recreational vehicles.
Public schools and Key West's small airport were closed.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Broward and Palm Beach counties, schools were closed
for a teacher workday. The major airports in the state, including
Miami and Fort Lauderdale International Airports, remained open,
but many flights were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Still, compared with other storms, like Hurricane Andrew in
1992, Hurricane Irene was relatively weak, and many South
Floridians were nonchalant about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a wet storm,'' said Mary Kay Reich, a Monroe
County commissioner. ``We're flooding pretty badly down here in the
Keys, but we're used to riding out these storms.''
</P>
<P>
   Floods in many South Florida neighborhoods and on roads caused
lines of cars to stall. The rain, which at times blinded drivers,
and slick roads caused more than a dozen accidents on interstate
highways.

 &HT;    Atlanta day trader charged by SEC in Ponzi scheme
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Securities regulators Friday alleged that a
32-year-old Atlanta day trader, Mark Drucker, engaged in a Ponzi
scheme that raised $6.2 million from about 80 investors. The
investors thought they could get profits of 50 percent or more, in
two months or less.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission said it obtained a
temporary restraining order in federal court in Atlanta prohibiting
Drucker from violating the anti-fraud provisions of securities laws
and from destroying documents. It also got an order freezing
Drucker's assets.
</P>
<P>
   In its complaint, the SEC alleged that Drucker _ known in
Atlanta social circles for throwing lavish parties _ took money
from new investors to pay purported profits to earlier investors
and to pay his own personal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC alleged that instead of generating fat profits from day
trading, Drucker ``consistently'' lost money _ including $634,453
this year _ trading stocks such as Yahoo, Amazon.com,
priceline.com, Qualcomm and Chase Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Drucker couldn't be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the lawsuit as a ``relief defendant'' was Atlanta
attorney Michael Weinstock, an original investor in the scheme,
according to Richard P. Murphy, the SEC's assistant district
administrator in charge of enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not alleging in the complaint that Mr. Weinstock
actively engaged in the fraud,'' Murphy said. ``We are alleging
that the monies he received _ beyond what he put in _ he is not
entitled to. We are seeking the return of that money for ultimate
distribution to defrauded investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstock invested about $1,035,916 and received about
$1,575,514, according to the SEC. He couldn't be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said regulators also may seek to recoup money and other
assets _ including a $153,000 Ferrari _ from other early investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be determined by evidence received in litigation,''
Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC alleged that from July 1998 through Sept. 30, 1999,
Drucker offered and sold interests in a ``momentum'' stock trading
program that was based on a ``complex mathematical formula.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said most of the investors live in metro Atlanta. Some
live in Michigan and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme spread ``primarily by word of mouth,'' according to
Murphy. ``He (Drucker) relied on some of the earlier investors of
the scheme, who did pretty well, to talk to their friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors signed a management agreement giving Drucker
``full and complete discretion to invest, trade and make
transactions associated with the account,'' according to the SEC's
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said the agency has not been able to find Drucker. And it
doesn't know what assets he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did have cash withdrawals that he took from the account in
August,'' Murphy said. ``There were some wire transfers made out of
the account. We have not yet tracked down where all the money was
sent.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said the long bull market may have had a role to play in
the alleged scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to the later stages of a bull market, people tend
to have more money,'' Murphy explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they are accustomed to whatever the market's been
generating _ returns have been averaging 20 to 25 percent a year _
they become receptive to someone offering considerably more, as Mr.
Drucker was,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line: People should be skeptical before they make
investments,'' Murphy continued. ``There really is no such thing as
a free lunch.''

AT 41, A FATHER FIGURE TO CHILE'S GAY RIGHTS CAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Santiago Journal)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ As a rebel student leader opposing the
Pinochet dictatorship 20 years ago, Carlos Sanchez Soto lived a
double life fraught with danger.
</P>
<P>
   He used to duck the police in the middle of the night to paint
the walls of Santiago with revolutionary graffiti. He was briefly
jailed. He was expelled from his university in 1981 after joining
other dissidents in a daring hunger strike in the Metropolitan
Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   But those were relatively breezy days, Sanchez says, compared
with what he faces now as the most visible homosexual civil rights
leader in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the dictatorship I knew who the enemy was,'' Sanchez
said. ``Now the opposition we face is much broader, more subtle and
harder to identify.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine years after Gen. Augusto Pinochet stepped down as
president, political protests are tolerated, but Chile remains
Latin America's most culturally conservative society. Divorce is
still prohibited, and abortion is illegal even in cases involving
rape or the survival of the mother. Movies and videos are censored.
</P>
<P>
   As far as homosexuality goes, it is rarely talked about. Gay
activists estimate that only about 1 percent of the homosexual
population is openly gay _ lower than anywhere else in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez says no company will hire him to ply his trade as a
computer technician now that his picture has appeared in the
newspapers as a gay activist. He lost most of his old friends when
he came out of the closet six years ago. His relationship with his
only daughter also changed and remains somewhat strained.
</P>
<P>
   When he calls news conferences, usually only the alternative
press shows up. When he goes to Congress to lobby, conservative
legislators refuse to see him. Then there is the tiny gay movement
itself, which activists describe as a pit of jealousy and intrigue,
rife with arguments over tactics and financing.
</P>
<P>
   Now 41, his wispy Trotsky-style beard graying, Sanchez is a
father figure in a movement that is young and politically
inexperienced. He gives advice to young gay Chileans about their
love lives and how to deal with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything else, he balances between those in the
movement who want to shock with their militancy and those who want
to fit into society as comfortably as possible by shunning
demonstrations and isolating those on the fringes, like gay
prostitutes and transvestites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dictatorship period was my political school,'' he said.
``I learned how to organize, how to negotiate and when to break off
a negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recent planning session at the headquarters of the Unified
Movement of Sexual Minorities, of which he is one of eight
directors, a more radical leader spoke in favor of the Communist
Party presidential candidate and suggested that the group invite
all of the candidates competing in the December election to present
their views.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez shot down the idea, explaining later that he knew that
the main presidential contenders would decline, leaving only fringe
candidates to make their case. ``I don't want us to be
marginalized,'' he said, adding that sexual orientation and civil
rights crossed ideological lines.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez's pragmatism has enabled him to work with the Health
Ministry, which gives the Unified Movement of Sexual Minorities
small grants to produce videos for AIDS prevention. His quiet but
persistent lobbying in Congress helped lead to the recent repeal of
a 19th-century law that made gay sex illegal as sodomy.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanchez can be very direct when necessary. Working closely
with Silvia Parada, 30, a transvestite leader, his latest focus has
been on guaranteeing humane treatment and health care for
homosexuals in prison and protesting police brutality against
transvestites and gay prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Monday afternoon, Sanchez put on a staid
double-breasted gray suit jacket and rode the subway with Silvia
Parada to San Miguel prison to visit German (Mariana) Rodriguez, a
transvestite prisoner who has AIDS. When they visited the dim
visiting pen in the prison's Tower 1, the section of the jail where
60 gay prisoners are segregated, they were told that he had been
taken to the prison clinic sick and in great pain.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez huddled with a group of prisoners, first inquiring about
Rodriguez's symptoms and about the care he was receiving and then
about how the prisoners were being treated by guards. The prisoners
described a wide assortment of harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treat us like dogs, not like we're human beings,'' said a
20-year-old transvestite named Manuel. Sanchez, his face tightening
into an angry grimace, shot back, ``Don't ever forget you are a
human being.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we need to do: make an accusation and make it
publicly, so various reporters will start asking questions,''
Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   From the prison, Sanchez and Silvia Parada hailed a taxi to take
them to the Supreme Court building, where a demonstration they had
organized was starting.
</P>
<P>
   With police officers laughing behind them, seven transvestites
stood at the top of the stone entrance steps and spoke out against
what they described as systematic police brutality. One had fresh
bruises across his arms and chest, and stitches above one swollen
eye and below his nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a plague!'' Michel Clemente, 30, pleaded to more
than 50 people who gathered to listen, many with faces of amused
astonishment. ``We're part of this society whether you like it or
not!''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez looked on with a broad smile. ``This is perfect,'' he
said. ``The `girls' will be safe from the beatings for 10 or 15
days at least. It's another small step.''

CONGRESS PASSES $13.7 BILLION SPENDING PLAN FOR NASA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A $13.7 billion spending plan for NASA cleared
Congress on Friday, providing the space agency with about $75
million more than requested by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the legislation puts a hold on a controversial
satellite project pushed by Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The NASA budget, which passed the Senate 93-5, was part of a $99
billion measure financing environmental, housing, veterans and
space programs for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with less than a week left before expiration of a
temporary funding resolution that has kept the government running
since Oct. 1, Congress and the White House have not reached
agreement on five annual spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   Officials signaled Friday that an agreement was likely to pass
another stopgap bill to keep federal agencies operating beyond
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no intent to shut the government down, not on our
part, not on the president's part,'' said House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Congress will have to
make ``a credible case'' for another extension. Republicans must
``come clean, be honest on the numbers, make the tough choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with Clinton opposition to Republican spending priorities,
Congress has yet to approved three bills covering funding for the
departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education,
Interior, Commerce, Justice, State and several smaller agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The president earlier vetoed a bill financing the District of
Columbia _ saying it included misguided social policy and did not
respect the district's right to govern itself _ and Congress
returned to work on the legislation hoping to secure his approval
before Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Also, aides say Clinton plans to veto a second measure covering
foreign aid because it is $2 billion less than he requested and
does not allow for payment of the United States' current, or
delinquent, dues in the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who in August threatened to veto the NASA budget after
House Republicans cut it by almost $1 billion, was expected to sign
the measure early next week.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which was approved Thursday by the House
406-18, sets aside $13.65 billion for space agency programs, about
$12 million less than the current budget. In January, the
administration requested $13.59 billion for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, House Republican leaders yielded to Senate
demands to restore the Republican cuts and add even more for NASA,
the Environmental Protection Agency and veterans' health care.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the House agreed to back off demands for less
spending on low-income housing programs.
</P>
<P>
   At the insistence of House negotiators, the bill puts a hold on
funds for the Triana project, a camera-equipped satellite proposed
by Gore to provide round-the-clock video images of Earth for
Internet users. Lawmakers want a National Academy of Sciences study
of the project's scientific merit before NASA can spend any more
money on the satellite project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disturbing to see NASA wholeheartedly support a project
just because it's proposed by the vice president (while) other
worthwhile projects are scrutinized more closely for their
scientific merit,'' said House Science Committee Chairman James
Sensenbrenner, R-Wisc.
</P>
<P>
   Named for Rodrigo Triana, the sailor who first sighted the New
World on Christopher Columbus' voyage in 1492, the satellite was
scheduled for launch in December 2000. It was to be stationed about
halfway between Earth and the sun.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to beaming back images of the sun-splashed Earth for
viewing on the Internet, the telescope and high-definition camera
aboard the satellite were to provide scientists with information
about weather patterns, cloud formations, oceans and the planet's
vegetation canopy.

 &HT;    Dow dives amid inflation fears, Greenspan signal
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Dow Jones industrial average dipped briefly below
10,000 Friday for the first time in more than six months. The sharp
drop was sparked by renewed inflation fears and some blunt talk by
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   In what Prudential Securities strategist Larry Wachtel called a
``double whammy,'' the government reported a worse than expected
1.1 percent September rise in the Producer Price Index, which
measures wholesale price changes. The core rate _ minus the cost of
food and energy _ rose 0.8 percent, considerably bigger than
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that would have been bad enough for stocks, but it
came on the heels of a Thursday night speech by Greenspan to a
bankers' group. He cautioned them about stock market valuations _
reminiscent of his December 1996 warning against ``irrational
exuberance'' in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's economic reports and Greenspan's remarks renewed
investor concern that the Fed might raise interest rates in
November for the third time this year. The Fed raised rates to
fight inflation after its meetings in June and July. The board left
rates unchanged in October, but signaled it was more likely to
boost them again later than cut them.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, there was considerable uncertainty about what
next week may bring. The government will release the Consumer Price
Index on Tuesday and the balance of trade report on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The market's response to Friday's events was immediate, starting
overnight in the Far East and Europe after Greenspan's speech.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, stocks plunged at the opening bell. When
investors regained their composure, they started shopping for
bargains.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark Dow dipped just below 10,000 shortly after 3 p.m.
_ the first time since April 7 _ and later tested that level before
bouncing back. The index finished at 10,019.71, down 266.90 points,
or 2.6 percent. It was the Dow's worst point loss in more than a
year.

BUSH AGREES WITH TEST BAN VOTE, BUT WOULD KEEP MORATORIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush said Friday he agrees with
Senate Republicans who rejected the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty, but said he would not resume underground nuclear weapons
testing if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters at a Seattle elementary school, Bush
described the treaty, which bans underground testing, as
non-verifiable and argued that ratification would have ``made it
very difficult to make sure our arsenal is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The position puts the Republican presidential frontrunner
directly at odds with Vice President Al Gore. Gore pledged here
Wednesday night that he would to rebsubmit the treaty for Senate
ratification as his first act if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was terse in his answers about the test ban, and did not
elaborate on his thinking. But he did seek to refute an assertion
made Thursday by President Clinton as he lambasted the Senate's GOP
majority for turning down the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   At a White House news conference, Clinton said: ``Now, if we
ever get a president that's against the test ban treaty, which we
may get _ I mean there are plenty of people out there who say they
are against it _ then I think you might as well get ready for it.
You'll have Russia testing. You'll have China testing. You'll have
India testing. You'll have Pakistan testing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, while opposing treaty ratification, said he would keep in
place the current moratorium on underground nuclear testing _ and
thereby set an example to the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the United States can send a strong message, that we
aren't going to test and they shouldn't either,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate refused to ratify the test ban on a 48-51 vote
earlier this week. Only four Senate Republicans broke ranks to
support the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made news in recent weeks by seeming to put distance
between himself and Republican leaders in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   During his two-day visit here, however, the Texas governor is
working to reaffirm his credentials as a GOP loyalist. ``He's a
team player who is working to maintain Republican majorities in
both the House and Senate,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash.,
state chairwoman of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent Friday doing what has become a hallmark of his
presidential campaign _ conducting photo opportunities at schools
with heavy enrollments of minority students.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped at Garfield Elementary School in Yakima, which is 76
percent Hispanic. He read to a group of first graders from a book
called ``The Very Hungry Caterpillar.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, Bush visited Kimball Elementary School on
Seattle's Beacon Hill, where one-third of the students are learning
English as a second language, and again read from ``The Very Hungry
Caterpillar.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimball Elementary School uses U.S. Department of Education
dollars, under a program called Title I, to support three of its
teachers. The program allows the school to lower class size and
give better instruction in reading and mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   If elected, said Bush, he would give ``a bonus'' to schools that
use Title I money to boost achievement scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``If students aren't learning, I have a plan to give your
parents more options,'' he told a fourth grade class, apparently
referring to vouchers that would allow parents to send their
children to private or parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would you do about the homeless?'' asked fourth grader
Anthony Bissiri.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would work with local jurisdictions to get homes for them,''
Bush replied.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name his heroes, Bush started off with ``my dad'' _
former President George Bush _ and listed Great Britain's World War
II Prime Minister Winston Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has raised more than $57 million for his presidential bid,
$20.1 million of it in the third quarter of this year. He ended the
quarter with $37.7 million in cash on hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has spent the last two days debating proposed
campaign spending limits, and has scheduled a series of key test
votes next week. The drive for spending reform is led by GOP Sen.
John McCain of Arizona, one of Bush's rivals for the Republican
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Friday that he would increase the current limit of
$1,000 per election on individual donations to congressional and
presidential campaigns. He also defended political action
committees whose giving would be curbed under a reform proposal
sponsored by McCain and Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis. PACs can give up
to $10,000 in an election cycle to federal candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush noted that PACs are an outgrown of Congress' last effort to
control campaign costs, in the wake of the Watergate scandal.
``PACs are a reform that came into existence to give people a
chance to participate in the system,'' he argued.

ASARCO ACCEPTS GRUPO MEXICO'S $1.18 BILLION TAKEOVER BID 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Asarco Inc. said Friday that its board had voted to accept a
sweetened $1.18 billion all-cash takeover bid from Grupo Mexico AG
and that it planned to break its $1.17 billion cash and stock
merger agreement with Phelps Dodge Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Phelps Dodge decides to increases its bid _ a move
analysts said was unlikely _ its seven-week effort to acquire
Asarco, the nation's third-largest copper producer, will come to an
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, the story is virtually complete,'' said
Clarence Morrison, an analyst at Prudential Securities. ``I don't
see Phelps Dodge increasing its offer, for the simple reason that
they have come to the realization that it is no longer economic to
purchase the company at this point for more than they are currently
offering.''
</P>
<P>
   Asarco shareholders could, however, opt for the Phelps Dodge
offer, particularly if the suitor's stock price rises.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal struck on Oct. 5, Phelps Dodge agreed to pay
$14.75 in cash plus 0.2513 Phelps Dodge share for each of Asarco's
39.8 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Grupo Mexico, a rail and mining conglomerate and Asarco's
largest shareholder, lobbed a $26-a-share, $1.03 billion cash bid
for Asarco in September, topping an earlier hostile offer from
Phelps Dodge. Grupo Mexico sweetened the offer on Oct. 7 to $29.50
a share, or $1.18 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps Dodge said on Oct. 8 that it would not raise its bid.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Suber, a spokeswoman for Phelps Dodge, said Friday that
the company had no comment on the Asarco decision.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Asarco said it intended to end its
agreement with Phelps Dodge ``at or after'' 9 a.m. on Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Asarco will pay Phelps Dodge a $30 million breakup fee when it
ends the deal, Jerry Cooper, an Asarco spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phelps Dodge exchange offer is still open, but it looks
likely Asarco shareholders will go with the cash bid,'' said Tom
Burnett, founder of Merger Insight, which is based in New York.
``However, if Phelps Dodge sees its stock price go up to $62 or
higher, all things could change.''
</P>
<P>
   Phelps Dodge and Asarco shares withstood Friday's stock market
dive. Phelps Dodge closed at $57.875, up 62.5 cents a share, while
Asarco rose 6.25 cents, to $29.375.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Asarco would make Grupo Mexico one of the
world's largest copper companies, with annual production of about
800,000 metric tons.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Asarco's decision to accept the Grupo Mexico bid has
apparently stifled Phelps Dodge's sweeping effort to become the
world's largest copper company. As copper prices slumped earlier
this year, Phelps Dodge began an offensive in August to acquire
both Asarco and Cyprus Amax Minerals Co., in an effort to cut costs
through consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, it looked as if its efforts had succeeded: Earlier
this month, in addition to striking a deal with Asarco, it agreed
to acquire Cyprus for $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   John Tumazos, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co., said
that even if Phelps Dodge abandons its effort to acquire Asarco
now, it may choose to revive its interest later on, particularly if
copper prices slide from their current levels of around 78 cents a
pound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phelps Dodge may have the idea to try and buy part of Asarco
at a lower valuation than $29.75 a share if the outlook for copper
turns out to be unfavorable six, twelve or eighteen months from
now,'' he said. ``Grupo's all-cash offer reinforces my thought that
their expectation about copper prices is very aggressive.''

   There is a ``good news, bad news'' quality to the current
corporate earnings season.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that third-quarter profit growth is projected
to be vigorous, aided by a strong economy and favorable comparisons
with the 1998 summer quarter, a period marred by a strike at
General Motors and turmoil in world financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that because of rising interest rates _ the
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond has risen 1.17 percentage points
this year, to 6.26 percent on Friday _ investors do not seem to
care about the good news. ``The numbers are going to be pretty
robust, but when you buy stocks, you are buying the future profits
of the company,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic
Forecasting Center at Georgia State University. ``With interest
rates rising, the value of the future is discounted. Higher
interest rates make it harder to earn those profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pucci, chief operating officer at IBES International, a
research firm, said that based on estimates of 10,000 securities
analysts, operating profits for the companies that comprise the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index will show a 20 percent gain for
the third quarter and an additional 20 percent in the following
three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are good and the comparisons are easy,'' he said.
``But I think stocks have a little ways to go down, because the
rise in interest rates will cause price-earnings multiples to
decline.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, since the earnings reporting period began in earnest
last week, the S&AMP;P 500 has fallen 6.6 percent. Still, sectors with
stronger-than-average profit growth are more likely to weather the
effects of higher rates than those that underperform.
</P>
<P>
   IBES expects the third-quarter winners to be led by energy
companies, benefiting from the sharp rise in oil prices, with
operating profits up 41 percent. And because conditions were so
poor in 1998, profits at financial services companies should look
much better, too, up an estimated 34.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer cyclical companies, beneficiaries of shoppers' torrid
spending, should see earnings rise 33.3 percent. And technology
companies should do well, despite fears about Year 2000 computer
problems; analysts expect their earnings to rise 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, no sector is projected to show negative earnings growth
for the period, though transportation companies are expected to
show a profit increase of just 1.3 percent. Utilities also fared
relatively poorly, as did consumer staples companies like
Coca-Cola, Gillette and Revlon.
</P>
<P>
   As in the second quarter, when corporate profits were also
healthy, much of the information about the third quarter was
assimilated in advance by investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been talking for a long time about how good
third-quarter earnings were going to be,'' said Sam Stovall, a
senior investment strategist at Standard &AMP; Poor's. ``Now that
earnings are coming in as expected, investors are saying `good.'
It's a little like a kid who wakes up Christmas morning and gets
everything he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grinch in the earnings story, Stovall said, is the Federal
Reserve Board: ``If worries about the Fed raising interest rates
were not there, then I believe stock prices would have upside
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts agree that profit growth should remain strong in
the fourth quarter. But when talk turns to 2000, opinions start to
diverge.
</P>
<P>
   Ratajczak and other economists expect profit growth to slow
sharply next year, as a combination of higher interest rates,
rising employee costs and a slowdown in consumption bites into the
bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have consumption continue like this forever,''
Ratajczak said. ``Profit growth will be slightly negative next year
due to higher labor costs, higher finance charges and slower
revenue growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, profits ``are going to get hit from all sides,'' said
Joseph Carson, chief fixed-income economist at Deutsche Bank
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas M. McManus, equity portfolio strategist at Banc of
America Securities and a longtime profits bull, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   McManus said profit growth next year would slow slightly from
the 20 percent increase he expects for the third and fourth
quarter, but not much.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think operating earnings will rise by 15 percent or better
next year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McManus said the increase in interest rates, wage rates and
commodity prices would prove temporary, and that bonds would rally.
Moreover, he said that profits in 1998 and 1999 have been depressed
by investments that corporations have made in preparation for 2000.
Those investments will start to pay off next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am looking for a bond market rally to shift some stock
market laggards into overdrive,'' he said, pointing to four stock
sectors: financial services, health care, consumer nondurables and
utilities, all of which are suffering because of higher rates.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Yosef Burg, a seminal Israeli political figure who
was a cabinet minister for 35 years as a head of the religious
Zionist movement, died early Friday at Shaare Tsedek Hospital in
Jerusalem. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Burg, a doctor of philosophy and an ordained rabbi, was last in
public in July, when, in a wheelchair, he beamed with pride while
his son, Avraham, was sworn in as the speaker of the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Dresden and educated in Germany, Burg left a few months
before World War II broke out in 1939. He emigrated to Palestine,
witnessing the birth of the State of Israel. He served under every
prime minister until his retirement in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Burg was the minister of the century for religious
Zionism,'' said Yitzhak Meir, the Israeli ambassador to Switzerland
and a friend. Witty and grandiloquent with a thick German accent,
Burg stood for tolerance in relations between religious and secular
Jews. Though his movement, originally centrist, grew increasingly
right-wing, he was seen as a moderate and a force of reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always represented tolerance,'' said Shmuel Sandler, a
historian of religious Zionism based at Bar Ilan University near
Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   Burg, with his chubby cheeks, thick glasses and ever-present
skullcap, belonged to the first generation of religious Zionists,
who formed the National Religious Party in 1956. The only Orthodox
Jewish party that believed that Israel should be guided both by
secular and religious laws, the party was the political arm of the
Jewish settlers' movement.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, critics attacked Burg over ambivalence for not
asserting a more moderating influence over the party before it grew
hawkish.
</P>
<P>
   A polyglot who spoke nine languages, Burg was elected to the
first Israeli Parliament, in 1949. He went on to head a wide
assortment of agencies, including the Ministries of the Police,
Interior and Health, and Religious Affairs under eight prime
ministers. He forged a particularly close relationship with
Menachem Begin, although he opposed the war with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics is not a choice between good and evil,'' Burg said
last year in an interview with The Jerusalem Post. ``In politics,
you have to decide between evil and less evil, and that can be a
cruel choice.''
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, Burg studied at the University of Berlin and
received his doctorate from the University of Leipzig. He received
his rabbinical certification in Germany at 24 and was active in the
Zionist youth movement there.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services will be held on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, Rivkah; his son; his daughter, Dr. Ada
Ben-Sasson, and several grandchildren.

YANKEES, RED SOX BRACE FOR HEAVYWEIGHT PITCHING MATCHUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ On the eve of the most striking postseason pitching
matchup in a generation, the principals didn't exactly play to
their reputations of single-minded combatants.
</P>
<P>
   In this corner, Roger Clemens was talking about the beautiful
fall foliage of New England. In the other corner, Pedro Martinez
was wearing a soft, off-white jacket and black-framed glasses and
saying how much he respected Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured when Martinez and Clemens face each other Saturday
afternoon, in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series,
they will compete like Ali and Frazier, Russell and Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond their individual greatness _ Clemens has won five Cy
Young Awards, Martinez will win his second next month, both seem
destined for the Hall of Fame _ there are fascinating layers to
this game. The Red Sox trail the best -of-7 series 2-0, and history
says they must win Game 3. No baseball team has ever returned from
a 3-0 deficit to win a postseason series.
</P>
<P>
   There are leftover feelings from Clemens' nasty divorce with the
Red Sox: He established his stardom in Boston and departed
unhappily _ he feels he was ushered out by the general manager Dan
Duquette, who essentially replaced Clemens a year later with
Martinez. Cast out as the city's favorite son, Clemens is returning
in pursuit of the championship he never won with Boston, to face
the pitcher who has replaced him in the hearts of Bostonians.
</P>
<P>
   Fenway Park will be an epicenter of emotion. ``I think the
circuit breaker for that electric company, for the great pad in the
sky, might be challenged,'' said Jimy Williams, the Boston manager.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette told ESPN: ``This could be the defining moment in the
careers of those pitchers, and it could be a defining moment for me
personally.''
</P>
<P>
   The conditions may be perfectly suited for power pitchers. The
game is scheduled to start just after 4 p.m. and the sky is
expected to be clear, meaning that the autumn shadows will darken
the infield in the early innings and make it extremely difficult
for hitters to see. The awesome talents of two pitchers headed for
the Hall of Fame will be exacerbated. ``Everybody but two people
are hoping for a cloudy day,'' David Cone said, smiling a pitcher's
smile.
</P>
<P>
   As in most Super Bowls, there is always the chance one or the
other, or both, will struggle. Clemens has had great stuff most of
the season, his fastball 94-96 mph, but his seven shutout innings
against Texas in the division series belied a year in which he was
mostly inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez struck out 28 in 16 innings in successful starts
against the Yankees this season, but he is coming back from a
strained back muscle and even while pitching six no-hit innings
Monday in Cleveland, he was not fully armed with his best stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens mostly has affected a detached air when speaking
publicly about facing Martinez, but others in the Yankees'
organization say Clemens was thrilled to have gotten the
assignment; he badly wanted the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great challenge for Roger,'' said another Yankee.
``Pitching in Boston, against the guy who replaced him, in a
playoff game _ it can't get any bigger for him, personally, unless
it was the seventh game of the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   When Torre told him earlier this week of his opponent _
Martinez, in Game 3 - Clemens responded, ``Beautiful,'' got up and
walked out of Torre's office. It was as if Clemens didn't want to
give Torre a chance to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have a good time with it,'' said Clemens, referring to
himself and family members who have come to Boston to see the game.
``I know the environment, and you know, it brings back memories.
Today we were going down the Mass Pike seeing the color of the
trees. It is awesome, this time of year. This is what you play
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens won three of his five Cy Young Awards and 178 of his 247
career victories while in a Red Sox uniform, but he will be booed
heavily Saturday, in the place that used to be his home ballpark.
``I will be as excited as everyone else tomorrow,'' Clemens said.
``But I think I will have to channel all that and hopefully get off
to a good start and hold up my end of the deal to make it exciting
for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he respects Clemens for what he has accomplished.
``All the players have to have respect for a man like that, a man
that puts up the numbers,'' said Martinez, who, along with his
brother Ramon, will become only the second pair of brothers in
postseason history to pitch for the same team; Dizzy and Daffy Dean
pitched for St. Louis in the 1934 World Series, against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been through everything,'' Martinez said of Clemens.
``He has been through war and he is a great competitor and I'm sure
he knows how to handle the situation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Red Sox have shrugged off questions about the Curse of the
Bambino, rightly noting the obvious: None of them were around in
1920, when the Red Sox sold Ruth to the Yankees, or in 1949 or 1967
or 1972 or 1978 or 1986, when Boston failed to win the championship
that was within its grasp.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Sox could have wondered about their bad luck in the
first two games of this series. An umpire, Rick Reed, admittedly
blew a call that sabotaged Boston's 10th inning rally in Game 1,
and in Game 2, Jason Varitek and Troy O'Leary each came within an
inch or two of hitting home runs, their drives denting the very top
of the right field wall at Yankee Stadium. Then, in the seventh
inning of Game 2, Paul O'Neill drove in the go-ahead run with a
broken-bat, bloop single over shortstop, a fluke hit.
</P>
<P>
   Boston could have created better fortune for itself, too: They
went scoreless in the last seven innings of Game 1, before going 1
for 13 with runners in scoring position in Game 2. The Yankees,
conversely, have capitalized on most of their opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody feels sorry for us, you know,'' said Williams. ``We are
going to be prepared tomorrow. We know we need a win tomorrow. We
are going to do our darnedest to win tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox will have the best pitcher in the American League
going for them. But he will have to beat the best pitcher in modern
Red Sox history to do it. Martinez against Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Said Torre: ``It is electric. It would be a special time if it
happened during the season, but to happen in Game 3 of the American
League Championship Series in Fenway, where both pitchers have won
Cy Youngs _ it is pretty incredible. I just hope it lives up to
that hype, and I have a sense it will.'' &QL;

BAUER SAYS BUSH WILL LOSE ELECTION IF HE STRAYS TO LEFT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Firing an ominous warning from the right, dark
horse Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer said Thursday
that George W. Bush cannot win the presidency unless he sharpens
his conservative message.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, the darling of many in the religious right, said
Republicans are setting themselves up for a great disappointment by
placing electoral pragmatism above their ideological beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Republicans, the surest way to lose is to enter the
primaries looking for a winner,'' Bauer said when asked about
Bush's tremendous lead among Republicans. ``It means that we're
looking at polls instead of having a campaign that is driven by
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited Bush's support for trade with China, his tepid support
for school vouchers and his unwillingness to emphasize social
issues as weaknesses in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe that the current vague message coming out of
Austin, Texas ... can prevail against either Al Gore or Bill
Bradley, regardless of what the polls say now,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer offered his blunt assessment over lunch with California
reporters, during which he discussed matters ranging from his
belief that he can win the presidency to his doubts that gays would
serve in his administration.
</P>
<P>
   The former Reagan aide, who left his post as president of the
conservative Family Research Council to seek the presidency, has
stressed social issues such as abortion, school prayer and family
values in his uphill quest for the GOP nomination. Bauer blamed his
lack of money _ not his message _ for his current low standings in
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it looks like (Republicans) think we can buy an election,
or that the only way to win is to nominate the guy with the biggest
inheritence or the biggest fund-raising effort _ I think almost
inevitably we end up losing,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, who compared his quest to win the nomination to Ronald
Reagan's battle in 1980, said many voters have grown sick &LR; tired of
Bush's apparent invincibility.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer quoted a bartender in Louisiana he spoke with a few days
ago who said, ``I'm so tired of having George Bush being shoved
down my throat.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer criticized Bush for his comments last week in which
he &LR; Bush attacked the GOP Congress for trying to ``balance the
budget on the backs of the poor.'' Though Bauer said he actually
agrees with the substance of Bush's complaint, he blamed him for
using ``the rhetoric of Ted Kennedy and Barney Frank and Hillary
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said Bush is headed for defeat ``unless he defines his
message to be more of a Reagan-type message. I do not believe a
message of trying to be everything to everybody can win.''
</P>
<P>
   On other matters, Bauer said he cannot fathom asking someone who
is openly gay to serve in his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot, in my wildest imagination, imagine someone who is
openly homosexual would want to work in an administration that is
going to emphasize that marriage is between a man and a women ...
and that homosexuality has a moral aspect to it that makes it
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such an individual, in my view, would be so deeply conflicted
that I would worry about their stability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer also warned that there is no room for a pro-choice
candidate on the GOP ticket, and suggested that there would be
widespread defections if the ultimate nominee attempts to name a
pro-choice running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do not have a ticket that at both top and bottom is
pro-life, we may as well cancel reservations for the inaugural now,
because that ticket will not win,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said he supports efforts to crack down on illegal
immigration, and would have supported Proposition 187, which sought
to deny services to those who crossed the border illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to come to America,'' Bauer said, ``apply like
everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   He rejected the suggestion that he was on a quixotic quest in
the hopes of inserting conservative issues into the debate. ``Yes,
I think I can be the next president of the United States,'' he
asserted. Citing the strain of the campaign on his family life, he
added, ``I would never do this just to make a point.''

primaries looking for a winner,'' Bauer said when asked about
Bush's tremendous lead among Republicans. ``It means that we're
looking at polls instead of having a campaign that is driven by
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited Bush's support for trade with China, his tepid support
for school vouchers and his unwillingness to emphasize social
issues as weaknesses in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe that the current vague message coming out of
Austin, Texas ... can prevail against either Al Gore or Bill
Bradley, regardless of what the polls say now,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer offered his blunt assessment over lunch with California
reporters, during which he discussed matters ranging from his
belief that he can win the presidency to his doubts that gays would
serve in his administration.
</P>
<P>
   The former Reagan aide, who left his post as president of the
conservative Family Research Council to seek the presidency, has
stressed social issues such as abortion, school prayer and family
values in his uphill quest for the GOP nomination. Bauer blamed his
lack of money _ not his message _ for his current low standings in
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it looks like (Republicans) think we can buy an election,
or that the only way to win is to nominate the guy with the biggest
inheritence or the biggest fund-raising effort _ I think almost
inevitably we end up losing,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, who compared his quest to win the nomination to Ronald
Reagan's battle in 1980, said many voters have grown sick &LR; tired of
Bush's apparent invincibility.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer quoted a bartender in Louisiana he spoke with a few days
ago who said, ``I'm so tired of having George Bush being shoved
down my throat.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer criticized Bush for his comments last week in which
he &LR; Bush attacked the GOP Congress for trying to ``balance the
budget on the backs of the poor.'' Though Bauer said he actually
agrees with the substance of Bush's complaint, he blamed him for
using ``the rhetoric of Ted Kennedy and Barney Frank and Hillary
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said Bush is headed for defeat ``unless he defines his
message to be more of a Reagan-type message. I do not believe a
message of trying to be everything to everybody can win.''
</P>
<P>
   On other matters, Bauer said he cannot fathom asking someone who
is openly gay to serve in his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot, in my wildest imagination, imagine someone who is
openly homosexual would want to work in an administration that is
going to emphasize that marriage is between a man and a women ...
and that homosexuality has a moral aspect to it that makes it
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such an individual, in my view, would be so deeply conflicted
that I would worry about their stability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer also warned that there is no room for a pro-choice
candidate on the GOP ticket, and suggested that there would be
widespread defections if the ultimate nominee attempts to name a
pro-choice running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do not have a ticket that at both top and bottom is
pro-life, we may as well cancel reservations for the inaugural now,
because that ticket will not win,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said he supports efforts to crack down on illegal
immigration, and would have supported Proposition 187, which sought
to deny services to those who crossed the border illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to come to America,'' Bauer said, ``apply like
everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   He rejected the suggestion that he was on a quixotic quest in
the hopes of inserting conservative issues into the debate. ``Yes,
I think I can be the next president of the United States,'' he
asserted. Citing the strain of the campaign on his family life, he
added, ``I would never do this just to make a point.''

 S.F. Treasure Hunt for Pirated Software Flops  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Microsoft Corp. attorney Anne Murphy was hoping people who were
using pirated software would drop on by Justin Herman Plaza to turn
in their illegal booty.
<P>
   But to perhaps nobody's surprise but her own, yesterday's mildly
publicized ``Ask If It Is Licensed'' event did not draw one single
repentant soul.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of folks who came for the free T-shirts and
free software. And at least one man was more concerned about a
different sort of intergalactic fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Microsoft should have called the event ``Ask, But Don't
Tell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed,'' said Murphy, the chief anti-piracy
enforcement official for the Redmond, Wash., software colossus. She
said a similar event in San Diego drew about 40 computer sellers
who wanted to see if their software was legit, and ``the vast
majority was counterfeit.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and publishing software-maker Adobe Systems of San
Jose sponsored the event to publicize how consumers can tell if
their software was illegally copied and to evangelize about the
evils of piracy.
</P>
<P>
   The companies weren't there to throw violators in the slammer
but would have exchanged genuine software for illegal copies. Then
the illegal programs would serve as evidence to hunt down the real
perpetrators _ the people who actually copied and sold the
software.
</P>
<P>
   Piracy cost the California economy an estimated 18,000 jobs and
$244 million in lost tax revenue in 1998. The estimated rate of
illegal software installed statewide last year was about 29
percent, about eight percentage points higher than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Software piracy includes both individuals and companies that
make and distribute illegal copies of legal software and criminals
who make and sell counterfeit software.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate ceremony in Palo Alto, Gov. Gray Davis signed an
executive order setting government policy for state agencies to use
only legal copies of software. President Clinton signed a similar
order covering federal agencies a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Microsoft also filed federal suits against four
Northern California computer sellers, including one in Fremont.
Microsoft has filed more than 160 similar suits nationwide in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   The people who drifted by during the four-hour event mostly
appeared to be workers enjoying the midday sun rather than software
desperadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Passers-by interviewed agreed that using illegal software was
bad, although none said they would actually walk up to Microsoft
admitting their deed if they were. A few ranked shoplifting a candy
bar as a worse crime.
</P>
<P>
   One 29-year-old accountant from Dublin happily admitted sharing
his copy of Chessmaster 3000 with 10 friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought it, and I can give it to my friends if I want,'' said
the man, who didn't want to give out his name for fear Microsoft
enforcers ``would get bored one day and send their legal team after
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Chu, 39, of Oakland didn't care about software at all. He
was trying to get in front of television cameras with a sign that
read, ``Impeach Clinton. 12 Galaxies Guiltied (sic)  &LR; to A
Techtronic Rocket Society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton has freely committed treason against 12 galaxies,''
Chu explained.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy hoped no one would take the free software given to a
select few in the crowd and make copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone to learn about piracy and then go out and
negatively impact the California economy would be a little bit
cheeky,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Australian tourist Quentin Chester said software piracy wasn't
high on his list of concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Australia, we don't tend to be fussed about this stuff,''
said Chester, 41. ``Australians are pretty laid back.''

PEDRO VS. ROGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Understand this about great postseason pitching
matchups: They are almost entirely circumstantial. That's why there
have been so very few of them.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro vs. Roger is even more special than most people realize.
You might think that during the 96-year history of 20th century
postseason baseball there would be a score of ballyhooed pairings
to stir the diamond soul, but you would be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The very first World Series game featured one, however. Cy Young
(28-9) was matched up on Oct. 1, 1903, against Pittsburgh's Deacon
Phillippe (25-9). There would be no suspense. Pittsburgh won it,
7-3, as an anonymous Globe scribe analyzed as follows: ``Cy Young
was hit hard. He fell considerably short of his best work, lacking
speed, his winning ingredient.''
</P>
<P>
   Christy Mathewson, always a Main Attraction, found himself in a
marquee matchup two years later when his Game 1 foe was
Philadelphia's ``Gettysburg Eddie'' Plank, a fellow future Hall of
Famer. In what would turn out to be merely the first of five
consecutive shutouts for one team or the other, Big Six (31-8, 1.27
ERA) and the Giants beat Plank (25-12, 2.26) and the A's with a
four-hitter, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Said the Globe man, ``Each team had its best pitcher, Mathewson
putting it all over Plank, who was wild and continually getting
himself in a hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathewson could have been matched up with Smoky Joe Wood seven
years later, but it never materialized. Matty faced Ray Collins
once and Hugh Bedient twice. Smoky Joe faced Jeff Tesreau three
times, beating him in Games 1 and 4 and losing to the Giants rookie
in Game 7. Wood did, however, pick up the relief win in the
deciding Game 8 (Game 2 was a tie).
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, two full decades passed before there was
anything close to a stop-the-presses, you-just-gotta-be-there
matchup in the World Series. You can make a case for the 1934 Game
5 pairing of Detroit's Tommy Bridges (22-11, 3.67) and St. Louis's
Dizzy Dean (30-7, 2.66). Bridges and the Tigers prevailed, 3-1, and
the Globe's Victor O. Jones was suitably impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's battle was by all odds the best of the series _ a
tightly played, fiercely fought engagement in which Bridges,
superbly supported, outpitched incredible Dizzy Dean,'' declared
Mr. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later the Game 1 confrontation between the Giants'
``King Carl'' Hubbell and the Yankees' Lefty Gomez had a major
appeal. The Globe headline: FIRST GAME OF WORLD SERIES WILL BE A
``BATTLE OF LEFT HOOKS'' _ GOMEZ AND HUBBELL PERFORM.
</P>
<P>
   John Lardner, meanwhile, soared to lofty rhetorical heights.
``This will make the first game an orgy of sinistralism, an orgy of
saturnalism, a pantheon of portside prowess,'' he gushed.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way there were certainly great pitching battles. You
had Johnny Sain beating Bob Feller's two-hitter in a 1-0 Braves
triumph in Game 1 of the '48 Series. You had back-to-back 1-0 games
to start the 1949 Series (the Yankees' Allie Reynolds over Don
Newcombe and the Dodgers' Preacher Roe over Vic Rashi,
respectively). But it wasn't until 1963 that baseball again had a
primo pulse-racing matchup in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   You want numbers? OK, then, try these. In Game 1 of the 1963
World Series it was the Dodgers' Sandy Koufax (25-5, 1.88, and 11
shutouts) against Yankee ace Whitey Ford (24-7, 2.74). Now that's a
matchup.
</P>
<P>
   The day belonged to Koufax, who established a Series record with
15 strikeouts as he fashioned a 5-2 victory. This was the game in
which Frank Howard hit that famous 450-foot double to the deepest
portion of the old Death Valley in left field at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Jim Lonborg vs. Bob Gibson in Game 7 would
have been a bigger deal if the playing field had been leveled. But
Lonnie was working on two days' rest, while Gibson was working on
three for the Cardinals. Does anybody remember that in addition to
winning the game with a route-going performance, Gibson also hit a
fifth-inning solo homer?
</P>
<P>
   A year later Gibson was part of the next great media hype.
Coming off a memorable 22-9, 1.12, 13-shutout campaign, he found
himself matched up against Detroit's Denny McLain, he of the 31-6
record. Each man did his best to avoid the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not facing Gibson,'' said McLain. ``I am facing the whole
Cardinal team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't pay too much attention to those things,'' echoed
Gibson. ``I will pitch my own game, the same as always.''
</P>
<P>
   (From what we can tell, copies of these statements have already
been faxed to Messrs. Martinez and Clemens.)
</P>
<P>
   The game? Strictly a Gibson show. He fanned 17, prompting at
least one Tiger (second baseman Dick McAuliffe) to say he was ``the
best I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was the Last of the Great Matchups. Oh, sure, former Cy
Young winners Vida Blue (A's) and Jim Palmer (Orioles) hooked up in
Game 3 of the 1974 American League Championship Series and it was a
splendid game (Blue won it, 1-0, on a two-hitter), but this was a
battle between a 17-15 guy (Blue) and a 7-12 guy (Palmer).
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, the single most publicized pitching showdown did
not take place in the postseason. But it did take place right here
on Sept. 6, 1912. Ladies and gentlemen, we give you the legendary
Walter Johnson (28-10) vs. Smoky Joe Wood (29-4, a winner of 13
straight who had not lost since July 4).
</P>
<P>
   Or shall we say, as the Globe did, ``The Terrible Swede''
against the ``Kansas Cyclone''?
</P>
<P>
   This was a Very Big Deal that had been carefully arranged by
managers Jake Stahl and Clark Griffith, a couple of guys with
obvious baseball soul. Check this Globe headline: WOOD AND JOHNSON
IN PITCHING DUEL TODAY. ONE OF GREATEST BATTLES OF BOXMEN IN YEARS
TO BE FOUGHT AT FENWAY PARK.
</P>
<P>
   A great weekday crowd of 29,000 stormed Fenway. ``The playing
field was surrounded by a triple, even quadruple, rack of
humanity,'' reported The Globe.
</P>
<P>
   And what did they get? Merely a 1-0 Wood triumph on sixth-
inning back-to-back doubles by Tris Speaker and Duffy Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Wrote the Globe's venerable Melville E. Webb, ``A pitcher's
battle was predicted between the gladiators of the mound, and a
pitcher's battle it surely was.''
</P>
<P>
   Concluded Mr. Webb, ``It was as sterling a game as possibly
could be played.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, Pedro and Roger. There is your performance bar. Think you
guys can reach it?

 Examiners Get Tough on Santa Clara Bank  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
In what could be a sign of a tougher regulatory stance on risky
loans, bank examiners have instructed Silicon Valley Bancshares to
boost its capital.
<P>
   The Santa Clara bank _ known for financing hot young technology
and health care companies _ said yesterday that it had signed a
memorandum of understanding with the Federal Reserve Bank of San
Francisco and state bank regulators to raise its capital by an
estimated $25 million by year's end. Capital is retained earnings
and money contributed by investors that serves as a cushion against
loan losses.
</P>
<P>
   Examiners ``had concerns about loan quality,'' said John Dean,
Silicon Valley's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum, the mildest form of regulatory sanction, doesn't
mean Silicon Valley is in financial straits. In fact, on Thursday,
the bank reported a record profit of $10.5 million for the three
months ended September 30.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, analysts said, the action may signal that regulators are
putting their money where their mouths have been _ following up
recent public warnings about risky lending with sterner supervision
of banks.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on down
have been sounding the alarm that banks are getting too lax in
commercial lending standards just when the economy may be slowing.
Some of those borrowers may not be able to pay the loans back,
which could produce big losses and a credit crunch down the road.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, said Sutro &AMP; Co. analyst Campbell Chaney, ``Banks
are getting more scrutiny on loan quality now than they have in the
past. This is just the first example. You will see more.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaney was a Federal Reserve bank examiner before he switched
careers.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Richard Spillenkothen, the Fed's top bank
supervisor, sent a seven-page memo to examiners urging them to step
up their vigilance against ``overly aggressive lending practices.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Federal Reserve spokeswoman Carol Eckert declined
to comment on Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, regulators have reason to focus on Silicon Valley
apart from any national trends. The bank has an unusual business
model, somewhere between a conservative bank lender and a venture
capital investor, financing risky young companies most traditional
banks avoid.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year and a half, Silicon Valley's delinquent loans
and loan losses have spiked. In response, the bank has set aside
more money to cover bad loans and reviewed its credit policies.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley officials said the bank's loan problems have been
concentrated in industries outside its technology and health care
specialty areas, and that they are cutting back such loans.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that after a regularly scheduled examination,
regulators pressed the bank to sign a memorandum of understanding
``is something not to be taken lightly,'' said Chaney. ``It tells
me they have a lot of potentially risky credits on the books.``
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the memorandum requires Silicon Valley to boost
its Tier 1 leverage ratio, a key capital measure, to 7.25 percent
by year's end from 6.7 percent at the end of September. The bank,
which has $3.7 billion in assets, needs roughly $25 million in new
capital to reach that threshold, Chaney calculated.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said it is considering a public equity offering to
raise the additional capital. ``We want some cushion (above 7.25
percent) and we want the ability to grow the bank,'' Dean said.

 Religious-Supply Firms Aren't Realizing Visions of Big Sales  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
For many people, the millennium's end is nothing more than an
excuse for one heck of a good New Year's Eve party. For others,
though, this brief moment is seen as nothing less than the
beginning of the end of life as we know it.
<P>
   From the second coming of Jesus to the arrival of the Antichrist
to all-out Armageddon, Y2K is viewed by many in religious circles
as a pivotal event in the history of mankind _ one that is best
prepared for with a renewed commitment to spiritual matters.
</P>
<P>
   This surge in faith-related activity should be making itself
felt in companies that specialize in religious goods. But those in
the religious-supplies trade are finding that sales are up only
modestly as the 1990s stagger to a close.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufer's Religious Supplies, San Francisco's oldest and largest
purveyor of church goods, is a good case in point. Although owner
David Kaufer said it is clear that church attendance is up because
he is selling more candles to parishes, he has yet to see a run on
religious supplies by people believing that the apocalypse is just
around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you going to stockpile?'' he asked. ``Are you going
to buy 100 a hundred  &LR; crucifixes?''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Kaufer doesn't recognize Y2K as a unique business
opportunity. He has high hopes that banners, pins and coffee cups
bearing the Catholic church's official ``holy year'' logo will be a
hot item going into the all-important Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
   And he is keeping his fingers crossed that the increase in
church attendance may prompt more clerics to spruce up their
appearance with new black shirts ($30), white collars ($3.20) or
even a snappy Jesus wristwatch ($37.50).
</P>
<P>
   The religious-supplies field is dominated by companies like
Kaufer's _ small, family run concerns that cater mainly to the
needs of local churches. Only about a quarter of sales are to
walk-in retail customers.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufer's was established in Tacoma, Wash., in 1904, and
subsequently expanded to Seattle and then to San Francisco. The
company grew when it bought out Stadler Co. on Market Street in
1968 and moved to its present location near San Francisco State
University in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufer's serves about 2,200 Catholic churches and 800 other
Christian facilities throughout the Bay Area and Pacific Rim,
including Hawaii, Guam and Japan. It sees approximately $2 million
in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by metal chalices, colorful vestments and crosses of
all stripes, David Kaufer, 49, makes a striking impression with his
long hair, dark eyes, mustache and goatee. He represents the fourth
generation of his family in the religious-supplies industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people in the business, they grow up in it,'' Kaufer
said. ``I've been working in it since I was a teenager.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar story was told by Michael Norton, whose father
purchased 90-year-old McCoy Church Goods in Burlingame about three
decades ago. ``The family structure in this business works well
with churches,'' he said. ``No one's trying to ace anyone out.''
</P>
<P>
   Norton said the millennium has had a small but noticeable effect
on his shop's sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are gathering nuts for the winter,'' he said.
``I've seen people buy multiple candles out of anticipation of
three days of darkness. People are feeling a need to prepare.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days of darkness are one of the prophesies concerning the
return of Jesus and a cataclysmic battle with the forces of
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Other faiths, meanwhile, are finding adherents a good deal less
preoccupied with millennial matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not our millennium,'' noted Millie Goltz, a saleswoman at
Palo Alto's Bob and Bob, the Bay Area's largest purveyor of Jewish
goods. ``For us, the year is 5760.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jerry Derblich, owner of Afikomen Jewish Books, Gifts and
Arts in Berkeley, said he has seen about two dozen Christian
customers stop by his store during the past year to purchase prayer
shawls. He speculated that the buyers may have millennial motives
related to Old Testament prophesies.
</P>
<P>
   By the Islamic calendar, the year is now 1420. Khaled Hamid,
manager of Casbah Halal Market in South San Francisco, said he
hasn't seen much of an improvement in sales of prayer rugs, incense
or other such items as a result of looming Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Muslims consider the year 2000 to be just like any
other,'' he noted. ``They believe God has provided and will
continue to provide.''
</P>
<P>
   While the millennium may be having only a modest effect on
religious-supplies companies, there is another development out
there that many in the business believe could have a potentially
devastating impact: the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, such worries remain largely hypothetical because
there are as yet relatively few religious-supplies firms online.
But it was only a few years ago that online purveyors of books, CDs
and all manner of technology were themselves a rare commodity, and
today, they are turning their respective industries upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, manufacturers sell to dealers, who then sell to the
churches,'' said David Malhame, executive secretary of the National
Church Goods Association in Pennsylvania. ``But if a manufacturer
puts up a Web site, they can sell to anyone they please. Who knows
how this will affect our business?''
</P>
<P>
   David Kaufer isn't sure about that, either. But he does know
that things gradually are changing in an industry that has always
prided itself on being close-knit and cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, for example, an Arizona company began direct marketing
to churches nationwide, seeking to snatch business away from local
suppliers by undercutting their prices. Such brazen aggressiveness
previously was unheard of in the religious-supplies trade, in which
established companies honor long-standing ``gentlemen's
agreements'' not to encroach on each other's territories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to compete with them,'' Kaufer said. ``They have their
game plan and are good at what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   His consternation is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could put an 800 number out there, but I don't,'' he said.
``It's just a personal decision about how we want to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   At McCoy, Norton expressed similar distaste for more
confrontational business practices. But he admitted that his
company is vulnerable to any competitor with the resources to mount
a significant e-commerce operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``No family business has the time or money to maintain a
400-page catalog on the Internet,'' Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   The 800-pound gorilla that many in the religious-supplies
industry are keeping an eye on is an Illinois outfit called Roman
Inc., formerly Roman Religious Goods. With an already substantial
Web site, Roman is well-positioned to capture a hefty online share
of church-goods sales.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for the mom-and-pop shops, though, Roman is more
concerned these days with gifts and collectibles than it is with
traditional religious supplies.
</P>
<P>
   If there is an area where such shops do have legitimate
concerns, it's books. A sizable portion of business for nearly all
religious-supplies companies involves supplying Bibles and other
religious publications to churches and schools.
</P>
<P>
   At Kaufer's, a large part of the company's showroom is devoted
to shelves containing titles like ``10 More Good Reasons to Be a
Catholic'' and ``Sacred Sex: Chastity _ Because You're Worth It!''
More than 60 pages of the company's 550-page catalog are devoted to
books.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufer admitted that his business would take a serious hit if
the major religious publishers offered their products online at
discount prices.
</P>
<P>
   To date, none has rocked the boat. For example, Catholic Book
Publishing Co. of New Jersey offers its ``family edition'' Bible
through dealers and online at the same price: $51.95. The
Liturgical Press of Minnesota offers a book of hymnals both online
and through dealers for $11.95 for orders of 25 or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   However, both companies allow buyers to purchase books online,
thus allowing ``wired'' pastors to bypass local retailers if they
so choose.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for religious-supplies outlets, Kaufer said precious
few members of the clergy are computer savvy. (His company carries
only a handful of religious-software titles.) The threat of direct
business-to-consumer e-commerce will remain limited until a new
generation of tech-oriented pastors arrives on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufer, like virtually all others in his business, insisted that
brick-and-mortar dealers will survive the onslaught of the Net by
emphasizing the personal service they provide to customers _ a
sense of loyalty that he says his customers reciprocate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Churches like the people contact,'' he said. ``They wouldn't
just go on the Internet and buy things directly.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not now, but give them a few years. Whatever else, it
seems clear that the religious-supplies industry will be making
some adjustments by the time a fifth generation of Kaufer takes
over the family business.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if the next generation is keen to carry on the legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufer has three daughters and a son. His oldest child, Lisa,
15, has been helping out around the store for the past couple of
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's my job,'' she said with a shy smile. ``In the
next 20 years, I probably won't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa went on to explain that she wants to open her own bookstore
_ selling mainstream titles, not just religious publications _ and
almost certainly will sell books on the Web, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, sitting beside her, listened quietly, his hands
clasped together as if in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, Dad,'' Lisa said.

COMMUNION WAFER FIRM WON'T BREAK BREAD PACT  &HT;     BY DAVID LAZARUS
</HEADLINE>
 _ SF CHRON   &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Cavanagh Co. of Rhode Island, the world's largest manufacturer of
communion wafers, is perhaps uniquely positioned to cut out the
middleman and deal directly with Catholic churches via the
Internet. The company dominates its market, and its products are
constantly in demand.
<P>
   ``We'd never do it,'' insists George Farrelly, Cavanagh's
general manager. ``We have a conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a decision to pursue e-commerce would have profound
moral implications. That's because Cavanagh now sells its entire
output at wholesale prices to convents around the world, and the
nuns in turn sell the wafers to parishes with a retail markup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The convents rely on altar bread almost solely for their
income,'' Farrelly said. ``To cut them out would be
unconscionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Cavanagh has been in the communion wafer business since 1946,
when brothers John and Paul Cavanagh began building and selling
machines devised by their father to automate the production
process.
</P>
<P>
   They received special permission from the church in the 1950s to
begin producing wafers themselves as nuns became increasingly
unable to keep pace with demand.
</P>
<P>
   Then, about a decade later, the brothers came up with patented
new machines after the Second Vatican Council ruled that communion
wafers should look and taste more like food. They stopped selling
their machines to would-be competitors and focused exclusively on
altar-bread production.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the privately held company operates out of a
60,000-square-foot facility in the town of Greenville, R.I. The
wafers are cut from sheets of flour and water that have passed
through a gas-fired oven and special humidifier.
</P>
<P>
   Cavanagh sells 1,000 white or whole wheat communion wafers to
convents for approximately $9. The nuns then pass them along to
parishes for roughly 50 percent more per shipment.
</P>
<P>
   Cavanagh's wafers account for about 70 percent of the U.S.
market and half of the wafers consumed in Canada, Britain and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Do nuns drive a tough bargain in business negotiations?
</P>
<P>
   Farrelly laughs. ``You'd be surprised,'' he replies.

STANLEY'S INJURY ADDS TO QUESTIONS ABOUT RED SOX LINEUP
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The trainer walked up to Mike Stanley and, without
interrupting the conversation, peeled away the big bandage that
held the ice bag in place on Stanley's left wrist. As he continued
talking, Stanley shifted the soda cup from his left hand to his
right hand. The outside of the wrist was red, but little damage
showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't as much swelling as I thought there would be,''
said Stanley, the Red Sox first baseman. ``It's not that bad. I've
been hit quite a few times this year, but never in the wrist.
Little worried about it, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Had there been a game Friday, could Stanley have played?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he replied. ``I'm not testing it out. Just let
it relax. Sit here with this ice on it. Let it mend, heal. Wait
until tomorrow before I start testing it out. As far as gripping
the bat, I can squeeze pretty good. See how much mobility and
flexibility I have when I start getting into the swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley was hit in the wrist Thursday night by Yankees pitcher
Jeff Nelson in the eighth inning of Game 2 of the American League
Championship Series. He left the game for X-rays, which showed no
break, the Red Sox said. The Yankees went on to win by 3-2 and take
a 2-0 lead in the best-of-7 series.
</P>
<P>
   With Game 3 here on Saturday, most of the conversations
concerned the pitching matchup of New York's Roger Clemens and
Boston's Pedro Martinez. But the Stanley injury also could prove
significant for a gritty Red Sox team that seems to be suffering
physically as the postseason wears on. Martinez missed part of the
previous series against Cleveland with a sore back. Rich Garces, a
relief pitcher, could not pitch in Game 2 against the Yankees
because of a sore arm.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra, the star shortstop, missed one game against
Cleveland with a sore right wrist and has played with bandages on
it. He, like Stanley, was hit by a pitched ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `It hurts, doesn't it?''' Garciaparra said when asked
about his conversation with Stanley about their injuries. ``He's a
little bigger than I am. Bigger bones.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Stanley has only one hit in seven at-bats against the
Yankees, he was 10 for 20 against Cleveland. If he cannot play
first base, manager Jimy Williams would have to make at least one
change in his lineup. Scott Hatteberg, with no at-bats yet in this
series, already was a candidate to replace Brian Daubach as
designated hitter because Daubach is 1 for 10. But Daubach could
stay in the lineup to play first base. Another possibility, at
designated hitter or first base, is Butch Huskey, who struck out as
a pinch-hitter with the bases loaded in the eighth on Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Huskey acknowledged that Stanley's absence might increase his
participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably would,'' Huskey said. ``Hopefully, Stano will be in.
If he's not, we'll keep up from where he is. It's not one guy on
this team that makes this team win every day; guys come off the
bench and do great jobs. Stano has been one of our best hitters in
the postseason. If he can't go, we'll have to figure something out,
get someone in there who's going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked specifically about Stanley's condition, Williams
replied: ``He got whacked good. He got whacked pretty good. I just
talked to him and he says he is better. I said, `Better than what?'
He got hit not too many hours ago, but I really believe he will be
ready to play. He is a tough kid, you know, he is, he doesn't say a
lot. But that ball got him flush.'' &QL;

   OTTAWA _ The last time President Clinton came to Canada's
capital, in 1995, he visited the neo-Gothic Parliament building to
witness the signing of an abstract piece of economic diplomacy: an
open-skies agreement with Canada.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton returned here last week, the benefits were as
concrete as the direct flight between here and Washington's Reagan
National Airport that began two months ago, just in time for the
president's advance team.
</P>
<P>
   The new flight is part of a two-thirds increase in the number of
flights between Canada and the United States over the last five
years. Across the United States, 24 cities have begun direct
flights to Canada. Freed to choose routes and equipped with smaller
commuter jets, Air Canada, the nation's largest airline, has
tripled its American destinations to 45.
</P>
<P>
   By bringing the regional jet revolution to north-south air
travel, Canada now paces Britain as the favored destination for
Americans. Last year, about 8.4 million Americans boarded planes
for each country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, according to analysis by BACK Associates Inc., a
research firm, there are 193,427 commercial flights from the United
States to Canada _ more than the total for Asia and Europe
combined.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation led Air Canada to inaugurate direct flights from
its Toronto hub to a series of unlikely American destinations:
Allentown and Harrisburg, Pa.; Charlotte, N.C.; Columbus, Ohio; New
Orleans; Providence, R.I.; Phoenix, and San Jose, Calif. As a
result, Ontario now receives more American air travelers than
France or Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air Canada built up a nice model for adding direct city
pairs,'' said Don Ogden, an industry analyst in Vancouver. ``Over
the first couple of years they were able to add route after route
after route.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Canadian side, American and Canadian airlines have
channeled most of the growth into the nation's two busiest airport
hubs, Toronto and Vancouver. But new pairings have also evolved:
Winnipeg-Denver, Edmonton-Chicago, Whitehorse-Anchorage,
Ottawa-Philadelphia and Montreal-Portland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Moving aggressively into western Canada, Alaska Airlines has
inaugurated service from Seattle to Calgary, Edmonton and Kelowna,
British Columbia. Connecting the prairies, Northwest Airlines has
started flights linking Minneapolis and Regina, Saskatoon and
Kenora.
</P>
<P>
   On Canada's Atlantic side, Air Canada has service between Prince
Edward Island and Boston and has just inaugurated a daily flight
from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Dulles International Airport in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Since the open-skies agreement was signed in February 1995,
Northwest and Continental Airlines have each inaugurated 10 flights
to Canada. American Airlines has inaugurated eight, United Airlines
six, US Airways four and Delta three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I find out there are new routes being established
between our two countries,'' said Canada's prime minister, Raymond
Chretien, who came here for the Clinton visit. ``Open skies is
great because it has changed the way we do business. It has brought
far more Americans to Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not always been this way. Before the accord was signed,
passenger traffic was stagnating. Since the accord, it has jumped
about one-third.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was enormous frustration on the part of business
travelers, tourists and family members how to get to Canada,''
recalled Federico Pena, who was U.S. transportation secretary when
the 1995 agreement was signed. Speaking from Denver, where he
advises an investment firm, he added: ``There were very, very few
flights, very few locations. If you wanted to fly to Canada, you
had to go through a number of airports.''
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation negotiations had dragged on for years, stalled
largely because Air Canada and its smaller rival, Canadian
Airlines, feared they would lose market share to American
competitors. In the end, a fresh team was brought in and the
Canadians were given a two-year head start to open new routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the signing on Parliament Hill in 1995,'' recalled
Paul Frazer, spokesman for the Canadian Embassy in Washington.
``There were all these other people, some with gray hair. I was
trying to figure out who they all were. It turned out the room was
full of negotiating teams going back 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Canada is currently fighting a hostile takeover: a proposal
to merge with Canadian Airlines, on which shareholders are to vote
Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how a merger might affect the new American air
links, and there is some fear that fledgling American routes might
be cut to increase the combined airlines' profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Partly to head off criticism that he wants to create a monopoly,
Gerald Schwartz, a Canadian financier who is leading the takeover
bid, announced last week that if his merger plan was approved, he
would largely freeze domestic fares and route networks for five
years.

SEARCHERS FIND BODY OF 10-YEAR-OLD KIDNAP VICTIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD ESPINOZA and TANYANIKA SAMUELS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Investigators Friday found the body of
10-year-old Pamela Butler in a field a few hundred yards from a
church in Grain Valley. She was covered with sticks, and her
clothes were strewn nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the story didn't have a happy ending, like we
had hoped,'' said George Sims, a spokesman for the Kansas City,
Kan., police. ``But we did find her.''
</P>
<P>
   Pamela was kidnapped Tuesday evening, snatched from the street
while she skated in front of her family's home in Kansas City, Kan.
As one of her sisters watched, a stranger threw Pamela into a
pickup and sped away.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities Thursday charged Keith D. Nelson, 24, with
kidnapping. Nelson was arrested earlier that day on the banks of
the Kansas River near the 18th Street Expressway bridge. He was in
custody Friday night at the University of Kansas Medical Center,
where he was being treated for a severe leg injury.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 p.m. Friday, Pamela's father, Paul Butler, tearfully told
friends and news reporters, ``They found her; that's all I can
say.''
</P>
<P>
   About an hour later, Cherri West, Pamela's mother, talked about
how she'd been bracing herself for the possibility of Pamela's
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was worried about her not eating and being cold,'' West
said, crying. ``Now I don't have to worry about that; but this
isn't the way it should have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities searched four sites during the morning before
turning almost full attention to the partly wooded Grain Valley
area. It was the third time detectives looked there, but they
wanted to go in further Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt there was still evidence out there, so we wanted to do
a large-scale, thorough search,'' said Monte Strait, assistant
special agent in charge of the FBI's Kansas City office.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 FBI, Jackson County and Wyandotte County, Kan.,
officials fanned out across the field, which borders the woods and
encircles the Grain Valley Christian Church. Slowly, methodically,
they walked shoulder to shoulder through the knee-high grass and
overgrown brush, finally disappearing into the thicket.
</P>
<P>
   About 12:30 p.m. searchers found Pamela's body lying several
hundred yards northwest of the church. They had searched a little
more than a square mile.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, members of the search team found items of clothing that
matched what Pamela was wearing when she disappeared Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the body was found, about 60 FBI agents and other
investigators kept scouring the land behind the church, looking for
additional evidence, such as blood and more clothing, FBI spokesman
Jeff Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
   For several hours Pamela's body remained where investigators had
come across it, while the lawmen finished examining the area for
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   They said they couldn't tell how Pamela died and were waiting
for the results of an autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation in Grain Valley was to continue into Friday
night and resume at first light Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela's body was carried away in a coroner's van at 4:25 p.m.
to the medical examiner's office. An autopsy was expected to be
performed Friday night, and but U.S. Attorney Steve Hill said he
would not release the cause of death because it was an ongoing
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has been charged in federal court with kidnapping Pamela
and carrying her into Missouri. Hill said Nelson may appear before
a magistrate early next week. Officials are waiting until he is
physically and mentally fit.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said investigators will continue to evaluate the evidence
and decide whether to bring additional charges. Hill said
investigators will continue to look into the possibility of a
second suspect, but refused to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the U.S. attorney's office said they planned to
meet with Jackson County and Wyandotte County officials and
Pamela's family before deciding on whether to seek the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had been searching for Pamela since Tuesday, when
she was dragged into a pickup near her home. Another driver gave
chase and although he lost track of the pickup, he wrote down its
license plate number and reported it to police.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the abductor literally lay in wait in the
truck as Pamela skated unsuspectingly toward it. As she approached
the back of the truck, he jumped out and threw her inside, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   An hour or so after the abduction, a church custodian and his
wife saw a pickup parked behind Grain Valley Christian Church, near
where Pamela's body was found Friday. They told authorities they
didn't see much inside other than a brown plaid afghan with a
fringe, spread over the front seat. The truck didn't belong at the
church, so the man wrote down its license plate number for police.
</P>
<P>
   Grain Valley Police Chief Gary Scherer praised the custodian,
saying his tip was critical in this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had that not happened, we might never have gotten here,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The pickup was next seen about midnight, parked in the 3000
block of East 14th Street, about four blocks from Nelson's mother's
home. It had been emptied, vacuumed and scrubbed inside and out,
according to an affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   But when investigators removed the seat, the affidavit said,
they found longish, light-colored hair strands that matched
Pamela's hair.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle was identified by its owner, who told authorities he
had lent it to Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at Nelson's mother's home, detectives saw an afghan
similar to that the custodian described as being in the truck. A
tracking dog that had sniffed clothes from Pamela's room walked
around the house and stopped at the afghan.
</P>
<P>
   But where were Nelson and the girl?
</P>
<P>
   Nelson was found about 1:30 p.m. Thursday after a civilian
employee of the Kansas City, Kan., Police Department took lunch to
her husband on the job at the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad
tracks near 18th Street and the Kansas River. She decided to take a
slow drive along the dike on a hunch that Nelson might be there.
</P>
<P>
   She spotted him near the expressway bridge and he hobbled on his
injured leg into the river. Railroad workers took Nelson to shore
and held him for investigators, who turned him over to a helicopter
ambulance crew.
</P>
<P>
   Cherri West said her family needs help for the burial. Donations
may be sent to the Pamela Butler and Family Fund, First State Bank,
650 Kansas Ave., Kansas City, KS 66105. Checks should be made out
to the Pamela Butler and Family Fund.

DOW DIPS 267 POINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market dropped 267 points Friday _ an 11.5
percent slide from its all-time high in August _ as investors
panicked about an ominous inflation report and a warning by the
Federal Reserve chairman that stocks are becoming risky.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's close of 10,019.71 marked an official ``correction''
in the market, or a drop of 10 percent or more from the index's
all-time high of 11,326.04, reached on Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   The rout was triggered by a carefully worded speech delivered by
Fed chief Alan Greenspan on Thursday night that warned investors
and lenders to prepare for a ``reversal'' in the business cycle and
``inevitable'' losses as stock or other asset prices fall.
Investors then were hit by a government report that wholesale
prices in September had their biggest jump in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was a perfect illustration that inflation and stock
prices tend to go in opposite directions,'' said Doug Cliggott,
managing director of J.P. Morgan in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about the next few months. We've got more bad news
on inflation and interest rates ahead of us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's slide Friday, to 10,019.71, was the outcome of a
nerve-wracking day in which the index plunged by more than 200
points during the first hour of trading and later slumped to a low
of 9998.18, before recovering slightly. It was the first time since
April 7 that the market has dropped below the psychologically
important 10,000 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Other major stock indexes dropped even more. The
technology-heavy Nasdaq plunged 75.01 points, or 2.67 percent, and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index gave up 36.01 points, or 2.81
percent.
</P>
<P>
   With Greenspan's speech still fresh in investors' minds, the US
Department of Labor reported that inflation may be gaining
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Investors fear that if the CPI begins to creep up, the Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates for a third time this year to
cool a sizzling economy and attempt to relieve inflationary
pressures. If the Fed, at its Nov. 16 meeting, increases rates, the
cost of borrowing for businesses and consumers would rise,
dampening demand for goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesale prices paid to producers rose 1.1 percent in
September, the government said. That translates to a 3.39 increase
in the producer price index during the past year, according to
Oscar Gonzalez, an economist for John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance
Co..
</P>
<P>
   Subtracting out fuel prices, prices, which have been rising, and
food prices, the so-called ``core'' producer price index was up a
hearty 0.8 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very large number,'' said Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Said Greg Smith, chief investment strategist in New York, ``If
you were worried about Greenspan before, that (PPI report) just
cranked it up another notch.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a clear trend of higher wholesale prices, however, there
is virtually no evidence that they are being passed through to
consumers, analysts said. But economists will be closing watching
the consumer price report for September, which will be released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's market, nearly every industry _ from financial
services to automobiles _ was pummeled. Some small technology
stocks listed on the Nasdaq declined 20 to 30 percent or more.
Motorola Inc., General Motors Corp. and Biogen Inc. fell by more
than 5 percent. And financial stocks, which are particularly
sensitive to moves in interest rates, fell sharply. A large
credit-card issuer, Capital One Financial, gave up more than 8
percent of its value.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market seemed to be non-discriminating in taking stocks
down,'' said Steve Esielonis, head of global equity strategy for
State Street Global Advisors, division of State Street Boston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's fallout capped a week in a nervous market marched
steadily downward in reaction to each whif of bad news. Market
analysts said Friday's reaction to bad news was the most dramatic
example of how jittery investors have become.
</P>
<P>
   On a calmer note, Wayne Ayers, chief economist for Fleet Boston
Corp., said the forces driving wholesale prices in September ``are
probably going to be one-time events.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Clough, chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch &AMP;
Co., sees the early signs of weakness in the economy, including a
softer bond market than a year ago, a softer dollar, and
indications that some companies relied on ``accounting'' to boost
profits.
</P>
<P>
   A slowdown in the economy would be welcome by the Fed, which
would see less reason to put on the brakes by raising interest
rates. Clough said a slowdown that brings softer profits and lower
sales is another scenario for weak stocks in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually we're going to see demand slow down,'' Clough said.
``It's taken longer than we thought because money has been so
available, but once it starts to slow we'll see more profit
problems. That's why the market is so weak. I don't think it's an
inflation problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps reacting to signs of weakness, yields on the benchmark
30-year US Treasury bond dipped to 6.26 percent. That is down from
a two-year high of 6.33 percent on Thursday.

PATERNO PREPARES FOR OHIO STATE BY ASKING FOR PEACE AND QUIET  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Pa.)   By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. _ He believes his team is being treated like
rock stars and, frankly, Joe Paterno does not like it. So the Penn
State football coach pulled the plug on the show _ the publicity
one _ this week and asked the team's fans to ease up and let the
Nittany Lions prepare for Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   No autographs. No crowd scenes. For reporters, he offered up
three players for a total of 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get away from it,'' Paterno said of his Nittany
Lions, 6-0 and No. 3 in The New York Times computer ranking. ``It
got to the point where we've got to get some control over it. You
guys keep forgetting they're still college students.
</P>
<P>
   ``LaVar Arrington walks down the street and he's besieged by
people. You're the first people that would crucify them if they
don't go to class or they flunk out of school or something happens
to them. I've got to protect them. This is just a week I felt I had
to get a grip on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outmaneuvered, Ohio State Coach John Cooper reminded
his players that no one is clamoring for them. They are a modest
4-2 and have hardly resembled the Big Ten power that has finished
No. 2 in the final national rankings in two of the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper caught his players' attention when he suggested the
Buckeyes needed a poor game from Penn State to win Saturday at
Beaver Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty obvious that if we play our best game and
they play their best game and neither team makes any mistakes,
they'll probably win the game,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Each coach is doing what it takes to gain an edge in one of
college football's newest and fiercest rivalries. Since Penn State
started playing in the Big Ten in 1993, the two have met six times.
The Buckeyes have won four of them _ including a 28-9 thumping of
the Nittany Lions last year.
</P>
<P>
   In asking for peace and quiet this week, Paterno acknowledged
that Ohio State, despite its two losses, could be the most
formidable threat to his team's national title aspirations and
indicated he wasn't entirely pleased with his team's performance
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions needed a blocked field goal to down
Pittsburgh, a late bomb to outlast Miami and have sputtered the
last two weeks in victories over outclassed opponents, Indiana and
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have been a tired football team,'' Paterno said.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State is trying to play down the rivalry. Safety Derek Fox
said the Nittany Lions do not want to put the Buckeyes ``up on a
pedestal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a big week,'' Fox said. ``But this year, myself and this
whole team, we're taking a different approach. Sometimes, we put
too much emphasis on this game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes, meanwhile, are befuddled about their coach's lack
of faith. Some bristled. Others tried to get inside Cooper's head,
and still bristled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a fair assessment because if that's the
case, then we don't need to play the game,'' Ohio State wide
receiver Reggie Germany said.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Ahmed Plummer tersely said that he would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Mike Collins acted stunned. ``Wow, that fires
me up,'' he said. ``That gets me upset to hear that.''
</P>
<P>
   The All-Big Ten linebacker Na'il Diggs tried to play it off as a
motivational technique _ to insure that his Buckeyes are more like
the team that defeated Purdue, 25-22, last week rather than the one
that gave up 42 points and lost to Wisconsin the previous week.
</P>
<P>
   Diggs has reminded his teammates that they were the nation's No.
1 team last year when Michigan State came to Columbus and upset
them, and that an upset of undefeated Penn State would move them
back up the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he is irritated at Cooper's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is, it's a weird way of doing it,'' Diggs said of
Cooper's needle. ``If it is, it sounds like it should work. It's
going to tick a few guys off.''

FAMILY, FRIENDS REMEMBER PAMELA BUTLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STACY DOWNS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ As her relatives wept, Amanda West recalled
the little things she did with her stepsisters, Penny and Pamela
Butler _ things that now have become important memories.
</P>
<P>
   She and the two girls had fun when they shopped for school
supplies or when they recently attended a church retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a blast,'' Amanda West said. ``I don't know what it's
going to be like without both of them together.''
</P>
<P>
   The body of 10-year-old Pamela was found Friday in a partly
wooded area in Grain Valley in Jackson County. Pamela had been
missing since Tuesday evening when she was abducted while skating
on the street in front of her home in Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   As the news spread, friends and relatives gathered to hug and
cry on the front lawn of the family's home in Kansas City, Kan.
They shared memories of Pamela, who loved to play outdoors. They
said she was a sweet girl, who often smiled and laughed.
</P>
<P>
   They brought flowers and mementos that were placed with the
candles, stuffed animals and large cards on the front porch of the
modest two-story frame house. Others handed Cherri West small
amounts of cash they had collected. West said it would help pay for
her daughter's burial.
</P>
<P>
   Penny, Pamela's 11-year-old sister, stood with family and
friends on the front porch after learning that her sister's body
had been found. Her eyes were red from crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure it's hit Penny yet,'' said her mother, Cherri
West. ``In a couple of days, she'll want to play and ask `Where's
Pammy?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Penny saw a stranger grab Pamela and drive away.
</P>
<P>
   Before the death of Pamela, whom many called ``Pammy,'' the
sisters always played together.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't pry them apart,'' said Amanda West, 18.
</P>
<P>
   Cherri West talked about how people wouldn't get to see Pamela,
a fifth-grader at Fiske Elementary, grow up to realize her dreams.
She was a straight-A student who wanted to go to Sumner Academy,
where students who have excellent academic records can attend
starting in the seventh grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her wish didn't come true,'' Cherri West said between sobs.
</P>
<P>
   She thanked the community for its outpouring of support and for
working hard to find Pamela and the person who abducted her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope no one else in this community has to go through this,''
she said.

BOSTON COLLEGE IN A MUST-WIN SITUATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At the beginning of the season, almost everyone on
Boston College's football team recognized the sixth game of the
season against Pittsburgh was important. If everything fell into
place, the Pittsburgh game could provide an opportunity for the
Eagles to start 6-0 and become bowl eligible.
</P>
<P>
   But the Eagles' 24-14 loss at Temple last week changed all that,
transforming Saturday's game against the Panthers (3-2, 1-1 Big
East) at Alumni Stadium into a must-win situation for the Eagles
(4-1, 1-1).
</P>
<P>
   Junior quarterback Tim Hasselbeck suffered a mild separation of
his right (throwing) shoulder against Temple. Although Hasselbeck
had been medically cleared to play, coach Tom O'Brien will start
redshirt freshman Brian St. Pierre against the Panthers. O'Brien
said he did not want to put at Hasselbeck at risk, and will have
him back up St. Pierre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim has so much more experience, and we've tried to get Brian
in the games and have him play,'' O'Brien said. ``You just don't
know what he's going to do in a full game. That's the biggest
apprehension I have on my part about Brian right now, but I feel
confident in his ability.''
</P>
<P>
   There are hardly any easy games left on BC's schedule, which
will get exponentially tougher next week against Miami and at
Syracuse Oct. 30. The Eagles wrap up the season with games against
West Virginia (Nov. 13), at Notre Dame (Nov. 20), and at Virginia
Tech (Nov. 26).
</P>
<P>
   That explained why, as far back as last week, senior center and
offensive captain Butch Palaza was prompted to remark that the Pitt
game ``was going to be humongous for us.''
</P>
<P>
   With BC's season hinging on Saturday's outcome, it could be even
bigger than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be huge,'' said Pedro Cirino, BC's senior free
safety and defensive co-captain. ``There's a lot of implications in
the Big East standings. We can't afford to go 1-2 in conference. We
have to do whatever we can to get this game. They're going to come
up with the same mindset and the same attitude. It's going to be
tough, but we're going to be at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers enter the game on the heels of a 24-17 loss to
Syracuse Oct. 7. Quarterback David Priestley entered the game in
the second half in relief of starter John Turman. Although
Priestley rallied Pittsburgh from a 24-0 halftime deficit to within
a Hail Mary heave at the end of the game, Pitt coach Walt Harris
indicated earlier this week that Turman will remain as his starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the decision to go with David because I thought we
needed a spark (against Syracuse),'' Harris said. ``But that
doesn't mean that John is finished as a starter.''
</P>
<P>
   During their first open date of the season Sept. 11, the Eagles
saw what Pittsburgh capable of in the Panthers' 20-17 loss at Penn
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone came back to the locker room the next day and said,
`Pitt's for real,' '' said Hasselbeck. ``You look at that game and
they probably should've won that game. Then you look at the
Syracuse game and the ball doesn't bounce their way the whole first
half. I mean with a couple of breaks, they're 5-0. They've had some
tough losses, but they're a good football team.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien was most impressed by Pitt's improved running game, led
by junior tailback Kevan Barlow (90.0 yards per game), who ranks
third in the conference behind Virginia Tech's Shyrone Stith (116)
and BC's Cedric Washington (114.4).
</P>
<P>
   ``Barlow's a great back and has really helped them a lot as far
as their running game goes,'' O'Brien said. ``They're sound on
defense and come at you from all angles and play solid defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing its first game of the season and being outgained
by Temple, 492-328, O'Brien realizes his team cannot afford to
dwell on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's move on,'' he said. ``Let's just worry about and take
care of the things we have control over and let the other things go
away. That's the only way we're going to get another victory this
year, and that's to focus and concentrate on the opponent at hand
and that's what we have to do.''

PARENTS CAN TEACH CHILDREN MEASURES TO REDUCE RISK OF ABDUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN UHLENHUTH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The kidnapping Tuesday evening of 10-year-old
Pamela Butler from the street near her Kansas City, Kan. home
serves as a chilling reminder, says Sgt. Joe Reed of the Overland
Park, Kan., Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't any guarantees, and we're vulnerable as a
society.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, he and other law enforcement and mental-health
professionals point out that such tragedies need not cause
excessive worry among other children and their parents, and that
there are actions people can take to minimize the odds of such a
tragedy striking again, closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of random acts of violence, parents should
reassure their children and reinforce the importance of exercising
certain reasonable safety measures, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which children become anxious over random violence
aimed at other children varies widely, said Sharon Cain, a clinical
assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Kansas
Medical Center in Kansas City, Kan. She suspects that only a small
proportion of children are seriously troubled by news of such
tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she said, parents ``need to be reassuring, that
they're doing everything they can to keep (their children) safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Calvert, a clinical social worker at Crittenton, said:
``If your child is particularly anxious, I think you would want to
validate their concerns and fears, allow them to express their
feelings about it, and then open it up to talking about, `What kind
of things can we do to keep ourselves safe?' ''
</P>
<P>
   She suggests that parents address, ``Why is it important that we
know where you are, and if you go someplace else? Why is it
important that you be with friends, and not out by yourself? Why is
it important not to talk to someone who approaches you in a car?
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time,'' she cautioned, ``you don't want to cause
them anxiety and fear. You want to emphasize your confidence in the
child's ability to make safe decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed, of the Overland Park Police Department, points out that
there are ``no recipes'' for preventing such a tragedy, but he
encourages parents to take certain steps.
</P>
<P>
   It is best that children be supervised by an adult when they are
not at home, he said. And those who are supervising should ``look
with a suspicious eye to what's going on around them. Is there a
strange person here with their kid, or (someone) paying undue
attention to kids?''
</P>
<P>
   Next best to adult supervision is the company of other children.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, ``we need to keep hammering home the point
about when a stranger approaches, when you get that uncomfortable
feeling, go with that feeling, run, seek the nearest adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people stop and ask directions or offer rides, if you don't
know the person in the car and they're approaching, get away from
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve McBride, executive director of the Kansas City branch of
the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, noted that
Pamela Butler ``did one thing that she absolutely needed to do. She
brought attention to herself and to what was being done to her.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, people obtained a description of the abductor's
vehicle and the license number. Those clues helped police in their
hunt for the abductor and led to the arrest Thursday afternoon of
Keith D. Nelson, 24, on the banks of the Kansas River near the 18th
Street Expressway.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a key, key thing, to bring attention to yourself,'' he
said. ``She did great.''
</P>
<P>
   Some perpetrators have been known to release children because of
the ruckus they were causing, McBride said.
</P>
<P>
   Caryln Saunders, a counseling psychologist in Kansas City,
concurred with the need for parents to reassure and instruct their
children about safety precautions. But she added one other note _
don't overreact.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such an unusual event. I'm not trying to minimize
what's going on, but how long has it been since we had an event
like this in Kansas City? People are more upset about this than
being in a car accident, and yet the probabilities are so far
apart.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Majority Whip Tom DeLay has never been called
shy about displaying his power.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, the 52-year-old Texas Republican
mischievously showed that he really does know how to use the long
whips that he keeps coiled in his office as symbols of his job as
the House's chief head-counter and vote wrangler.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay slipped out the back door of his suite, holding a red,
white and black, braided Hungarian whip. He marched out to the East
Front of the Capitol, instructing his bodyguard to warn police that
the loud bangs that would soon ring out were not gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   Then, standing as poised as a ballet dancer, he swung the
eight-foot coil over his head and sent its end cracking, again and
again. Bill Paxon, a former congressman turned lobbyist, who had
been nearby, whispering into his cellular phone, cowered and called
out playfully, ``I didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, no one questions that the whip-cracking DeLay is the
House's most powerful member. Though technically just the
third-ranking member of the Republican leadership, he wields more
influence than Speaker Dennis Hastert, whose election he largely
orchestrated. Although he enjoys moments of showmanship, he has
acquired this power more quietly, building a political machine that
many experts call the most formidable organization of any member of
Congress today. The confederation, knitted over the last five
years, includes House loyalists, DeLay proteges, political
committees and corporate lobbyists all deployed to expand and
protect the thin Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   The machine is fueled by money and some of his fund raising has
been criticized because, even though he is a federal official, he
seeks contributions that fall outside the purview of federal
election law. He has raised millions of dollars for other
Republicans, including state officials, sometimes by using legal
loopholes in the campaign finance laws. DeLay is currently raising
funds for a controversial $25 million drive to counter labor union
efforts for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In his brashness, DeLay has sometimes skated close to the
ethical edge. Reports that he has demanded declarations of loyalty
from lobbyists have led the House Committee on Standards of
Official Conduct on two occasions to remind him of the rules
against linking official actions to partisan considerations. But
ethics complaints against him were dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay is a powerful force in the conservative wing of his party
and led the charge for the impeachment of President Clinton. But
Republican moderates turn to him, too, and several say they like
the way he is masterminding the Republicans' budget showdown with
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to turn over to my kids a country that I had a part
to play in changing from the failed welfare state that I lived
in,'' DeLay said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of DeLay's strength that he was the only House
leader to go unchallenged when the loss of House seats by
Republicans last November forced the resignation of Speaker Newt
Gingrich and set off a struggle for every other post in the House
Republican hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's never been more influential than he is right
now,'' said Rep. John Doolittle, R-Calif., who is part of DeLay's
whip organization. Marshall Wittmann, a congressional analyst at
the conservative Heritage Foundation, said: ``He is the most
powerful majority whip in the history of the House of
Representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every member of the current House Republican
leadership is somehow indebted to DeLay _ either because of favors
he has performed or campaign funds he has shared. And his kitchen
cabinet of plugged-in players in the lobbying world meets regularly
in DeLay's inner sanctum.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay wins praise from Republicans for his skill, his energy and
his willingness to help colleagues. But much of his power is rooted
in his unabashed devotion to political money.
</P>
<P>
   In Gingrich's absence, Delay has emerged as the chief
fund-raiser for the National Republican Congressional Committee,
the campaign arm of House Republicans. Republican strategists
estimate that DeLay, through telemarketing, direct mail and
personal appearances, has helped raise at least $11 million in the
first half of this year _ or nearly half the organization's money.
</P>
<P>
   ``My infrastructure expands,'' he said in an interview. ``The
number of people I know, the networking and everything, just grows.
It doesn't happen overnight. It's a lot of work. Years of work.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Now DeLay is helping his conservative allies raise money for an
ambitious new enterprise, a $25 million campaign to counter
organized labor's plan to help Democrats in the coming
congressional elections. The effort is being directed through a
non-profit corporation that can raise money in unlimited sums
without disclosing its donors.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., a sponsor of legislation to
overhaul campaign finance, has called the secrecy of the group
``unbelievably sick.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay argued that the group was necessary to return Republicans
to their grass roots. ``There's no other organization that can
fight with the unions toe to toe, in the streets, in the
communities,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   Partisan battle is what DeLay is all about. He is proud of
running the whip's office not just as a vote-counting operation but
as part catering hall, part campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   He will help a fellow House member find a private plane if the
Republican needs to get to an event quickly. He will travel to a
far-flung congressional district to headline a fund-raising event.
He routinely offers buffet dinners in his office during the House's
late-night sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's barbecue,'' said Doolittle. ``Sometimes it's
fried chicken. Sometimes it's pizza. Frequently it's more than one
of those things.
</P>
<P>
   Even though that doesn't have anything to do with the
legislative process, it develops closer relationships,'' he said.

CITY RIVALRY A ONE-WAY AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rudy Giuliani had just ended his daily news
conference and was walking briskly toward the door when I shot out
the question I had traveled so far to ask: ``Do you regard Boston
as the major cultural rival to New York?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No more questions,'' an aide barked in a typically New York
way. Giuliani paused in the doorway and stared back bemused, his
coterie of advisers pausing silently around him.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the eruption that was no doubt to come at the very mention
of his archrival city, his patience breaking like a pane of glass,
the seething quotes that would tumble forth. Boston? You think that
glorified little cowtown peopled by puritanical nerds could even
hold a church candle to my teeming metropolis?
</P>
<P>
   He opened his mouth. I squinted in delighted dread.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Boston very much,'' he said, smiling. ``It's a very
nice city. But my attitude is that you can't rival New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Like it very much? Very nice? That scum. How dare he!
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the mayor has gone soft, so I quickly punched out the
number to a real New Yorker, Ed Koch, a guy who would just as soon
disembowel Bambi as tell you how to find the 4-train up to the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Boston,'' he says. ``But there are no rivals to New
York. We're the capital of the world in commerce, culture,
capitalism, everything. But if it spurs you on, that's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Love? Spurs you on? The temerity. The ruthless brass!
</P>
<P>
   OK, next up: Donald Trump. His assistant announced that he was
unavailable. Aha. The man is so obviously outraged and threatened
at the mere mention of his metropolitan nemesis that he can't find
his way to speak a few civil words. Finally, we're getting to the
moody core of this dark rivalry. So I approach someone of equal
importance: Trump Tower doorman John McDwyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big Brahmin hello to you,'' I said, knowing that would get
him _ the history he doesn't have, the refinement we do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston's a beautiful city,'' he offered.
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful? I am incensed, almost irrational. In a last-ditch
effort, I take myself up to Game 1, where I find a man named Carl
Marino from Tinton Falls, N.J., walking around the outfield stands
in a T-shirt that, politely paraphrased, says, ``Boston is not a
nice place.'' Here we go (wink, wink). The rivalry lives on. You
just have to know where to look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never been,'' he shrugs when asked what he so despises about
Boston. ``My wife wants me to take her there. I just haven't gotten
around to it.''
</P>
<P>
   As I walk away despondent, he calls out sympathetically,
``Boston's all right.'' No, you don't understand.You don't
understand that because we hate you, you must hate us. We draw
life, fullness, validation from your hatred.
</P>
<P>
   We want to hear all the cliches. We want to hear you call us
dorks, geeks, simpletons who marry our own cousins (for the money)
and look at fish and chips as a gastronomical triumph. The men
among us, such as we are, wear brown shoes with blue suits, right?
The women look at Talbot's as the height of fashion. We are Timex
to your Rolex. We want to hear this because it makes us matter.
</P>
<P>
   And we'll strike back. Will we ever. You are predatory and
unsavory and uncouth, not to mention unfriendly. So there. Your car
breaks down on I-95, give it 20 minutes before it's stripped of its
stereo, tires, for God sakes, its dignity. So many of you wear
black that the entirety of Manhattan Island looks like a seminary
school for wayward priests with cell phone addictions. You are
personified by this mananimal Joey Buttafuoco.
</P>
<P>
   All else aside, you do hate our baseball team, don't you? We're
your worst nightmare, right? True enough, you got our goat back in
1920, all for the benefit of ``No, No Nanette.'' You killed us in
September of 1949. You stole our hearts on Oct. 2, 1978. And, OK,
your Yankees have 24 world championships in a span of time in which
the Red Sox have none. But now we have arrived on the doorstep of
history.
</P>
<P>
   We are, as novelist Alexander Theroux writes about this fierce
rivalry, ``natural enemies, threatening entities.'' I call Theroux
for encouragement. Just kidding, he says. ``The rivalry is all in
the minds of Bostonians. It's an amazing hubris on your part.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're like our little brother,'' said Sal Cozzupoli, another
Yankees fan in a ``Boston is not a nice place'' shirt.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes me hate them even more. Is it really too much
to ask that they hate us in return?

WASHINGTON: he said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Building DeLay Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Delay was never expected to become whip. When Republicans won
the majority in 1994, Gingrich had endorsed his friend, Rep. Bob
Walker, R-Pa. Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., also made a spirited and
well-financed run. But DeLay defeated them both, benefiting from
nine months of helping Republican congressional candidates around
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   He formed a leadership political action committee, known as
Americans for a Republican Majority, that poured $2 million into
the campaigns of incumbents and challengers. The group has received
large donations from an array of corporations, including tobacco
and telecommunications companies. He has traveled to 25 states to
help get Republicans elected, offering campaign advice,
fund-raising help, anything that a candidate asked for. His toiling
translated into votes.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, now a lobbyist, still seems somewhat jarred that DeLay
defeated him. ``Tom is someone who enjoys raising money,'' Walker
said. ``It is one of his strengths. Even though I didn't want to
campaign that way, I admired in the end that it was successful for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mildred Webber, a DeLay loyalist who managed his campaign
for whip says that it was more than contributions that led to
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom knew that it wasn't just going to be money that got us the
majority _or that won him the whip race,'' she said. ``It was going
to be a full-service operation and that's what we became.''
</P>
<P>
   He even sent out tapes to candidates providing such practical
tutoring as how to use lawn signs.
</P>
<P>
   After securing the whip's job, DeLay continued using money to
enhance his power, much like other aspiring House leaders. Because
he rarely faces a serious challenger for re-election he
traditionally gives away as much as 90 percent of his campaign
funds. And, with Gingrich gone, DeLay has become the linchpin
between Republicans in the House and their conservative donors. His
popularity with these donors was enhanced by his role in the
impeachment of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't waste Tom on small donors,'' said one of DeLay's
advisers. ``We don't ask him to make $1,000 calls. He makes
six-figure calls.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay has expanded his organization from a vote-counting
operation into a kind of political machine.
</P>
<P>
   This year, through a program called Romp, or Retain Our Majority
Program, DeLay nudged his deputy and assistant whips to contribute
to the campaigns of 10 Republican incumbents who were in dange of
losing their re-election races. The money was supplemented by
lobbyists, political action committees and other House leaders,
altogether netting more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's edge was apparent in an early draft of the program's
organization plan, written by an aide. It opened with a quote from
Winston Churchill that seemed to capture the spirit of the office:
``Victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory
however long and hard the road may be. For without victory there is
no survival.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay also opened an offshoot of ARMPAC in Virginia, where he
gave donations to candidates for the state legislature. He called
the focus on state politics essential to ``grow the majority
party,'' saying it was designed to help create a farm team for
Congress and wrest control of state legislatures before crucial
decisions on redistricting that could affect control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Operating in Virginia allowed him to take advantage _ as other
lawmakers have done _ of that state's lack of contribution limits
for PACS. In 1996, the Virginia operation directed $12,000 back
into DeLay's federal PAC, drawing a warning letter from the Federal
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Although DeLay eventually closed his Virginia group, his federal
PAC has continued to maintain a state fund that accepts corporate
donations and keeps its records to itself. The organization is in
the process of registering again in Virginia and Mississippi,
associates said, and plans to focus on the 22 states that allow
corporate contributions to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Another organization that benefits from DeLay's fund raising is
the Republican Majority Issues Committee, which Democrats have
challenged before the Federal Election Commission because of its
decision not to report donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the worst thing in politics is anonymous, under the
bedclothes money,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   The group is led by Karl Gallant, who previously ran the federal
PAC for DeLay. For years, Gallant fought organized labor as vice
president of the National Right to Work Committee. He described the
group as a ``mirror image of the AFL-CIO'' because it would devote
its efforts to identifying and turning out conservative voters in
key Congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the organization unusual is that it is registering
under the IRS code as a nonprofit corporation involved in politics.
That designation means that it does not have to make its tax
returns public or report its contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal election law, such a group is banned from
coordination with candidates and Gallant carefully says that
although DeLay is a major fund-raiser, the organization is
independent from him. ``We are separate from the DeLay operation,''
he said. ``I have had to leave the nest to get this started.''
</P>
<P>
   But many Republican-leaning lobbyists say they consider the
group another surrogate DeLay organization, and DeLay has been
unabashedly helping it raise money. He says he does not run the
group, but he does not distance himself from it either. And he
staunchly defends the lack of disclosure because ``the law doesn't
require it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be glad to disclose it if I can get disclosure of Ralph
Nader's groups, disclosure of the ACLU, disclosure of the leftist
organizations,'' DeLay said. ``If they'll disclose, I'll
disclose.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee made its initial pitch for funds earlier this year
on the private yacht of Amway president Richard DeVos and his wife,
Betsy, the chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party, both of
whom are among the Republican Party's biggest donors.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay and the other Republican leaders in the Hose were all on
hand. The first to step forward with a pledge was lobbyist and
fund-raiser Jack Abramoff, who is close to DeLay. He says he will
raise ``plenty'' for the effort.

 WASHINGTON: the effort.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Protecting a Majority
</P>
<P>
   A larger majority in the House would help DeLay with his job as
whip _ to pass the Republican legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   To carry out that role, he has assembled 64 colleagues into what
has been called the largest whip organizations in decades, and also
one of the most effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think I'm handed a bill and I go to the floor and
try to pass it,'' DeLay said. ``It takes much more work. It takes a
lot of work one on one with members.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's clout was most visible in last year's Republican
leadership elections. DeLay, who has earned the moniker ``The
Hammer,'' was the only one of the Republican leaders to go
unchallenged and in most of the other races he mobilized on behalf
of chosen candidates.
</P>
<P>
   He virtually installed his chief deputy whip, Hastert, R-Ill.,
as speaker after DeLay's first choice, Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La.,
unexpectedly stepped down because of reports of sexual
infidelities.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas Davis, R-Va., who was elected chairman of the
National Republican Congressional Committee, was DeLay's candidate.
The ascension of Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., as Republican Conference
chairman in place of Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, led to another
increase in DeLay's power: the uncontested role as his party's
chief liaison with lobbyists, trade associations and business.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming the majority, House Republicans have aggressively
sought to make sure the corporate interests who benefit from their
agenda hire more Republicans and give them financial support and
lobbying help.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay has long had a kitchen cabinet of lobbyists who meet with
him regularly. Among those hashing out strategy are Paxon, who has
joined the Washington law firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &AMP; Feld,
Abramoff of the Preston, Gates &AMP; Ellis law firm, David Rehr of the
National Beer Wholesalers Association, and Dan Mattoon of Bell
South Corp.
</P>
<P>
   This year DeLay has used his role as liaison to the corporate
world to organize business groups into loose-standing coalitions
around particular issues. His office has relied on high-tech
companies, for example, to build support for legislation shielding
business from lawsuits resulting from Year 2000 computer problems.
When he was fearful that a bill alloting funds for the U.S.
military operation in Yugoslavia would not pass, he enlisted the
lobbying might of defense contractors.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbyists report back with details of whom they contacted.
Aides to DeLay say that the lobbyists get nothing specific in
return though one DeLay loyalist acknowledged, ``We do know who
produces votes. Guys who do well see more favor in our eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay has sought to convince lobbying firms and trade
associations to install more Republicans in their executive
positions. He was warned by the House Ethics Committee after he
tried to persuade a lobbying group not to hire a Democrat as its
president.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay does not insist that every Republican back the
leadership's legislative goals on every vote. And he loses some,
such as the recent defeat of a managed health care bill favored by
the Republican leadership over a more stringent version. Instead,
he demands a signal of how each member will vote _ yes, leaning
yes, no, leaning no _ and he expects no surprises.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing moments of a recent vote on the spending bill for
foreign operations, DeLay signaled to two lawmakers sitting behind
him. Aides said the motion had a meaning: He was letting his
colleagues know he had enough votes to pass the bill without their
votes, and that they could vote no.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are members who on any given issue, because of their
districts or their own particular circumstances, can't vote for a
particular thing,'' said Doolittle. ``He knows who they are.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   FROM HUNTS IN THE SHIRES TO THE HALLS OF CONGRESS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The term ``whip'' was first used in the British Parliament and
was derived from the fox hunt, where a person called the whipper-in
kept hounds in a pack.
</P>
<P>
   The majority whip is the third-ranking member of the House
leadership, responsible for knowing the whereabouts of party
members, knowing how they will vote on specific issues and lobbying
them to support the party position. Through weekly floor notices,
the whip keeps party members up to date on the floor schedule and
when to expect important votes.
</P>
<P>
   The party in a minority in the House also elects a whip.

   It seemed a good idea at the time. When a business acquaintance
named Jerome Axelrod approached John Paul DeJoria, the co-founder
of the Paul Mitchell line of hair-care products, with a plan for
distributing the company's shampoos, detanglers and sculpting
sprays in the People's Republic of China, DeJoria jumped at the
chance.
</P>
<P>
   After all, why not have somebody you know _ someone you trust _
act as your representative in what is potentially one of the
biggest consumer products markets in the world?
</P>
<P>
   Three years and one lawsuit later, DeJoria is far from bubbly
about the arrangement. His privately held, $100 million company,
which is based in Santa Clarita, Calif., has broken off relations
with Axelrod, who also uses the name Jerome Alexander in business.
And DeJoria is suing him, along with several other defendants,
accusing them of creating a fraudulent operation in place of the
promised distribution in China.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit contends, among other things, that most of the
products sent to China ended up back in the United States, often on
drugstore and supermarket shelves, in violation of Paul Mitchell's
policy of selling only through approved beauty salons.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a federal judge in New York City issued a temporary
restraining order that prevents Quality King, a distributor based
in Ronkonkoma, N.Y., that DeJoria says worked in concert with
Axelrod, from selling Paul Mitchell products. A lawyer for Quality
King, Anthony J. Viola, said the company ``denies any knowledge of
or participation in the fraud that is the centerpiece of Paul
Mitchell's complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley R. Goodman, a lawyer for Axelrod, said he would be
presenting ``viable defenses to this action.'' The defendants have
not yet filed a formal response with the court.
</P>
<P>
   A burgeoning gray market for brand-name merchandise with a
certain perceived cachet gave rise to the situation, the lawsuit
says. Now, DeJoria, a veteran of overseas expansion in 48 other
countries, says he has learned the hard way _ the company estimates
its losses at as much as $45 million _ how not to do business in
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody wants to start out really big, be very cautious,''
he said the other day. ``China is slow in development.''
</P>
<P>
   That was underscored by Jeffrey E. Garten, the dean of the Yale
School of Management who was under secretary of Commerce for
international trade during President Clinton's first term. Garten
has witnessed plenty of business disasters, as well as successes,
in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pepsis, the AT&AMP;T's, the Honeywells and General Electric
are really in it for the long term,'' he said. ``They have very
sophisticated strategies. They have really dug in and invested in
Chinese communities, built education institutions in China and
developed webs of connections with all levels of Chinese society.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, ``many small companies tend to get
carried away by the hype that China has suddenly become a market
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are pockets of it,'' he added. ``But in order to succeed
in China today, you have to establish yourself as an entity that is
aligned with the government's long-term goals. That doesn't mean
communism, but it does mean training people and showing you are not
a fly-by-night company and you actually care about Chinese
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is a cautionary tale from the Paul Mitchell experience for
businesses that want to expand abroad, whether in China or other
difficult environments.
</P>
<P>
   DeJoria said Axelrod's offer seemed perfectly legitimate when it
was made in 1996. To begin with, Axelrod and his son, Berin, spoke
Chinese and would be living and working in China. And Axelrod also
had something of a high profile in the United States, thanks to his
televised sales of cosmetics bearing the Jerome Alexander name on a
home-shopping channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, `Now, Jerome, this is strictly selling to salons,'''
DeJoria recalled. ```No drugstores or supermarkets.' He said: `I
know that. Trust me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Axelrod also signed a document, attached to the lawsuit, stating
the terms of the distribution agreement, which limited sales to
beauty salons in the People's Republic of China. Paul Mitchell
began shipping products to Axelrod's offices in Shanghai, which
operated under the name China Distribution and Marketing Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The first shipment went out in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until July of this year, after the company made its
final shipment, DeJoria said, that a Paul Mitchell employee who
spoke Chinese, Anna Wang, went to Shanghai and found that nearly
all the products had been rerouted from a duty-free warehouse,
where they were being stored, back to the United States, via
Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Once in the United States, the
lawsuit says, Quality King dispensed them to drugstores,
supermarkets and other outlets that were not salons.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, who represents the Axelrods and a third defendant,
Robert A. Seibel, who was China Distribution's in-house lawyer,
said he found it curious that Paul Mitchell singled out Chinese
consumers who have ``more of a concern about putting food in their
mouths and a roof over their heads than getting hold of Paul
Mitchell products.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What would they be doing in Communist China?'' he asked about
Paul Mitchell. ``It just seems ludicrous to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaeline Re, the chief legal officer for Paul Mitchell, said
that in China's developing consumer economy, the company could gain
millions of customers. ``Yes, it's not going to sell out in the
farmland,'' she said. ``But in the major cities, people are buying
consumer goods.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As DeJoria and Garten noted, building a business in China can
take a long time. But as demand ballooned for Paul Mitchell
products in the first year, DeJoria began to wonder, he says now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't jibing,'' he said. ``They were ordering so much.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit contends that in the last of seven shipments the
company sent to China Distribution, only about 7,000 of 144,000
bottles and tubes of Paul Mitchell products actually made it to
Chinese salons in cities like Shanghai and Beijing. The remainder
wound up back in the United States, according to the Paul Mitchell
lawyers. The retail value of that last shipment was about $6
million, said Geoffrey Potter, a lawyer for Paul Mitchell.

 &HT;    Nemechek back on pole
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLADEGA, Ala. _ Joe Nemechek is called ``Front Row Joe'' by
his fellow drivers for his propensity to win pole positions.
</P>
<P>
   Nemechek lived up to his billing during first-round qualifying
at Talladega Superspeedway on Friday, motoring along at 198.331 mph
to capture the No. 1 start for Sunday's Winston 500.
</P>
<P>
   The Chevy No. 42 driver has won the pole this season at the
circuit's shortest track (Martinsville) and longest (Talladega).
Nemechek, who posted his first career victory at New Hampshire last
month, won his third pole this year Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked really hard on our speedway program the last two
years,'' Nemechek said. ``Qualifying is really, really tough.
You've got to have a good diving race car, lots of power, and then
the driver has got to do his job.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Rudd is also on the front row thanks to his future
employer, Robert Yates Racing. Andy Petree teammates fill the next
row with Kenny Wallace third and Ken Schrader fourth.
</P>
<P>
   By starting second, Rudd put himself in prime position to extend
his streak of winning at least one race per year for the past 16
seasons. The Ford No. 10 driver had assistance for qualifying when
he was offered the use of a trademark Yates motor.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd is leaving his team after this season to operate the No. 28
car owned by Yates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say but `Thank you,''' Rudd said. ``Not
only did (the engine) qualify good, but I think I can talk (Yates)
into letting me use this thing in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got something to race with. This thing is bad
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Engines were a major problem Friday for Richard Childress
Racing. Both of the team's drivers, Dale Earnhardt and Mike
Skinner, had engine malfunctions during the qualifying lap.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner's motor stopped before he could take the green flag and
he posted no speed. Earnhardt shut down his car after the first
lap, which was 39th.
</P>
<P>
   ``We blew up,'' Skinner said. ``We haven't had a lot of problems
with qualifying motors all year. The guys back at the shop have
done a great job. I hate that it happened, but that's OK. We've got
another one and we'll try it again (today).'' Other drivers failing
to make the field in the first round were Darrell Waltrip, Bill
Elliott, Kyle Petty and John Andretti.

 &HT;    Rams' Warner springs from anonymity
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kurt Warner's college coach didn't see it. Neither did
Mike Holmgren, who cut Warner a few weeks into his first NFL
training camp with the Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   It took awhile for St. Louis coach Dick Vermeil to realize
Warner's potential, too. Not until Rams starter Trent Green
suffered a season-ending knee injury in the preseason did Warner
get the opportunity to prove he could play quarterback in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Sunday's game against the Falcons, the Rams are
undefeated, and Warner is the league's hottest quarterback. Warner,
28, has thrown for 14 touchdowns and only three interceptions,
completing 72.6 percent of his pass attempts. His current passer
rating of 136.0 would shatter the NFL record of 112.8, set by San
Francisco's Steve Young in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``His performance is probably not going to continue at (its
current pace),'' Vermeil said. ``That is darn tough. ... (But)
gentlemen, this kid is for real.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner's improbable success is attracting a lot of attention.
He's on the cover of Sports Illustrated this week, with the
headline ``Who Is This Guy?'' David Letterman wanted him to fly to
New York on Monday or Tuesday for a taping; Warner turned it down
because his second wedding anniversary was Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, who is open about his religious beliefs, was invited to
a crusade by the Rev. Billy Graham. Representatives of evangelist
Pat Robertson called seeking a five-minute interview. Warner Bros.
Studio in Hollywood is developing a promotional cartoon of the
quarterback and the Warner Bros. _ the nickname of St. Louis'
talented receiving corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to know the young man, you see that he is a very
humble, sincere human being,'' Vermeil said. ``He is not awed by
all this. He is excited, but he hasn't changed a bit in his
demeanor.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner's career has been a humbling odyssey. From Regis High
School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to Division I-AA Northern Iowa to the
Arena Football League and NFL Europe, he has demonstrated a knack
for drama. And he carries undaunted confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had that swagger all his life,'' said Kansas coach Terry
Allen, who coached Warner for five seasons at Northern Iowa. ``When
he steps out there, he knows he can do it. He's confident.''
</P>
<P>
   That confidence could be mistaken for arrogance, if not for the
obstacles and tragedies Warner and his family have overcome. Seven
years ago, Warner met his future wife at a country and western
dance in Cedar Falls, Iowa. Brenda Warner told Kurt that she was a
divorced mother of two children, living with her parents, and that
if he didn't want to see her again, she would understand. The
college quarterback showed up at her front door with a rose the
next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through a lot of hings,'' Warner says. ``We've had
some good times and some bad times. We realize what's important in
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, his wife's parents were killed when a tornado
demolished their home in Mountain View, Ark. Her parents had moved
there a year earlier when her father retired.
</P>
<P>
   Warner adopted his wife's children, including 10-year-old
Zachary, who is legally blind and has brain damage from an accident
he suffered at 4 months old. Brenda's first husband was taking him
out of a bath when the baby slipped out of his hands and hit the
back of his head on the tub. Doctors told Brenda her son would die,
but he lived.
</P>
<P>
   Zachary can see things when they are close to his face. He
attends his father's football games but watches the action on a
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to struggle with everything he does,'' Warner said.
``Nothing comes easy for him. In the position I'm in now, (I'm not
going to) allow things to give me a big head and I'm not going to
get too upset when things don't go well. It seems pretty minute to
me that I would get upset about things that happen on the football
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize that there are more important things. (Zachary) just
keeps my head level. I'm going to do everything I can to be
successful in football, but I'm not going to let it dictate the
kind of person that I am.''
</P>
<P>
   If Warner did, he might have given up on his dream of playing in
the NFL. He didn't start at Northern Iowa until he was a fifth-year
senior, spending four years behind Jay Johnson, who's now the
quarterbacks coach under Allen at Kansas. Warner lost his first two
games as a starter, separated his shoulder in the second, but led
Northern Iowa to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played behind a quarterback that we were having an awful
lot of success with,'' Allen said. ``It's not that Kurt didn't have
the talent. Kurt always had the arm strength, there's no question
about that. He's always had a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner was not drafted out of college, but landed a tryout with
the Packers in 1994. He spent only a short time with Green Bay,
however. Brett Favre, Mark Brunell and Ty Detmer were already on
the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't get a whole lot of snaps and probably didn't get
much of a chance with us,'' said Holmgren, who left Green Bay for
Seattle before this season. ``We looked at him more like our fourth
camp quarterback. I really hadn't heard much about him since then,
except I saw an Arena League game. I can't take credit for Kurt
Warner.''
</P>
<P>
   After he was cut by the Packers, Warner tried to catch on with a
team in NFL Europe but nobody would sign him. He went back to Iowa
and worked nights at a grocery store. He played for the Arena
League's Iowa Barnstormers and became a smashing success, throwing
for 183 touchdowns in three years, including 79 in his final
season. Twice, he took the Barnstormers to the Arena Bowl, the
league's equivalent of the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Dick McDonald, director of media relations for the Barnstormers,
said the team has received dozens of requests for replicas of
Warner's No. 13 jersey. HBO's ``Inside the NFL'' and other national
media have flocked to Des Moines, Iowa, to trace Warner's roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't pay for this,'' McDonald said. ``This publicity is too
expensive for us to buy. Our team and our league can't pay Kurt
enough for doing this well.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the '98 NFL Europe season, Amsterdam Admirals coach Al
Lugenbill contacted the Rams, asking them to give Warner a tryout.
Warner didn't think the audition went well, so he and his wife went
to Jamaica for their honeymoon. During the trip, Warner was bit by
a scorpion or centipede on his elbow. He couldn't throw for nearly
a month and missed a scheduled tryout with the Chicago Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when I didn't know what the Lord's plan for
me was,'' Warner said. ``I didn't know if it was going to take the
step back through the NFL, or if He just wanted me to be in Arena
Football and doing things for him there. I continued to believe
that I could play, and it was the Lord's will that I would be back
in (the NFL).''
</P>
<P>
   To Warner's surprise, the Rams had been impressed by his
workout. After playing a summer in Amsterdam, where he led the
league in yards, touchdowns, completions and attempts, he made St.
Louis' roster as the third-string quarterback in 1998. Quarterbacks
Tony Banks and Steve Bono left after a disappointing 4-12 record,
and Warner moved into the backup role behind Green, who signed a
$16.5 million contract in February.
</P>
<P>
   Warner makes the league minimum of $254,000 and is signed only
through this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven years ago, I was on food stamps,'' Brenda Warner says.
``We didn't have enough money to go get Happy Meals. So we're
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner became the starter when Green was injured on a
controversial hit by San Diego Chargers safety Rodney Harrison.
Through the first four games of his NFL career, he still feels like
he's throwing in the Arena League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have that same mentality, that we can go out and be
successful against anyone we play,'' he said. ``You develop that in
the Arena League because you score all the time. I'm not going to
change my mindset just because I'm in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the guys that we've got and the way we're playing on
offense, I don't think anyone can stop us. If we play like we're
capable of playing and I make good decisions, I feel like we can
score every time I touch the ball.''

 &HT;    Lambert providing spark
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ On his fourth NHL team in five years, Denny
Lambert hopes he's finally found a home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've bought a house (in Duluth), and my wife is expecting
twins, our first kids,'' the Atlanta Thrashers left wing said. ``I
hope we don't have to move again.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is permanent in the NHL, but Lambert is supplying just
what the Thrashers hoped when general manager Don Waddell obtained
him from Nashville, Tenn., for Randy Robitaille a couple of weeks
before training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denny's an agitator, one of those guys who is miserable to
play against,'' coach Curt Fraser said. ``He's tough and also
capable of scoring home goals. Denny's playing just like we knew he
could.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambert will be hitting anything that moves and hustling again
tonight, as the Thrashers face Tampa Bay in the second of a
three-game trip. Atlanta, which beat the Islanders 2-0 Thursday for
its first victory, plays at the New York Rangers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Never a top scoring threat, the 5-foot-10 Lambert's NHL high is
nine goals for Ottawa two seasons ago. But he got the Thrashers'
offense on track with an early goal against Dominik Hasek in a 5-5
tie with Buffalo last Saturday and has played well on a line with
Swedes Per Svartvadet and Johan Garpenlov.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always hard to come to a new team and have to learn
another system,'' Lambert said. ``With a first-year team, everybody
is new. It takes a while for everyone to get comfortable in their
roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has come easy for Lambert, who is half Ojibway Indian
and grew up near the reserve in Wawa, Ontario. After going
undrafted, he was signed by Buffalo in 1991 and sent on loan to San
Diego of the IHL, where Waddell was general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert played nearly four full seasons with the Gulls, and
Waddell knew exactly what kind of hard-nosed player he was getting
when he traded the potentially high-scoring Robitaille _ the most
valuable player in the AHL last season.
</P>
<P>
   The deal drew some surprised looks around the NHL, but Waddell
thought his team was overstocked with smallish centers and needed
another feisty player like Lambert, who had just lost his
arbitration case with Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't that surprised to be traded, and I was happy it was
to Atlanta,'' said Lambert, who was awarded $465,000 instead of the
$700,000 he was asking.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert had five goals and 11 assists with the expansion
Predators. The statistic that sticks out is penalty minutes;
Lambert had 218. In his two seasons at Ottawa, he had 217 and 250.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy in Atlanta, but I still want to show Nashville they
made a mistake,'' said Lambert, who broke into the NHL with Anaheim
in 1994. ``Every player wants to beat his old team. I wish we
played them more than twice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Denny has made himself into a NHL player,'' Fraser said.
``He's a great guy to have on a team.''
</P>
<P>
   DENNY LAMBERT FILE

 UNDATED: Paul Mitchell.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Goodman suggested that Paul Mitchell was simply seeking to
improve its sales and didn't care where the products went. He noted
that none of the products in question are in his clients'
possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps this was another way of augmenting the distribution of
the company,'' he said, ``to send these products to other parts of
the world.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DeJoria led a delegation of Paul Mitchell executives and hair
stylists to China in late 1997. They held news conferences, gave
interviews to newspapers and organized training sessions for salon
owners in Shanghai and Beijing. ``Our trip was delayed three
times'' at the Axelrods' request, DeJoria said. ``I had to talk
them into letting us go over and give them support.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Paul Mitchell stylist, Bill Peplow, went to Shanghai
late last year, also to see how things were going. ``His trip was
delayed several times, too,'' DeJoria said. According to the
lawsuit, ``Mr. Peplow's visit posed tremendous risk to the
defendants that their fraud would be discovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Memos attached to the complaint and attributed to China
Distribution include one that ordered the defendants' China
employees to ``stay with him at all times _ we do not want him to
go off on his own even if it is for sightseeing.'' The lawsuit said
Seibel, the China Distribution lawyer, sent that memo on Aug. 28,
1998, to Randy Zhou, an employee in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said he had not seen all the memos and had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Both DeJoria's group and Peplow were stalled not only in getting
to China, but also once they arrived, the lawsuit said. It contends
that the employees of China Distribution had to scramble from salon
to salon to conceal the dearth of Paul Mitchell products in actual
use in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to a couple of salons that had Paul Mitchell products
there,'' DeJoria recalled. ``But there were many delays. They kept
saying our schedule is too tight. They showed us some salons in
Shanghai. But when I asked to see more, they said our schedule is
too tight, or the other salons are outside the city and in the
provinces.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit says that as Paul Mitchell executives left one
salon, the same products they had seen in that salon were being
hastily forwarded to the next destination, to make it appear as if
Paul Mitchell shampoos were readily available all over Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Zhou arranged to take Peplow on a slow route from salon to
salon while the Paul Mitchell products in the salon just inspected
would be rushed to the next salon to be inspected,'' the lawsuit
says. ``The ruse was successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman scoffed at the story. ``It's all hearsay,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when a Paul Mitchell employee was shopping at a
drugstore in the Midwest, he spotted some of the company's products
and bought them, DeJoria said. The numbered codes on the bottles
indicated that they had been part of a shipment to China.
</P>
<P>
   DeJoria said he confronted Axelrod with the discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Maybe someone went into China, bought two bottles
and brought them back to sell here,''' DeJoria recalled. ``He said,
`There's nothing that left China.'''
</P>
<P>
   DeJoria said China Distribution's lawyer, Seibel, also assured
him that everything was fine. ``Don't worry about it,'' DeJoria
said Seibel told him. ``It's all in China.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DeJoria said there were many such sightings of Paul Mitchell
products across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not so unusual, Goodman countered, adding that he did
not think the brand in general was as closely protected as the
company liked to depict it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find them in any drug chain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The China operation began to unravel this year in Shanghai's
sticky summer heat. Randy Zhou, who led Peplow on the salon tour
and was China Distribution's chief liaison in Shanghai, had become
bored on the job, DeJoria said. After all, the lawsuit contends, he
had very little to distribute.
</P>
<P>
   And he saved many of the memos he received from his bosses,
including a final one, written by Seibel on June 16, 1999, the
lawsuit says, that instructed him to cover his tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lastly, please destroy this memo along with all the others
after you have read,'' it said, according to the lawsuit. ``No
paper trails!!''
</P>
<P>
   Zhou appears to have ignored the request. He described the
situation to Ms. Wang, the Paul Mitchell executive, in July,
according to an affidavit filed by Ms. Wang.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, however, said he thought Zhou might have had some other
motivation. ``He was bored?'' Goodman asked, sarcastically. ``He
had nothing to do but turn over his employer's documents? If that's
what boredom is, I would watch everybody who doesn't have anything
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   As for whether the documents would be key evidence in the case,
Goodman said he had not yet had the time to assess their relevance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quantity,'' he said, ``is not necessarily evidence of
quality.''
</P>
<P>
   The case will be taken up in a jury trial in United States
District Court in New York City early next year.

MRS. CLINTON POINTS TO DIFFERENCES WITH GIULIANI ON TEST BAN
TREATY 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY     
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton condemned Senate Republicans on Friday
for rejecting a treaty that would have barred all underground
nuclear testing, saying Republicans had ``played partisan politics
at the expense of our national security'' and drawing a clear
distinction on the issue with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, her likely
opponent in next year's race for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vote sent a dangerous message to people around the world,
to our allies, and to Americans at home,'' Mrs. Clinton said, using
language that closely tracked what President Clinton said in
denouncing the Senate's 51-49 vote not to approve the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York has a long and proud tradition of senators from both
parties realizing that our fight against nuclear proliferation,
nuclear testing, nuclear weaponry and an attempt to have a
comprehensive test ban treaty is not a partisan issue,'' Mrs.
Clinton declared. She added, ``New York's next senator must not
turn away from the world by saying no to a treaty that is so
critical to our future.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton detailed her position first in a statement issued
by her Exploratory Committee, and later in a speech to about 100
people, including a number of clergy leaders, in the basement of
the Antioch Baptist Church in Hempstead, N.Y. With her remarks, the
first lady becomes the latest prospective Democratic candidate to
seized on the vote as a potential issue in the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he would have voted to defeat the treaty,
although, in an interview on CNN last Saturday, before the vote,
the mayor said he would prefer to see the vote delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I would vote no if it were brought to a vote, but
what I prefer to see is that it be put off and the administration
have to answer for the fact that we now have nuclear weapons in
Pakistan, in India,'' Giuliani said. ``Nuclear weapons under
Clinton have expanded dramatically in China and nothing's been done
about it. And this treaty would not address any of that.''
</P>
<P>
   At City Hall on Thursday, Giuliani described the results as
``one of the big defeats of the Clinton administration.'' He blamed
the outcome on Senate Democrats who pressed Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott for a vote on the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``In essence, the Clinton administration and the Senate
Democrats required a vote and they required a vote now,'' Giuliani
said. ``I think, as all the newspapers said, they made a very big
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said she had discussed the issue repeatedly with
her husband over the past few days, and that both viewed the
outcome of the vote with alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had many conversations with my husband in the last days
because, as he said yesterday in his press conference, the world
will not be safer because the Republicans in the Senate voted
against that treaty,'' Mrs. Clinton said.

 &HT;    Sore wrist could keep Stanley out of Red Sox lineup
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mike Stanley, Boston's best hitter against New York
this season, will be held from the lineup today if his right wrist
does not show significant improvement by game time.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley was hit by a Jeff Nelson fastball in the eighth inning
of Game 2 Thursday night and while precautionary X-rays were
negative, the wrist was placed in a protective splint. The Red Sox
didn't work out Friday, meaning Stanley won't get a reading on his
status until batting practice today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got whacked pretty good,'' Boston manager Jimy Williams
said. ``I just talked to him and he says he is better. I said,
`Better than what?'... He's a tough kid. You know he is. But that
ball got him flush.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, who made 100 starts at first base for the Sox, was just
1-for-6 in the two games in New York but hit a team-high .476
against the Yankees this season, with three homers and eight RBIs
in seven games. With the injury to his throwing hand, it is
doubtful he could play first but could be the designated hitter
while Brian Daubach takes first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it's the same exact spot where Nomar (Garciaparra)
got hit (by a pitch in the Division Series with Cleveland),''
Stanley said.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE'S JORGE
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect to see much of Yankees catcher Jorge Posada this
weekend. Joe Girardi will work Games 3 and 4 while Posada, who
started 98 games this season, will be reserved for handling Orlando
Hernandez if there is a Game 5 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Posada was charged with 17 passed balls this season while
throwing out just 21 percent (20-for-95) of attempted steals.
Although Girardi played just one game against Boston in 1999, his
glove, game-calling skills and playoff experience are favored by
the Yankees staff. NUMB NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   Sign of the times: Yankees pitchers have begun taking batting
practice; Red Sox pitchers have not.
</P>
<P>
   Smugly or not, New York senses it's heading for a third World
Series in four years. But despite leading the series two games to
none, New York has led in just four of the 19 innings and has been
outhit .278 to .258. The difference has been runners left on base.
Boston has stranded 19 runners, 11 of those in scoring position.
The club is batting just .182 (4-for-22) in RBI situations. ETC.
</P>
<P>
   After Williams let Ramon Martinez throw 120 pitches in Game 2,
former Sox pitcher Dennis Eckersley, now a local broadcaster, said,
``The bullpen is supposed to be a team strength but this is beyond
me.'' ... Dom DiMaggio will throw out today's first pitch.

 &HT;    Clemens ready to take on fans, duel Martinez
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They lined up like kids waiting to see the principal,
the New York Yankees starting rotation hanging outside Joe Torre's
office while inside, Roger Clemens mulled what would surely be one
of the grandest moments of his baseball life.
</P>
<P>
   Or one of the most harrowing.
</P>
<P>
   Torre was determining his assignments for the American League
Championship Series and as Clemens recalled it, ``He was hemming
and hawing back and forth. I told him, `Skip, whatever slot you
want me in, you put me in. Doesn't make any difference.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So he said, `All right, you got Saturday against Pedro.' I
said, `Beautiful,' got up and left. He was shaking his head at me
as I walked out the door. The rest of the guys are standing
outside, waiting, and I said, `I already got the long straw. You
guys are good, go on in there. You guys got nothing to lose.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does baseball today, when New York's Clemens pitches against
Boston's Pedro Martinez in Game 3 at Fenway Park. Somehow, the
defending world champions, winners of 12 consecutive postseason
games, ahead 2-0 in the series, are instant underdogs. Clemens,
adopted favorite son of New England for his 13 long seasons as a
Red Sox, returns a villain in pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   This is rich.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Boston manager Jimy Williams poetically put it, ``I think
the circuit breakers for that electric company for the great pad in
the sky, they might be challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes. New England always admired Clemens but it never loved him
as it has come to love Martinez, whose infectious personality
helped elevate a club that first assembled last February without
much hope. That, more than anything, will explain the harsh fan
treatment Clemens will receive today. Fenway was boorish to him
during the All-Star Game. This will be far worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely understand,'' said Red Sox infielder Lou Merloni,
who grew up in nearby Framingham, Mass., the same town Clemens
lived in while with Boston. ``I can understand the way it is around
here. Players leave, they come back and they get booed.''
</P>
<P>
   If emotion is meaningful to the Red Sox, it has often been an
obstruction for Clemens, who has faltered in past big games because
he admits adrenaline gets the better of him. He was able to handle
a Division Series start in his home state of Texas last weekend but
unlike Arlington, Boston awaits this game with a raw nerve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just going to go out there and pitch the game, and I'm
sure he is going to do that,'' said Martinez, this season's
winningest pitcher at 23-4. ``I hope he puts a lot of pressure on
himself and I hope he gives it up soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Down two games, Martinez can quickly change the ALCS. By
winning, he'd give the Sox a chance to even the series Sunday
against the Yankees' Andy Pettitte, a left-hander who must work
with one eye on the left-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro in big games?'' Boston general manager Dan Duquette
asked. ``In Pedro's very first game as a Red Sox last year at
Fenway, he struck out 15. When Mo Vaughn returned this year to
Fenway with Anaheim, Pedro struck out 15. When the Atlanta Braves
came to town this year, he struck out 16. And, oh, that's right, he
had 17 against the Yankees (in New York) when we swept them in
September. Allowed only one hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just no-hit Cleveland for six innings the other day.''
</P>
<P>
   One man in 25 cannot win a series, but Martinez alone can steer
this one in another direction, especially with all New England
pushing along from behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens with Roger and the fans out there, it is his
business,'' Martinez said. ``Let him deal with it. I don't have
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was seated next to Torre in New York on Wednesday night
as the Red Sox were introduced for Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they introduced Pedro, they booed him a little bit,''
Torre said. ``I said to Roger, `You will do better than that.'''
</P>
<P>
   He will. Boston promises.

 &HT;    Bulldogs taking Vandy seriously
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Psychological preparation has been as much a
priority as offensive and defensive game plans as Georgia and
Vanderbilt get set to play today at Vanderbilt Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The 14th-ranked Bulldogs (4-1, 2-1 SEC) are coming off an
embarrassing 37-20 loss to Tennessee last Saturday in Knoxville and
coach Jim Donnan is concerned about how his young team will respond
to such a dominating defeat in the face of great expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really concerned because we put so much into that game
and got beaten so thoroughly,'' Donnan said. ``You worry about
young players who have a tendency to get depressed. But we've come
back with a very good attitude and worked hard in practice. I feel
good now about where our team is mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vanderbilt coach Woody Widenhofer is trying a
different approach this week for getting his team ready to play
against a Top 25 opponent. He hyped their game against 12th-ranked
Mississippi State two weeks ago as ``the biggest around here in a
long time'' and the Commodores (4-2, 1-2) came out on the short end
of a 42-14 final score.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we approached the Mississippi State game didn't
work,'' Widenhofer said. ``I put a lot of pressure on our players
and staff, and we fell flat on our face. Now we're playing another
very meaningful game, but we're going to approach it as just
another game. I think our players are better when they're loose and
free-spirited. Our approach to Georgia will be to hang loose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs will need to be at their best against Vanderbilt,
which is fielding what many believe to be its best team of the
1990s. The Commodores have not won more than five games since 1994
and haven't had a winning record since 1982, and their fans are
anticipating both numbers falling this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big game, a chance for us to make some noise in the
SEC,'' Vanderbilt receiver Tavarus Hogans said. ``We need to play
loose and just have some fun. This is what you play big-time
football for.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs have dominated the 106-year-old series, winning 22
of the past 25 games for a 40-17-2 edge. But Vanderbilt has sneaked
up on them at the most inopportune times, such as its 43-30
homecoming upset in 1994, its 27-25 victory in Nashville in 1991
and a 13-13 tie in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's players promise they're not taking Vanderbilt lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're 4-2; it's not like they're 0-6 or something,'' tight
end Randy McMichael said. ``We know we've got to go up there and be
ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The lopsided loss to Tennessee aside, Georgia's preseason goals
remain. The Bulldogs, Vols, Florida and Kentucky, next week's
opponent, all have one conference loss. Any team that can make it
the rest of the way unscathed likely will represent the Eastern
Division in the SEC Championship Game at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tennessee game's not going to make or break our season,''
Georgia quarterback Quincy Carter said. ``We've got six more pretty
good teams to play, and Vanderbilt's the first of them. They're
real scrappy, play hard and they've got some talent. We know that,
but we'll be ready for them.''

 &HT;    Team healthier but not Tuggle
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Falcons enter Sunday's game against the Rams
healthier than they have been in awhile.
</P>
<P>
   But middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle doesn't want to hear about
it. Tuggle will miss his second game in 12 seasons, spanning 182
games.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chandler, who missed three of the past four games with a
strained right hamstring, will start at quarterback, and all four
starting defensive linemen are better off than they have been in
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuggle (strained left patella tendon) and weak-side
linebacker Keith Brooking (partially torn right medial collateral
knee ligament) are out.
</P>
<P>
   Brooking's streak of playing in regular-season games ends at 16;
Tuggle's ends at 115.
</P>
<P>
   As an undrafted rookie in 1987, Tuggle played in 12 of 15 games;
one game was canceled by a strike. Then he played in 65 consecutive
before missing one in '92 because of viral meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be smart about it,'' the 13-year veteran said.
``Although I want to go, you don't want to risk going out there and
getting hurt again, and then it's too late to activate another
player. And it could bother me all year if I don't let it heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the Falcons' record and fact book, Tuggle did not
enter this season with 105 starts in a row; he missed one in '97
when the defense began in the nickel.
</P>
<P>
   That means former center Jeff Van Note's consecutive starts
record of 112 in 1970-84, is safe, at least until the last game.
Left tackle Bob Whitfield has started 101 consecutive games and
could tie the mark by the end of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Van Note holds the record for consecutive games played, 155,
ahead of Tuggle (115), Ken Reaves (112) and Whitfield and Buddy
Curry (107 each).
</P>
<P>
   ROSTER RUMBLINGS
</P>
<P>
   With Tuggle and Brooking out, the Falcons will have two
linebackers at each position: Ruffin Hamilton and rookie Lamont
Green on the weak side, Henri Crockett and Jeff Kelly in the middle
and Craig Sauer and Whit Marshall on the strong side.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Tuggle and Brooking, the early inactives are reserve
safety Johndale Carty (strained left hamstring) and rookie fullback
Jeff Paulk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably will hold (reserve defensive tackle Ed) Jasper out
another week,'' coach Dan Reeves said, ``and we'll have to make a
(game-day) decision on (wide receiver) Jammi German.''
</P>
<P>
   Jasper missed the past two games with a partially torn medial
collateral left knee ligament. German broke the little finger on
his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   For the Rams, left guard Tom Nutten (back) will be replaced by
Andy McCollum (6 feet 4, 295 pounds), a former Saints player.
</P>
<P>
   THE GAME PLAN
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will try to play keep-away, even though they have
had the advantage in possession time in just one of its five games.
</P>
<P>
   To do it, they will need a play ratio more like the 33-20
run-pass balance they had last week against the Saints. In the
first four games, the run-pass ratio was 95-146.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Green, activated from the practice squad Wednesday,
will play a lot on special teams. ... With Carty out, reserve free
safety Omar Brown, who had the cast taken off his broken right
thumb, will be active for the first time in several weeks. ... If
German can't go, Tim Dwight becomes the primary No. 3 receiver,
although Terance Mathis remains most likely to work out of the
slot.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTLAND FOUR CORNERS, Vt. _ From where he sat in the afternoon
sunlight, the autumn foliage overspreading the nearby hills, the
Zen Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh could survey a former horse farm
now called the Green Mountain Dharma Center, a place for Buddhist
study and the future home of a monastery for several dozen monks
like himself.
</P>
<P>
   He was in the midst of a few unscheduled days, a break from the
round of lectures and retreats, in which he has spoken to audiences
of hundreds, sometimes thousands, about the need to live
``mindfully,'' that is, with such an intense awareness of the
present that one acquires self-understanding and compassion for
others.
</P>
<P>
   Among Buddhist leaders influential in the West, Thich Nhat Hanh
ranks second only to the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of
Tibet. His works can be found in bookstores coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dalai Lama has millions of admirers,'' said Helen Tworkov,
editor of Tricycle, a magazine devoted to Buddhism in America,
``but there are thousands of people in this country who think of
Thich Nhat Hanh as their teacher,'' a significant personal
relationship. ``He's been a very important figure in the spread of
Buddhism,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   How many Buddhist practitioners there are in this country may be
impossible to know. But in his book, ``The Complete Guide to
Buddhist America'' (Shambhala, 1998), Don Morreale offers a clue to
how fast Buddhism has grown, reporting that while 21 Buddhist study
centers were established here from 1900 to 1964, more than 1,000
have been established since then.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview on Tuesday, Thich Nhat Hanh's subject was
Vietnam, specifically his desire to return to teach there after
more than three decades in exile, living mostly in France. In 1966,
he embarked from his homeland on an overseas peace mission, meeting
with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Pope Paul VI and
Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, to whom he appealed for an
end to the U.S. bombing of Vietnam. The former government of South
Vietnam barred his return, as did the Communists who took control
after the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have offered teachings and practices in 35 countries,'' said
Thich Nhat Hanh. ``And yet in Vietnam, my books are still banned.''
</P>
<P>
   By speaking publicly, after behind-the-scenes efforts, Thich
Nhat Hanh and his supporters hope to gain greater support in the
United States and Europe to persuade the Vietnamese government to
allow him, with a delegation of other Zen monks and nuns, to return
to teach. They want to go as legitimate religious figures in their
own right, without having to depend solely on the sponsorship of
Vietnam's government-sanctioned Buddhist organization.
</P>
<P>
   That organization, he said, lacks credibility with many
Vietnamese Buddhists in this country.
</P>
<P>
   His goal, he said, is spiritual, to help build up that nation
morally, using Buddhist principles he has taught as an antidote to
alienation and consumerism in the West. ``Marxism is no longer
appealing to anyone,'' he said. ``Our intention is to offer a
living Buddhism, an engaged Buddhism.''
</P>
<P>
   In phone interviews from Washington, where Thich Nhat Hanh had
gone on Wednesday to visit several Congress members' offices,
Pritam Singh, a Massachusetts-born businessman who considers
himself a student of Thich Nhat Hanh and who travels with the monk,
said the effort would be directed at religious leaders, artists and
politicians. He said the Vietnamese government had responded to
past inquiries by saying the monk, who holds a French passport,
needed to return to Paris and apply for entry into Vietnam either
as a tourist or through the country's official Buddhist
organization. But the government has not indicated whether Thich
Nhat Hanh would be granted entry in either circumstance, Singh
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have taken a strong interest in the case is Rep.
Rick Boucher, a Virginia Democrat, who has talked with Vietnamese
officials in Hanoi about it.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview on Friday, Boucher said one possibility
would be for Thich Nhat Hanh to be jointly sponsored by the
official Buddhist organization and a secular, international
friendship organization, similar to an arrangement earlier this
year that allowed him to visit China for three weeks and to teach
in Buddhist monastic communities.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the State Department, too, had taken an interest
in working out a way for Thich Nhat Hanh to visit Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment, a spokeswoman at the Vietnamese Embassy in
Washington said, ``The consistent policy of the government of
Vietnam is to create conditions favorable for Vietnamese overseas
to fulfill their desire to return to visit their homeland.'' She
added that for all who wished to return to visit, ``their return to
the homeland is facilitated according to existing regulations of
the government of Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past four decades, war and revolution in East Asia
have had an indirect, yet profound impact on American religion.
Exiled Buddhist scholars, like Thich Nhat Hanh and the Dalai Lama,
among many others, have become important teachers, writing and
lecturing, spreading knowledge of Buddhism.

<P>
   On Sept. 24, more than 3,500 people turned up to hear Thich Nhat
Hanh speak on ``peace, harmony and happiness'' at the University of
Vermont. On Sept. 26, about 500 people came to a five-day retreat
led by Thich Nhat Hanh at the Omega Institute in Rhinebeck, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   At 73, Thich Nhat Hanh is a small, slender man who possesses an
aura of stillness and a focus that commands attention. People who
consider themselves his students call him ``Thay,'' meaning
teacher. In exile, he has created a community called Plum Village
in France. His message is plain-spoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mindfulness is to be aware of everything you do every day,''
he writes in his book, ``Going Home: Jesus and Buddha as Brothers''
(Riverhead, 1999). ``Mindfulness is a kind of light that shines
upon all your thoughts, all your feelings, all your actions and all
your words.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dharma Center sits on 175 rolling acres in the hills
southwest of White River Junction, Vt. An indoor riding ring is to
be converted into a meditation center. Two separate monastic
buildings will house communities of monks and nuns.
</P>
<P>
   Before he began the mission that led him into exile, Thich Nhat
Hanh was known as a poet and scholar who had helped found a
Buddhist university and a social service corps for youth in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1965, he wrote King, saying that Buddhist monks and nuns
he personally knew who had burned themselves to death, in public
protests against policies of the South Vietnamese government, were
acting from a spirit of self-sacrifice, symbolically taking on the
sufferings of the larger population.
</P>
<P>
   He and King met in Chicago in May 1966 and issued a statement
calling for an end to U.S. bombing in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Thich Nhat Hanh said he later paid the civil rights leader a
great compliment, telling him that Vietnamese Buddhists who knew of
his work considered King as a ``bodhisattva,'' an enlightened being
devoted to serving humanity.
</P>
<P>
   King, the Nobel Peace Prize winner in 1964, paid Thich Nhat Hanh
a compliment as well, nominating him for that prize in 1966. (There
was no winner selected that year.)
</P>
<P>
   When the South Vietnamese government denied Thich Nhat Hanh
permission to return home in 1966, it was cracking down on the
Unified Buddhist Church, with which he was associated. The
organization endorsed neither the U.S.-backed government nor the
Communists, but possessed a vision of its own for reconstructing
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how the government viewed him, Thich Nhat Hanh
said: ``When I came I was not a politician. I'm not inclined to be
a politician at all. My vocation is as a monk.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a monk, he added, ``You have to have the courage to speak
out against social injustice, the violation of human rights.''

REMORSEFUL TERROR PLOTTER RECEIVES 11-YEAR SENTENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A convicted terrorist who cooperated with the
government's investigation of the plot to blow up the United
Nations and other landmarks in New York was sentenced to 11 years
in prison Friday after he made a tearful apology and strongly
denounced terrorism, saying it was ``evil and ungodly.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Siddig Ibrahim Siddig Ali, had admitted to a
major role in the plot in which 10 people, including Sheik Omar
Abdel Rahman, were ultimately convicted in a trial in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Siddig Ali, who pleaded guilty shortly after the trial began,
announced at the time that he would cooperate, and admitted helping
select some of the plotters' targets, which also included the
Lincoln and Holland Tunnels, the George Washington Bridge and the
Federal Building in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to reiterate that I renounce violence,'' Siddig
Ali said Friday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, ``and condemn
those who fraudulently preserve the sacredness of Islam to
perpetrate their unholy war against the innocent and the
unsuspecting.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he wanted to apologize to the people of New York, the
American people, and to the Muslim community in the United States
and around the world, adding, ``I know now more than ever that only
through peaceful dialogue can we resolve our differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Siddig Ali faced a term of life plus 30 years for his plea to
seditious conspiracy and other charges. But Judge Michael B.
Mukasey was able to avoid the strict federal sentencing guidelines
after he got a letter from prosecutors in the office of the U.S.
attorney, Mary Jo White, describing Siddig Ali's extensive
assistance in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The details of that assistance are not known, because Siddig Ali
never testified at trial, and the government's letter was not made
public. But from his statements at the time of his plea, it seems
likely that he supplied the government with intimate details of the
conspiracy, which also included an assassination plot against the
Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, on an official trip to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperation may have also gone beyond the bombing case to
include information about the Sudanese Mission in New York. For
example, a document introduced at trial quoted Siddig Ali, a
Sudanese immigrant, as telling an informant in 1993 that he had
friends in the mission who could provide him with diplomatic
plates. That would help him to get a car packed with explosives
into the U.N. garage.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, that information may have helped the government
expel a Sudanese diplomat accused of helping a terrorist, and to
bolster its case that Sudan was involved in supporting terrorism
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The only hint in court Friday about Siddig Ali's cooperation
came when Mukasey described him as having ``provided substantial
cooperation, most of which, in my own view, most of the valuable
material was in essence intelligence material, and his willingness
to provide it in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no further elaboration. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In court Friday, Siddig Ali's lawyer, Howard R. Leader, asked
the judge to sentence his client to time served, in this case, six
and a half years. Leader cited the cooperation and his client's
``genuine sense of remorse.''
</P>
<P>
   Mukasey refused, saying such a sentence would have ``trivialized
what happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Had your actions gone uninterrupted,'' he said, ``hundreds,
perhaps thousands of people would have died.''
</P>
<P>
   But the judge said that Siddig Ali's guilty plea and cooperation
had assisted both in the prosecution of the case and possibly to
``prevent further cases.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge said that 11 years was, in his view, a term that
``balances the enormity of what you did and intended to do against
the substantial cooperation you provided.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentence means that Siddig Ali is likely to serve roughly
four and a half more years, depending on time credited for good
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Leader said later that Siddig Ali's sentence showed that even
for terrorists, ``if they are genuinely remorseful, that their
actions can have a dramatic impact on how they would be spending
the rest of their lives'' because of the tremendous value placed
upon their assistance and the risks inherent in deciding to
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   All defendants convicted in the trial did receive substantial
terms, including a life sentence for Abdel Rahman.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Ms. White had no comment Friday night. In court,
a federal prosecutor, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, told the judge that
the government was seeking a lower term than mandated because of
Siddig Ali's ``substantial assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   In what appeared to be a show of support for Siddig Ali,
Fitzgerald was joined in the courtroom by other senior prosecutors
and agents of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Siddig Ali, 38, broke down in tears several times as he spoke to
the judge, contending that his actions did not reflect the
``peaceful spirit of Islam'' nor the views of most Muslims around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six and a half years ago, upon my arrest, I stood before you
here a man filled with hatred and contempt,'' Siddig Ali said. ``I
was arrogant, immature and foolish.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I cannot find enough words to express my deep sense
of shame and remorse for what I have done, because what I did was
unjustified and wrong.''

BASEBALL COLUMN: MARTINEZ HAS SEVERAL GHOSTS TO DEFEAT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The passions of a proud city, the hopes of a plucky team and the
future of a horrible eight-decade-old curse rest on the sloped
shoulders of a 170-pound pitcher with a squeaky voice, a confident
demeanor and a playful personality whenever he is not firing
fastballs. To succeed, this pitcher must beat the best pitcher who
has ever called Fenway Park home.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox and their rowdy fans speak reverentially about Pedro
Martinez, especially in this delicate part of their dwindling
season. We still have Pedro, the players and fans say evenly, so we
still have a chance. Pedro's presence and pitching makes this solid
team a special team and could make this series between the Yankees
and the Red Sox competitive very quickly, they vow.
</P>
<P>
   They are correct, and Game 3 of the American League Championship
Series is even more intriguing than normal because it features
Martinez, who happily came to Boston for $75 million, against Roger
Clemens, who left Boston after a mostly successful yet sometimes
aggravating 12 years and is now a pariah.
</P>
<P>
   To the fans who will crowd Fenway Park, this duel of the century
will be good against evil. Pedro is good; Roger is evil. Pedro is a
hero; Roger is a traitor. Obviously, this comparison deserves more
analysis, but it is not forthcoming in Boston. Pedro will be the
king and he is not worried about how Roger will be treated in the
place where he used to be the only Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens with Roger and the fans out there, that's his
business,'' said Martinez. ``Let him deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez spoke respectfully about what Clemens has accomplished
in a Hall of Fame career, but he stressed that he did not want to
be compared to the other great Boston pitcher, and did not want to
reveal much about spending two hours at an awards dinner together
during the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was Martinez's way of asserting his game face or not
praising an opposing pitcher 24 hours before the biggest game of
the season, but the chatty pitcher turned ornery when asked what he
and Clemens spoke about at the dinner. He gave a brief response,
mildly scolded the reporter for asking the question in a postseason
setting and then called him ``curious man.'' It was a funny
display, another sign that Martinez was loose and was uninterested
in bowing to Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wants to be himself,'' said Ramon Martinez, Pedro's
older brother. ``Pedro is Pedro. Clemens is Clemens.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez resembled a college student who had finished
cramming all night for exams with droopy eyes behind black-framed
glasses and a white jacket that might as well have been a
letterman's cardigan. Pedro was cool, quite cool, as he spoke about
pitching in the biggest game of the season and the biggest game for
the Red Sox since 1986. Pick Game 6, Game 7 or both from that
dreary year.
</P>
<P>
   When Martinez was at Yankee Stadium earlier this week, the
pitcher said he planned to ``forget that Babe Ruth was traded'' and
that he did not even know that memorable story. Obviously, Martinez
knows the details, but, to him, the past is irrelevant. Martinez
claimed Boston's 2-0 deficit is irrelevant. Pedro also said the
muscle strain in his upper back is irrelevant, because he had
enough to tame the Indians and he should have enough to stifle the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to change my game because there is more
pressure or less pressure,'' said Pedro Martinez. ``My pressure is
just to get them out.''
</P>
<P>
   But, when there is more pressure, Martinez gets nastier.
Remember how he whiffed five of the six batters he faced in the
All-Star Game? Remember how he struck out 17 Yankees and uncorked
an amazing one-hitter at Yankee Stadium last month? It might have
been the best game ever pitched at the Stadium, and it is a
performance the Yankees will definitely recall at about 4:30
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can do anything anytime,'' said Ramon Martinez. ``It
doesn't matter what kind of pressure there is.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement would have sounded boastful in 99 out of 100 other
settings, but it sounded appropriate for Pedro. He extended the Red
Sox' season by tossing six remarkable innings of no-hit relief
against the Indians in Game 5 of the division series. The Red Sox
were hoping Martinez could go two innings, but he experimented to
see what kind of repertory he had and slowly figured out how to
dominate, as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only he would know if he loves the spotlight,'' said catcher
Jason Varitek. ``But he knows how to handle throwing in the
spotlight.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro seemed relaxed Friday as he ran through the clubhouse,
tickled a reporter he did not know and sprinted to pick up his
ringing cellular phone the way a 5-year-old rushes to greet an ice
cream truck. Martinez was singing about finally going home and was
surely planning to rest up for facing Clemens and the Yankees.
Pedro could and should make this a memorable day at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win tomorrow,'' said John Valentin, a hint of a smile on
his face, ``this thing could get interesting.''

   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: testban
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday rejected, 51 to 48, a bill to ratify the
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The treaty, which has been signed by 154
countries and ratified by 51, would prohibit nuclear weapons
testing in complying nations. Supporters said the treaty would stop
the proliferation of nuclear weapons worldwide. Opponents said the
treaty could not ensure that nations would not test their arsenals.
A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: farm
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 74 to 26, a $69.3 billion
agriculture spending bill that provides $8.7 billion in emergency
aid for farmers. Supporters said the bill would help farmers hurt
by historically low prices. Opponents said the bill does not
sufficiently compensate farmers whose crops were damaged by
droughts and hurricanes. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: Mccain
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 77 to 20, an amendment to
strengthen existing rules that require campaign contributions to be
reported. The amendment, attached to a larger campaign finance
reform bill, would also force electronic disclosure of
contributions within three months of an election. Supporters said
the amendment helps to make the fundraising process more
transparent. Opponents said the measure would create too much
paperwork in the political process. A ``yes'' vote favors the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: Defense
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 87 to 11, a $268 billion
defense spending bill that would offer a large pay raise to the
military, delay production of the Air Force's F-22 fighter jet, and
improve Pentagon operations. Supporters said the military deserved
higher wages. Opponents said the bill contained misleading gimmicks
intended to dodge the spending caps. A ``yes'' vote favors the
bill.

<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: Trucks
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 415 to 5, a bill to create a
separate agency within the Transportation Department to reduce
truck accidents. Supporters of the measure said it would help curb
the high level of deaths on the highway. Opponents said the bill
contained too much pork-barrel spending. A ``yes'' vote favors the
bill.

JOSEPH LOCKE, IRISH TENOR, DIES AT 82 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ Josef Locke, a tenor whose singing of traditional
sentimental Irish songs brought tears to the eyes of audiences in
Ireland and Britain in the 1940s and '50s and whose career was
portrayed in the 1992 film ``Hear My Song,'' died Friday in a
hospital in Clane in County Kildare, where he lived south of
Dublin. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Locke's popularity derived from the emotional style in which he
sang lachrymose ballads about the problems of love and life in
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Grant, a friend who runs the bar at the Olympia Theater
in Dublin, said Friday that women particularly were moved by his
voice. ``They threw flowers on the stage,'' she said. ``And they
brought along extra pairs of underpants and threw them as well.''
</P>
<P>
   His best-known songs were ``Hear My Song, Violetta,'' ``Dear Old
Donegal'' and the imperishable ``Danny Boy.'' He also sang and
recorded operatic arias and traditional Irish pieces.
</P>
<P>
   In her review in The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote that the
film ``Hear My Song'' had ``blithe, fanciful magic that can't be
achieved through skill alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Locke was the highest-paid singer in Britain in the 1950s and
performed in 19 consecutive annual shows in Blackpool, the English
seaside resort. In 1958 British revenue officials said he owed
$50,000 in back taxes. Locke returned to Ireland and retired,
admittedly to evade the tax.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1992 ``Hear My Song,'' directed by Peter Chelsom, put him
back in the spotlight. It starred Ned Beatty as Locke.
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Andrews wrote in The Financial Times of London that ``Hear
My Song'' was a ``sly, imaginative, off-the wall delight.'' The
film depicted, more or less accurately, how another singer, calling
himself X, impersonated Locke, seeking to titillate audiences by
giving the impression that he was Locke trying to evade the tax
collectors with a false name.
</P>
<P>
   The original X, Eric Ellison, now 74, is still performing in
England, Locke's friends said. The film returned him to the
footlights.
</P>
<P>
   After settling his tax account Locke returned to London, where
he sang ``Danny Boy'' and other songs at the film's premiere before
an audience that included Diana, Princess of Wales. Friday his
voice was heard again in Irish living rooms as national radio and
television reported his death.
</P>
<P>
   Locke, whose original name was Joseph McLaughlin, was born on
March 23, 1917, in Londonderry in the British province of Northern
Ireland, the son of a butcher and cattle dealer. He sang in
churches and schools and aspired to be an operatic tenor. In 1933
he joined the Irish Guards of the British Army and later served
with the Palestine Police, a force controlling what was then a
British mandate territory.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Northern Ireland, he joined the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, and called himself the Singing Bobby. He met John
McCormack, the Irish tenor, who advised him to build his career on
traditional songs and music hall appearances rather than on opera.
A theater impresario, Jack Hylton, said the name Joseph McLaughlin
did not fit on the billboard, so his name became Josef Locke.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would finish singing `The Holy City,' and then come down
the aisle shouting `Maureen!','' asking for his ``holy water,''
said Ms. Grant, the bar manager. ``His holy water was a pint of
Guinness.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that among his favorite songs was ``My Way,'' usually
associated with Frank Sinatra. ``But it was Joe's song, too,'' she
said. ``He did it his way.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Yosef Burg, a seminal Israeli political figure who
was a cabinet minister for 35 years as a head of the religious
Zionist movement, died early Friday at Shaare Tsedek Hospital in
Jerusalem. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Burg, a doctor of philosophy and an ordained rabbi, was last in
public in July, when, in a wheelchair, he beamed with pride while
his son, Avraham, was sworn in as the speaker of the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Dresden and educated in Germany, Burg left a few months
before World War II broke out in 1939. He emigrated to Palestine,
witnessing the birth of the State of Israel. He served under every
prime minister until his retirement in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Burg was the minister of the century for religious
Zionism,'' said Yitzhak Meir, the Israeli ambassador to Switzerland
and a friend. Witty and grandiloquent with a thick German accent,
Burg stood for tolerance in relations between religious and secular
Jews. Though his movement, originally centrist, grew increasingly
right-wing, he was seen as a moderate and a force of reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always represented tolerance,'' said Shmuel Sandler, a
historian of religious Zionism based at Bar Ilan University near
Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   Burg, with his chubby cheeks, thick glasses and ever-present
skullcap, belonged to the first generation of religious Zionists,
who formed the National Religious Party in 1956. The only Orthodox
Jewish party that believed that Israel should be guided both by
secular and religious laws, the party was the political arm of the
Jewish settlers' movement.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, critics attacked Burg over ambivalence for not
asserting a more moderating influence over the party before it grew
hawkish.
</P>
<P>
   A polyglot who spoke nine languages, Burg was elected to the
first Israeli Parliament, in 1949. He went on to head a wide
assortment of agencies, including the Ministries of the Police,
Interior and Health, and Religious Affairs under eight prime
ministers. He forged a particularly close relationship with
Menachem Begin, although he opposed the war with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics is not a choice between good and evil,'' Burg said
last year in an interview with The Jerusalem Post. ``In politics,
you have to decide between evil and less evil, and that can be a
cruel choice.''
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, Burg studied at the University of Berlin and
received his doctorate from the University of Leipzig. He received
his rabbinical certification in Germany at 24 and was active in the
Zionist youth movement there.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services will be held on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, Rivkah; his son; his daughter, Dr. Ada
Ben-Sasson, and several grandchildren.

 &HT;    Heisman debate getting charged
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart and J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The arrest last week of Florida State wide receiver
Peter Warrick on a felony-theft charge has touched off a debate
about the Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Should character count when voters make their choice for college
football's best player? If so, do Warrick's problems open the door
for Georgia Tech quarterback Joe Hamilton?
</P>
<P>
   Judging from a sample of voters, the answer in not clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, it appeared (Warrick) was starting to take control
of the race,'' Steve Weiberg of USA Today said. ``This certainly
changes that. Now, it's a question of when he gets back, how he
plays and how many voters are willing to give him a second
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Warrick will miss his second game in a row when FSU plays
Wake Forest. He pleaded innocent to the theft charge, and his
attorney is attempting to get the charge reduced to a misdemeanor.
If the lawyer succeeds, Warrick could be in uniform Oct. 23 against
Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters said missing too many games could make the other
issue moot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The so-called character issue won't affect my vote. Missing
games will affect my vote,'' Ivan Maisel of Sports Illustrated
said. ``If a player misses two games out of an 11-game season,
that's a pretty good chunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters did agree on this: If Warrick doesn't get back into the
race, Hamilton becomes one of the favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite losing to Florida State, Hamilton played his heart
out, and a lot of people saw that,'' said Steve Richardson of the
Dallas Morning News. ``He is a bona fide candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton says he's less concerned about the Heisman race than
today's game. Eighth-ranked Tech (4-1, 2-1 ACC) plays Duke (1-4,
1-1) in Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to put the Heisman stuff on the back burner,'' he
said. ``We're in the middle of a season where we can really do
something special, and we control our own desitiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton has the nation's top passer-efficiency rating. He has
passed for 1,347 yards and 12 touchdowns and run for 321 yards and
six scores.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he was getting plenty of media attention even
before Warrick's arrest and suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so good, he's in Sports Illustrated all the time,'' Duke
coach Carl Franks said.
</P>
<P>
   If Hamilton continues to play well _ and Tech continues to win _
voters will take note, no matter what happens with Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   Eligible to vote for the Heisman are 921 people _ former
winners, selected media members and administrative people
throughout college football. Many of them say that they think
Warrick needs to be more contrite.
</P>
<P>
   He apologized on national television last week, but days before
he was charged he sounded smug when he said he shouldn't be
suspended: ``It's not like I killed the president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like Warrick's toast, but he might be a warm bagel,''
said Tom Shatel of the Omaha World-Herald. ``I need to see him eat
a little more humble pie. I need to hear him say he's an idiot, he
made a mistake and he'll never do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Other voters see no way that enough voters, many of whom are
older, conservative men, will cut Warrick any slack.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Heisman voter, I would have a hard time voting for
Warrick in his current situation,'' said Richardson, the Dallas
writer who also is the executive director of the Football Writers
Association of America. ``If there is some futher development which
could prove him less involved or innocent, then I might
reconsider.''

STARR IS LEAVING, BUT HIS OFFICE IS SAID TO INTENSIFY INQUIRIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to insert new graf after 5th graf to discuss background on
travel probe)   (bl)  
 By DAVID JOHNSTON and DON VAN NATTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a time Clinton administration officials had
hoped that the Whitewater independent counsel office would soon
shut down, lawyers involved with the inquiry said Friday that the
office has intensified its investigation into matters that could
still prove difficult for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The surge of activity in recent weeks has been accompanied by a
change in leadership at the independent counsel's office. The
federal judicial panel that supervises independent counsel issues
has appointed Robert Ray, an aggressive racketeering and gang
prosecutor who joined the office five months ago, to succeed
Kenneth Starr, who plans to step down, possibly as soon as next
week, after holding the job for five years and two months.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Starr, Ray, 39, is relatively obscure in
Washington's political and legal circles. But his appointment
suggested that prosecutors may hope to accomplish more than simply
writing a final report and closing down.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation has recently racheted up, the lawyers said
Friday, as prosecutors have centered renewed attention on trying to
determine whether White House aides played any role in what a
former White House volunteer, Kathleen Willey, has said was an
effort to persuade her to deny that the president made a sexual
advance to her in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the lawyers said prosecutors are continuing to
pursue what they see as their still-open inquiry into the
dismissals of White House travel office employees in the early
months of the Clinton presidency. They are also investigating
whether anyone involved in the matter at the White House misled
investigators about who had ordered the ouster of the employees.
</P>
<P>
   The furor over the travel office erupted in 1993 when Clinton
aides abruptly dimissed all seven employees at the White House
travel operation and replaced them with a group led by Clinton
associates from Arkansas. A White House review found that mid-level
aides were responsible for the firings, although a congressional
investigation later unearthed memorandums that suggested first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton played a central role in the dismissals. She
has said she never urged that the employees be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential aides have long denied any wrongdoing in either the
Willey or the travel office matter.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have seemed particularly active in their inquiry
into Ms. Willey's accusations. Specifically, prosecutors are
examining her accusation that Nathan Landow, a high-profile
Democratic fund-raiser and Maryland real estate developer, tried to
influence her testimony in a deposition she was preparing to give
in Paula Jones' sexual misconduct lawsuit against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors from the independent counsel's office have
subpoenaed several associates of Landow to testify before a federal
grand jury in Alexandria, Va., away from the media glare of the
District of Columbia federal courthouse, said one lawyer with
knowledge of the activity.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, agents from the FBI assigned to the independent
counsel's office have recently subpoenaed Landow's telephone logs
and business records in what appears to be an effort to find a
connection between him and White House aides, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Landow has repeatedly denied Ms. Willey's accusation; he would
not comment on the matter Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this renewed activity, it remains uncertain what the
prosecutors hope to achieve in their continuing inquiry and whether
they might plan still more indictments. The lawyers said they
suspected that some prosecutors have never abandoned their goal of
somehow implicating senior White House officials in a crime, even
Clinton or his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton. But others said that
there was scant concrete evidence and little legal basis to support
such an effort.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Starr, who is expected to resume his law partnership
in the Washington office of Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, seems to be drifting
out of public view after a tumultuous tenure in which the
independent counsel's office presided over the investigation of
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Starr's inquiry
culminated with Clinton's impeachment by the House of
Representatives in December and the president's trial and acquittal
in the Senate in February.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House on Friday, the residue of bitterness over
Starr's investigation was apparent even as the prosecutor was
stepping aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as Starr goes, I think Americans will be glad that from
now on, he'll be taking his garbage out each morning in private,''
said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, independent counsels nearing the end of their
inquiries have turned their cases over to deputies who operated as
legal caretakers with the primary jobs of handling appellate issues
and shutting down the office. But Ray is a courtroom-hardened
veteran of criminal trials, and his credentials do not suggest that
he will be a passive legal administrator.
</P>
<P>
   He was an assistant U.S. attorney in New York, where he helped
prosecute a gang known as the ``142nd Street Lynchmob'' under
federal racketeering statutes. He also helped prosecute a
49-defendant organized crime and narcotics case and supervised
``kingpin'' wiretap investigations of large scale drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   His biography, furnished by the independent counsel's office,
said he had conducted ``multi-defendant prosecutions involving
public corruption, organized crime, violent crime and narcotics
trafficking at all levels and stages of federal courts.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Ray moved to Washington to work as a deputy in Donald
Smaltz's independent counsel investigation into whether former
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy had accepted improper gifts from
companies with a financial stake in decisions of the Agriculture
Department. Espy was indicted, but after a lengthy and expensive
investigation and trial, he was acquitted of all charges.
</P>
<P>
   But Ray was the lead prosecutor in the case against Archie
Schaffer, a senior employee at Tyson Foods, the huge Arkansas-based
poultry producer. Schaffer was convicted of two counts of providing
illegal gifts to Espy. The trial judge threw out both convictions,
but an appeals court reinstated one of the counts. A sentencing
hearing is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Just five months ago, Starr named Ray the office's ``senior
litigation counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Lockhart questioned whether experience in the Espy and
Schaffer cases qualified a prosecutor to take over as independent
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's somewhat of a dubious proposition that someone involved
both in the Espy investigation and the Starr operation'' is
``getting a promotion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Lockhart said he had no ``particular concern'' about Ray,
but said there was a broader concern ``that we're continuing to
keep going and keep going and people are moving up.'' He added,
``We think they ought to find a way to wrap this up.''
</P>
<P>
   But another prosecutor in the Schaffer trial, Barry Coburn, said
Ray was a professional, apolitical prosecutor who handles complex
cases like the Espy case with aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were moments during the course of the investigation that
were extremely stressful,'' he said. ``The level of tension was
unlike anything I have experienced. He handled it with calmness,
poise and tact.''

   Construction workers near the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin have

Though the site has been known for years, it was sealed off by the

   On the eve of the first anniversary of the arrest in London of

formal request from Chile to release him on grounds of his age and
failing health. A spokeswoman for Home Secretary Jack Straw said he

   RAWALPINDI, Pakistan _ If there is such a thing as a good coup,
this one is winning raves in the bazaars of Rawalpindi.
</P>
<P>
   A decade of crooked and incompetent civilian rule before the
takeover this week, a decade of competently brutal dictatorship
before that, and life keeps getting harder for Pakistan's 138
million souls. A Pakistani poet, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, once was asked
what would become of his nation. ``My great fear,'' he said, ``is
that nothing will happen. Things will go on the way they are.''
</P>
<P>
   There is not much passion for politicians or for going to the
polls again. There is a thirst for leadership, or even something
stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there should be any elections,'' said Kalsoon
Syed, an elementary school principal. ``There should be a strong
dictator.''
</P>
<P>
   The American ambassador, William Milam, met Friday for 90
minutes with the coup leader, Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, at the army's
general headquarters here just hours after the general declared
himself the country's chief executive, suspended the Constitution
and dismissed Parliament. The general's government also froze the
assets of more than 500 political figures, among them Nawaz Sharif,
the ousted prime minister, and his predecessor, Benazir Bhutto.
Western diplomats said the ambassador had given the general a
message from President Clinton calling on him to return the nation
to civilian rule as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may be calling for a return to democratic principles in
Pakistan, but politicians here have rarely practiced them. For 11
years, since the end of the last military dictatorship, most of
them have behaved like medieval barons, plundering most of what
remained of the nation's wealth.
</P>
<P>
   What was left was not enough to run a civil society. The
principal export of Pakistan today is Pakistanis. The most
talented, the best educated, the potential leaders are gone. So
nostalgia for a strongman fills the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling may support the military government of Musharraf,
who seized power this week, becoming the latest in a series of
rulers who have led and misled the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan was created in 1947 out of the violent partition of
India. While it often has been ruled by military dictatorships, it
has also had the trappings of democracy: a Parliament, a lively
press, political debate.
</P>
<P>
   But to many Pakistanis, democracy is a facade. Waheed Zaman, 30,
the well-spoken owner of a trophy shop in Rawalpindi, said his
middle-class family was ``like other people; we are fed up with
politicians; we have love for our armed forces despite their
checkered history.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaman and others in the teeming bazaar in this city, 25 miles
southwest of the national capital, Islamabad, spoke in heroic terms
of a man who was once a national demon: Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq.
He ruled Pakistan for 11 years until he died in a plane crash in
1988, a still unexplained midair explosion that also took the life
of Arnold Raphel, then the American ambassador to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Zia was an angel,'' said a grizzled rickshaw driver
named Amir Khan, 59. ``Then there was no inflation. Crime was under
control. When I heard he was killed, I thought Pakistan was an
orphan.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment is sometimes tinged with blood; many Pakistanis
want their political miscreants punished. ``These smugglers, these
bribe-taking people should be behind bars or hanged,'' said Mrs.
Syed, the school principal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pervaiz Musharraf, my prayers and my best wishes are with
him,'' she said. ``This man is a general. He knows law and order
and how to get things done. We expect him to do things for the
common people.''
</P>
<P>
   Much needs to be done. Pakistan is a basket case, and the coup
may make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   Today two-thirds of the country's wealth goes to the military
and to paying its debts. Three-quarters of the aid Pakistan
receives from the International Monetary Fund goes to pay off IOUs
to the I.M.F. That aid was immediately suspended after the coup, as
was a trade agreement with the European Union that Pakistan
desperately needed. Pakistan has only $1.4 billion in foreign
reserves _ just enough to buy three weeks of imports.
</P>
<P>
   In the troubled 2{-year tenure of Sharif, Pakistan's currency,
the rupee, lost half its value against the dollar. Everything in
the bazaar seems to cost far more than it did in 1997. And the $600
million in annual military and economic aid Pakistan received from
the United States in Zia's day, during the 1980s, ended after he
died and when the Cold War was over, blocked by law after the
United States acknowledged that Pakistan was building a nuclear
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is now uneasily contemplating the prospect of dealing
with a dictator in Pakistan once more. Western diplomats said the
general had given Milam a preview of the speech he is to give on
Saturday, which those diplomats expect will set forth his plans for
dealing with Pakistan's crushing problems.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans may include a slow return to what the West would
like to call democracy. It may come, but for now the bazaar has
spoken, and in much the same voice as that of Talat Massoud, a
retired lieutenant general who served as defense secretary from
1988 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coup was a good thing,'' he said, in a voice devoid of
happiness or anticipation. ``It gave us a sigh of relief. There was
no choice left for the military. Our politicians put us on the
brink of disaster. They were making a mockery of democracy. The
prime minister had corrupted every institution. The judiciary was
bought off; there was no justice. The police were run as a fiefdom.
What kind of democracy was that?''

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 17) 
(af) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``It was a good day,'' Ronnie Heyman was overheard
telling a friend on Oct. 5, at the end of a Senate subcommittee
hearing on legislation championed by her husband, Samuel J. Heyman,
the chairman of the GAF Corp.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was. Embraced warmly by the subcommittee, the bill and
a similar one moving rapidly through the House of Representatives
would limit sharply the crushing legal liability of former asbestos
producers like GAF, which have been locked in a decades-long battle
with hundreds of thousands of people who say they have been made
ill by exposure to asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   With powerful opponents like labor unions and the Association of
Trial Lawyers, the GAF legislation was considered a dead letter at
the beginning of the year. Now it is gaining stunning momentum, all
because of a remarkable multimillion-dollar lobbying effort
engineered by the Heymans.
</P>
<P>
   For the Heymans, the benefits of limiting GAF's liability to the
most serious cases of asbestos poisoning are clear. Heyman owns
most of GAF; his investment in the company constitutes the bulk of
the family's estimated $1 billion in wealth.
</P>
<P>
   For other supporters, the legislation would limit runaway
liability and speed money to victims.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the bills would shrink many settlements and cut
many victims out of the process.
</P>
<P>
   With stakes this high, the Heymans are proceeding with the same
determination they used as dissident shareholders nearly 17 years
ago, when they won a bitter proxy fight and wrested control of GAF
from its old management.
</P>
<P>
   The Heymans and GAF have retained a battery of lobbyists,
including a former United States senator, Dennis DeConcini, and the
son of Sen.r Orrin G. Hatch, a co-sponsor of the GAF measure. They
have used the same advertising firm that created the famous ``Harry
and Louise'' ads that helped crush President Clinton's health care
package five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And they have given generously to scores of lawmakers, most
notably to a handful of Democrats like Sens. Charles E. Schumer of
New York and Robert G. Toricelli of New Jersey who have
longstanding alliances to unions and the trial lawyers but who have
begun to come around to GAF's position.
</P>
<P>
   GAF has also hired two law professors as consultants. One,
Christopher Edley Jr., a professor at Harvard Law School and a
former top aide to President Clinton, wrote the legislation for
Congress. He is being paid by the Coalition for Asbestos
Resolution, an ad hoc group of businesses organized and financed
largely by GAF.
</P>
<P>
   The other, who testified on behalf of the measures, is Paul R.
Vurkeil, the dean of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at
Yeshiva University in Manhattan, which named a research center on
corporate governance after the Heymans when they donated $1 million
to the school.
</P>
<P>
   The trial lawyers and the unions, traditionally among the most
powerful interest groups in Washington, have been caught
flat-footed, largely distracted by other legislative matters. They
have salted Congress with significantly more money in campaign
contributions than GAF has, but they have many more causes to
advocate. And while they have apparently used only one outside
lobbying firm, GAF has outgunned them with at least six.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some sense, it's an advantage to be an outsider because you
come with no preconceived notions of what can and cannot be
achieved within the system,'' Heyman said in an interview last
week. ``We've run a focused legislative campaign, emphasizing the
merits of the legislation, and we have a high conviction that we're
right.''
</P>
<P>
   That determination has already led to much bipartisan support,
with 18 senators and 57 representatives sponsoring the measures _
giving the legislation a bright prospect of passing this session or
next.
</P>
<P>
   So it was hardly surprising that the five senators at the Oct. 5
hearing _ some with longstanding ties to labor and the trial
lawyers _ praised the legislation. While witnesses supporting the
GAF bill were treated to a series of softball questions, the two
lawyers representing labor and the trial lawyers' group had to
contend with sliders and curves.
</P>
<P>
   GAF's measure would eliminate crushing punitive damages, which
can be high multiples of actual damages. It would supersede state
laws and mandate more restrictive medical proof for many claims.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say it would slash GAF's potential liability, now in the
billions of dollars. And they say it would eliminate up to 70
percent of the 100,000 cases pending against GAF, as well as many
times that number in those that may ultimately be filed,
particularly cases that involve some exposure but, as yet, no
serious disease.
</P>
<P>
   It does offer benefits for plaintiffs. It would, for instance,
eliminate state statutes of limitation that defendants often use to
knock plaintiffs out of court. It would place a 25 percent cap on
fees paid to plaintiffs' lawyers, who now often get more than a
third of an award, and set up a new office to ease out-of-court
settlements. That, proponents say, would save plaintiffs money.
</P>
<P>
   But critics see a wolf in sheep's clothing. The bill's backers
``purport to want to fix the liability system so that people can
get quickly compensated,'' said Frank Clemente, director of Public
Citizen's Congress Watch, an organization founded by Ralph Nader
that has campaigned against the measure. ``Their proposal could
actually do nothing of the sort. If anything, it would cut off more
than half of the population injured by asbestos from pursuing their
legal rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, the House Judiciary Committee is expected to
approve a version of the legislation, moved in part by a Supreme
Court decision in June. In it, the exasperated justices implored
Congress to find a solution to ``the elephantine mass of asbestos
cases.'' As of now, GAF's in-house legal team, with little
experience in the ways of Washington, is outmaneuvering the more
seasoned trial lawyers and labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started this thing, people told us that there was no
way we could win because of the control over Congress by the trial
lawyers,'' said Richard A. Weinberg, GAF's general counsel and
Heyman's field general in the campaign. ``It's nice to finally see
that policy is finally prevailing.''
</P>
<P>
   But not policy alone.

 WASHINGTON: policy alone.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a group of other asbestos makers abandoned
GAF, apparently after being threatened with more personal-injury
lawsuits from aggressive plaintiffs' lawyers. For GAF, the
short-term loss proved to have a longer-term benefit: On its own,
the company did not need to strike any industry compromises or
freight the legislation with other companies' pet causes.
</P>
<P>
   The company then turned to Edley, who first wrote about asbestos
issues earlier this decade, to draft the legislation. He said that
he does not have a normal lawyer-client relationship with GAF and
that he regarded himself as working somewhat independently _ he
occasionally disagrees with Heyman and Weinberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into this with a very strong expectation that in
pursuing the right public policy, I would at the same time be
satisfying the client, if not perfectly, at least adequately,''
Edley said.
</P>
<P>
   Heyman said that even though Edley was being paid by the
coalition financed by GAF, ``We don't regard him as our lawyer in
the normal sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyman also said that despite his own strong ties to Harvard Law
School _ he is an alumnus, a major donor and a member of the dean's
advisory board _ it would be unfair to make any links between those
ties and Edley.
</P>
<P>
   Controlled and financed by GAF, the Coalition for Asbestos
Resolution is led by Conrad L. Mallet Jr., a former chief justice
of the Michigan Supreme Court. Mallet has testified repeatedly
about the legislation's virtues.
</P>
<P>
   A third witness who testified about the constitutional and
administrative law aspects of the legislation was Verkuil, the dean
of Cardozo, the home of the Samuel and Ronnie Heyman Center on
Corporate Governance. Mrs. Heyman, a lawyer and director of GAF, is
also on that school's board, and is a 1996 Clinton appointee to the
National Council on the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Verkuil said that, while he had a long friendship with the
Heymans, his views on the law had not been colored by those ties or
by the family's association with the school. ``The fact that the
Heyman Center and Sam and his wife have been supportive of the
school is more coincidence than anything else,'' he said. ``My
views have developed over the greater part of 30 years of thinking
about these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The connections forged by the Heymans are deeper than academic.
</P>
<P>
   At the current rate of spending, GAF's registered lobbyists
could wind up being paid more than $3 million this year, probably
more than lobbyists for any other company in its industry will be
paid. The lobbyists include Scott Hatch, whose father, a Utah
Republican, heads the Senate Judiciary Committee and was a
co-sponsor of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Parry, Romani &AMP; DeConcini, the firm where Scott Hatch works, is
headed by Thomas Parry, a close friend and former chief of staff to
Hatch. Its other partners include Dennis DeConcini, the former
democratic senator from Arizona, a former member of the judiciary
committee who has helped persuade current senators like Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., to support the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The firm has received $360,000 from GAF for its services,
according to records filed by the lobbying firm at the Senate
clerk's office.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hatch did not return several telephone calls seeking
comment. The firm's president, Romano Romani, said Hatch's primary
job is to perform research and that he was listed on the lobbying
forms to meet the technical requirements of the disclosure law.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has never lobbied his father on anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Smith, a spokesman for Senator Hatch, also said that Scott
Hatch had not lobbied his father.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Hatch has received at least $10,000 in campaign
contributions from the Heyman family, far from the lion's share of
the company's and family's contributions. Since last year, the
family and GAF's political action committee have given more than
$250,000 to both Democrats and Republicans, according to records at
the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four years, the company and the family have made
donations to more than 100 current and former lawmakers. Not
surprisingly, the bulk of the more recent contributions has gone to
members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, which would
have to approve any measures.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans have long supported GAF's cause as part of
their efforts toward so-called tort reform, the donations and
lobbying appear focused on dislodging enough Democrats to win final
approval. Many Democrats have long been allied with the unions and
trial lawyers, but after donations and heavy lobbying, a number of
them have joined the GAF cause.
</P>
<P>
   When he served on the House Judiciary Committee, Schumer,
outspoken on many issues, never sponsored any asbestos legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has also been a significant recipient of campaign
contributions. The Heyman family gave $77,500 to his Senate
campaign, including $62,500 to a ``Victory in New York'' fund in
the final week of the race.
</P>
<P>
   He said during the hearing two weeks ago that it was crucial for
Congress to come up with a way to resolve the problems in the
courts and quickly compensate the injured.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli said at the same hearing that he rarely disagrees
with the unions and the trial lawyers. But he also backs the
legislation. As chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, Torricelli is his party's top fund-raiser in the Senate,
and his campaign and the committee have received at least $41,000
from the Heymans and GAF so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   But GAF's approach to fund-raising has been bipartisan, with its
political action committee giving at least $32,000 to Republicans
on the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the donations came after GAF suffered a stunning setback
in the Supreme Court in 1997. The court suggested that only
Congress was in a position to clamp down on GAF's mounting asbestos
liability. After that decision, more than 93,000 asbestos claims
were filed against GAF and its affiliated companies, and by the end
of last year, the company faced 113,800 cases.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the members of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee that has
initial jurisdiction over the legislation, only one, Russell D.
Feingold, D.- Wis., has not signed on to the bill. Irking many
corporate lobbyists, Feingold, who is the main proponent of
campaign finance reform, has a singular reputation in the Senate
for spurning big financial contributions and donations from
political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   Heyman, a real estate developer from Connecticut and former
Justice Department prosecutor, inherited GAF's asbestos problems
when he won control of GAF in 1983. Holding only 6 percent of the
company's stock, he and nine others ran against GAF executives and,
against long odds, were elected to its board. In 1989, he took the
company private in a leveraged buyout.

 WASHINGTON: leveraged buyout.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAF, founded in 1868, got into the asbestos business a century
later, when it acquired the Ruberoid Co. of New York. In 1928,
Ruberoid bought the H.F. Watson Co., which made thermal insulation
that contained asbestos. The company later acquired an asbestos
mine in Vermont. Ruberoid made significant use of asbestos as an
insulation known as Calcilite, used primarily in roofing products.
</P>
<P>
   GAF never made much money from asbestos and stopped making
asbestos products years before the Heymans arrived.
</P>
<P>
   A white, flaky mineral known for its fire-retardant properties,
asbestos gets its name from a Greek adjective that means
inextinguishable, which history has proved was an apt choice.
</P>
<P>
   The substance was widely used by the turn of the century as
insulation in construction, at shipyards and in household
appliances. Between 1940 and 1980 alone, an estimated 21 million
Americans were exposed to it at work, and countless millions more
are believed to have inhaled loose fibers.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after World War II that scientists, led by the late
Dr. Irving J. Selikoff, discovered that the fibers cause lung
cancer, asbestosis, mesothelioma and other debilitating and fatal
diseases _ but often not until decades after exposure.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, as the research translated into litigation,
companies began to face staggering liability claims, which have
multiplied as relentlessly as the broom in ``The Sorcerer's
Apprentice.''
</P>
<P>
   But huge verdicts, punitive damages and large fees for both
plaintiff and defense lawyers can deplete the money necessary to
help victims.
</P>
<P>
   GAF is one of the most frequent defendants. ``Since the late
1970s, when asbestos litigation as we know it today began,'' Heyman
testified before the Senate subcommittee, GAF has paid out ``more
than $1.2 billion in claims and expenses, a substantial portion of
which has gone to people who are not sick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite both GAF and the industry having settled almost
300,000 cases,'' he added, ``more than 200,000 asbestos cases
remain pending nationwide, 100,000 of which involve claims against
GAF, with new claims being filed now at the rate of 50,000 per
annum _ with more to come and no end in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of possible claimants is indeed staggering, and many
experts say they are already overwhelming the legal system. The
AFL-CIO estimates that up to a million current or retired members
were exposed to asbestos and that many will suffer from serious
ailments. A widely cited study by the Judicial Conference, the
policy arm of the federal court system, predicts up to 265,000
asbestos-related deaths by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   All this has made it difficult for those who made or used
asbestos to control their expenses. More than 15 companies have
gone bankrupt, and in many cases, the injured have had to wait
years for compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts at consolidating the cases to try to put some cap on
liability have met with mixed success. Twice in the last two years,
the Supreme Court has struck down large class action settlements,
saying they simply cannot accommodate the diverse interests of all
current and future plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The first of those cases, Amchem Products vs. Windsor, involved
a settlement that set up a special center that claimants could use
to resolve their cases against the 20 large asbestos makers,
including GAF.
</P>
<P>
   Heyman's interest in the legislation is in no small part a
personal one because of his stake in GAF.
</P>
<P>
   But some other large asbestos defendants, like the Manville
Trust, have declined to join GAF's legislative campaign. GAF
executives say this is in part because trial lawyers have
threatened to increase the number of cases they file against them.
</P>
<P>
   One large former asbestos manufacturer, Owens Corning, has
actually testified against the legislation, suggesting that in its
present form it may upset a delicate settlement program the company
has devised with the law firms of more than 100 plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The program involves giving modest sums to the least injured and
opportunities for victims to reapply for more later, if their
exposure creates more serious problems. Over the next few years, it
will make payments of nearly $3 billion, excluding insurance
contributions and any tax benefits, in the hope of keeping the
company solvent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to discharge our obligation in a way that also works
for us financially,'' said Maura J. Abeln, the general counsel of
Owens Corning and architect of the company's national settlement
program.
</P>
<P>
   Heyman remains dubious, suggesting that the program is destined
to fail because it relies too much on the promises of plaintiffs'
lawyers that they will not sue _ lawyers who in his mind are
needlessly bleeding his and other companies dry, and raking in huge
fees in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just is not enough money in the world to buy off all the
asbestos lawyers,'' Heyman told the Senate subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Abeln disagreed, and has a far kinder assessment of
those lawyers. ``Over all, the plaintiffs' bar some 15 years ago
represented people who were exposed and did become ill,'' she said.
``Had they not had access to the court system, they probably would
never have gotten paid.''

   Please note that the photo numbered NYT16 and sent Thursday,
Oct. 14, by the New York Times News Service, with an article about
reports of war time American military looting of valuables stolen
from Hungarian Jews, was provided in error. The photo was slugged:
JEWS-GOLD-1-B&AMP;W.
</P>
<P>
   The photo should have shown Gen. Harry J. Collins - a commander
suspected of having requisitioned valuables for his personal use.
</P>
<P>
   Instead it showed Gen. J. Lawton Collins, who died in 1987. He
was a combat leader in World War II and an Army chief of staff. He
won the nickname ``Lightning Joe'' when he commanded a division at
Guadalcanal. He later led one of the Army corps that landed at
Normandy on D-Day. The general earned numerous honors including two
Silver Stars.

SENATE DEMOCRATS ALL BUT ASSURED OF VOTES ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE
REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., Wis., Ariz., Nev., Conn., Mass., N.J., Maine)  (rk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Democrats managed to score a parliamentary
victory Friday that appeared to guarantee them test votes next week
on a wide-ranging bill to overhaul the nation's campaign finance
laws and on a more limited measure to ban unregulated donations to
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering seemed to catch the measures' chief foe, Sen.
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., off guard. But it was not at all clear that
either vote, on the Democrats' effort to shut off debate on the two
measures, would accomplish anything even if supporters mustered the
60 votes needed. The measures were introduced Friday as amendments
to underlying legislation, which would face further procedural
hurdles in any case.
</P>
<P>
   Barring an unforeseen twist, however, senators will commit
themselves in principle next Tuesday on whether to allow the
parties to continue to receive unregulated six-figure
contributions, the ``soft money'' that critics denounce as a
corrupting influence on America's political system. At the very
least, Democrats could use the roll-call votes on their two
amendments as a potent campaign issue next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to answer the question `Who's for soft money?'''
said Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., who, along with Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., is offering the underlying bill, which would ban
the unlimited donations. ``Are you for a system of legalized
bribery or against it?''
</P>
<P>
   The arcane procedural victory that the Democrats achieved Friday
occurred when they offered the two amendments for consideration and
then, when there was no objection, were able to demand the cloture
votes on them. The Democrats then refused to set aside their
amendments to make room for Republican amendments, fearing that
McConnell, a master of the Senate rules, would figure out a way to
block the cloture votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing here is that Democrats are blocking
Republicans from offering amendments,'' said McConnell, head of the
Senate Republicans' campaign committee, who maintains that the
legislation would infringe on the Constitution's free-speech
protections. ``We've been shut out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, the assistant Democratic leader, shot
back, ``The majority now knows how we feel all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, standing by his bill but wary of votes that could lead
nowhere except to a political clobbering of fellow Republicans,
called the situation on the floor ``gridlocked right now,'' and
said he hoped that on Monday he could talk Democrats into
``unsticking it.'' But he said the maneuvering had become extremely
complicated, with many competing agendas.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, ``what the Democrats are doing is trying to preserve
their options,'' McCain said in an interview. ``I think the
Republicans are scared to death there will be more Sam
Brownbacks.'' Sen. Brownback, R-Kan., abandoning the party
leadership's position, endorsed the McCain-Feingold bill this week.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the Democrats' amendments enshrines a campaign
finance overhaul championed in the House by Reps. Christopher
Shays, R-Conn., and Martin Meehan, D-Mass.. This measure, which the
House has already passed, mirrors legislation that McCain and
Feingold introduced in 1998 but scaled back this year to try to win
more votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Democrats expect that this amendment will fail to win
60 votes. So their second amendment is simply the revised
McCain-Feingold bill. But unlike that underlying bill, this
amendment cannot itself be amended, because a vote on cloture must
be strictly up or down.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats opened this second day of debate on campaign
finance by fighting among themselves over whether it made more
sense to back the soft-money ban or the more comprehensive bill,
which in addition would regulate issue advocacy advertisements,
often thinly disguised campaign commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, who heads the Senate
Democrats' campaign committee, said a soft-money ban alone would
simply shift such donations to issue advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a premature defeat,'' Torricelli said. ``We cannot
explain to the American people that we let this charade continue.''
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, he and McConnell sounded like allies, as the
Republican added that so narrow a ban would amount to ``selective
disarmament.''
</P>
<P>
   But Feingold countered by noting that the original
McCain-Feingold bill, while preferable, had repeatedly fallen at
least eight votes short of the 60 needed to steer past a
filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   ``By banning soft money,'' Feingold said, ``isn't it worth
giving it a try?''

   Please note that the photo numbered NYT16 and sent Thursday,
Oct. 14, by the New York Times News Service, with an article about
reports of war time American military looting of valuables stolen
from Hungarian Jews, was provided in error. The photo was slugged:
JEWS-GOLD-1-B&AMP;W.
</P>
<P>
   The photo should have shown Gen. Harry J. Collins - a commander
suspected of having requisitioned valuables for his personal use.
</P>
<P>
   Instead it showed Gen. J. Lawton Collins, who died in 1987. He
was a combat leader in World War II and an Army chief of staff. He
won the nickname ``Lightning Joe'' when he commanded a division at
Guadalcanal. He later led one of the Army corps that landed at
Normandy on D-Day. The general earned numerous honors including two
Silver Stars.

 HOUSE GOP WHIP TOM DeLAY EXPANDS HIS POWER, AND RELISHES IT

 By ALISON MITCHELL and MARC LACEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Majority Whip Tom DeLay has never been called
shy about displaying his power.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, the 52-year-old Texas Republican
mischievously showed that he really does know how to use the long
whips that he keeps coiled in his office as symbols of his job as
the House's chief head-counter and vote wrangler.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay slipped out the back door of his suite, holding a red,
white and black, braided Hungarian whip. He marched out to the East
Front of the Capitol, instructing his bodyguard to warn police that
the loud bangs that would soon ring out were not gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   Then, standing as poised as a ballet dancer, he swung the
eight-foot coil over his head and sent its end cracking, again and
again. Bill Paxon, a former congressman turned lobbyist, who had
been nearby, whispering into his cellular phone, cowered and called
out playfully, ``I didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, no one questions that the whip-cracking DeLay is the
House's most powerful member. Though technically just the
third-ranking member of the Republican leadership, he wields more
influence than Speaker Dennis Hastert, whose election he largely
orchestrated. Although he enjoys moments of showmanship, he has
acquired this power more quietly, building a political machine that
many experts call the most formidable organization of any member of
Congress today. The confederation, knitted over the last five
years, includes House loyalists, DeLay proteges, political
committees and corporate lobbyists all deployed to expand and
protect the thin Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   The machine is fueled by money and some of his fund raising has
been criticized because, even though he is a federal official, he
seeks contributions that fall outside the purview of federal
election law. He has raised millions of dollars for other
Republicans, including state officials, sometimes by using legal
loopholes in the campaign finance laws. DeLay is currently raising
funds for a controversial $25 million drive to counter labor union
efforts for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In his brashness, DeLay has sometimes skated close to the
ethical edge. Reports that he has demanded declarations of loyalty
from lobbyists have led the House Committee on Standards of
Official Conduct on two occasions to remind him of the rules
against linking official actions to partisan considerations. But
ethics complaints against him were dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay is a powerful force in the conservative wing of his party
and led the charge for the impeachment of President Clinton. But
Republican moderates turn to him, too, and several say they like
the way he is masterminding the Republicans' budget showdown with
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to turn over to my kids a country that I had a part
to play in changing from the failed welfare state that I lived
in,'' DeLay said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of DeLay's strength that he was the only House
leader to go unchallenged when the loss of House seats by
Republicans last November forced the resignation of Speaker Newt
Gingrich and set off a struggle for every other post in the House
Republican hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's never been more influential than he is right
now,'' said Rep. John Doolittle, R-Calif., who is part of DeLay's
whip organization. Marshall Wittmann, a congressional analyst at
the conservative Heritage Foundation, said: ``He is the most
powerful majority whip in the history of the House of
Representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every member of the current House Republican
leadership is somehow indebted to DeLay _ either because of favors
he has performed or campaign funds he has shared. And his kitchen
cabinet of plugged-in players in the lobbying world meets regularly
in DeLay's inner sanctum.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay wins praise from Republicans for his skill, his energy and
his willingness to help colleagues. But much of his power is rooted
in his unabashed devotion to political money.
</P>
<P>
   In Gingrich's absence, Delay has emerged as the chief
fund-raiser for the National Republican Congressional Committee,
the campaign arm of House Republicans. Republican strategists
estimate that DeLay, through telemarketing, direct mail and
personal appearances, has helped raise at least $11 million in the
first half of this year _ or nearly half the organization's money.
</P>
<P>
   ``My infrastructure expands,'' he said in an interview. ``The
number of people I know, the networking and everything, just grows.
It doesn't happen overnight. It's a lot of work. Years of work.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Now DeLay is helping his conservative allies raise money for an
ambitious new enterprise, a $25 million campaign to counter
organized labor's plan to help Democrats in the coming
congressional elections. The effort is being directed through a
non-profit corporation that can raise money in unlimited sums
without disclosing its donors.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., a sponsor of legislation to
overhaul campaign finance, has called the secrecy of the group
``unbelievably sick.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay argued that the group was necessary to return Republicans
to their grass roots. ``There's no other organization that can
fight with the unions toe to toe, in the streets, in the
communities,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   Partisan battle is what DeLay is all about. He is proud of
running the whip's office not just as a vote-counting operation but
as part catering hall, part campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   He will help a fellow House member find a private plane if the
Republican needs to get to an event quickly. He will travel to a
far-flung congressional district to headline a fund-raising event.
He routinely offers buffet dinners in his office during the House's
late-night sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's barbecue,'' said Doolittle. ``Sometimes it's
fried chicken. Sometimes it's pizza. Frequently it's more than one
of those things.
</P>
<P>
   Even though that doesn't have anything to do with the
legislative process, it develops closer relationships,'' he said.

 &HT;    Rocker `pushes their buttons'
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The pack of starving Mets fans got what they wanted
on Friday and it was long before the game started. They got a piece
of the newly anointed king of trash talk John Rocker upon his
arrival for batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was interviewed by NBC in the dugout, then surrounded by
a pack of reporters where he was asked to explain his sentiments
behind ``to hell with Mets fans'' comments among others. But to the
jeers of the Mets fans above the Braves dugout, Rocker finally
walked up the steps, turned and tipped his cap to the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker even stopped to sign autographs down the left field line
on his way to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's funny I can push their buttons that bad,'' Rocker
said. ``One comment can make them expend this much energy.''
</P>
<P>
   But did he expect it to be much worse?
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be just as irate and derogatory toward me,'' Rocker
said. ``Are they going to tell me I really (stink) this time?''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to gauge his competitive juices, Rocker smiled and
said: ``They're about as high as they've ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves manager Bobby Cox spoke up Friday about his displeasure
when he was asked about Rocker's comments, saying it was something
he would address with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it irritates me,'' Cox said. ``I don't like it. I don't
condone it. He was roughed up by the fans, I think, our first
series here out in the outfield. And he's the type of guy that's
going to give it right back. He's got to work on that. He's a great
pitcher, a great competitor, but he needs to work on his player/fan
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   That was met with laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe if you feel something is wrong, maybe you ought to
speak up,'' Rocker said.
</P>
<P>
   BAYLOR UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's news that Phil Garner had been hired to manage the
Detroit Tigers just underscored that Braves hitting coach Don
Baylor is the leading candidate for the Cubs managing position and
will probably have the job offered to him once the Braves season is
over.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs general manager Ed Lynch called Baylor at 9 a.m. in his New
York hotel room on Friday. Baylor said Lynch did not offer him the
job, just told him he was still evaluating other candidates and
would be back in touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't talked length of contract or of dollar figures,''
Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor has also been pursued by the Milwaukee Brewers, and has
talked with former Braves assistant general manager and current
Brewers GM Dean Taylor six or seven times already. But the Anaheim
Angels and the Cubs would appear to have most of Baylor's interest.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor has interviewed with the Angels but is waiting for the
hiring of a new general manager, something that is expected as
early as Monday. Also with Friday's news that Cleveland manager
Mike Hargrove was fired, his name could enter the mix in several of
those cities.
</P>
<P>
   LINEUP SHAKEUP
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to get out of an Atlanta pitching-induced slump,
Mets manager Bobby Valentine juggled the top of his lineup for Game
3, moving the struggling John Olerud up to No. 2 and putting the
hot hitting Edgardo Alfonzo at No. 3. He also dropped a cold Robin
Ventura from fifth to sixth and put power-hitting Benny Agbayani in
Ventura's usual fifth spot behind Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting Mike where he might get a pitch or two more to hit,
gives Fonzie a little more prominence in our lineup and it spaces
our left-handers,'' Valentine said.

   Please note that the photo numbered NYT16 and sent Thursday,
Oct. 14, by the New York Times News Service, with an article about
reports of war time American military looting of valuables stolen
from Hungarian Jews, was provided in error. The photo was slugged:
JEWS-GOLD-1-B&AMP;W.
</P>
<P>
   The photo should have shown Gen. Harry J. Collins - a commander
suspected of having requisitioned valuables for his personal use.
</P>
<P>
   Instead it showed Gen. J. Lawton Collins, who died in 1987. He
was a combat leader in World War II and an Army chief of staff. He
won the nickname ``Lightning Joe'' when he commanded a division at
Guadalcanal. He later led one of the Army corps that landed at
Normandy on D-Day. The general earned numerous honors including two
Silver Stars.

WASHINGTON: he said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Building DeLay Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Delay was never expected to become whip. When Republicans won
the majority in 1994, Gingrich had endorsed his friend, Rep. Bob
Walker, R-Pa. Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., also made a spirited and
well-financed run. But DeLay defeated them both, benefiting from
nine months of helping Republican congressional candidates around
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   He formed a leadership political action committee, known as
Americans for a Republican Majority, that poured $2 million into
the campaigns of incumbents and challengers. The group has received
large donations from an array of corporations, including tobacco
and telecommunications companies. He has traveled to 25 states to
help get Republicans elected, offering campaign advice,
fund-raising help, anything that a candidate asked for. His toiling
translated into votes.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, now a lobbyist, still seems somewhat jarred that DeLay
defeated him. ``Tom is someone who enjoys raising money,'' Walker
said. ``It is one of his strengths. Even though I didn't want to
campaign that way, I admired in the end that it was successful for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mildred Webber, a DeLay loyalist who managed his campaign
for whip says that it was more than contributions that led to
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom knew that it wasn't just going to be money that got us the
majority _or that won him the whip race,'' she said. ``It was going
to be a full-service operation and that's what we became.''
</P>
<P>
   He even sent out tapes to candidates providing such practical
tutoring as how to use lawn signs.
</P>
<P>
   After securing the whip's job, DeLay continued using money to
enhance his power, much like other aspiring House leaders. Because
he rarely faces a serious challenger for re-election he
traditionally gives away as much as 90 percent of his campaign
funds. And, with Gingrich gone, DeLay has become the linchpin
between Republicans in the House and their conservative donors. His
popularity with these donors was enhanced by his role in the
impeachment of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't waste Tom on small donors,'' said one of DeLay's
advisers. ``We don't ask him to make $1,000 calls. He makes
six-figure calls.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay has expanded his organization from a vote-counting
operation into a kind of political machine.
</P>
<P>
   This year, through a program called Romp, or Retain Our Majority
Program, DeLay nudged his deputy and assistant whips to contribute
to the campaigns of 10 Republican incumbents who were in danger of
losing their re-election races. The money was supplemented by
lobbyists, political action committees and other House leaders,
altogether netting more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's edge was apparent in an early draft of the program's
organization plan, written by an aide. It opened with a quote from
Winston Churchill that seemed to capture the spirit of the office:
``Victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory
however long and hard the road may be. For without victory there is
no survival.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay also opened an offshoot of his federal PAC in Virginia,
where he gave donations to candidates for the state legislature. He
called the focus on state politics essential to ``grow the majority
party,'' saying it was designed to help create a farm team for
Congress and wrest control of state legislatures before crucial
decisions on redistricting that could affect control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Operating in Virginia allowed him to take advantage _ as other
lawmakers have done _ of that state's lack of contribution limits
for PACs. In 1996, the Virginia operation directed $12,000 back
into DeLay's federal PAC, drawing a warning letter from the Federal
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Although DeLay eventually closed his Virginia group, his federal
PAC has continued to maintain a state fund that accepts corporate
donations and keeps its records to itself. The organization is in
the process of registering again in Virginia and Mississippi,
associates said, and plans to focus on the 22 states that allow
corporate contributions to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Another organization that benefits from DeLay's fund raising is
the Republican Majority Issues Committee, which Democrats have
challenged before the Federal Election Commission because of its
decision not to report donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the worst thing in politics is anonymous, under the
bedclothes money,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   The group is led by Karl Gallant, who previously ran the federal
PAC for DeLay. For years, Gallant fought organized labor as vice
president of the National Right to Work Committee. He described the
group as a ``mirror image of the AFL-CIO'' because it would devote
its efforts to identifying and turning out conservative voters in
key congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the organization unusual is that it is registering
under the IRS code as a nonprofit corporation involved in politics.
That designation means that it does not have to make its tax
returns public or report its contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal election law, such a group is banned from
coordination with candidates and Gallant carefully says that
although DeLay is a major fund-raiser, the organization is
independent from him. ``We are separate from the DeLay operation,''
he said. ``I have had to leave the nest to get this started.''
</P>
<P>
   But many Republican-leaning lobbyists say they consider the
group another surrogate DeLay organization, and DeLay has been
unabashedly helping it raise money. He says he does not run the
group, but he does not distance himself from it either. And he
staunchly defends the lack of disclosure because ``the law doesn't
require it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be glad to disclose it if I can get disclosure of Ralph
Nader's groups, disclosure of the ACLU, disclosure of the leftist
organizations,'' DeLay said. ``If they'll disclose, I'll
disclose.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee made its initial pitch for funds earlier this year
on the private yacht of Amway president Richard DeVos and his wife,
Betsy, the chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party, both of
whom are among the Republican Party's biggest donors.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay and the other Republican leaders in the Hose were all on
hand. The first to step forward with a pledge was lobbyist and
fund-raiser Jack Abramoff, who is close to DeLay. He says he will
raise ``plenty'' for the effort.

 WASHINGTON: the effort.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Protecting a Majority
</P>
<P>
   A larger majority in the House would help DeLay with his job as
whip _ to pass the Republican legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   To carry out that role, he has assembled 64 colleagues into what
has been called the largest whip organizations in decades, and also
one of the most effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think I'm handed a bill and I go to the floor and
try to pass it,'' DeLay said. ``It takes much more work. It takes a
lot of work one on one with members.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's clout was most visible in last year's Republican
leadership elections. DeLay, who has earned the moniker ``The
Hammer,'' was the only one of the Republican leaders to go
unchallenged and in most of the other races he mobilized on behalf
of chosen candidates.
</P>
<P>
   He virtually installed his chief deputy whip, Hastert, R-Ill.,
as speaker after DeLay's first choice, Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La.,
unexpectedly stepped down because of reports of sexual
infidelities.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas Davis, R-Va., who was elected chairman of the
National Republican Congressional Committee, was DeLay's candidate.
The ascension of Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., as Republican Conference
chairman in place of Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, led to another
increase in DeLay's power: the uncontested role as his party's
chief liaison with lobbyists, trade associations and business.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming the majority, House Republicans have aggressively
sought to make sure the corporate interests who benefit from their
agenda hire more Republicans and give them financial support and
lobbying help.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay has long had a kitchen cabinet of lobbyists who meet with
him regularly. Among those hashing out strategy are Paxon, who has
joined the Washington law firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &AMP; Feld,
Abramoff of the Preston, Gates &AMP; Ellis law firm, David Rehr of the
National Beer Wholesalers Association, and Dan Mattoon of Bell
South Corp.
</P>
<P>
   This year DeLay has used his role as liaison to the corporate
world to organize business groups into loose-standing coalitions
around particular issues. His office has relied on high-tech
companies, for example, to build support for legislation shielding
business from lawsuits resulting from Year 2000 computer problems.
When he was fearful that a bill alloting funds for the U.S.
military operation in Yugoslavia would not pass, he enlisted the
lobbying might of defense contractors.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbyists report back with details of whom they contacted.
Aides to DeLay say that the lobbyists get nothing specific in
return though one DeLay loyalist acknowledged, ``We do know who
produces votes. Guys who do well see more favor in our eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay has sought to convince lobbying firms and trade
associations to install more Republicans in their executive
positions. He was warned by the House Ethics Committee after he
tried to persuade a lobbying group not to hire a Democrat as its
president.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay does not insist that every Republican back the
leadership's legislative goals on every vote. And he loses some,
such as the recent defeat of a managed health care bill favored by
the Republican leadership over a more stringent version. Instead,
he demands a signal of how each member will vote _ yes, leaning
yes, no, leaning no _ and he expects no surprises.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing moments of a recent vote on the spending bill for
foreign operations, DeLay signaled to two lawmakers sitting behind
him. Aides said the motion had a meaning: He was letting his
colleagues know he had enough votes to pass the bill without their
votes, and that they could vote no.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are members who on any given issue, because of their
districts or their own particular circumstances, can't vote for a
particular thing,'' said Doolittle. ``He knows who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   (STORY ENDS HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   FROM HUNTS IN THE SHIRES TO THE HALLS OF CONGRESS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The term ``whip'' was first used in the British Parliament and
was derived from the fox hunt, where a person called the whipper-in
kept hounds in a pack.
</P>
<P>
   The majority whip is the third-ranking member of the House
leadership, responsible for knowing the whereabouts of party
members, knowing how they will vote on specific issues and lobbying
them to support the party position. Through weekly floor notices,
the whip keeps party members up to date on the floor schedule and
when to expect important votes.
</P>
<P>
   The party in a minority in the House also elects a whip.

MIXING HISPANIC AND YANKEE PRIDE NEAR THE BALL PARK 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By AMY WALDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Maria Infante is Dominican by parentage, but she has
little affinity for the baseball heroes with whom she shares a
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate Pedro,'' Ms. Infante said with a 16-year-old's ruthless
absolutism, referring to the Boston Red Sox pitcher, who is
scheduled to start Saturday's playoff game against the Yankees in
Boston. ``I hate Sosa. I hate all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter, however, is a different story. ``I luuuuuuv him,''
she said, lingering on the word as if it were Jeter himself.
</P>
<P>
   On her block in the Highbridge section of the Bronx, where
perhaps one in five residents is Dominican, only one kid likes
Pedro Martinez and the Red Sox, Ms. Infante said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks just because he's Dominican and they're Dominican
they're the best,'' she snorted.
</P>
<P>
   And so this week, at least, in this corner of the Bronx, just a
few blocks from the Yankees' ball park, neighborhood is apparently
trumping nationality. Not only is the Yankee logo everywhere _ on
hats, T-shirts, jackets _ but a new version featuring Chinese
letters is in vogue, too.
</P>
<P>
   But for Hispanic baseball fans across the city, allegiances are
less automatic, for the success of Hispanic players, from Sammy
Sosa to Manny Ramirez to El Duque, has given rise to all sorts of
divided loyalties. And the sorting out of those interests has only
become more intricate this October.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is arguably the finest Dominican pitcher since Juan
Marichal, and many Dominicans this season turned out to cheer him
loudly at Yankee Stadium. The Mets, meanwhile, have more Dominican
stars _ Armando Benitez and Octavio Dotel _ than the Yankees. Oh,
and then there was the problem of how to feel about Ramirez, the
Washington Heights prodigy who drove in more runs for the Cleveland
Indians than anyone in baseball this year. Sadly _ or mercifully,
perhaps _ for Ramirez fans, the Indians were eliminated last Monday
by the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, then, Miguel Rodriguez's anguish was real this
week in Highbridge. ``I want Ramon Martinez to get a victory,''
Rodriguez, a 40-year-old train operator for New York City Transit,
said before Thursday night's game, referring to Pedro's brother,
who also pitches for the Boston. ``I would like my Dominican
brothers to win. But not against the Yankees.'' Ramon, it turned
out, took the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Rady Torres, who owns the Palacio social club at Woodycrest
Avenue and West 165th Street, said he is a Mets fan, and has been
since he arrived from Puerto Rico in 1969 and spent a summer with
his aunt and uncle watching the Mets on television. But Torres is
not a stupid man: his club, where the two televisions have gotten a
workout this week, has Yankees pictures on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' latest ascent to dominance seems all the more sweet
here because it mirrors the arc of the neighborhood, where gunfire
once underlay drug dealers' transactions like a bass line. Fortunes
have not changed so much that anyone around here has the cash for a
ticket to a playoff game, but now, children of all ages can at
least play in the streets _ throwing a baseball, teasing each other
_ without fear.
</P>
<P>
   There are just-built multifamily homes and a few new businesses.
Optimism is in the air, and its soundtrack is the cheering from the
stadium down the street.
</P>
<P>
   Proximity also creates a certain willingness to forgive. Yes,
Carlos Melo, 32, who works at the bodega at the corner of
Woodycrest and West 165th, conceded, the Yankees have few Hispanics
on their team. Yes, he said, he likes Pedro Martinez. But, he said,
``Boston does not play among us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, most Hispanics here seem to separate the players
from the teams. ``I luuuuuv Pedro and Ramon,'' Glauco Vidal said,
sounding like a certain neighborhood girl. ``But I do not like
Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does he like the Yankees, however. Vidal, a Mets fan, is
careful not to display that fact in his new travel agency and phone
center, which is down West 165th Street from the social club. His
opinions, he said, were formed in the 1980s, when the Yankees, it
seemed to him, did not value the neighborhood's legions of baseball
fans and were always talking of relocating. Now, with attendance
soaring, the question of the Yankees leaving the Bronx has all but
evaporated. Still, Vidal has not forgiven them.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone around here, Vidal lives so close to the stadium
that, if he cannot hear the crack of the bat, he can hear the crowd
responding to it. On Wednesday night, watching sheets of rain fall,
he turned off his television set, certain the game was being
suspended. A few minutes later, he heard a great roar a few blocks
away, and turned on the television to see Bernie Williams circling
the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Caban, 16, predicted Wednesday that Williams would win
the game, and Thursday he was back on the street to gloat. He is
Puerto Rican, he said, and has little interest in the Dominican
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shut up with Pedro Martinez,'' he said when a brave
13-year-old piped up that the pitcher would lead Boston to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Most, but certainly not all, Puerto Ricans in the neighborhood
expressed similar sentiments: disinterest in Dominican players and
passion for the Yankees. If anything, Boston's defeat of Cleveland,
where Sandy Alomar, a Puerto Rican, plays, made the team even more
unpopular here.
</P>
<P>
   In this neighborhood, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans and Cubans and
other Hispanic immigrants live together, which further complicates
_ and sometimes confuses _ the question of loyalties. Consider
12-year-old Junior Gamoneda, who is half-Dominican, with the rest a
mix of Honduran, North American and Puerto Rican _ and a 100
percent Yankees fan.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Rosario, 29 and Puerto Rican, also loves the Yankees; her
husband, who is Dominican, ``likes Pedro,'' she said distastefully,
adding, ``Everybody Dominican likes Pedro.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Angel Diaz, who on Thursday was wearing a hat
that said Puerto Rico and a sweatshirt that championed the Mets. As
it turns out, he is Cuban and a Yankees fan. He makes and sells the
hats in a tiny workshop on West 165th Street, and he had grabbed
the sweatshirt to combat the cold.
</P>
<P>
   Big mistake: he might as well have worn red in a Crips
neighborhood. After more than a few ominous-sounding ``hey, are you
crazy?'' remarks from passers-by, he said, he was going home to
change. A few minutes later, he re-emerged, a plain gray sweatshirt
on his back and a Yankees ski cap on his head.

EDITORIAL: DOCTORS TAKING CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Oct. 16:
</P>
<P>
   The growth of managed-care health plans since the mid-1990s
brought the explosive rise of health-care costs to at least a
temporary halt. But cost control antagonized both physicians and
patients. Physicians choked on constraints that insurance companies
slapped on their income and professional autonomy. Patients
complained that denials by HMOs of treatments recommended by
physicians amounted to profit-driven betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   But now comes evidence that managed-care systems are bending to
satisfy both patients and doctors with modifications in at least
one key area, the payment of the physicians. The modifications have
come from some of the more venturesome Independent Practice
Associations, known as IPAs, which are groups of doctors that sign
contracts with HMOs to treat enrollees. In many Western states such
groups treat most of the enrollees in HMOs, and they are growing
everywhere else, including New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The physicians who join such an association remain in solo or
small-group practice and are in charge of running their own
offices. Insurance companies like Aetna pay the IPAs a fixed fee to
treat each enrollee who chooses a primary-care physician from the
IPA. The IPA, in turn, pays its physicians and performs tasks like
processing claims.
</P>
<P>
   An IPA controls costs by monitoring its physicians' practices
and denying requests for unnecessary procedures. But in this case,
physicians are told no by members of their physician group, not a
nurse or medical director from a faraway insurance company. IPAs,
then, can reduce intrusive interference by insurance companies, the
source of much antagonism of patients and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The best IPAs also oversee quality. For example, specialists at
a San Francisco Bay Area association meet regularly to develop ways
to treat patients and intervene when physicians fail to uphold
agreed-upon standards.
</P>
<P>
   Some IPAs have paid physicians a fee for every procedure they
provide, which motivates doctors to attend to the patients' every
need but does a poor job controlling costs. Others have paid a
fixed monthly rate per patient, a practice called capitation, which
creates an agonizing conflict of interest because the less doctors
do for their patients, the more income they keep. Neither pure
fee-for-service nor pure capitation works well.
</P>
<P>
   But now, according to an article by Prof. James C. Robinson of
the University of California at Berkeley in a recent issue of the
Journal of the American Medical Association, IPAs are developing
``blended'' methods that combine the best features of
fee-for-service and capitation. For example, a California IPA pays
primary-care physicians a fixed monthly rate per enrollee to cover
basic services. But it also pays them extra fees to cover services
that the IPA wants to encourage: mammograms, visits to patients in
nursing homes and office procedures, like screening for colon
cancer, that the primary-care physicians might otherwise refer to
an expensive specialist.
</P>
<P>
   When enrollees in Aetna or Cigna pick a primary-care physician,
they may not know they are joining an IPA. But the best IPAs,
Robinson points out, can offer the patient the ``feel of
fee-for-service,'' with physicians offering evening office hours
and procedures with less grumbling about second-guessing by
insurance bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   IPAs may not solve the nation's health-care problems. But
doctors, by this means or another, must take responsibility for
controlling costs, because they and their patients will surely
resist if anyone else tries. Markets are supposed to respond to
consumer complaints. Robinson's study shows the process is
gathering momentum.

EDITORIAL: THE PEACE PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times Said in an editorial for Saturday, Oct. 16:
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 dozens of humanitarian organizations were working to
feed, house and care for the health of Rwandan refugees in camps
just over the border in Zaire. The camps were full of fleeing
Rwandan Hutus _ and, it gradually became apparent, full of Hutu
soldiers guilty of genocide, who were directing food and other aid
to their own troops. A large portion of food was going not to needy
innocents, but to support the reorganization of a genocidal army.
</P>
<P>
   Medecins Sans Frontieres, which was treating cholera in the
camps, was the first group to decide to pull out in protest. It
left the Zaire camps with a very public warning about the
manipulation of aid. The controversial decision prodded the United
Nations to improve its control over food.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which in America is called Doctors Without Borders,
won the Nobel Peace Prize Friday. The prize was principally a
recognition of the group's humanitarian mission, but its political
dexterity is also a noteworthy part of its story. The organization
was founded in a simpler time, before post-Cold War chaos
complicated the politics of humanitarian relief. In 1971 a group of
French doctors who had worked in the Biafran war _ including
Bernard Kouchner, now running the U.N. mission in Kosovo _
organized Doctors Without Borders. The doctors felt that aid
organizations were too slow to bring medical relief and suffered
from restrictions that kept them from denouncing abuses. The
group's first humanitarian effort was to treat earthquake victims
in Nicaragua the next year. It now sends about 2,000 people a year
to provide rapid medical care to refugees from countless wars and
victims of natural disasters, famine and diseases such as
meningitis in Nigeria, AIDS in Thailand and tuberculosis in Eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The group acquired a reputation for agility in both bringing
help and attracting publicity. But this outspokenness has made it a
leader among humanitarian groups in wrestling with the new politics
of aid. In 1985 it criticized Ethiopia's mass expulsions of people
from the north of the country, where rebels were active. The group
was run out of Ethiopia, but its warning helped limit the
expulsions.
</P>
<P>
   Today, these dilemmas are worldwide. Humanitarian groups must
worry about how aid is used by the very people who caused the
crisis. Warlords deliberately starve a region, and then steal the
food aid and the vehicles it arrives in. Governments engage in
widespread ethnic cleansing, knowing that aid organizations will
care for the refugees, thus hurrying their exodus.
</P>
<P>
   The award to Doctors Without Borders echoes the first Nobel
Peace Prize of the century, which was given to the founder of the
Red Cross. The doctors' group is a far blander choice than some
other nominees for the prize, such as Chinese dissidents. But more
than most humanitarian groups, Doctors Without Borders has
understood that aid today is as fraught with ethical and political
controversies as the rest of the world's decisions regarding war
and peace, life and death.

BISHOPS AND EDUCATORS NEAR ANOTHER ROUND ON RELIGIOUS LOYALTY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy)   By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the first three months of this year, newspapers in
Boston, Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Washington and
other major cities ran prominent articles with headlines like
``Catholic Colleges See Peril in Vatican Push for Control'' or
``Catholic Campuses Face Showdown on Ties to Church.''
</P>
<P>
   As so often happens, the story then sank from sight. Now it is
back. And it is part of a larger story that stretches far beyond
the 200-plus Roman Catholic campuses to many other religiously
affiliated colleges and universities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The steady secularization of American higher education over the
last hundred years has often been viewed as a virtually
irresistible trend. Catholic leaders, both educators and bishops,
have nonetheless declared themselves determined to resist
secularization, but they are divided about how to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Among many colleges with ties to Protestant denominations or
other religious groups, there is also a renewed desire to retain
some distinctive religious character, either in the name of a
religious form of multiculturalism or as a crucial resource for the
survival of particular traditions. But here, too, opinions clash
about how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   What caused the spate of news articles last spring was a draft
document spelling out how Pope John Paul II's 1990 statement on
Catholic higher education, ``Ex Corde Ecclesiae'' (``From the Heart
of the Church''), should be applied in the United States. The
draft, in turn, was a revision of a 1996 document in which American
Catholic bishops emphasized communication and trust between
educators and church leaders as the chief way to maintain a
distinctive Catholic character in the education, research efforts
and campus life at Catholic colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 approach won overwhelming support among the bishops.
But Rome found it, well, whatever would be the polite Latin
equivalent of mealy-mouthed. The Vatican wanted some hard-and-fast
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   So last year's draft insisted, among other things, that a
majority of faculty members and trustees at Catholic colleges and
universities should be ``faithful Catholics,'' that the presidents
of these institutions take a special oath of fidelity and that
Catholics teaching theology obtain a ``mandate'' from the local
bishop indicating they are Catholics in good standing and are
presenting church doctrines as authoritatively interpreted.
</P>
<P>
   Would such requirements threaten academic freedom, undermine the
credibility of Catholic scholarship, hobble the drive toward
academic excellence that has marked many Catholic campuses over the
last decades, run afoul anti-discrimination laws and perhaps
endanger federal and state financial aid?
</P>
<P>
   Many Catholic educators, whose institutions are generally not
under the direct control of the bishops but of independent boards
of directors, said yes. A minority said no, arguing in particular
that fears of legal entanglements or the loss of government aid
were hypothetical problems never tested in the courts. A few simply
pointed to the loophole phrases in the draft, like ``as much as
possible'' and ``to the extent possible,'' as clues that once these
requirements were on the books, no one would take them too
literally.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops themselves said almost nothing, waiting for a
further revision of the draft. Now they have it. In September, the
administrative board of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops
decided that when the conference meets in November, a major item on
its agenda will be a revised version of last year's draft.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a year of discussions with worried educators, most of
the revisions appear cosmetic, saying the same thing but in what
the drafters term ``a clearly pastoral tone.''
</P>
<P>
   The revised draft insists, for example, that the requirement
that faculty members respect Catholic doctrine does not mean that
``a Catholic university's task is to indoctrinate or proselytize
its students.''
</P>
<P>
   In a commentary accompanying the new version, the drafters point
to language about ``academic freedom and integrity'' and ``respect
for religious liberty and freedom of conscience'' and ``observance
of federal and state law, regulations and procedures in hiring.''
</P>
<P>
   These references, they say, are ``specifically aimed at
protecting not only governmental assistance to students but also
the federal and state entitlements and benefits that Catholic
colleges and universities enjoy as significant participants in U.S.
higher education.''
</P>
<P>
   Other changes may make the new version more palatable to a wider
academic audience and to a public that sometimes equates any
religious language with blind fervor. Instead of calling for
``faithful'' Catholics on the faculties and boards of trustees, an
adjective that appeared to invite subjective judgments, the
document now speaks of Catholics ``committed to the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of calling on Catholic institutions to be instruments of
``evangelization,'' which, for many people, has overtones of
proselytizing, the new version speaks of contributing to ``the
mission of communicating Gospel values.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of calling on presidents of Catholic colleges and
universities to take an ``oath of fidelity,'' a phrase with unhappy
echoes of loyalty oaths, the new version requires each new
president to ``express his or her commitment to the university's
Catholic identity and to the Catholic faith in accordance with
canon 833'' (which in fact specifies the oath of fidelity).
</P>
<P>
   Instead of using the English ``mandate,'' with its suggestion of
command or injunction, the new version uses the original Latin
``mandatum'' as technical and not so ``easily misconstrued.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems doubtful that these minor revisions will relieve the
anxieties provoked by the draft discussed last year. Some bishops
have gone on record against taking any action in November, although
they are under pressure from the Vatican to do so. They fear that a
confrontation with Catholic educators will initiate an extended
period of squabbling, even litigation, and will undercut the many
efforts to reassert the religious identity of Catholic colleges and
universities that the pope's letter has already encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   Other bishops believe that nothing but a set of unambiguous
stipulations will hold back the tide of secularization. Who is
right?
</P>
<P>
   In the history of American higher education, secularization has
sometimes been abetted by an abdication or failure of nerve by the
religious authorities. At other times, strong efforts to assert
church control have actually reinforced the drive toward
secularization.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever the outcome at the bishops' meeting in November, it
will have an impact well beyond the campuses of Catholic colleges
and universities.

IN FOR THE LONG HAUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A man who sort of looks like me predicted the Red Sox would
sweep the Yankees in the American League Championship Series. What
nerve. If this weren't such a compelling series, I would use this
space to talk a little trash about the man. But for now, let's just
say he was joking.
</P>
<P>
   Really, the last thing anyone should be thinking about Saturday
morning is a sweep or short series. The Yankees are not going to
sweep the Sox. And they won't win in five games. All I can tell you
is that you should keep Thursday night open because that's when the
final Sox-Yankees game of the 20th century will take place in
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Please do not take that as a prediction. It's obvious, isn't it?
These teams have played two one-run games, with the Yankees winning
both. The New Yorkers received breaks and bounces that can't
possibly continue for the next couple games. The Sox will win three
of the next four to force a seventh game in the Bronx. I didn't
even have to consult with my insightful alter ego, the Holley Lama,
to come to that conclusion. All I had to do was watch the first 19
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, most Sox fans have missed the beauty of these
games. The first one was tainted by umpire Rick Reed, who watched
Chuck Knoblauch drop a ball in the 10th inning and determined,
strangely, that it wasn't a dropped ball. (Yo, Rick. Have you been
following Knoblauch's woes this year? The second baseman handles
the ball as if he were at war with the thing. Of course he dropped
it.) In the second game, 13 stranded runners and two balls that
just missed leaving the park had fans complaining about managerial
strategy and players who do not know how to move runners over so
they can come home.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that if baseball had more games like these,
baseball would have no problems. You want to know how good these
games have been? So good that I wouldn't be surprised if Reggie
Jefferson called Mo Vaughn Friday night and said, ``Have you been
watching this Sox-Yankees series? This is how the game is supposed
to be played, man. You gonna watch today?''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon at Fenway Park, Pedro Martinez and Roger
Clemens will oppose each other. Arguments have gone deep into the
night over matchups like this, mostly because they rarely happen.
Boxing fans would have loved to have seen Rocky Marciano face Larry
Holmes. Fans of irreverent comics dream of Chris Rock matching
monologues with Lenny Bruce. Jazz fans would pay thousands to see a
Billie Holliday-Cassandra Wilson marquee. But those performers are
eras and generations apart.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the case with the 27-year-old Martinez and
37-year-old Clemens. The hype of their Game 3 paceoff is justified.
But the two men already have tough acts to follow. That's how good
the series has been. Even those involved have a difficult time
explaining the intensity that will be splayed over the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the regular season you play a close game and people
say, `That game had a playoff atmosphere,' '' Sox first baseman
Mike Stanley said Friday. He shook his head. ``That's not true.
There is nothing you can compare this to.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time in Stanley's career that he has made it
to a championship series. He said he always wanted to make it here,
but he acknowledges he had no idea it would be like this. At this
level of the playoffs, you can walk by anyone in the afternoon _ a
manager, player, reporter, league official _ and they all look like
they have spent eight hours dancing at a club. Ask someone how they
are doing and they are likely to reply, ``Dehydrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, it would have been an acceptable answer from either Joe
Torre or Jimy Williams. The point-counterpoint the two managers
displayed in the eighth inning of Game 2 was even exhausting to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it is fun when it works to your benefit,'' Torre said.
``I mean, it is something that if I am in his dugout, I do the same
things he did. And if he is in my dugout, he probably does the same
things I do.''
</P>
<P>
   It's like Torre and Williams had a Jenga game going. You know,
when you put a piece of wood on top of another until your towering
creation finally topples.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have teams like we have, you don't pay much attention
to what is going on in the first six innings, because down toward
the end is where you have to save your moves and really see if, you
know, see if you can match up,'' Torre said. ``Matchups and knowing
what matchup you want . . . a lot of times it is just a matter of
who gets the first move, which dictates other things.''
</P>
<P>
   After the moves are complete and games finished, the natural
thing to do is review them all. That's when fans in most cities _
Atlanta being the exception _ raise their games to match the
passion of the playoffs. It's when everyone becomes an expert. It's
when there is a lot of questioning and doubt attached to every
move.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, that meant wondering why Butch Huskey pinch-hit for
Trot Nixon in the eighth inning of Game 2. In the ninth, that left
the overmatched Damon Buford trying to hit Mariano Rivera's cutter,
which sometimes reaches the high 90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that people are that into it,'' Sox catcher Jason
Varitek said with a laugh, ``but we already get the second-guessing
in the regular season.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Sox were home, a final-day Ryder Cup-type of
crowd guided them through a 23-7 win over the Indians. Every strike
was cheered. There were boos on balls. There was cheering on foul
balls.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the Ryder Cup crowd will merge with the Big Event
crowd. They will see the best contemporary pitcher, a man who won
Cy Young Awards in both leagues, challenge a five-time Cy winner
who was the most dominant pitcher in the game for most of the 1980s
and two seasons in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is gonna be a hell of an experience,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   He's right. He could make the same statement about the series.
The seven-game series. So don't call me on Thursday, OK? I'll be in
the Bronx.
</P>

DONALD H. RIDDLE, 78; LED JOHN JAY COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (js) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donald H. Riddle, who as president of the John Jay College of
Criminal Justice changed the institution's curriculum to produce
``educated cops,'' died on Monday at an assisted-care center in
Newtown, Pa. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   He had lived in Newtown and died after a long illness, said
Richard H. Ward, a close friend and former colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Before Riddle's presidency, from 1968 to 1975, law enforcement
officers were commonly trained as gun-toting security men without
much exposure to critical and analytical thinking. Riddle changed
that at John Jay College (a branch of the City University of New
York) by introducing required courses in language and the
humanities.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people asked President Riddle how to educate the police,
he famously replied, `Like everybody else,' '' said Gerald W.
Lynch, the current president of John Jay College, who worked with
Riddle.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, Riddle also gained national attention when he
stood up to J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the FBI, on a matter
of academic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1970, Riddle learned that 15 members of the student
body had suddenly resigned. All were members of the FBI on leave to
study criminal justice at the college. One of the students showed
him a form letter he and the others had received from FBI
headquarters in Washington instructing them to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   When Riddle called the New York office of the FBI to seek an
explanation, he later reported, he was told that Hoover had decided
no agents would be permitted to attend John Jay College as long as
Prof. Abraham S. Blumberg continued to teach at the institution.
</P>
<P>
   Blumberg had voiced some fairly mild criticism of Hoover the
previous July, saying that there was a ``cult of personality'' at
the agency and that it had been ``a bit slow in civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of Blumberg's remarks had reached Hoover.
</P>
<P>
   Riddle recounted later: ``They said they were not trying to
force me to fire the professor, but they just wanted me to know
Hoover's feelings. I told them the professor was staying.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumberg said the FBI's action had a ``chilling effect on free
discussion at the college.''
</P>
<P>
   Riddle later said: ``It's terribly naive of the FBI to think it
can send their agents to any college in America and not find
someone who is critical of the bureau.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not until after the death of Hoover, college officials
say, that FBI agents began appearing again in the student body.
</P>
<P>
   Riddle had been in conflict with Hoover previously, when as dean
of the faculty of John Jay he appointed Hans J. Morgenthau, the
University of Chicago political scientist who was a leading critic
of U.S. policy in Vietnam, to a new professorship.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting on Dec. 18, 1967, at which the New York City Board
of Higher Education approved the Morgenthau appointment, the board
also elevated Riddle to the post of acting president of the college
to fill the vacancy created by the death of Leonard Reisman.
</P>
<P>
   He became president of the college the next year and stayed
until 1975, when he accepted the post of chancellor of the
University of Illinois at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Riddle was born in Brooklyn and earned bachelor's and master's
degrees and a doctorate from Princeton University. He taught at
Princeton, Hamilton College and the Eagleton Institute of Politics
before joining John Jay College as dean of the faculty in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a daughter, Susan, of Trenton, and a sister,
Betty Carhart, of West Long Branch, N.J.

CLEMENS WILL GET A `SPECIAL' FENWAY WELCOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time _ when he was younger and thinner and we knew
so much less about him _ when Roger Clemens was the most popular
Red Sox player. He was all fire and fuzzy cheeks, and it seemed he
never lost. Young Roger was compared to young Larry Bird.
</P>
<P>
   That was before he came out of Game 6 in '86, before his spring
training walkout in '87, before the ``we've got to carry our own
bags'' interview. It was before Velvet Elvis, Possessed Rebel,
Terry Cooney, and the headphones incident in which he dissed Daddy
Butch Hobson. It was before his final four mediocre (by his
standards) Red Sox seasons and before he went to Toronto and
pitched with the rage of a man whose family had been terrorized.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens's local popularity waned steadily even as he was
establishing himself (side by side with Cy Young) as the winningest
pitcher in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   And then he committed the ultimate crime and took his game to
the New York Yankees. It was like having an ex-girlfriend move in
with your hated next door neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   This is why Clemens was booed when he was announced to the
Fenway crowd before the All-Star Game as one of the century's top
100 players. And this is why he's going to hear it again Saturday
after 4 p.m. when he tries to beat Pedro Martinez and the Red Sox
in the third game of the American League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever that is, whatever that does, I don't know,'' Clemens
said Friday. ``I've got plenty of people who appreciate what I was
able to do in my 13 years here, and that is never going to change.
You can't make people not boo you or like you if they don't and you
want them to come and get it out and let it out. That's what the
Boston-New York situation is supposed to be. I don't think as far
as hate and nasty towards one another is really there, like when
Zim (Yankees bench coach Don Zimmer) tells us some of the stories.
But they get better each year, too, as it goes by.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was relaxed and uncommonly anecdotal when he met with
the media Friday. Sounding like a regular Roger Waldo Emerson, he
spoke lovingly of his old Mass. Pike commute from Framingham, and
the blazing colors of autumn in New England. He didn't disown the
obvious, as he had in other return trips to Fenway. He appeared to
be in the moment, just like everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's joust is the most wildly anticipated Fenway game
since the 1978 one-game playoff between the Red Sox and Yankees,
and Clemens acknowledged, ``This is not business as usual. I'll be
as excited as everyone else tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a stunning comment from a man who's constantly downplayed
what his presense in a Yankee uniform means to Red Sox fans.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is 3-1 against the Sox since Dan Duquette said he was in
the twilight of his career. Sox fans think they've got the goods on
the Rocket Saturday because Pedro is pitching and we all remember
his 17-strikeout, one-hitter in Yankee Stadium last month.
Moreover, Red Sox Nation thinks Roger will spit the bit because
it's postseason ball.
</P>
<P>
   When he wore a Red Sox uniform, Clemens started nine playoff
games and won only once. That stat is somewhat unfair because he
pitched well in many of those games and his bullpen blew leads. His
World Series ERA is 3.18, and his ALCS mark is 4.10. He won the
seventh game of the ALCS for Boston in 1986 (he also pitched seven
shutout innings in New York's Division Series clincher against
Texas). The Sox have lost 10 straight ALCS games since Clemens's
victory over the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   But image means a lot, and New Englanders see Clemens in the
playoffs and think of Bo Schembechler at the Rose Bowl or Shaquille
O'Neal at the foul line. Red Sox fans remember when Dave Stewart
played Bill Russell to Clemens's Wilt Chamberlain. The Rocket could
not beat Oakland's ace when it mattered, and there are those who
believe Clemens intentionally got himself tossed out of their final
playoff match at Oakland in 1990 _ just to avoid the embarrassment
of another futile effort against Mr. Death Stare.
</P>
<P>
   And of course there is the nasty spitting contest between
Clemens and ex-manager John McNamara, who told the world that the
Rocket asked to come out of Game 6 in '86 _ a statement Clemens
angrily denies. No Warren Commission could possibly unearth
everything that actually happened that fateful night at Shea
Stadium, but Mac's version of events was harmful to Clemens's local
repuation.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the history Roger lugs to the Fenway mound Saturday. He
can fool folks in Texas, Toronto, and New York, but he can't fool
Bostonians. He was here too long. These fans know him as a flawed
pitcher in October. They also know that he dislikes New York and
went there only for the money and the chance for a ring. We know
that Saturday's game could stand as the defining moment of a Hall
of Fame career that's already seen five Cy Young trophies and two
20-strikeout games.
</P>
<P>
   No excuse will work if things don't go Clemens's way Saturday.
Pedro can come out with an injury and nobody will peep, but the
Rocket exhausted the patience of Sox fans while he was here, and
thousands can't wait to see the Red Sox benefit from a continuation
of his playoff woes. There can be no excuses. Clemens has emptied
the auxiliary tanks of fan tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if Clemens sticks it to the home team, look
out below. Fragile New England sports fans are emotionally
incapable of coping with a series sweep set up on the strengh of a
Clemens Game 3 shutout. It would be Babe Ruth, Sparky Lyle, and
Wade Boggs all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody got an extra ticket?

EDITORIAL: PATAKI'S FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Oct. 16:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki has become the perfect leader to reform New
York's cozy relationship between those who make policy and those
who donate money in order to influence policy. The reason is that
Pataki knows this coziness all too well. He has been nestling into
New York state's comfortable system for some time now, and although
he and his aides have insisted that he follows the letter of the
law, that letter all too often looks like a D- on fund-raising and
government ethics.
</P>
<P>
   A promising politician like Pataki who wants to make his mark in
the national arena needs to do better than conform to the loose
ethical standards imposed by New York state. Thus when he announced
the skeleton of a campaign finance plan in June, there was some
reason to hope that he would lead a new spirit of reform in Albany.
This hope survives despite the fact that the governor's proposal
came just a few hours before the end of the legislative session and
brought snickers from other legislators who presumed by its very
lateness that the governor wanted plenty of credit but little real
change in the system.
</P>
<P>
   The time for real change is while Pataki still serves in the
state Capitol. As it is now, the shadows on his administration's
fund-raising practices grow longer each season. Questions began
soon after he was elected and established an inauguration and
transition fund in 1994, a secret $2.5 million fund-raising
operation that was finally made public by a judge two years later.
Federal investigators are looking at whether the Pataki
administration has influenced the state parole board to go easier
on relatives of the governor's financial supporters. Those who give
thousands to campaign funds controlled by the governor can and do
expect to win state contracts. Silverite Construction Co., for
example, gave thousands of dollars to state Republican funds
controlled by Pataki and won a $97 million state contract for work
on the Queens-Midtown Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the Pataki family's combined vacation and
business trips to Hungary in 1995 and 1996, which the governor's
aides say were approved by the state's Ethics Commission. The trips
were sponsored by the Hungarian-American Chamber of Commerce,
U.S.A., but appear to have been financed by corporations such as
Pepsico and Philip Morris, which have important business interests
before the governor. Pataki's spokesman says there was no way for
these corporations to have undue influence on Pataki and his staff
because they did not know about donations that went directly to the
Hungarian group.
</P>
<P>
   The Hungarian organization, after paying the governor's fare,
received a free office at the World Trade Center, which is owned by
the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Pataki appointed a
longtime friend as the authority's executive director. The
governor's spokesman said Pataki had played no role in his friend's
decision to provide the office. Such distinctions may get the
governor off the hook in Albany, but they leave the strong
impression that his administration is up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has proposed significant restrictions on ways that state
politicians raise and spend money. Now his own reputation depends
on using his formidable clout in Albany to follow through. &QL;

 VIRAL OUTBREAK SHOWS TENSIONS BETWEEN N.Y. CITY AND STATE
AGENCIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first time city Health Department officials
learned that their state counterparts were investigating the city's
strange viral outbreak, the state was announcing that it had solved
the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed state health officials were not so convinced that New
Yorkers were falling ill from St. Louis encephalitis _ the
diagnosis by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
_ so they turned to a scientist with a cutting-edge lab in
California for help. But they never told city health officials or
the CDC in Atlanta of their suspicions, or that they had enlisted
the California lab to take a peek.
</P>
<P>
   The oversight did not have any practical effect on how the city
responded to the outbreak, which began in August, killing six
people and sickening dozens. Scientists now believe it resulted
from a version of the West Nile virus, which is transmitted by
mosquitoes. But the state's actions were more than an aberration.
</P>
<P>
   The episode underscored ages-old tensions between the two
agencies, which sometimes resemble squabbling siblings rather than
coadjutant partners. Dr. Stephen Joseph, who was the city's health
commissioner from 1986 to 1990, summarized the relationship in a
phrase: ``porcupines making love.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The city guys feel like, `We are doing the work and taking the
hits, and the state sits up there and makes pronouncements without
getting their hands dirty,''' Joseph said. ``And the state feels
like, `Hey, we are sitting up here trying to run the world, and the
cowboys are down there in the city just running around.'''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph, who now runs a biotechnology and computing research
company in Santa Fe, N.M., lived through one of the most public
battles, which centered on a controversial proposal for intravenous
needle users during the height of the AIDS crisis. But over the
years, the tensions have varied from the petty (which agency will
hold a news conference and who will be invited) to the complex (how
to administer immunization programs).
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the two agencies have worked successfully in tandem
on some important public health emergencies, like a 1990s outbreak
of the AIDS virus that centered on one man who traveled the state
spreading sickness. But several factors, like the city's unusual
relationship with the federal government, its storied history in
the annals of public health, and the awkward divisions of
responsibilities between the two agencies, have contributed to the
tension.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the source of it goes back to 1866: the year the city
agency was founded but 35 years before its state counterpart was
even conceived. In part because of its early formation _ it is the
oldest city agency in the country _ the department has played a
huge national role in identifying illnesses, starting vital record
keeping and containing threats like a Russian cholera epidemic in
1892, according to ``A History of Public Health in New York City,''
by John Duffy.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike any other city health agencies in the nation, New
York's has its own set of vital records and its own health code,
and reports vital statistics directly to the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, its mandate is strikingly similar 100 years later:
it still pushes doctors to improve illness reporting, it still
worries about the local water supply, it still tries to keep
disease outbreaks at bay.
</P>
<P>
   But when the state Health Department greatly expanded in the
1970s, certain functions slowly were turned over to that agency.
Sometimes, there was duplication of services.
</P>
<P>
   Simple geography and vast population differences also divide the
two. They are three hours apart by car, but a world away
demographically. And each often reflect the wishes and agendas of
the presiding mayor and governor, who do not always see eye to eye.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Public health issues often evidence themselves in the city and
large urban areas first,'' said Maria Mitchell, the former chief
health policy adviser to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the state is often perturbed that the city does not readily
cooperate with or credit them for their role in city issues, former
officials said. And unlike anywhere in the country, both the city
and the state have world-class laboratories and disease experts
under their respective roofs, a boon for public health that can
create professional rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have always been some difficulties,'' said Dr. Mark
Chassin, who was the state health commissioner during the early
1990s and now heads the department of health policy at the Mount
Sinai School of Medicine in New York. ``There are inherent issues
of responsibility and turf, credit and coverage and blame and glory
that will always be there.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most difficult points in recent history occurred
during the tenures of Joseph and his state counterpart, Dr. David
Axelrod, during the administrations of Mayor Ed Koch and Gov. Mario
Cuomo. Both commissioners were very strong-willed, outspoken and
fierce proponents for their programs. Joseph said he always had
great respect for Axelrod, who died in 1994. But Joseph conceded
that the AIDS crisis, including his battle with the state, was one
of the most trying moments in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle between the two centered on Joseph's proposal to
distribute free needles to drug addicts, whose sharing of
contaminated needles had contributed to the spread of the disease.
Prosecutors and law enforcement officials hated the idea, as did
Axelrod, who made it very difficult for the city to start a pilot
project, which was ultimately scratched.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in the early 1990s, there was a tuberculosis outbreak in
the city. Directly observed therapy _ getting sick people to take
their medication in front of health care workers to insure that
they finished it _ was chosen. Who deserved the credit for carrying
out the plan still remains an issue for debate.
</P>
<P>
   Former city officials countered that the critical role was
played by the CDC, not by the state.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the city's relationship with the CDC that has often
put it at odds with Albany. For instance, New York City frequently
sends data to the CDC, bypassing the state, officials there
complained. ``It has been a longstanding battle for every
administration,'' said a former state official, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Former officials from both departments say that when the system
works, it really works, as was the case in tracking Nushawn
Williams, who infected at least 13 women around the state with the
virus that causes AIDS, and was sentenced to prison in April for
reckless endangerment and rape.
</P>
<P>
   But when the system fails, it can have serious consequences. A
study released last month by IPRO Inc., a nonprofit group that
studies the quality of health care, found that only 23.5 percent of
New York state residents 65 and older received a pneumococcal
vaccine in 1997; in the city, that rate averaged 14.7 percent, the
lowest rate in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Many health care experts concur that vaccine delivery is an area
in which the state and the city need to better coordinate their
respective areas of authority. ``In the early 1990s, there was a
measles epidemic, and it was obvious that kids were not
immunized,'' Chassin said. The state started an initiative to
increase immunization rates, he said, but ``the city was not able
to take the regulatory action that would make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   No great calamity befell any New Yorker because the state
decided not to tell the city what it was up to with the West Nile
investigation and its subsequent announcement that it was now
taking over, a month into the outbreak. But public confusion over
who is running the investigation and containment of a health care
crisis can create its own sort of hazards, health experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, health workers for the city and the state have been
on the phone daily, said Dr. Perry Smith, the epidemiologist in
charge of the investigation for the State Department of Health.
``It is critical that we keep each other informed,'' Smith said,
adding later, ``It is remarkable how well everyone has worked
together on this one.''

NOTE: THERE IS NO ATTENDANCE CHART WASHINGTON, Oct. 15 -- The
following chart shows how senators and representatives voted on key
bills and amendments within the last week. A ``Y'' means the member
voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the member voted against the
measure; a ``?'' means the member did not vote; and a ``P'' means
the member voted ``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: testban
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday rejected, 51 to 48, a bill to ratify the
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The treaty, which has been signed by 154
countries and ratified by 51, would prohibit nuclear weapons
testing in complying nations. Supporters said the treaty would stop
the proliferation of nuclear weapons worldwide. Opponents said the
treaty could not ensure that nations would not test their arsenals.
A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: farm
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 74 to 26, a $69.3 billion
agriculture spending bill that provides $8.7 billion in emergency
aid for farmers. Supporters said the bill would help farmers hurt
by historically low prices. Opponents said the bill does not
sufficiently compensate farmers whose crops were damaged by
droughts and hurricanes. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: Mccain
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 77 to 20, an amendment to
strengthen existing rules that require campaign contributions to be
reported. The amendment, attached to a larger campaign finance
reform bill, would also force electronic disclosure of
contributions within three months of an election. Supporters said
the amendment helps to make the fundraising process more
transparent. Opponents said the measure would create too much
paperwork in the political process. A ``yes'' vote favors the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: Defense
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 87 to 11, a $268 billion
defense spending bill that would offer a large pay raise to the
military, delay production of the Air Force's F-22 fighter jet, and
improve Pentagon operations. Supporters said the military deserved
higher wages. Opponents said the bill contained misleading gimmicks
intended to dodge the spending caps. A ``yes'' vote favors the
bill.

   The House on Wednesday approved, 372 to 55, a $268 billion
defense spending bill that would offer a large pay raise to the
military, delay production of the Air Force's F-22 fighter jet, and
improve Pentagon operations. Supporters said the military deserved
higher wages. Opponents said the bill contained misleading gimmicks
to dodge the spending caps. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: Trucks
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 415 to 5, a bill to create a
separate agency within the Transportation Department to reduce

U.S. TO LET NEW YORK HOSPITALS KEEP $1 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Pa., Hawaii, Kan., Mass., Minn., Tenn.)   (mk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration reversed itself Friday
and agreed to let New York hospitals keep $1 billion of Medicare
money that the federal government had been trying to get back.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's decision came one day after Hillary Rodham
Clinton, a likely candidate for the U.S. Senate from New York, said
the federal government should give more money to New York
hospitals. White House officials said that she had repeatedly
expressed her view that those hospitals, and other hospitals
serving poor people around the country, should receive more federal
money, but that she did not order the change.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they were abandoning their effort to
recoup the $1 billion, which was paid over the last 10 years to New
York hospitals serving large numbers of poor people. In recent
months, the federal government had asserted that the hospitals were
overpaid because they overstated the number of poor people they
served.
</P>
<P>
   Using a similar argument, federal officials had made such claims
against hospitals in seven other states. All those claims will now
be dropped. The government had already compelled hospitals in
Pennsylvania to repay $50 million to the federal treasury, and they
were trying to collect $200 million more.
</P>
<P>
   The decision will allow 38 hospitals in New Jersey to keep $288
million that they would otherwise have been required to pay back to
the federal government. An aide to Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,
said Medicare officials had been ``pretty intransigent'' until this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Horvath, a deputy assistant secretary at the federal
Department of Health and Human Services, acknowledged Friday that
it was unreasonable to make states repay such money because the
federal regulations on the subject were unclear. The $1 billion
represents more than 10 percent of what New York hospitals receive
from Medicare for in-patient care each year, government data show.
</P>
<P>
   The reversal follows months of intense lobbying by the senators
from New York, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Charles Schumer, and
Rep. Charles Rangel, dean of the state's congressional delegation.
All are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Berry, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton, said the first
lady had ``expressed her deep concerns about the impact'' of the
repayment demanded by the Medicare agency, the Health Care
Financing Administration. And Mrs. Clinton is ``very glad that the
problem has been addressed,'' Ms. Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White
House, said Mrs. Clinton had regularly conveyed her concern about
the financial problems of New York hospitals in general and
hospitals serving large numbers of poor people in particular.
</P>
<P>
   But, Jennings said, Mrs. Clinton did not directly order or
instruct anyone to make the decision announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny Mindel, the press secretary for New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, said, ``We are very satisfied that the federal government
has come to the same conclusion that the city has maintained for
quite some time.'' Ms. Mindel declined to comment on the timing of
the decision or to speculate on whether Mrs. Clinton's expected
Senate candidacy played a role.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Phil English and Sen. Rick Santorum, both Pennsylvania
Republicans, have for months been urging the administration to drop
its claims against hospitals in their state.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Hall, the press secretary for English, said he wrote to
the Medicare agency in October 1998 and had met with agency
officials several times since then.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Hall said Friday: ``We didn't get much of a response
until today. The reason it took so long is that bureaucrats at the
Health Care Financing Administration buried their head in the sand
and refused to change their policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan said he had twice raised the issue with the president
in the last 10 days. Schumer said he had raised it with Donna
Shalala, the secretary of Health and Human Services, and with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Federal health officials said they first became aware of the
problem in Pennsylvania and initially believed that no other states
were affected. But, they said, further investigation revealed
similar problems in New York and at least six other states: Hawaii,
Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary estimates by the Greater New York Hospital
Association suggest that Friday's decision will be worth $4.3
million to Saint Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan, $13.6 million to
Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan, $6.6 million to Mount
Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan and $6.3 million to Montefiore
Medical Center in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare finances health care for 39 million people who are
elderly or disabled, including 2.7 million in New York state and
1.2 million in New Jersey. Medicare routinely covers hospital care
for beneficiaries, and the federal Medicare law guarantees extra
payments to hospitals that serve ``a disproportionate number of
low-income patients with special needs.'' The law refers to these
institutions as ``disproportionate share hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing Friday before the House Ways and Means Committee, Ms.
Horvath said: ``Our policy guidance on how to calculate Medicare
disproportionate share payments was not clear. We have decided that
the guidance needs clarification.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Horvath said the federal government would drop all its
claims to money paid before Jan. 1, 2000. But after that, she said,
the administration will insist on its interpretation of the law,
which could cost New York hospitals $160 million a year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The technical issue at the heart of the dispute is whether
people on welfare programs financed entirely by the states _ home
relief and general assistance programs _ should be counted as
indigent when the government computes Medicare payments to
``disproportionate share hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals in New York and New Jersey have counted such welfare
recipients, many of whom are childless adults. But the federal
government says they should not be counted.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel said: ``We are very grateful that the administration has
decided not to go back and seek recoupment for claims made
honestly, based on real need. To extract a billion dollars from New
York hospitals would have been a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer welcomed Friday's announcement as ``a first step in
preventing the devastation of teaching hospitals and inner-city
hospitals.'' But, he said, more needs to be done by the federal
government to repair damage done by the 1997 law and to forestall
the administration's policy on ``disproportionate share hospitals''
after Jan. 1.

FOX THE FIRST TO FILL KOBE'S ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Lakers are staying home for the weekend, and
coach Phil Jackson said it's just as well. No makeup game in Little
Rock, Ark., means more practice time _ and more time to find a
replacement for injured Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Little Rock have discovered more cracks in the new
Alltel Arena, canceling plans to reschedule an exhibition game
there. Instead the Lakers will practice today and possibly twice
Sunday in preparation for Tuesday's game against Golden State in
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   And who will start at shooting guard?
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask me that question,'' Jackson said. ``I won't answer
it.''
</P>
<P>
   With Ron Harper not yet in shape, Rick Fox is the likely
temporary replacement for Bryant, out six weeks because of a broken
hand. But Jackson has more general concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fortunate'' not to return to Little Rock, he said,
``because we're just not ready as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper, now a key component, practiced for just the second time
and was pulled off the court 20 minutes earlier than his teammates
because Jackson is concerned about his conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to be careful with him right now,'' he said. ``I
want to see Ron get in shape. If he gets in some kind of shape,
then we can cover our butts (at shooting guard) for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Awaiting the call: Fox, a starting small forward for most of his
pro career, welcomes the chance to start at off-guard Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think six years of starting in this league gave me enough
experience to step back in there and fill the void of Kobe,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``one of us, especially myself or Harp or the other guys who
have eight years and above are going to fill his youthful legs and
his explosiveness. I'd like to think that we can think the game as
well or even maybe better with the years of experience we have. You
fill the void by committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimming down: The loss of Bryant and Travis Knight (ankle, 3-4
weeks) might simplify the Lakers' roster reduction efforts.
</P>
<P>
   If both are placed on the injured list, Jackson will have to
waive just five players to get down to the maximum 12. The likely
five are free-agent pickups Andy Panko, Donald Williams, Gerald
Jordan and Stephen Smith, plus second-round draft choice John
Celestand.
</P>
<P>
   In that scenario, aging big men Benoit Benjamin and John Salley
both make the opening-day roster. Benjamin seems to have cemented a
position as Shaquille O'Neal's primary backup. Salley is needed to
provide depth at power forward, especially in Knight's absence.
</P>
<P>
   Psychology 101: Jackson had an interesting response when
addressing the challenge of getting his players to focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all autistic in some form or fashion _ I don't mean to
say that as a snide remark toward a certain population in our
society _ but they have a limitation of their attention span, a lot
of it probably due to too much rap music going in their ears and
coming out of their being. So they need to get a focal point that
lasts longer than a TV commercial or one short, 15-second span.''

   His team's season was down to a death rattle, his back was in
slightly worse shape, his vintage stuff was a dusty memory, and his
durability was a piece of Waterford crystal spinning on the edge of
a shelf.
</P>
<P>
   And he betrayed none of this, not the slightest awareness of
these mortal curses, not a clue that this madhouse of misery was
about to collapse on top of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not an ounce of pressure on his face,'' said Red Sox pitching
coach Joe Kerrigan. ``Not an ounce of pressure in his body. He was
just having fun out there.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Pedro Martinez crossed the threshold Monday night,
leaving behind the realm of mere master and entering the rarefied
zone of mythic figure.
</P>
<P>
   With his playoff salvage mission in Cleveland _ in which he
eliminated the Indians and rescued the Red Sox with six implausible
innings of no-hit relief at a time when he more belonged in
traction than on the mound at hostile Jacobs Field _ Martinez
gained a place in the pantheon. It's one his opponent Saturday,
Roger Clemens, never achieved despite 13 years of statistical
marvels in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   That is what a postseason crucible can do for you. Or to you.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens's Boston legacy has a huge void. He is defined as much
by what he didn't do here as by what he did. Even his most fabled
season _ that 24-4 epic in 1986 _ became a textbook case of
heartbreak. True, he won Game 7 of the American League Championship
Series against the Angels, but the heroics of that enterprise
belonged to Dave Henderson. And he left the infamous Game 6 of the
World Series against the Mets _ under murky circumstances, no less:
was the decision his or manager John McNamara's? _ thus exposing
the Red Sox to the treachery of Bill Buckner's glove.
</P>
<P>
   In nine postseason starts for Boston, Clemens won once.
</P>
<P>
   In two postseason starts and one relief appearance for Boston,
Martinez has won twice.
</P>
<P>
   His playoff debut at the end of his first year here, 1998, was
an 11-3 rout of the Indians that ended a skid of 13 consecutive Red
Sox postseason losses, all of which Clemens was around for, if not
a party to.
</P>
<P>
   And in the deciding Division Series game Monday, four days after
he had been forced to leave his Game 1 start with a strained muscle
in the middle of his back that was supposed to render him useless
until the millennium, Martinez pushed the envelope of heroism. With
the Sox pitching in tatters, the Indians owning an 8-7 lead and
seeming as if they were just starting to flex their muscles,
Martinez was a one-man cavalry charge. He stifled Cleveland, giving
Boston breathing room for a 12-8 victory and a date in the ALCS
against the accursed Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is a quirk of the rotation or destiny, Game 3
Saturday at Fenway Park brings us Clemens-Martinez,
point-counterpoint.
</P>
<P>
   It is a seemingly can't-lose situation for Martinez, whose
health remains questionable but whose credentials cannot be denied
after Monday's transcendent performance. As improbable as it may
seem, he took numbers that rivaled Clemens's best _ a 23-4 regular
season _ and dwarfed them with one October outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't surprise myself, but I was more impressed with the
time I stayed out there,'' Martinez said Friday upon reflection.
``I stayed there for four innings and then I said, `Well, I feel a
little bit tight but I am going to keep going and see how long I
last.' Then all of a sudden, I was there for six innings, and that
impressed me more than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the closest he will come to self-congratulation, and
perhaps that is his greatest gift: utter unflappability in showcase
situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you look at his record,'' said manager Jimy
Williams, ``every time he pitches, it is a big moment. That is his
whole mindset: Be prepared to pitch that game and help his team
win.''
</P>
<P>
   So what if it's the All-Star Game on his home turf, a worldwide
television audience waiting to see what's so special about this
skinny Dominican righthander _ and watching him win the game MVP
award with five strikeouts in two innings?
</P>
<P>
   So what if it's a crucial September stretch-drive game at Yankee
Stadium, with a wild card in the balance and a clearly superior
team in the opposing dugout _ a team that flails for one hit and 17
strikeouts as the upstart Sox make an indelible statement of
credibility?
</P>
<P>
   So what if it's a survival game for which he was supposed to
have called in sick?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he ever lets a situation get bigger than he can
handle,'' said catcher Jason Varitek.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, that is the case Saturday. Let others ponder the
cosmic implications of this duel of the decade _ and oh, by the
way, the Red Sox' 2-0 deficit in this best-of-seven series.
Martinez is having none of it, at least not for public consumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help what is going on out there,'' he said. ``I can
only control what I do with the ball on the mound. So I don't focus
on those things. I let that happen out there. I let the fans go
crazy in the stands and I do my thing. I am not going to change my
game because there is more pressure or less pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez won't acknowledge the ramifications, but Clemens will.
He volunteered to pitch the Yankees' potential Division Series
clincher in his home state, Texas _ and his seven shutout innings
there gave him as many wins in 10 postseason appearances as
Martinez has in three. After that, Clemens went to manager Joe
Torre and said he didn't care which ALCS assignment he drew.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right,'' said Torre. ``You got Saturday against Pedro.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful,'' Clemens responded. He got up and left, leaving
Torre to shake his head, undoubtedly questioning his veteran's
sanity.
</P>
<P>
   Spying his staff mates outside the manager's door, Clemens
informed them, ``I've already got the long straw. You guys are
good. Go in there, you've got nothing to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   That mentality is the secret weapon that has enabled Martinez to
surpass Clemens in Boston lore.

CRITICAL CROSSROADS FOR USC, NOTRE DAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ USC coach Paul Hackett and Notre Dame coach
Bob Davie could be expected to say the same things when discussing
what is billed as the greatest intersectional rivalry in college
football.
</P>
<P>
   But their remarks were almost indistinguishable on another topic
this week. See if you can match up these comments with the correct
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got enough pressure on me right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have more criticism from myself than there is from the
outside. A fan from the outside is able to say whatever they want
to say.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, guess who said what? Give up? The first remark came from
Davie, and the second from Hackett. But either coach could have
said them, considering the Trojans are 3-2 and the Irish 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the teams' records make today's 11:30 a.m. game
almost more important, as a victory over your archrival can
sometimes turn a season around, or at least make the alumni less
lethal.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism aside, there is a sense of urgency from both teams
that today is a good launching point to reclaim their preseason
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to get going now,'' USC wide receiver Kareem Kelly
said. ``This game separates the men from the children right here.''
</P>
<P>
   Davie was doing his fair share of re-analyzing the Irish's mixed
start this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of us realized there was a chance we could
struggle early in the season,'' he said. ``I'm not totally shocked
by what our record is. What's frustrating is how we had an
opportunity to win those games we didn't win. That's what haunts
you.''
</P>
<P>
   There's been some tinkering with the personnel for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   USC's offensive line _ long a source of derision _ will sport a
new look, thanks to injuries. Left tackle Trevor Roberts will start
ahead of Brent McCaffrey, who has a sore ankle but is expected to
play. Freshman Zach Wilson will start at right guard with Jason
Grain out a month with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Denmon, out two weeks with sore knees, will start, and
Faasea Mailo will start his third straight game at left guard,
although Donta Kendrick is nearly recovered from an ankle injury
and will play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when I think we're making progress, we slide back because
we don't have the same people in there we had two days earlier,''
Hackett said. ``We worked hard at paring the running game now and
adjusting it to what we think will work best against Notre Dame.''
</P>
<P>
   Davie has decided to bench kicker Jim Sanson, who missed three
field goals against USC in 1997, and start sophomore David Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett has also done an about-face in another area. He decided
to hold a one hour walk-through in Notre Dame Stadium on Friday.
Last week, the Trojans abandoned the walk-through the day before
playing Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notre Dame Stadium creates an atmosphere that is what college
football is about,'' Hackett said. ``If that atmosphere intimidates
you or makes you nervous, then you're not ready to play yet. It's
part of the process of learning to be a champion. If you can't go
to Notre Dame and play well, you can't expect to be a contender.''

UCLA'S REESE MAKES THE MOST OF OPPORTUNITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA true freshman linebacker Marcus Reese thought
his playing time would disappear when the two-game disabled-parking
suspensions ended and the starting linebackers returned.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Reese is on the field more than ever, and he's rapidly
becoming one of UCLA's best players _ solid against the run and
indispensable against the pass, both as a blitzer and cover man.
</P>
<P>
   Last week against Oregon, for example, he played 66 percent of
the defensive snaps, he intercepted a pass, he recovered a fumble,
and he tied for the team lead with six tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought when the (suspended) players came back, I'd be out
of the picture,'' Reese said as he prepared for today's game
against Cal at the Rose Bowl. ``I'm pretty surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins aren't. Reese was one of the top linebackers in the
nation last year at San Jose's Oak Grove High School, which
produced former Bruins tight end Mike Grieb. Reese has superb
instincts, he's stronger than he looks at 215 pounds, and he's
better conditioned than most true freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very physical, and he'll hit you,'' Bruins coach Bob
Toledo said. ``We always said he'd play as a true freshman. He was
the No. 1 linebacker recruit in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   For his prep success, for his dedication, conditioning and
impact at UCLA, Reese credits former Oak Grove teammate Andre
Carter, who plays defensive end for Cal and leads the Pacific-10 in
sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the reason I'm here,'' Reese said. ``When I was a
sophomore (and Carter was a senior), I was real small. Andre helped
get my lifting technique down. I trained with him and ran with him.
Andre was like my big brother. When I wanted to chase girls, he
told me no, I had to concentrate on football and school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre always called me `Little Andre.' I was the next
All-American. My junior year, people called me the next Andre, the
next great defensive player from Oak Grove. But I just wanted to be
Marcus.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for Reese to carve a niche in Westwood. When
UCLA broke training camp, Reese was the second-string weakside
linebacker. He made four tackles in the opener against Boise State,
then led the Bruins with nine at Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   The suspensions ended, but Reese did not falter. Each week, he
got more comfortable with the system. Each game, he made something
happen. Now, halfway through the season, he's UCLA's fifth-leading
tackler despite playing fewer snaps than players ranked above him.
</P>
<P>
   And because of his speed, Reese is integral to the pass defense.
When UCLA uses its nickel (five defensive backs) and dime (six)
coverages, Reese plays and starter Ryan Nece sits.
</P>
<P>
   That could be a combustible situation _ rookie playing ahead of
veteran _ but Reese and Nece have become friends. In fact, during
training camp, Nece treated Reese to burgers at In-n-Out. Shy and
anxious, Reese wondered how he could play linebacker at 215 pounds.
Nece, all of 214, told him to play smart and fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say, `You guys must compete,' but in person
there's no competition,'' Reese said. ``I'm still trying to learn
the stuff, and I always ask Ryan.''

UCLA'S PAUS WILL BE TARGET FOR CAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA has reason to fear for quarterback Cory Paus'
health this afternoon in the Rose Bowl, and he'll be wearing No.97
in white.
</P>
<P>
   Cal junior end Andre Carter is the closest thing the Pacific-10
has to a dominant defensive lineman _ stronger than his 250 pounds,
yet fast as a linebacker. He leads the league in sacks (seven) and
tackles-for-loss (13).
</P>
<P>
   But stopping Carter does not guarantee stopping the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the best defensive team we will have faced this
year,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said. ``They have an excellent
front seven.... They can devastate you with their pass rush.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bears, who held Nebraska's mighty running game to 114 yards,
have several NFL prospects. Linebacker Sekou Sanyika is a preseason
All-American. Cornerback Deltha O'Neal is one of the league's most
versatile players and leads the conference with four interceptions.
Jacob Waasdorp, of Quartz Hill, and Jeremiah Parker form the
Pac-10's best tackle tandem.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all good,'' UCLA offensive tackle Bryce Bohlander
said. ``They could be the best in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Countermeasures: Protecting Paus will be difficult, but the
Bruins have several options.
</P>
<P>
   They can deploy extra tight ends to protect the outside rushing
lanes. Or they can use a blocking technique known as chipping, in
which running backs hit the rushers before starting their pass
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   But the most effective countermeasure may be Paus' mobility.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (the quarterback) always lands in the same place, they'll
get you,'' Toledo said. ``Part of it is moving the pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Which way did they go? One of Cal's most effective pass-rushing
techniques is the end-tackle exchange: The defensive tackle breaks
to the outside while the end moves inside, forming an X. The Bears'
speed makes blocking the exchanges difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked against it a lot in practice, and we've done
well,'' Bohlander said. ``But they do it a lot, and their personnel
is really good. So we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Under lock and key: Asked to name the key to victory, Toledo
pointed to the front lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be able to run the ball and protect our passer,
and our (defensive) people have to do a good job stopping the run
and putting pressure on (Cal quarterback Kyle) Boller.''
</P>
<P>
   Attack the quarterback: Asked if he would try to exploit
Boller's inexperience _ he's a true freshman making his fourth
start _ Toledo didn't hesitate: ``Absolutely, and you can write
it.''
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: The Bruins have won 13 consecutive
regular-season home games.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two games, UCLA receiver Danny Farmer has caught 13
passes for 344 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins kicker Chris Griffith has made 10 of 13 field goals.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA has scored 45 points following opponent turnovers, while
opponents have scored 36 points off UCLA mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Something has to give: Cal is last in the league in offense (236
yards per game), while UCLA is last in defense (451).

THE YANKEES CAN AFFORD A MOMENT OF LAUGHTER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Allen Watson entered Game 2 in the eighth inning to
face Lou Merloni and was promptly ordered to walk him
intentionally. It was the only batter Watson faced before manager
Joe Torre replaced him.
</P>
<P>
   As Torre reached for the ball with a look of disgust on his
face, he said to Watson: ``I got to get you out of here. You're too
wild. You've got to stop walking guys.''
</P>
<P>
   And Watson burst out laughing, in perhaps the only light-hearted
moment of that tense half-inning that was integral to the Yankees'
3-2 victory. Jimy Williams, the manager of the Red Sox, made five
personnel changes in the inning, while Torre made four.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone, the Yankee pitcher, said, ``I couldn't keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   After all the pinch-hitters and pinch-runners had been inserted,
after Torre had the pitcher he wanted on the mound, the Red Sox had
the bases loaded and one out, and Boston's Butch Huskey was facing
Ramiro Mendoza. It was Mendoza's first appearance in 13 days.
</P>
<P>
   Torre had the Yankees' infielders play back, looking for a
double play off Mendoza's hard-sinking fastball, which often
creates ground balls. But Mendoza had other intentions: the last
time he faced Huskey, in September, Huskey seemed to be
anticipating his fastball, so this time Mendoza threw him changeups
and struck him out. Then Jose Offerman flied out to center field to
end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Mendoza's teammates mentioned later how remarkable it
was that he had such great control despite his long layoff. They
weren't surprised at how calm he was, however; Cone surmised that
it might be the heritage Mendoza shares with Mariano Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's in the water in Panama,'' Cone said. ``He
and Mariano, they're both expressionless when they're out there,
unflappable.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada Waits His Turn
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada was saying all the right things after Joe Girardi
started ahead of him at catcher in Game 2. Posada said that he
could understand, that Cone is just more comfortable with Girardi,
and that he would have made the same decision if he were the
manager.
</P>
<P>
   But saying all the right things doesn't necessarily translate
into being happy with the decision. ``You want to play,'' said
Posada. ``You want to go out there and help the team win. I want to
be the guy. It doesn't get any better than this, playoff time.
We're playing for our lives, for the World Series, and you want to
be out there, there's no doubt. I get more nervous on the bench
than when I'm playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada's time as the full-time, front-line catcher will probably
come next year. Girardi is expected to depart as a free agent _
many executives in baseball believe he is headed to the Chicago
Cubs _ and Posada will get a chance to play every day for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   No More the Hero
</P>
<P>
   Lou Merloni is a native of Framingham, Mass., and he admitted
that he knows the culture of the Red Sox and their fans better than
his teammates do, because he has lived in both worlds. He tried to
explain why Roger Clemens will be booed so incessantly when he
opposes Pedro Martinez in Game 3 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though there were things that went on between him and
management, the bottom line to the fans is that he left,'' said
Merloni. ``When he first left and came back with Toronto, they
called him a traitor. You hardly see a great hero return to Boston
to cheers. Look at what they do to Wade Boggs with all that he did
in Boston. That's just the way it is around here.''
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old Merloni said that he was a big Clemens fan, but
when he got older, he studied Clemens more as a pitcher and not as
a hero. If it were up to Merloni, Clemens would not be berated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't boo him,'' said Clemens. ``Not after all he did
while he was in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fans definitely will. _ JACK CURRY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Through the Roof
</P>
<P>
   How much interest is there in the Martinez-Clemens matchup? The
Boston Herald reported that four tickets for Game 3 sold for
$12,100 on E-Bay, the auction Web site. When Boston manager Jimy
Williams was asked about this huge amount for an ALCS game, he
said: ``I think you probably you should comment on that yourself. I
just leave it at that.'' _ JACK CURRY

MATCHUP FOR THE AGES: PEDRO AGAINST ROGER AT FENWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It has already given us two riveting nights of
Masterpiece Theater, though judging by the face of Red Sox Nation _
dark circles under sleep-deprived eyes, anxiety creasing every
forehead _ it has had a horror-movie feel, too. The Beast from the
Bronx having its way with the Olde Towne Team.
</P>
<P>
   And now the first postseason confrontation between those ancient
rivals, the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees, which opened with
two exquisitely played games in the Bronx, each won by a single run
by the Yankees, switches to Fenway Park Saturday afternoon with
perhaps the most anticipated pitching matchup ever seen on Yawkey
Way.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens, returning in New York pinstripes in search of the
World Series ring that eluded him through 13 years in Boston in
which he won more games (192) than any Red Sox pitcher except
turn-of-the-century Cy Young, is facing Pedro Martinez, who in two
short years in Boston has won accolades here once reserved
exclusively for the Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox manager Jimy Williams was asked to consider the
magnitude of this pitching pairing. He responded in his folksy
style that has come to be known as Jimywocky.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as tomorrow's game, I think the circuit-breaker for
that electric company, for the great pad in the sky, they might be
challenged,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The diminutive Martinez, the first Dominican-born star ever to
play for the Sox, may already have eclipsed Clemens, the
larger-than-life Texan, in the affection of Red Sox fans.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, at age 36 a lion in winter who only on occasion this
season has flashed the brilliance of a future Hall of Famer, always
was admired in when he was in Boston. But his clashes with the Red
Sox front office and stormy departure because of a contract dispute
three years ago left a sour taste.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old Martinez, who in two Octobers already has won as
many postseason games (two) as Clemens has in a decade and a half,
is loved. No Never more so than Monday night, when he came out of
the bullpen in Cleveland with a sore back _ Everyman's affliction _
and pitched six hitless innings to win the deciding game of the
Division Series against the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Martinez is being asked to rescue the Red Sox yet again.
The Yankees, who have won 35 American League pennants and 24 World
Series titles, are two wins away from returning to the World Series
for the third time in the last four years. They have won 12
consecutive postseason games, matching the record set by their
illustrious predecessors 67 years ago, a team that included Babe
Ruth (another former Red Sox pitcher) and Lou Gehrig.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who won the first game of the series on Bernie
Williams's home run off Sox reliever Rod Beck in the 10th inning
Wednesday night, beat Martinez's older brother, Ramon, 3-2, in the
second game Thursday. Ramon the Elder pitched beautifully, allowing
just six hits in 6 2/3 innings, but the Sox bullpen faltered in the
seventh inning, when the Yankees scored twice to overcome Nomar
Garciaparra's two-run home run. Sox hitters, 1 for 13 with runners
in scoring position, left the bases loaded in the eighth inning and
runners on first and third in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Red Sox, who have taken leads into the late innings of
each of the first two games only to lose, are two defeats away from
winter, and a fin de siecle realization that they will enter the
new millennium with their streak intact of no World Series titles
since 1918.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure all falls on Pedro, who on Sept. 10 in Yankee
Stadium may have pitched the best game ever pitched against the
Yankees. He allowed just one hit, a second-inning home run by Chili
Davis, did not walk a batter, and struck out 17, the most whiffs
ever recorded against the Bombers. By the end of that night,
Yankees fans were on their feet, cheering for him.
</P>
<P>
   How will he respond to that pressure?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he said, ``I just lay myself in God's hands and let it
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My body might be beat, my arm might be beat, but my heart is
out there and my mind and my love for the game and respect for the
fans, it is out there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez also stressed that this game isn't just Roger and
Me.
</P>
<P>
   ``As capable as I am of beating any team, I believe my team is
good to do it, too,'' he said. ``You guys got to start having some
respect for my teammates. They are good. They are really good, and
if you don't believe it, you can analyze where you are right now
and it wasn't just one single man, it wasn't me with my 23 (wins),
no. I did it because they were behind me, and I think you guys have
to give them some credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox CEO John Harrington said Friday that tickets for the
game may be the most sought-after ticket ever for a Red Sox game.
On eBay, an Internet auction site, one buyer reportedly paid
$12,100 for four box seats.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens said Friday that when Yankees manager Joe Torre was
trying to decide upon his postseason pitching assignments, he
called the Yankees pitchers into his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called us in one by one like drawing straws, I guess,''
Clemens said, ``and (Torre) was hemming and hawing back and forth.
I told him again, `Skip, whatever slot you want me in, you put me
in, doesn't make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``So he said, `All right, you got Saturday against Pedro.' I
said, `Beautiful.' I got up and left.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he was shaking his head at me as I walked out the door.
The rest of the guys are standing outside the door waiting. I said,
`I've already got the long straw. You guys are good. Go in there,
you've got nothing to lose.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When Clemens was introduced here at the All-Star Game in July as
one of the 100 best players of the century, he wore a Yankees cap
and was loudly booed. Even though he said he expects some Sox fans
to be cheering for him ``undercover,'' Torre knows better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when they introduced Pedro in Yankee Stadium they
booed him a little bit,'' Torre said. ``I said to Roger, who
happened to be sitting next to me, `You will do better than that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think that is what the goosebumps are going to be about
tomorrow. It is going to be respect. There is going to be screaming
and yelling just like every time we play here, except magnified,
because of postseason and what it means. It is going to be a heck
of a show.''

NOTRE DAME DOESN'T SCARE VAN RAAPHORST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ USC quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst shrugged
off naysayers who believe the Trojans stand little chance of
stealing a victory from favored Notre Dame today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what people think,'' Van Raaphorst said. ``I've
been around too long and through too much to care what people
think.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time USC played here, Van Raaphorst was a bright-eyed
freshman just trying to gain ground on starter John Fox. He ended
up completing 2 of 3 passes for 21 yards in the Trojans' 20-17
victory over the Irish.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Van Raaphorst is the full-fledged starter, albeit because
Carson Palmer is out with a broken collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being in the locker room afterward and how good
everyone felt,'' Van Raaphorst said. ``I hope we do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst said he doesn't think he will be intimidated by
the atmosphere at Notre Dame Stadium, and thinks the extra
adrenaline will have a positive effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a fun place to play at. You've got to get excited,''
Van Raaphorst said. ``If not, there's something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Other players, like true freshman wide receiver Kareem Kelly,
will make their first visit to South Bend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be butterflies, but not because I'm scared
but because I want to do well,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Deep in pocket: Van Raaphorst said he isn't worried about
getting injured because he takes more hits than Palmer. He isn't as
mobile and was sacked seven times against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my game. I'm not a Randall Cunningham-type scrambler,''
Van Raaphorst said. ``I take some hits. Usually nothing bad
happens. It's not my job to run around.''
</P>
<P>
   In USC's past two games, Van Raaphorst has stayed on the ground
after hard hits and twice required medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just getting the wind knocked out of me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ready for rain: The weather was sunny Friday, and today's
forecast was mixed. There were predications of rain, but also
forecasts that placed the temperature around 70 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The rain doesn't especially bother USC coach Paul Hackett, who
said fumbling is usually the biggest problem in wet games, and the
Trojans have lost just four fumbles in five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty good at hanging on to the ball,'' Hackett said.
``I think it's fairly standard that the pass rush is not as fierce
on a wet field. Unless it's a downpour, a rainstorm or a typhoon,
you stick to the game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Life or death? Notre Dame coach Bob Davie on the importance of
the rivalry: ``When you talk to other coaches that have coached
here, for instance talking to Ara (Parseghian) about these games,
he told me a story about when he lost out in Los Angeles, he went
back to the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt so bad that he contemplated jumping out of that hotel.
He said he went over to the window, happened to look, he was on
about the 15th floor. He said he'd have jumped, but he didn't want
to screw up his golf game, so he came to his senses before he went
out the window.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a new 60-second commercial made in the wee hours of Oct.
14 by Vice President Al Gore. Gore says he conceived the idea for
the commercial as he received word during a flight to Seattle that
the Senate had rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty _ the
first major treaty the Senate has rejected since the Treaty of
Versailles setting up the League of Nations in 1920. This is the
first commercial of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Century Media Group.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: The commercial opens not with a picture of Gore
but with two famous black-and-white still pictures of President
John F. Kennedy. It then cuts to Gore, wearing a coat and tie and
speaking directly into the camera. As he talks about nuclear arms,
the Internet headlines about the Senate vote and a live shot of a
rocket lifting off are shown. Later, it shows Gore in his Senate
days during arms-control talks with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
and George Shultz, who was secretary of state under President
Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: Gore is correct that the chairmen of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff have supported the test ban treaty, and they are the
senior responsible officers. Other defense experts have overtly
opposed it, including Dick Cheney, who was secretary of defense
under President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: Gore wants to convey that he is well-versed in a
vital issue to which he has had a longtime commitment. After he was
first elected to Congress in 1976, he schooled himself in arms
control. The subliminal message is that his opponents have no
comparable experience.
</P>
<P>
   Still, polls have showed that voters believe Gore lacks the
elusive quality called leadership. The commercial is meant to
counter that impression. Gore's voice is soft, and the commercial
aims for restraint _ a rocket lifting off rather than a
mushroom-clouded screen of destruction. This restraint is meant to
convey leadership as well as contrast with what he has
characterized as the Republicans' recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   Because Gore made public the story of how he penned the ad
himself, he also wants voters to see him as passionate about a
subject _ they perceive him as too cautious in general _ and as
someone who is taking direct control of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether this is a topic that will resonate with
voters. While polls show voters support arms control, they do not
call it as urgent a priority as domestic issues like education.

NEW YORK TO SEEK DISASTER FUNDS IN VIRUS OUTBREAK 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City plans to ask the federal government to
reimburse it for the cost of battling a viral outbreak, city
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The city's Office of Emergency Management will request a
presidential disaster declaration from the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, seeking reimbursement for roughly $10 million
that it spent in recent weeks to contain an outbreak of the West
Nile-like virus, which began in August, said Jerome M. Hauer,
director of the emergency management unit. The request, which was
still being drafted Friday, is likely to be submitted Monday, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Hauer said costs to contain the virus, which has killed six
people and sickened 54 in the New York region since late July,
mostly centered around mosquito control. West Nile virus and St.
Louis encephalitis _ the original diagnosis by the Federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in the outbreak _ are carried by
mosquitoes that bite infected birds and then go on to infect
humans.
</P>
<P>
   The city spent several days spraying the city with malathion and
other insecticides and handed out thousands of cans of bug spray,
cornering the country's supply at one point. Other costs included
large blocks of overtime for city workers, Hauer said.
</P>
<P>
   While it is not unusual for the city to make the request to FEMA
_ it has done so almost every time there has been a bad snow storm
or northeaster _ this will be the first time it has done so for a
public health threat, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile-like virus that has been found in the New York
City area has also been discovered in a dead bird 150 miles north
of Manhattan, State Health Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The virus was found in a dead crow collected earlier this month
in the Saratoga County village of Ballston Spa, officials said, and
in a cuckoo found at the United States Military Academy at West
Point, 40 miles north of Manhattan. No human encephalitis cases
have been reported in those areas.

SATURN'S NEW WAGON A COOL RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Some really fine, midsize station wagons have crossed
my path recently. Quick, good-handling, luxurious cars with plenty
of room and lots of character, they all have had two things in
common:
</P>
<P>
   They are European and they cost plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Now, along comes Saturn to throw a monkey wrench into my neat
little world view. Here's the square-back version of its L-Series
cars, the first all-new products from the corporation since it
started up a decade ago and its first midsize cars ever.
</P>
<P>
   And guess what? The upscale wagon I drove, with the catchy name
LW2, is quick, good-handling and luxurious with plenty of room and,
well, a fair amount of character. Can't have everything. Especially
when a fully loaded, leather-lined, top-of-the-heap LW2 costs about
as much as the Euro wagons' base models.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, it's made in Tennessee, although with a bit of European
DNA thrown into the mix. The basic platform is from the Opel
Vectra, a European GM product, which was lengthened and then
transformed with Saturn's signature space-frame construction and
plastic lower-body panels.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about pleasant surprises. No offense intended, Saturn, but
I didn't really expect the LW2 to be such a cool ride. The compact
S-series cars are good machines, with proven reliability and
durability, but without much in the way of panache.
</P>
<P>
   When Saturn first hit the market, it was as a remarkable new
kind of automaker organized by General Motors as a clean-slate
attempt to beat the imports head on.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the original compacts were updated and improved,
but the marketplace was changing and the demand for little cars was
fading. Some of the original warts, such as noisy engines and
cramped interiors, were also taking their toll.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the L-Series arrives as Saturn's first foray into a new
line of cars. Too bad the corporation waited so long to expand, but
if the LW2 is a fair example of the breed, Saturn should regain its
luster.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn has a strong following of loyal customers, an automotive
Up With People! that recently gathered by the thousands at the
corporation's Spring Hill, Tenn., for group hugs and camp songs.
</P>
<P>
   The L-Series gives them somewhere to go once they outgrow their
compact Saturns.
</P>
<P>
   The uptown tester was equipped with a strong V-6, actually a
detuned version of the 200-horse engine found in the Cadillac
Catera. The engine is made in GM's engine factory at Ellesmere
Port, England.
</P>
<P>
   German chassis, British engine, yes it's true the new Saturn is
no longer a 100 percent U.S. product, as the compacts are.
</P>
<P>
   The engine is smooth and powerful, with a muscular feel and a
subtle growl under acceleration. Coupled with a good automatic
transmission, the engine performed with flexibility, tame around
town, aggressive on the open road.
</P>
<P>
   Base engine for the wagon is a 2.2-liter twin-cam four, a newly
minted engine that's expected to be used in other GM cars. I didn't
drive this version _ which has the equally catchy name LW1 _ but
from what I've read and heard, the new four is a step up from the
one in the S-series cars.
</P>
<P>
   Stick shift is available only with the four and only in the
sedan.
</P>
<P>
   The four-wheel disc brakes work well, but anti-lock is optional.
It should be standard, just like most other GM cars.
</P>
<P>
   The styling of the wagon is simple and purposeful, with clean
lines and a front end that carries over the Saturn theme. I favor
the look of the wagon over the sedan, which has a fussy rear-end
treatment. The wagon's rear end looks simple and uncluttered.
</P>
<P>
   The interior on the tester included optional leather seating at
$1,095, an upgraded stereo for $220 and six-way power driver's seat
at $325, the only extras added on to the price of the V-6 model. I
found the interior roomy, even for an extra-tall driver and his
extra-tall back-seat offspring. The ride was quiet and rattle-free.
</P>
<P>
   The dashboard, console and doors are very straightforward, even
spare, which might be a fault to those used to lavish appoints.
However, I thought it was clean, functional and unpretentious.
</P>
<P>
   The new Saturns are as aggressively priced as the compacts, with
the base sedan starting at $15,000 and the base wagon at $18,835.
The wagon model driven here was about as expensive as they get.
</P>
<P>
   I've heard some reports that Saturn has plenty of advance orders
for L-series cars, and with good reason. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Vehicle type: Five passenger, four-door station wagon, front-wheel
drive. &QL; 
Base price: $21,360. &QL; 
Price as tested: $23,440. &QL; 
Engine: 3-liter V-6, 182 hp at 5,600 rpm, 190 lb-ft of torque at
3,600 rpm. &QL; 
Transmission: &QL; 
4-speed automatic. &QL; 
Curb weight: &QL; 
3,230 pounds. &QL; 
Wheelbase:  &QL; 
270.5 inches. &QL; 
EPA mileage: &QL; 
20 city, 26 highway. &QL; 
_Good performance. &QL; 
_Quality feel. &QL; 
_Roomy interior. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
_Anti-lock brakes optional. &QL; 
Generic dashboard. &QL; 
_Boring name. &QL;

 &HT;    Irene unloads flooding in Florida
 &HT;    By Pat Moore, Sally Swartz
 &HT;    and Thomas R. Collins
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ As Hurricane Irene plowed across South
Florida with 80 mph wind gusts and up to 10 inches of rain Friday,
Treasure Coast officials expected to find flooded roads and perhaps
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be quite a rainfall producer,'' said Randy
Lascody, senior forecaster at the National Weather Service in
Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
   But the South Florida Water Management District late Friday
forecast lower amounts of rain than meteorologists originally
predicted. They expected the Treasure Coast to get about 2 inches
of rain and most of Palm Beach County, 4 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Irene, a Category 1 hurricane, was expected to weaken to a
tropical storm as it moved slowly north overnight, bringing wind
gusts of 50 to 60 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the center gets to the north during the day Saturday, winds
will switch to the west and southwest and will diminish,'' Lascody
said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin County Red Cross officials opened one shelter at the
First United Methodist Church. St. Lucie County officials opened
shelters at Westwood High School in Fort Pierce and Port St. Lucie
Community Center. The Community Center, usually designated for
people with medical problems or other special needs, will serve any
resident who needs shelter, St. Lucie County Public Safety Director
Jack Southard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're opening them for anyone who has special needs or needs
to evacuate their houses because of localized flooding or other
problems,'' Southard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing we're concerned about is flooding,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   MARTIN ROAD CREWS GET JUMP
</P>
<P>
   After the storm came ashore Friday afternoon, the three major
South Florida airports closed and power losses mounted.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Power &AMP; Light Co. reported more than 400,000 customers
lost electricity in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties by
nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   Even the National Hurricane Center had to switch to backup
generators when the power went off, blacking out many computer
screens.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush asked President Clinton to declare a state of
emergency in Florida, hoping to unleash federal dollars and
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson said people with damaged
homes should contact their flood insurance agency, and said those
with no flood insurance may be eligible for federal aid; a hotline
number has been created: (800) 22-STORM.
</P>
<P>
   St. Lucie County law enforcement and Red Cross and hospital
officials gathered late Friday at the county's emergency operations
center preparing to respond to any emergency, Emergency Management
Director Keith Holman said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin County road crews got a jump on the storm Thursday by
placing pumps at strategic places that typically flood during wet
weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest threat is going to be the rain. The ground is
already saturated,'' the Weather Service's Lascordy said. ``If we
get as much rain as they're predicting in that short a period, some
roads will be impassable and some residences will experience
flooding.''
</P>
<P>
   William Larsson, who lives in the low-lying, frequently flooded
St. Lucie area in Martin County, said water in the St. Lucie River
behind his home rose about an inch every hour Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Port St. Lucie Public Works Director Larry Thacker said the city
can handle the 7 to 10 inches of rain forecasters are projecting
but said motorists should expect some intersections to be under
water temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   EROSION TAKES AWAY BEACH
</P>
<P>
   The city has lowered the level of its canals and waterways by
several inches in anticipation of Saturday's deluge. That water is
released to the St. Lucie River and ultimately makes its way to the
ocean, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Water managers continued to monitor conditions downstream of the
St. Lucie Lock late Friday to ensure waterfront residents aren't
flooded by Irene's rains.
</P>
<P>
   The lock gates were all open to release moderate amounts of
local runoff from area farms and residences into the St. Lucie
Canal and from the canal into the St. Lucie River, water district
spokesman Paul Millar said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers stood by its plan to stop
releasing fresh water from Lake Okeechobee until Irene passed. Then
lake water will be dumped into the St. Lucie River on Florida's
east coast and the Caloosahatchee River to the west.
</P>
<P>
   At Martin County beaches Friday, some waterfront residents
boarded up their homes and one who lives just north of the Bathtub
Beach built a makeshift seawall, lifeguard Mike Diapoules said. At
Stuart Beach, water washed under the boardwalks at high tide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a constant drizzle that stings when it hits you, and
the ocean is taking away the beach again,'' said lifeguard Dan
Naughton.
</P>
<P>
   85 MPH WIND GUSTS IN MIAMI
</P>
<P>
   Hobe Sound Beach lifeguard Bob Dixon said tourists crowded into
the covered picnic shelter facing the beach and were out shooting
pictures despite 40 to 45 mph winds and 6-to-10 foot seas. Surfers
were out of the water by early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``One surfer did try it after the seas got rough,'' Dixon said.
``He got slam-dunked, ate the sand and got out.''
</P>
<P>
   Lifeguards are looking for today's tides to be even higher than
Friday's surge of about a foot above normal.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle ranchers and citrus farmers around St. Lucie and
Okeechobee counties were busy Friday pumping existing water from
their pastures and fields to try to lessen the effect Irene's rain
may have. But generally, their feeling was that the area would
avoid a severe drenching and their cows and crops would fare well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can handle this,'' said Doug Bournique, the executive vice
president of the Indian River Citrus League, which represents 1,600
growers from Daytona Beach to Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem for citrus growers is that the industry is
on the cusp of what is predicted to be a productive year for them
and this will delay harvesting for two or three days, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just brings to a screeching halt a very successful start to
a season,'' he said. ``You want to get going. You want to employ
people and this puts you on hold.''

SHOTS FIRED AT IRVINGTON MAYOR'S HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINGTON, N.J. _ With a fresh bullet hole in her front door,
Mayor Sara Bost said Friday that someone had fired several shots
into her house Thursday morning in what she believed was an effort
by a vandal to intimidate her following a confrontation last month.
</P>
<P>
   Bost said she and her husband, Fred, an administrator in the
Essex County Sheriff's Department, were home when the shooting
occurred at 2 a.m. on Thursday. Neither of them was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Bost said she was asleep in a second-floor bedroom and her
husband was asleep in front of the television downstairs when they
were awakened by a rapid succession of loud bangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a drive-by. It started at the garage and went to the
front of the house,'' Bost, 51, said at a news conference on the
steps of City Hall Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Steven Palamara of the Irvington Police said nine shots
were fired from a .45 caliber automatic weapon. He said a witness
saw shots fired from a car that drove past the house.
</P>
<P>
   Police Director Robert Rankin said that there were ``some
leads'' in the case, but declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Three Sundays ago, Bost said, she and members of the Oak Avenue
Block Association spent the day removing graffiti from a building
and signs about a block away from her home, a green-and-white Cape
Cod-style house in a neighborhood of two-family houses that are in
varying states of repair. Two houses on her block are boarded up.
</P>
<P>
   Bost said she was driving by the site several days later when
she encountered a young man, age 19 or 20, spray-painting graffiti
on a stop sign that the group had painted over. The mayor said she
got out of her car and told the man to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't look at me. He turned his back on me and he spit
at me down by my feet,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Since being elected in 1994, Bost said she has often spoken out
against the violence, drug dealing and vandalism that have plagued
Irvington, a 2.8-square-mile city of 61,000 people on Newark's
northern border. She theorized the offended graffiti writer may be
involved with or have friends or associates in the drug trade who
participated in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Palamara said police are investigating whether there is a
connection between the shooting and the mayor's encounter with the
graffiti writer. He also said investigators are looking into an
incident about a month ago in which car thieves crashed a stolen
car into the front of the mayor's house.

BAPTIST COLLEGE BREAKS ITS NO-DANCING TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star

<P>
   LIBERTY, Mo. _ Graduates of William Jewell College will return
to the Baptist college Saturday for the usual homecoming
festivities _ the parade, the football game, the crowning of the
homecoming queen.
</P>
<P>
   They'll also come for the unusual:
</P>
<P>
   Dancing. On the central quadrangle.
</P>
<P>
   Homecoming has never included a dance on campus before, a taboo
left over from the Baptist heritage that condemned dancing as a
sin.
</P>
<P>
   The college has had dances off campus, and student groups have
danced at other spots on campus, as well as at off-campus hotels.
</P>
<P>
   But having a celebratory dance for alumni, benefactors,
administrators, professors and students in the heart of campus?
</P>
<P>
   Never even considered.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come that the prohibition, whether official or
unofficial, ends,'' said Barry Morris, an independent television
producer who graduated from Jewell in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks it will be spectacular to see people dancing in the
center of this school that opened 150 years ago. And even though he
considers himself a ``klutz,'' he probably will try to groove along
with the Swing 39 band, ``just for the entertainment value.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who is a co-chairman of the sesquicentennial homecoming
festivities, said more than 1,000 people had reserved spots for
tonight's dinner and dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the real world, having a dance on campus is not a big deal
at all, but at a Baptist campus, it is an event. It's not
controversial, but it is the first of a kind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Jones, a college spokesman, said some conservative Baptists
might see the dance as a sign that the college was becoming too
liberal. He said a couple of persons had questioned the college's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   But many people on campus are not against dancing and are
definitely in favor of having fun to celebrate the college's 150th
anniversary, Jones added.
</P>
<P>
   The homecoming booklet tells alumni: ``A large dance floor will
offer plenty of room for all those wanting to kick up their heels
and make a little history. This will not be a foot function.''
</P>
<P>
   Decades ago, students avoided the word ``dance'' by labeling any
event that included dancing a ``foot function,'' said Jewell
graduate John Philpot, a physics professor on campus for 38 years.
</P>
<P>
   Philpot sent a notice to the faculty about the upcoming dance
saying that even though this one was not a ``foot function,'' his
feet would function tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some alumni coming back because they can't believe
it, and they want to see it for themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Fulk, director of alumni programs, told a story about Will
Adams, a former professor, who taught ballroom dancing classes on
campus.
</P>
<P>
   In a fund-raising campaign in the 1970s, Adams pledged $500. He
gave the college $5 and said: ``You'll get the rest of this when
there's dancing on the quad.''
</P>
<P>
   That time has come. At the end of the dance tonight, Adams plans
to hand over the rest of the money.
</P>
<P>
   Fulk said alumni wanted to be part of officially changing the
campus tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had so many people calling us and saying, `Is this
really true? I read it in the brochure, but is it really going to
happen?' The consistent response is, `I'm not going to miss being
there to see it and participate in it.' ''

VALENTINE TRIES SHIFTING THE BATTING ORDER  
 ROUGH RECEPTION FOR ROCKER   
 SAFE ON THE STREETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Edgardo Alfonzo wondered how long it had been since
he had last hit third in a lineup. It was May 3, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday night, Alfonzo, essentially the only hot hitter for
the Mets in the National League Championship Series (4 for 8 with
one run batted in and one run scored), arrived at the clubhouse to
find himself in that unfamiliar spot. The move came after the heart
of the Mets' lineup _ John Olerud, Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura _
had gone 1 for 21 in the first two games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   The last time that manager Bobby Valentine changed the lineup
was during the Mets' seven-game losing streak in September, but
this move, Valentine said, was intended less to wake up his dormant
offense than as a move to put some batters between the Mets' two
left-handers _ Olerud and Ventura _ so that it would be more
difficult for Atlanta to use one of its left-handed relievers to
face both of them in the same inning.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said that in the last few days, several players had
made suggestions to him about what the Mets could try to break out
of their funk against Atlanta. So Friday night Olerud batted second
and Ventura sixth. Piazza remained fourth and Benny Agbayani, who
played right field, was fifth. Olerud batted second six times last
season, the last time on July 14, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there is some spacing that we needed when we played
Houston, because of their dominant left-handed reliever,''
Valentine said of Billy Wagner and the Mets' games against the
Astros during September. ``And Fonzie went to fifth. I think the
same kind of spacing, with Fonzie being hot, hitting in front of
Mike where he might get a pitch or two more to hit, gives Fonzie a
little more prominence in our lineup and it spaces our
left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be real difficult in one inning to pitch to John and
Robin with the same left-hander. I know they have another good
left-hander out there, and I know they can use Maddux to go after
my right-handers, and probably will if the situation calls for it.
But I think it will make it a little more challenging for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Alfonzo, who usually bats second, had expressed
unhappiness with being shifted in the lineup, although he is the
one who suggested it during the losing streak. Friday night,
Alfonzo said, he was not surprised by the move and did not feel any
increased pressure being in a position typically reserved for the
hot hitter on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever it takes,'' he said. ``I've got to go up and try to
do the same things. I'll do the same things and see if things
change. You see the numbers we have against Atlanta, especially in
the playoffs, and we have to try to find out what's happening.
Hopefully, it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo had batted third in just 10 games in his career, going
12 for 29, a .414 average. Olerud had batted in the second spot 17
times, going 22 for 63, a .349 average.
</P>
<P>
   In another switch, Valentine put Melvin Mora _ who was called up
from Triple-A when the rosters expanded and has been involved in
some of the biggest plays of the last few weeks _ in center field
instead of Shawon Dunston. Mora, playing in place of the ill Rickey
Henderson on Wednesday, belted a home run. He scored the winning
run on a wild pitch in the Mets' dramatic victory over Pittsburgh
in the final regular-season game. Friday night was Mora's third
start of the season, his first of the post-season, but he was as
cool as the veterans he joined in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not nervous,'' he said. ``I was nervous my first at-bat.
It's the same game. I know there's more pressure in New York, a lot
of people are waiting for you to do something. I've been in the
playoffs for 10 years in Venezuela. In Venezuela, there's more
pressure. They throw glasses if you don't do well. Here they just
scream.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Mora is capable of playing almost any position on the
field, he said he is most comfortable in center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my best position,'' he said. ``I've been playing it all
my life. I can make diving catches. I can control the outfield. I
can help a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   His recent success _ particularly the home run in Atlanta _ has
given a jolt to Mora's already substantial confidence. He was
thrilled when Valentine called on him to replace Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was looking at me and he wanted to put some defense in,''
Mora said. ``I respect Rickey. He was my favorite player. I think I
can help the team. I think I can do more than that. I showed
everybody here I can play. I know it's impossible to play in this
lineup. The only thing I can do is prepare myself physically and
mentally. My cousin from Miami told me when I got in the game, the
people started to talk on television and say, `I don't think this
is a good situation to put him in, he has no experience.' When they
were saying `they better put in Benny,' I hit the home run.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Masato Yoshii's sprained ankle was taped Friday, and
Valentine said it was ``wait and see'' whether Yoshii would be able
to pitch Game 5. If he cannot go, Orel Hershiser, who pitched one
inning of relief Oct. 8 against Arizona and has not started since
the final game of the regular season against Pittsburgh, would be
the most likely starter.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the medical report was more positive. Henderson, who
had flu symptoms that forced him to leave Game 2, was much better
and started in left field Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rough Reception for Rocker
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker emerged from the Braves' dugout before the start of
the game and met the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   After taunting Mets fans through the news media, Rocker was
expected to draw a vicious response from the fans. He stepped from
the dugout to begin the pregame warm-ups, and while enduring the
first taunts, he turned to the fans, smiled wide, tipped his hat
and said, ``Hey, boys.'' He then started toward the outfield,
stopped to sign autographs for a pair of young children wearing
Mets hats, and then continued on.
</P>
<P>
   When Rocker's name was called during player introductions, he
drew the loudest boos from the fans. He tipped his cap again in an
exaggerated gesture.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium was littered with signs challenging him, and that
was enough to draw the ire of his manager, Bobby Cox.
</P>
<P>
   ``It irritates me,'' Cox said of Rocker's comments in the news
media. ``I don't like it. I don't condone it. He was roughed up by
the fans, I think, in our first series here, and he's the type of
guy that's going to give it right back. He's got to work on that.
He's a great pitcher, a great competitor, but he needs to work on
his player-fan relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell all our guys to watch what they say, that's it still
the game of baseball, not a game of words.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One thing that Cox did not worry about was that the angry crowd
would fluster Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly is not going to scare,'' Cox said. ``They can
yell all they want and curse him all they want. If he's on, he's
on, but if he's off, he's off. If he has a bad a game it's not
going to be because somebody yelled at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Safe on the Streets
</P>
<P>
   Cox spoke glowingly of New York City, stating that his opinion
has changed in recent years. He described New York as ``one of the
safest cities, walking around.'' But when asked whether that
applied to Rocker and Chipper Jones, he said, ``I don't know about
that.''

VALENTINE TAKES HITS, BUT HE'S RIGHT FOR NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bobby Valentine, as usual, is smiling the most hated
smile in baseball. It's his badge of honor, that cocky Frankie
Avalon smile. Wipe it off if you dare.
</P>
<P>
   I say it can't be done.
</P>
<P>
   We're standing near the batting cage before Game 3 of the
National League Championship Series last night and his team is
about to lose its third straight to the Braves, but Valentine is
somehow relaxed and laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can take the heat better than anyone,'' he corrects, ``but
that doesn't mean I like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, after the Mets had blown a 3-0 lead and lost,
4-3, to the Braves, Valentine had quickly stepped forward to take
the blame, saying he'd left starting pitcher Kenny Rogers in too
long.
</P>
<P>
   His critics welcomed the confession and tabloid headlines
screamed that ``Bobby Blew It!'' but Valentine's ``mea culpa'' had
accomplished two things: He had defused the second-guessers by
admitting the mistake and at the same time took the heat off Rogers
and the heart of his batting order, which was a pitiful 1-for-21
with one RBI in the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know what they \Rthe New York media\S would have done
to Kenny?'' he asks, his eyebrows climbing up his forehead with
every word.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the New York sharks might have done to Rogers can't
compare with what they've already done to Valentine. When the Mets
were losing five in a row in the final week of the season,
Valentine said for the second time this season that if the Mets
didn't make the playoffs he should be fired.
</P>
<P>
   In both instances, he again became the lightning rod for all the
negative emotions and tension surrounding his team. After the
second time, he woke the next day to this ``New York Post''
headline: ``Why Wait? Can the Phony Now.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that yesterday the same newspaper ran a column
headlined: ``Bobby V Perfect Man for This Town and This Team.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the same writer who had vilified Valentine in the first
column, later wrote a glowing tribute after the Mets had won the
wild-card spot with a clutch sweep of the Pirates and a one-game
playoff win over Cincinnati.
   But that's Valentine: There are few emotions that aren't touched
where he's involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media in New York is pretty much split down the middle on
Bobby,'' says a longtime New York baseball writer. ``He reads
everything very closely and believes you're either for him or
against him. If you're against him, he doesn't have much use for
you. If he thinks you're giving him a fair shake, there's nothing
he won't do for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine is, according to longtime Mets' media relations
director Jay Horwitz, the best he's ever worked with.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 20 years in this business, I've never seen anyone more
accommodating to the media,'' Horwitz declares. ``But it doesn't
matter what he does, they still crucify him.''
</P>
<P>
   The TV camera loves his handsome, expressive face, his
unconcealed passion, his recklessness. He is brash, cocky,
paranoid, arrogant, controversial and amazingly candid, all the
things old-line baseball men detest.
</P>
<P>
   Is there another manager in baseball who would have had the
audacity to don a fake mustache and sunglasses and sneak back into
the dugout after an ejection during the team's earlier travails? Or
brashly predict that his team would go 40-15 over the next 55
games, and hit it right on the nose?
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give me credit for that one,'' Valentine says,
chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   A recent revealing ``Sports Illustrated'' article on the
``inside'' Valentine brought gasps of disapproval from around
baseball. Valentine just shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a good article,'' he says. ``The guy was
following me for three weeks. There were some times when I said,
`Now, you're not going to write this are you?' and he'd say, `No.
No,' but it was all in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what?''
</P>
<P>
   His one real regret, he says, is the section in which he said of
his players, ``You're not dealing with real intelligent guys, for
the most part,'' and ``there's about five guys in there right now
who basically are losers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I hadn't said that, but it's true,'' Valentine says.
``I called a team meeting and said, `Hey, if the shoe fits and
you've got a problem with it, let's go into my office and talk
about it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And if the shoe fits, they need a shoeshine.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Atlanta's Bobby Cox has managed rings around
Valentine in this playoff series. Based on postseason experience
alone, he should. I know this, it's a lot easier to manage when
you've got players like Maddux, Smoltz, Millwood, Glavine and
Rocker on your side. The Mets simply have not hit.
</P>
<P>
   But then, you can put me down on that shrinking list of
Valentine defenders. I like him both as a person and as a manager.
He came to the Rangers at one of the low points of the franchise's
existence, having been dragged into the gutter during the sordid
Doug Rader era, and no one worked harder to promote the team and
build it back to respectability than Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   The media here may have a love-hate affair with him, and the
Mets may yet can him _ two managers who finished behind him,
Philadelphia's Terry Francona and St. Louis' Tony La Russa, have
received extensions; Bobby V hasn't _ but the headline in
yesterday's ``Post'' was right: Valentine is perfect for New York.
</P>
<P>
   The day they fire him, he'll still be smiling.

CLEMENS VS. MARTINEZ IS A HIGH-STAKES SHOWDOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So far it has been a terrific series, potentially one
for the ages that people will be talking about for many years to
come.
</P>
<P>
   It has been two terrific teams in a historic rivalry and two
great games filled with tension, suspense, great plays and
controversial calls. The American League Championship Series
between the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees has been what
everybody expected.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the preliminaries. It's time for the main event.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens vs. Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The five-time Cy Young Award winner against the best pitcher in
baseball, going at it today on a late October afternoon at a
sold-out Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what baseball is all about,'' Yankees shortstop Derek
Jeter, echoing the thoughts of many. The anticipation has been
building since Yankees manager Joe Torre and Boston's Jimy Williams
announced their rotations Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be fun,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   The game means much more to the Red Sox, who trail two games to
none in the series after losing two one-run games at Yankee
Stadium. If they lose Game 3 today, the series is almost assuredly
over. No team in baseball history has ever rallied from three games
down to win a best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   If they win, Red Sox fans will once again have hope of another
sensational comeback, perhaps one even better than coming back from
two games down to beat the Cleveland Indians in the Division
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never easy being down 0-2,'' Williams said. ``We just
have to go out there and do the best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   But the implications for the Red Sox seem to run almost
secondary to the eagerly anticipated pitching match. The subplots
alone are delicious.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is returning to Fenway Park, his home with the Red Sox
for 13 years. He won the Cy Young Award three times while wearing
the Red Sox uniform before leaving in 1997 to pitch for the Toronto
Blue Jays. Now he's coming back as a member of the hated Yankees,
which should only enhance the booing he has had to endure from his
former fans for the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been back to Fenway many times,'' Clemens said. ``Going
to Texas for me is just as difficult. As much action as there's
going to be on the field, there's going to be in the stands. I just
hope it's as exciting as it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has not had a great year. After winning the Cy Young
Award twice with the Blue Jays, he went 14-10 with a 4.60
earned-run average for the Yankees. Those are hardly the numbers
they expected in spring training when he was acquired from the Blue
Jays for pitchers David Wells and Graeme Lloyd and second baseman
Homer Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But the road to redemption started in Arlington, when he wrapped
up the Division Series against the Rangers with seven scoreless
innings in the Yankees' 3-0 victory a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   He also knows that with a victory today, he will be on the verge
of going back to the World Series for the first time since 1986
with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get in these kind of games, you have to elevate your
focus,'' Clemens said. ``I know \Rtoday\S that will definitely have
to be the situation. I don't think I'm going to be afforded too
many mistakes against Pedro.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's record suggests that. No pitcher in baseball
performed better this year than the Red Sox ace. He was 23-4 with a
2.40 ERA, 313 strikeouts and won the Most Valuable Player Award in
the All-Star Game. He also strained a muscle in the back of his
shoulder in Game 1 of the Division Series against the Indians, an
injury that seemed to doom the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   But he came back with six scoreless innings in relief in Game 5,
allowing the Red Sox to complete their improbable comeback and
advance to the ALCS.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he has done this year is just tremendous,'' Clemens said.
``Everybody backs the truck up to him and he has to come out and do
it. It's been great for him, what he's been able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's shoulder is a concern but he said, ``I feel good. I
am sure I can work through it. And now I have more days to rest. I
should be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, well aware of his team's plight, has downplayed the
confrontation and the pressure that both pitchers will be under.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Roger is very professional, and he has been through
everything,'' Martinez said. ``He knows how to handle the situation
just like I will. I'm just going to go out and pitch the game, and
I'm sure he will too. I hope he puts a lot of pressure on himself,
and I hope he gives it up soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez blew away the Yankees on Sept. 10 at Yankee Stadium,
throwing a one-hitter while striking out 17.
</P>
<P>
   If Martinez wins, and the Red Sox stay alive, the 1999 ALCS has
a chance to reach epic proportions. It could also lead to another
epic matchup, given the way both rotations are set up.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez vs. Clemens in Game 7 at Yankee Stadium on Thursday
with a trip to the World Series on the line.

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR THE METS, A DREAM DEFERRED? 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shea Stadium was alive and crackling with the spirit
of playoff baseball Friday night. Fans came and unleashed the fury
of a decade worth of pent up emotions: everything from frustration
and anxiety to unbridled joy that the New York Mets had climbed so
many steep mountains to reach the National League Championship
Series.
</P>
<P>
   They came by elevated train, by car, by bus, to witness their
beloved Mets take the field in a home playoff game. As if they need
any more reason to be excited, Mets fans had been egged on by two
Atlanta Braves players.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones had suggested near the end of the season that the
Mets' fans go home and put on their ``Yankees stuff,'' and John
Rocker, the young, tough relief pitcher, had expressed disdain for
the Mets and even deeper dislike for their fans. So fans showed up
with signs and plenty of taunts in hopes of unnerving Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Some unnerving. Like so many strategies the Mets try against
Atlanta, it didn't work, as the Mets lost by 1-0 Friday night.
Within the first inning, Atlanta had scored a run, knocked Mike
Piazza dizzy and forced the normally infallible Mets' infield to
commit two errors. Atlanta is the team that has waited at the top
of the mountain each time the Mets got close, then pushed them back
down. The Mets were not so much decimated as demoralized.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two games of this series, the Mets would score a
run and Atlanta answered with two; the Mets would score two runs
and Atlanta answered with three or four. It began to seem that if
the Mets scored 100 runs, Atlanta would score 101.
</P>
<P>
   And not just Tuesday and Wednesday nights, but for two full
seasons. Anything the Mets have done, the Braves have done better,
and with maddening precision. They not only took Games 1 and 2 of
this series, but also seemed on the verge of snatching one of the
Mets' best assets: their resilient spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Al Leiter held Atlanta to one run, but Tom Glavine kept
the Mets scoreless. The Mets had just one poor inning _ the first.
Leiter and Piazza made throwing errors and the Braves had the only
run they needed. Except for those two plays in the first inning,
the Mets played brilliantly in the field. Mora threw out Bret Boone
at the plate and Rickey Henderson threw out two runners at second.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Valentine had changed the batting order before the game,
moved John Olerud to the No. 2 spot, Edgardo Alfonzo to No. 3 and
Melvin Mora started in center field. The only way to defeat the
Braves and their closer John Rocker is to have the lead going into
the final innings, but Friday night the Mets trailed by a run.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets co-owner, Fred Wilpon, had tried to raise the Mets'
spirits on Thursday. At the Mets' workout at Shea, he walked out of
the dugout with his manager as if on parade as a wave of
journalists followed. Wilpon made a point of speaking to each of
the potential goats of this series. He walked out to visit Rickey
Henderson. He had an animated conversation with Bobby Bonilla.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Wilpon walked back to the dugout and held court. ``Our
team is loose,'' he said. ``They're ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been a dream ride for the Mets. Two weeks ago Friday
the Mets opened a series in this stadium against Pittsburgh,
desperately needing a miracle just to qualify for the chance to get
into post-season play. The Mets got their miracle with Cincinnati
losing twice to Milwaukee, and the Mets swept Pittsburgh. The Mets
and their fans jumped sky high and never came back to earth as the
Mets won the playoff game against Cincinnati, then managed three
victories out of four games against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have been yanked back to earth, once again, by Atlanta.
But when someone asked Wilpon if he was ready to cash in the chips
and begin thinking of what a great season this had been, he cut in.
``No way, I'm not even going to let you finish. We're in it for
this series. We're going to win some games here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets will win one battle: There were 6,000 empty seats at
Turner Field for Games 1 and 2. Shea Stadium was packed and rocking
Friday night. Even the lack of a sellout is the signature of how
comfortable Atlanta fans have become with their team's success.
That lack of passion is precisely the reason Atlanta has won just
one World Series championship in a decade the franchise has
otherwise dominated. This sets up a classic confrontation with the
Yankees: Atlanta is the team of the decade, but the Yankees are the
franchise of the century.
</P>
<P>
   But all this is at an entirely different level from where the
Mets and their fans find themselves this weekend, hungry after 11
seasons without a championship, chasing a dream that stays just
beyond their grasp.

EDITORIAL: THE PEACE PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 2nd graf to add word `AID' to end of last sent.; last graf to
CORRECT date of 1st prize and that Red Cross was a co-recipient.) (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times Said in an editorial for Saturday, Oct. 16:
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 dozens of humanitarian organizations were working to
feed, house and care for the health of Rwandan refugees in camps
just over the border in Zaire. The camps were full of fleeing
Rwandan Hutus _ and, it gradually became apparent, full of Hutu
soldiers guilty of genocide, who were directing food and other aid
to their own troops. A large portion of food was going not to needy
innocents, but to support the reorganization of a genocidal army.
</P>
<P>
   Medecins Sans Frontieres, which was treating cholera in the
camps, was the first group to decide to pull out in protest. It
left the Zaire camps with a very public warning about the
manipulation of aid. The controversial decision prodded the United
Nations to improve its control over food aid.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which in America is called Doctors Without Borders,
won the Nobel Peace Prize Friday. The prize was principally a
recognition of the group's humanitarian mission, but its political
dexterity is also a noteworthy part of its story. The organization
was founded in a simpler time, before post-Cold War chaos
complicated the politics of humanitarian relief. In 1971 a group of
French doctors who had worked in the Biafran war _ including
Bernard Kouchner, now running the U.N. mission in Kosovo _
organized Doctors Without Borders. The doctors felt that aid
organizations were too slow to bring medical relief and suffered
from restrictions that kept them from denouncing abuses. The
group's first humanitarian effort was to treat earthquake victims
in Nicaragua the next year. It now sends about 2,000 people a year
to provide rapid medical care to refugees from countless wars and
victims of natural disasters, famine and diseases such as
meningitis in Nigeria, AIDS in Thailand and tuberculosis in Eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The group acquired a reputation for agility in both bringing
help and attracting publicity. But this outspokenness has made it a
leader among humanitarian groups in wrestling with the new politics
of aid. In 1985 it criticized Ethiopia's mass expulsions of people
from the north of the country, where rebels were active. The group
was run out of Ethiopia, but its warning helped limit the
expulsions.
</P>
<P>
   Today, these dilemmas are worldwide. Humanitarian groups must
worry about how aid is used by the very people who caused the
crisis. Warlords deliberately starve a region, and then steal the
food aid and the vehicles it arrives in. Governments engage in
widespread ethnic cleansing, knowing that aid organizations will
care for the refugees, thus hurrying their exodus.
</P>
<P>
   The award to Doctors Without Borders echoes the first Nobel
Peace Prize of the century, given in 1901, of which the founder of
the Red Cross was a co-recipient. The doctors' group is a far
blander choice than some other nominees for the prize, such as
Chinese dissidents. But more than most humanitarian groups, Doctors
Without Borders has understood that aid today is as fraught with
ethical and political controversies as the rest of the world's
decisions regarding war and peace, life and death.
