<HEADLINE> Clinton in Oslo for Mideast Summit Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *By KARIN LAUB 	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- President Clinton said today he hopes to  
inject ``new energy'' into the Israeli-Palestinian peace process as 
negotiations enter their last, decisive phase -- a 10-month quest 
for a final treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-day Mideast summit opening today in Oslo sets the stage  
for arduous negotiations on Palestinian statehood, creating a new 
sense of urgency after weeks of delays and sluggish preparations. 
Clinton meets separately today with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud 
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat ahead of three-way talks 
on Tuesday 
</P>
<P>
	``It's coming at a good time,'' Clinton said today. ``I believe  
that Prime Minister Barak and Chairman Arafat want to continue the 
peace process. And we are now to the point where the really 
difficult decisions lie ahead. ... And so we're hopeful that we'll 
make some progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barak said he believes one outcome of the Oslo talks will be  
setting a target date for a Camp David-style summit, possibly in 
Washington, early next year. ``I'm convinced that if we are 
determined and the two sides are willing to face the problem, it is 
possible,'' Barak said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief, hilltop ceremony, Clinton and Norway's King Harald V  
reviewed troops as a long line of palace guards wearing derby hats 
and feathered plumes lined the streets leading to the castle. Queen 
Sonja and Princess Martha Louise stood by on a chilly morning with 
gray skies. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Clinton was meeting Norway's Prime Minister Kjell Magne  
Bondevik at Government House. 
</P>
<P>
	At the peace talks, breakthrough on substance is unlikely, but  
Arafat and Barak will get a chance to sound each other out on keys 
issues and may try to reach agreement on the format of their 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak spoke cautiously Sunday of a ``feeling of possible  
momentum,'' while Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, said he hoped the 
summit would give negotiators the necessary nudge. 
</P>
<P>
	The emotional centerpiece of the summit is a memorial service  
Tuesday for Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister assassinated 
on Nov. 4, 1995, by an ultranationalist Jew trying to prevent the 
handover of West Bank land to the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview airing today on CBS' ``Early Show,'' Clinton  
said gathering in Rabin's memory may ``give some new energy to this 
process.'' He praised Barak and Arafat for cooperating on a time 
table and security concerns, but said agreement may be elusive now 
that they are taking up more difficult issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've known what these issues are for a long time now, they're  
not going to get any easier,'' Clinton said. ``So whatever ... the 
United States can do to facilitate a timely resolution of these 
issues, I think, will be positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All three leaders had forged close bonds with Rabin -- Barak was  
his protege, Clinton came to admire him and even Arafat, Rabin's 
former nemesis, later spoke of him as his ``partner in peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commemoration is a ``symbolic victory over all those who  
wanted to jeopardize the peace process,'' said Israeli legislator 
Uri Savir, who helped set up the secret Oslo talks that led to the 
1993 breakthrough agreement between Israel and the Palestine 
Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat's aides say his top priority in Oslo is to win assurances  
from Clinton that Israel will slow or freeze construction of Jewish 
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The United States has 
said settlements are ``destructive'' to peace, but it has not 
publicly reprimanded Barak for approving new homes at a faster pace 
than his hard-line predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Arafat has been careful not to threaten to suspend  
negotiations over the construction. Abbas would only say Sunday 
that settlement expansion ``would be a major obstacle'' to a 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak, in turn, wants to redefine the goals of a peace  
agreement. He says the initial dream of close cooperation between 
Israelis and Palestinians aimed too high, and that the best the 
current tense climate may yield is peaceful separation enforced by 
electric fences. 
</P>
<P>
	Such talk has alarmed the Palestinians, who fear their economy  
will wither if cut off from Israeli markets. U.S. officials have 
warned the Israelis that a separation will hurt stability. 
</P>
<P>
	There may also be disagreements on the format on the  
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat is pressing Clinton to play an active role, feeling he  
needs U.S. help to face the Israelis. Barak opposes U.S. 
intervention, a position that may eventually put him at odds with 
Clinton, who is determined to forge a historic treaty before he 
leaves office in January 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak wants to hold one-on-one talks with the Palestinian leader  
to formulate the outline of a peace treaty by a February deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat hasn't decided yet, waiting to hear more from Barak and  
Clinton during the summit. For now, the two chief negotiators, 
Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo and Israeli 
diplomat Oded Eran, are to meet Nov. 7 for a first round of 
negotiations.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Appeals Internet Access Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- AT&AMP;T is taking its case for control of  
cable Internet access to a federal appeals court, four months after 
after a judge sided with one of the first U.S. cities to stand up 
to the telecommunications giant. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T wants total control of the cable TV network it acquired in  
a merger last year with Tele-Communications Inc. AT&AMP;T now plans to 
turn the system into a high-speed data pipeline linking Portland 
homes and businesses to the Internet 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The city and Multnomah County, however, passed ordinances  
requiring AT&AMP;T to open its network -- and its Internet pipeline -- to 
competitors who would share the cable system. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T responded by taking the city and county to federal court.  
But U.S. District Judge Owen Panner ruled in favor of Portland and 
Multnomah County, granting their request last June to dismiss the 
AT&AMP;T lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T appealed, and the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals was  
scheduled to hear oral arguments in the case today in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	The city and county say the Federal Communications Commission  
has decreased its regulatory role in order to encourage 
competition, but unless local governments take action, high-speed 
access to the Net may be limited to just a handful of companies -- 
or maybe just one. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's called logical, consistent thinking, which  
unfortunately is not the way of Washington, D.C., right now,'' said 
A. Michael Noll, a University of Southern California communications 
professor and a former AT&AMP;T employee. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T claims that limiting the number of access providers may not  
be so bad, because a company that can plan its investment in all 
the equipment it requires to run the Internet through TV cables can 
offer service faster, cheaper and more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're moving into an information-based economy. People who  
don't have access are at a disadvantage,'' said Milo Medin, chief 
technology officer of Excite@Home, AT&AMP;T's cable service partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, AT&AMP;T officials have argued, telephone companies such as  
U S West have already begun providing high-speed Internet access 
competition with their digital subscriber line, or DSL, service -- a 
way of pumping data over old copper phone lines at high speed. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, and a host of other Internet service providers, also claim  
that local government regulations will vary across the nation, 
forcing costly changes in equipment and services that will 
ultimately affect the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, a group of Internet and high-tech companies wrote  
the FCC, saying the Portland cable access case could lead to 
``Balkanization'' of regulatory authority and slow Internet growth 
and innovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prospect of 30,000 local jurisdictions setting their own  
policies on matters relating to the Internet is the stuff that 
gives Internet business people like me nightmares,'' said Jerry 
Kaplan, CEO of Onsale Inc., an electronic retailer. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC has said the cable Internet market must be allowed to  
develop before it decides on regulatory policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC estimates that only 1 million Americans have high-speed  
capability right now, out of 40 million residential Internet 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of other municipalities have followed Oregon,  
including Broward County, Fla. Last week, St. Louis voted to force 
open access in a preliminary vote. The final vote should come this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	But other municipalities, including the local cable commission  
that oversees the western Portland suburbs in Tualatin Valley, have 
decided against forcing AT&AMP;T to share its network with competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th Circuit is unlikely to rule until next year.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, AT&AMP;T is staying on schedule to upgrade its cable  
network to provide both data and voice service, but it won't 
activate service until the lawsuit is resolved, company officials 
say.

<HEADLINE> GOP Candidate Looks To Grab Philly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Basic math would appear to be working  
against Sam Katz in his bid Tuesday to be the first GOP mayor of 
Philadelphia in nearly 50 years: There are seven Democrats here for 
every two Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	But the latest polls showed the businessman, who has never held  
elective office, in a dead heat against Democratic City Councilman 
John F. Street. President Clinton and Massachusetts Sen. Edward 
Kennedy came to Philadelphia to energize Street supporters last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz, who is white, spent the weekend trying to shore up support  
among black voters -- a key constituency since his opponent, like 40 
percent of Philadelphia's 1.4 million residents, is black. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP hopes Katz can do what white Republicans did earlier  
this decade in New York and Los Angeles -- win the mayor's job in a 
heavily Democratic, ethnically diverse city. That's one reason why 
the race here is one of the highlights of elections around the 
country Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other important contests is the governor's race in  
Mississippi, where the Republican governor is retiring. The 
Democratic candidate, Lt. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove, has a good chance 
of reclaiming the office for his party, which did the same thing 
last year in Alabama and South Carolina. He faces GOP former Rep. 
Mike Parker. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic governor of Kentucky, Paul Patton, is expected to  
win a second term. 
</P>
<P>
	The momentum could be moving in the opposite direction in  
Virginia, where the top three elected officials are Republicans. 
The GOP is within one seat of gaining control of the Legislature 
for the first time in 140 years, and after Tuesday could be in 
position to control the redrawing of congressional districts in 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	In other cities with mayoral races, Democrats hope to end  
decades of Republican control in Indianapolis and Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	In Philadelphia, Katz is making his third try for political  
office, having lost bids for mayor in 1991 and for governor in 
1994. He may be the more experienced campaigner, even though Street 
has spent 19 years on the City Council and seven years as its 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz is ``very seasoned,'' said Democratic political consultant  
Larry Ceisler. ``John Street had never run before outside a 
district council seat, and it shows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Katz, an adviser to local governments and an expert on stadium  
financing, has tried to position himself as a moderate best able to 
build on the economic recovery generated under popular two-term 
Mayor Edward G. Rendell. He has also tried to play down party 
affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems to be working.  
</P>
<P>
	Katz has the support of Philadelphia's NAACP president and a  
black politician who lost to Street in the Democratic primary. He 
won crucial endorsements from The Philadelphia Inquirer and the 
Philadelphia Daily News, which hadn't endorsed a Republican in 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most success has its roots in failure,'' Katz said  
Monday at a transit stop, referring to his earlier runs. ``I think 
I became a more relaxed candidate, I connected better with the 
public, I showed more of my personality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Street, who would be the city's second black mayor, has had to  
overcome his old reputation as a fiery community activist who once 
sucker-punched a reporter and twice declared bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	But his campaign has gathered steam in recent weeks, helped by  
the Clinton and Kennedy visit Friday. Street also has a large 
get-out-the-vote operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have a great field organization and we're going  
to have a great Democratic victory,'' said Street, campaigning 
Monday with Rendell. ``It really feels good out here.''

<HEADLINE> Newspapers Lose Bid To Avoid Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to spare two  
Louisiana newspapers from having to defend themselves at trial 
against a lawsuit for reporting details of an illegally recorded 
telephone conversation after the tape was played at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, which has not tackled a free-press case for nearly a  
decade, turned away arguments that the Constitution's First 
Amendment protection of press freedom shields the newspapers from 
Louisiana's wiretapping law because they did not make the illegal 
recording. 
</P>
<P>
	An appeal making those arguments was rejected without comment.  
Today's court action sets no legal precedent, and does not preclude 
the possibility the justices might agree to review the Louisiana 
dispute should it ever return to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Central Newspapers Inc., which publishes the Alexandria Daily  
Town Talk, and Avoyelles Publishing Co., publisher of the weekly 
Avoyelles Journal, are being sued by former judge Michael Johnson 
and McKinley ``Pop'' Keller, an Avoyelles Parish police juror -- the 
equivalent of a county commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Carol Aymond Jr., who lost a judicial election to  
Johnson in 1996, called a news conference five weeks later to 
allege corruption and possible vote-buying by Johnson and Keller. 
He said he had obtained a tape recording of a telephone 
conversation between the two men, and played it. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters for both newspapers attended the news conference and  
wrote stories about Aymond's allegations, including what was on the 
tape. 
</P>
<P>
	Aymond and the newspapers were named defendants in the  
invasion-of-privacy lawsuit, which alleged violations of a 
Louisiana law that prohibits recording private telephone 
conversations. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said the newspapers had violated the law by  
publishing the contents of the conversation revealed at the news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	In a later and unrelated hearing, the Louisiana Supreme Court  
removed Johnson from the bench for ethical misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	A state trial judge granted the newspapers' requests that they  
be dropped from the case, but a state appeals court reinstated 
them. The appeals court ruled that criminal willfulness is not 
required for punishing ``secondary disclosures and publication of 
previously intercepted communications'' under the wiretapping law. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court also ruled that neither the federal nor state  
constitutional guarantees of press freedom trumped the state law. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Supreme Court, by a 4-3 vote, refused to review the  
appeals court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the Indianapolis-based  
Central Newspapers Inc. urged the justices to protect ``publication 
of truthful information regarding matters of acute public 
concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court in 1989 limited states' power to punish the reporting  
of truthful information that is lawfully obtained. That decision 
spared a Florida newspaper from having to pay damages to a rape 
victim whose name it published in violation of state law after a 
sheriff's department mistakenly released the information. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said then: ``Where a newspaper publishes truthful  
information which it has lawfully obtained, punishment may lawfully 
be imposed, if at all, only when narrowly tailored to a state 
interest of the highest order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's appeal argued that Louisiana ``lacks an interest of the  
highest order in punishing ... publication'' of the news stories at 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Johnson and Keller called the appeal premature and  
urged the justices to reject it. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices have not fully decided a case involving press  
freedom since a pair of rulings in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	In one, they said the First Amendment's protection does not  
shield the news media from libel lawsuits based on fabricated 
quotes that changed the meaning of what really was said. In the 
other, they ruled that news media organizations can be sued when 
breaking a promise to keep a source's identity confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	The case acted on today is Central Newspapers vs. Johnson,  
99-42.

<HEADLINE> McCain's Temper May Become Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The largest newspaper in Sen. John McCain's home  
state is suggesting that the Republican presidential candidate's 
quick temper could hinder him if he reaches the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	In a front-page article and a separate editorial Sunday, The  
Arizona Republic said it wanted the nation to know about the 
``volcanic'' temper McCain has unleashed on several top state 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who have been on the receiving end of a McCain uproar  
include Republican Gov. Jane Hull and two Democrats, former Gov. 
Rose Mofford and former Mayor Paul Johnson of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hull, a supporter of GOP presidential front-runner George  
W. Bush, has acknowledged that her relationship with McCain has 
been cool and said recently that McCain ``has to keep control'' of 
his temper. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor had no further comment on the issue and ``she wants  
to move on to other things,'' spokesman Francie Noyes said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Republic, which endorsed McCain for each of his five  
congressional races but has not made an endorsement in the 
presidential contest, was direct. 
</P>
<P>
	It declared in the editorial:  
</P>
<P>
	``If McCain is truly a serious contender for the presidency, it  
is time the rest of the nation learned about the John McCain we 
know in Arizona. There is also reason to seriously question whether 
he has the temperament, and the political approach and skills, we 
want in the next president of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain spokesman Dan Schnur said the criticism reflects the  
senator's emergence as a serious contender, resulting media 
scrutiny and the fact that the former Vietnam POW ``is a fighter 
and has always been a fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When a candidate moves up in the polls as quickly as John  
McCain has there's bound to be closer media scrutiny,'' Schnur 
said. ``Show me a politician who's never offended anyone and I'll 
show you a politician who's pretty useless to his constituents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, McCain blamed the Bush campaign for helping plant  
recent stories concerning his temper and said the ``hothead'' 
portrayal was inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I insult anybody or fly off the handle or anything like  
that? No, I don't,'' he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	Pam Johnson, executive editor of the Republic, said her  
newspaper's coverage decisions were made independently, not at the 
suggestion of anyone in the Bush campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the admirable qualities of Sen. McCain have been  
widely reported nationally. A lot of the temperament issues have 
not,'' said Johnson, who is in charge of the paper's editorial and 
news pages. 
</P>
<P>
	Even some of McCain's supporters acknowledge he has a short  
fuse, but say that should not disqualify him to be president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think John McCain is as steady as they come. I've seen him  
get really passionate about issues, but I don't see it as losing 
control,'' said Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz. He called McCain's 
passion refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, McCain has kept his temper under control,  
publicly at least. He showed restraint during Senate floor debate 
on campaign finance reform -- one of his priority issues -- when Sen. 
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., tried to goad him. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Sabato, a political science professor the University of  
Virginia, said McCain's temper is a legitimate subject for 
questions, but noted a number of president have had fiery tempers. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidents Johnson and Nixon were famous for having bad tempers.  
President Clinton has become known for having one too. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not disqualifying because so many presidents have had bad  
tempers, but it's important to know about,'' Sabato said. ``You 
want to know what the fundamental character of a candidate for 
president is.''

<HEADLINE> Tears for Those Aboard Flight 990 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Hisham Ahmed Omar tried desperately to get  
on EgyptAir's direct Flight 990 to Cairo, but last-minute shopping 
got him to his travel agent a few minutes late. The office had 
closed, and Omar resigned himself to a 30-hour journey with a 
stopover in London. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was cursing my travel agent for this trip,'' he said, ``and  
it was a gift from God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, at the airport in Cairo, friends and family of the 217  
people aboard Flight 990 collapsed or wept when they learned that 
loved ones were aboard the EgyptAir jetliner that crashed nearly an 
hour after taking off from New York's Kennedy International 
Airport. Nobody was believed to have survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Fakhri Hassan said his nephew, Adel Maher, 22, called him from  
New York to let him know that Flight 990 was running late. A few 
hours later, Hassan heard about the crash on the television news 
and headed to Cairo International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if he is alive or in the water or under the  
water,'' Hassan said, holding back tears. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, few signs remained of the trauma of the night  
before. The makeshift information center in Terminal One was being 
swept clear of tissues, plastic cups and cigarette butts. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of the victims began arriving at the airport's  
EgyptAir sales office to inquire about arrangements to be flown to 
the United States to identify the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Some grieving relatives who did not have passports were  
immediately sent to apply for the documents, but they complained 
they were required to pay a photograph fee and another charge for 
the passport application. 
</P>
<P>
	At the U.S. Embassy, normal procedures were scrapped to speed up  
the issuing of visas, and a few had been issued late Sunday, said 
spokesman Dave Ballard. Ballard said the embassy had received 
hundreds of calls to a special information line it had set up, and 
he added that officials were focused on helping the State 
Department in Washington compile a list of Americans on board based 
on reports from relatives and other sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a reason to believe that a large number of American  
citizens were aboard the aircraft,'' Ballard said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 13 Canadians were also on the EgyptAir flight, Canada's  
Foreign Affairs Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamdi Hanafi was one of those inquiring at the airport today.  
His daughter, Wala, was on the plane, returning to Cairo from her 
first trip abroad. She had spent the last two months visiting her 
aunt in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanafi was holding his daughter's pink university identification  
card, showing a picture of a girl with shoulder-length dark hair 
and a big smile. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibrahim Qassem lost his son Tamer, 24, on the flight. He worked  
for the International Monetary Fund and was on his first trip 
abroad, attending a seminar in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want him to go to New York,'' Qassem said. ``I just  
had a bad feeling about this.'' The grieving father, smoking 
nervously, said he will not go to identify the body. ``I cannot do 
it.'' Instead, two of Tamer's cousins will make the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 990, which originated in Los Angeles, took off from New  
York at 1:19 a.m. local time and disappeared from radar while 
flying at 33,000 feet. It plummeted to the sea off Nantucket Island 
in two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Egypt has asked the United States to take the lead in the crash  
investigation. Egyptian experts and airline officials were planning 
to travel Tuesday to New York on an EgyptAir flight, along with 
relatives who were to help identify victims. 
</P>
<P>
	President Hosni Mubarak said today he was shocked after first  
hearing the news on CNN. ``It is a big tragedy for us,'' Mubarak 
told reporters today in a brief news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	A soccer match Sunday evening in Cairo between the Olympic teams  
of Egypt and Tunisia started with a moment of silence in honor of 
the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Omar, an engineer for the Egyptian oil company Gupco who had  
spent two weeks in New Orleans on a business course, said he called 
his brother Osama in Cairo as soon as he heard about the crash to 
let his family know he was safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Omar's wife, however, had already heard word of the crash and  
had rushed to the airport. She called her husband's company and 
received the news that he was returning through London. 
</P>
<P>
	Omar, heading home with his 18-month-old daughter Arwa in his  
arms, said he plans to stick closer to Cairo: ``It was the first 
time I went to America, and it was also the last time.''

<HEADLINE> Swedish Newspaper Eyes Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- The Metro newspaper was just an idea  
five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the splashy, free daily tabloid is a must-read for hundreds  
of thousands of commuters in its hometown of Stockholm, and 
editions in local languages are printed in a half dozen other 
European cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans are under way to start editions in the United States,  
South America and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We aim to start publishing in as many cities as possible in as  
little time as possible,'' said Metro's editor in chief, Sakari 
Pitkanen. 
</P>
<P>
	In an era when many newspapers are seeing declines in readership  
and revenues due to competition from TV, radio and the Internet, 
Metro is drawing readers with a bright format of short stories and 
colorful graphics. Many items are just one paragraph, some just one 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get a feeling you know what's happened without having to  
dig too deep,'' said Ulla Stenfors, who reads Metro each weekday on 
her subway ride to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Metro prints about 380,000 copies a day in Sweden, 130,000 in  
Helsinki, Finland, and 250,000 in the Netherlands. It also 
publishes in Prague, Czech Republic, and Budapest, Hungary, and 
says it plans to start editions sometime in the new year in 
Philadelphia and Santiago, Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	An English-language Metro will hit the streets of the Newcastle  
region of northeastern England early in 2000, the publisher's chief 
executive, Pelle Toernberg, said Oct. 14. A Swiss version is 
promised for Zurich in the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Blair, chief financial officer for Metro International,  
said the group also is looking at New York, Chicago, San Francisco, 
Boston, Singapore, Hong Kong, Beijing and Sydney, Australia, for 
future editions. 
</P>
<P>
	It remains to be seen if Metro's formula can succeed everywhere,  
considering when many longtime papers have gone out of business and 
few new papers have established themselves. But Constantine Kamaras 
of the World Association of Newspapers thinks Metro may have 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	``They certainly have proven that they have a strong chance,''  
he said. ``However, perhaps now newspaper publishers are becoming 
more concerned and will shape up and get ready to defend their 
territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In London, for instance, Associated Newspapers launched its own  
free daily called Metro, and in the Netherlands, newspaper 
heavyweight De Telegraaf came out with its own free paper after 
Metro began its Dutch edition. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia Newspapers, publisher of The Philadelphia Inquirer  
and the Philadelphia Daily News, says it is prepared for Metro's 
entry into its market, although executives decline to say if any 
special steps are being taken. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like any other competition, we take the arrival of Metro very  
seriously,'' said Pamela Browner, vice president of business and 
community affairs at the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Metro works best in cities where public transportation systems  
are well developed, Kamaras said. But big-city papers with strong 
local news coverage could counter Metro's business premise and 
limit its economic success, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Metro relies solely on advertisements to make money -- the  
Stockholm edition is packed with classified ads. It holds costs 
down by using the latest news production technology, keeping staffs 
to a minimum and distributing the paper by dropping bundles at busy 
spots like subway stops, ferry landings and bus stations. 
</P>
<P>
	About six of every 10 Stockholmers read the Metro at least twice  
a week, according to a recent survey. In Goteborg, Sweden's second 
largest city where it debuted last year, three of 10 people read 
the paper at least twice weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of Goteborg's Metro readers are younger than 30 -- a coveted  
group that has proven tough for traditional newspapers to reach. 
The survey also found traditional papers haven't lost many readers 
to Metro. Instead, their subscribers read Metro as a complement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingela Wadbring, a media researcher at Goteborg University, said  
Metro strengthens the newspaper market by bringing in new readers. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who haven't read a morning paper before have started to  
read Metro,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigrants, young people and people with low incomes read Metro  
almost exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
	In Stockholm's less affluent areas, where newspaper readership  
traditionally has been lower, readership is now at almost the same 
high level as the rest of Sweden -- 75 percent, Wadbring said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike many local competitors, the Metro format puts national  
and international news ahead of local news. 
</P>
<P>
	``Geography doesn't matter. We know what's in our readers'  
minds,'' Pitkanen said. ``It's an efficient, quickly read news 
summary of the most important events, and that's what people 
want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All its city versions have a similar look -- a simple layout with  
many graphics -- that Pitkanen argues is attractive to readers. 
</P>
<P>
	But while he feels that approach can succeed in many countries,  
he doesn't think Metro's expansion is a threat to competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if there were a paper named Metro in each country, there  
would be a whole lot more papers that weren't named Metro,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Grandparents Among EgyptAir Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	They were Egyptian grandparents visiting their American  
grandkids, retirees headed for a Nile cruise, a Canadian newspaper 
executive and his wife eager to climb the pyramids. 
</P>
<P>
	All perished when EgyptAir Flight 990 fell to the sea off  
Nantucket, leaving stunned and grieving loved ones behind around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives and friends gathered at a hotel near John F. Kennedy  
International Airport, where the Cairo-bound plane took off early 
Sunday, and later at mosques in New York and Los Angeles, where 
Flight 990 began. All day, survivors waited with little hope of 
good news. The day dragged on in tears. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Talaat Abdalmoneim rocked back and forth, his face swollen  
with weeping when he came to pray after nightfall at his mosque, 
the Islamic Center of Long Island in Westbury, 30 miles east of New 
York City. As trick-or-treaters traipsed through the suburban 
neighborhood, Abdalmoneim seemed a world away in his sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdalmoneim's parents had stayed with his family the past few  
months. But Abdel-Rahman Amin, the owner of a coffee factory and in 
his 60s and his wife, Alia Abdou, were eager to return to Egypt for 
the birth of their 11th grandchild. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've been a good son,'' Abdalmoneim said mournfully.  
``They've been sick and I took them to various doctors for 
treatment, just like when I was a boy, they took care of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His parents nearly missed the flight, sharing coffee, tea and  
talk with their son before heading to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Mere hours after Hisham Elzanaty, 40, of Searingtown, N.Y., put  
his parents on their plane home to Cairo, he was awakened with the 
news that their flight was missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Elzanaty and his brother, Tarec Elzanaty, went to the hotel by  
the airport. Later, they, too, came to their white mosque with its 
green dome for a special mourners' service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot express the sorrow, life will never be the same  
without my parents,'' Hisham Elzanaty said. ``We spent last night 
together until one in the morning. They prayed for us, and we 
wished them a safe flight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tarec, 39, stiff and barely able to speak, said they were  
consoled at the airport by sympathetic dignitaries like Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani and an EgyptAir executive. ``They were all doing a 
superb job, but nobody can save us from this loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Islamic Center of Southern California, more than 200  
people chanted ``Allahu Akbar,'' praying for the memories of two 
EgyptAir pilots who attended the mosque during Los Angeles 
stopovers. 
</P>
<P>
	One was Hatem Rushdy, said mosque member Aboubakr El-Tawansy. He  
had known Rushdy for about five years, since the pilot helped his 
daughter on a flight from Los Angeles to Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	``He upgraded her seats because she wasn't breathing well in a  
smoking area and was very generous with her,'' El-Tawansy said. 
``Since she heard the news, she's been crying and crying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The passengers included 54 people, all over age 50, bound for  
Cairo and a 14-day tour offered by Grand Circle Corp. of Boston. 
Most hailed from Colorado, Arizona and the Pacific Northwest, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Montreal, Canada, shocked colleagues remembered Claude  
Masson, deputy publisher of Montreal La Presse, where he spent most 
of his career. Masson and his wife, Jeannine Bourdages, both 58, 
parents of two grown sons, planned a week in Egypt and two more in 
Israel, said La Presse managing editor, Marcel Desjardins. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a place he always wanted to see, Desjardins said, once  
planning the trip only to postpone it. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he told us he was going to use his vacation to visit  
Egypt, go down the Nile River, climb the pyramids, one of our 
vice-presidents warned him it's not a very safe region to visit,'' 
said publisher Roger Landry. Masson, a keen traveler, brushed off 
the warning. 
</P>
<P>
	Norm and Joan Shapiro and Larry and Edith Kowalsky, all of  
suburban Detroit, were said to be on the flight and traveling 
together on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was their thing,'' Elliot Shepard, a longtime friend of  
both couples, told the Detroit Free Press. ``They wanted to see the 
world before it was too late.''

<HEADLINE> Deal Made on Taxing US-Owned Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANCUN, Mexico (AP) -- The United States and Mexico have worked  
out a deal over how to tax U.S.-owned firms that assemble duty-free 
goods in Mexico for export, averting a threatened exodus of 
investment from Mexico's northern border states. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico announced Friday it has dropped plans to tax U.S. firms  
on profits generated at Mexican ``maquiladora'' plants, starting 
Jan. 1. Instead, it will impose higher tax rates and a new tax 
structure on the U.S. firms' Mexican affiliates in an effort to get 
more tax revenue from an industry it says enjoys preferential 
treatment. The additional expenses can be deducted from a company's 
U.S. taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agreement allows for a more equitable distribution of tax  
revenue between the two countries and without increasing a 
company's total tax burden,'' said Tomas Ruiz, Mexico's deputy 
finance minister. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangement lasts through 2002 and will be replaced with a  
``permanent'' solution, Ruiz told the National Maquiladora 
Association annual convention. Mexico hopes to reach a long-term 
agreement with the United States by the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The plants are increasingly important to Mexico's economy,  
employing 1.1 million people at an average salary four times the 
minimum wage. The plants generated $40 billion in exports during 
the first eight months of the year, or 46 percent of Mexico's total 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, signed Wednesday, followed six months of negotiations  
between Mexico's Finance Ministry and the U.S. Internal Revenue 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Maquiladoras had threatened to halt investment, or even shut  
down, if Mexico attempted to tax the U.S. firms, in addition to the 
Mexican affiliates, on profits generated at the plants. Apart from 
double taxation, U.S. firms worried about opening their books to 
Mexican authorities without generally accepted guidelines on how to 
tax foreign-generated profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The firms generate little profit because they sell products at  
low prices to parent companies in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's happy with the outcome,'' said Lawrence Amrich,  
director of government relations in Mexico at Delphi Automotive 
Systems, the country's largest maquiladora owner with 53 plants and 
75,000 employees. ``The biggest question is what happens after 
2002. It really kicks it into the next administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both the United States and Mexico hold presidential elections  
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``On balance, it's positive,'' said Luis Martinez, who heads the  
maquiladora association's fiscal committee. ``It removes the 
uncertainty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, maquiladoras can pay taxes on 6.9 percent  
of assets, up from 5 percent currently, or on 6.5 percent of total 
costs, whichever is higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Firms could instead choose to pay taxes on theoretical profits.  
That option is already in place, but Mexico will now consider 
foreign-owned assets in determining a product's worth, not only the 
value-added component, effectively raising its value.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Shows Art Treasures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans who might never have the chance to  
stroll through the White House can join first lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton on a televised tour of its varied art collection. 
</P>
<P>
	The half-hour look at the collection, which includes four  
multimillion-dollar paintings by Paul Cezanne, often called the 
father of modern art, premieres tonight on Ovation, a cable TV 
network devoted to the arts. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also a Georgia O'Keeffe work that the artist kept with  
her until her death, a portrait of President Theodore Roosevelt by 
John Singer Sargent -- and the pick of anything the first family 
wants to borrow from the national museums. 
</P>
<P>
	On the show, which Ovation will carry at 8 p.m. EST and three  
more times in November, Mrs. Clinton is accompanied by J. Carter 
Brown, chairman of the U.S. Fine Arts Commission and head of the 
network. The show has a potential audience of 16 million 
households. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady emphasized her enthusiasm for bringing modern art  
to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we were the first ever to hang a De Kooning, for  
example, or a Kandinsky,'' she said. ``In our private quarters they 
fill the space of this very long center hallway that goes from the 
east to the west end of the second floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Willem de Kooning was a Dutch-born artist who became prominent  
among American abstract painters and died in 1997. Wassily 
Kandinsky, one of the first abstractionists, died in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton pointed proudly to the sculpture garden outside the  
corridor leading to the East Wing of the White House, where 
thousands of visitors see it on regular tours. On view when the 
tour was taped were the works of modern French sculptor Auguste 
Rodin and Americans he influenced. 
</P>
<P>
	It made the first lady think of a modern British sculptor with a  
personal meaning for her as a law student at Yale, where she first 
met President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was this wonderful Henry Moore -- a seated woman -- long  
admired and in part loved because it marked our first date,'' she 
recalled on the show. ``Sculpture is a big part of our 
relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown pointed out what may be the most valuable part of the  
White House collection. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Cezanne landscape, with its blocky, chunkiness  
prefiguring cubism, is one of eight paintings by the artist ... 
bought early on by an adventurous American collector before Cezanne 
became revered as he is today,'' Brown said. Charles Loeser left 
them to the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Truman felt the National Gallery should show them,  
as they were not by an American artist,'' Brown said. ``Mrs. 
(Jacqueline) Kennedy was not long in office, however, before she 
called the gallery and asked to see them, and as a young staff 
member I was assigned to hang a selection of them in this house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the paintings have historic as well as artistic  
significance. Brown cited the portrait of George Washington by 
Gilbert Stuart, which hangs in the East Room and is sometimes seen 
on TV when presidential news conferences and public events are held 
there. He said it was the only major item left from the original 
White House. First lady Dolley Madison rescued it when British 
forces burned the city in 1814. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton cited a Stuart portrait in another room -- Mrs.  
Madison herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of my favorite predecessors,'' she said, ``who not only  
was first lady to her husband but was the hostess for Thomas 
Jefferson ... She was quite a modern woman.''

<HEADLINE> European Interest Rates May Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Europe's central bank is reportedly close to  
raising interest rates to keep inflation in check. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our tendency toward higher interest rates has certainly  
increased somewhat since July,'' European Central Bank president 
Wim Duisenberg was quoted Monday as telling the German economic 
daily Handelsblatt. 
</P>
<P>
	Faster economic growth and the renewed slide of the euro have  
raised speculation in recent days that the ECB would decide on its 
first rate rise -- possibly as early as this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's benchmark interest rate stands at 2.5 percent. The  
ECB has moved the rate only once since taking over monetary policy 
for the 11 euro nations on Jan. 1, lowering it from 3 percent in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	Duisenberg noted that when the 17-member ECB council debated a  
rate hike three weeks ago, it wanted to await more data to back up 
fears of an inflation risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``The latest development of the money supply'' -- a key inflation  
indicator -- ``undoubtedly confirms the trend,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said he did not know whether the policymaking ECB  
council would raise rates as early as Thursday -- its next regular 
meeting -- or continue waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts on Monday were debating not whether, but by how much  
the ECB would raise rates -- by a quarter percentage point or half a 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	``The members of the governing council have so clearly  
positioned themselves that a rate move seems unavoidable,'' said 
Ulrich Kater, economist with DGZ-DekaBank in Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
	With inflation in Germany and France -- the two main euro  
economies -- significantly below 1 percent, some analysts question 
whether a rate increase might harm fragile growth. 
</P>
<P>
	But higher rates would bolster the 10-month-old euro, which has  
dropped about 3 percent in the last two weeks. The euro was trading 
Monday around $1.06, compared to about $1.18 at its Jan. 1 debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks ago, Duisenberg said the ECB was prepared to raise  
interest rates once it sees further evidence of a strengthening 
European economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottmar Issing, the ECB's chief economist, fueled talk of a rate  
rise Friday when he said that data confirmed the growth trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is showing in the direction of stronger activity,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Court Backs Fla. Panhandling Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Homeless people who say they have a  
free-speech right to beg for handouts at the city beach in Fort 
Lauderdale, Fla., lost a Supreme Court appeal today. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, turned away arguments that the  
city's panhandling ban is too broad. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1993 regulation prohibits ``soliciting, begging or  
panhandling'' on a five-mile strip of Fort Lauderdale's city beach 
and the sidewalks on each side of an adjacent street. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulation states that it is intended to ``eliminate  
nuisance activity on the beach and provide patrons with a pleasant 
environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A group of homeless people challenged the regulation in a  
federal class-action lawsuit, saying it violated the Constitution's 
First Amendment guarantee of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The city could have imposed a narrower rule that barred only  
hostile or aggressive panhandling, or restricted begging to 
specific areas of the beach, the lawsuit contended. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge and the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
upheld the regulation. Governments can restrict expression in 
public areas to serve a legitimate interest as long as they leave 
open other avenues of expression, the appeals court ruled, noting 
that panhandling still is allowed in other parts of Fort 
Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, the homeless people's lawyers said  
there was no evidence of complaints from tourists or business 
owners that begging had created a nuisance at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``This court has never upheld a law completely precluding speech  
in a public forum based upon the bare assertion that the speech is 
a nuisance and that the environment would be more pleasant if the 
speech were banned,'' the appeal said. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's lawyers urged the justices to reject the appeal.  
``The First Amendment does not guarantee the right to communicate 
one's views at all times and places or in any manner that may be 
desired,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Smith vs. Fort Lauderdale, 99-377.

<HEADLINE> EgyptAir's Management Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- EgyptAir hasn't had a plane crash in more  
than 13 years, but the state-owned airline has faced heavy 
criticism over its management. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash Sunday morning of EgyptAir Flight 990 likely will lead  
to more urging for change from those critics, who have complained 
about everything from poor cabin service and bad food to frequent 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane crashed into the sea off Nantucket Island. All 217  
people on board were believed dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent EgyptAir crash was in June 1986, when a plane  
belonging to EgyptAir subsidiary Air Sinai went down as it 
approached Cairo's airport in bad weather, killing 23 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the most serious EgyptAir crashes was in 1976, when an  
EgyptAir plane crashed during approach to the airport in Bangkok, 
Thailand, killing 73 people on board and on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, an Egyptian identified as Fathallah Khalaf  
managed to commandeer an EgyptAir flight between Istanbul, Turkey, 
and Cairo. He apparently poked a pen into the neck of a crew member 
and forced the plane to fly to Germany, where he was overpowered 
and detained. None of the 46 passengers on board was harmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the hijacking was evidence of sloppy security.  
</P>
<P>
	While some newspapers and commentators have long called for  
EgyptAir to become private, EgyptAir chairman Mohammed Fahim Rayan 
has ruled that out. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Rayan, a former army general, has acknowledged mistakes  
in the way the 67-year-old airline is run and has promised better 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	He is in the process of expanding the airline, which has a fleet  
of 38 planes that fly to 85 airports abroad and 10 in Egypt.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Seeks To Revive Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- President Clinton said today he hopes to  
inject ``renewed energy'' into the Israeli-Palestinian peace 
process, and encouraged both sides to move quickly toward agreement 
on a final treaty within 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the hard part, the really hard part, and we all need  
to support them,'' Clinton told reporters during a 
question-and-answer session with Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell 
Magne Bondevik. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said while it is too soon to predict results, he  
believed the Oslo talks could yield steps toward establishing a 
timeframe for reaching a peace agreement. He noted that the 
Israelis and Palestinians have demonstrated a commitment to carry 
out the 1993 Oslo peace accords and resolve their most contentious 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think this is a time for hand-wringing,'' Clinton  
said. ``What we've got to do is create a renewed energy to make the 
process continuous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two-day Mideast summit opening today in Oslo sets the stage  
for arduous negotiations on Palestinian statehood, creating a new 
sense of urgency after weeks of delays and sluggish preparations. 
Clinton meets separately today with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud 
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat ahead of three-way talks 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat and Barak scheduled a two-hour meeting for tonight,  
according to Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath, who said the 
session ``would show our constituencies that we are serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On arrival, Arafat remembered that the peace process gained life  
in Oslo and said ``here we are again to push forward the peace 
process and protect it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barak said he believes one outcome of the Oslo talks will be  
setting a target date for a Camp David-style summit, possibly in 
Washington, early next year. ``I'm convinced that if we are 
determined and the two sides are willing to face the problem, it is 
possible,'' Barak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said it was ``premature'' to discuss such a meeting, but  
was open to the idea. ``There is nothing that I would not do if I 
thought it would genuinely help to build a lasting peace in the 
Middle East,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first round of final status negotiations are scheduled Nov.  
7. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief, hilltop ceremony, Clinton and Norway's King Harald V  
reviewed troops as a long line of palace guards wearing derby hats 
and feathered plumes lined the streets leading to the castle. Queen 
Sonja and Princess Martha Louise stood by on a chilly morning with 
gray skies. 
</P>
<P>
	At the peace talks, breakthrough on substance is unlikely, but  
Arafat and Barak will get a chance to sound each other out on keys 
issues and may try to reach agreement on the format of their 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak spoke cautiously Sunday of a ``feeling of possible  
momentum,'' while Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, said he hoped the 
summit would give negotiators the necessary nudge. 
</P>
<P>
	The emotional centerpiece of the summit is a memorial service  
Tuesday for Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister assassinated 
on Nov. 4, 1995, by an ultranationalist Jew trying to prevent the 
handover of West Bank land to the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview airing today on CBS' ``Early Show,'' Clinton  
said gathering in Rabin's memory may ``give some new energy to this 
process.'' He praised Barak and Arafat for cooperating on a time 
table and security concerns, but said agreement may be elusive now 
that they are taking up more difficult issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've known what these issues are for a long time now, they're  
not going to get any easier,'' Clinton said. ``So whatever ... the 
United States can do to facilitate a timely resolution of these 
issues, I think, will be positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All three leaders had forged close bonds with Rabin -- Barak was  
his protege, Clinton came to admire him and even Arafat, Rabin's 
former nemesis, later spoke of him as his ``partner in peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commemoration is a ``symbolic victory over all those who  
wanted to jeopardize the peace process,'' said Israeli legislator 
Uri Savir, who helped set up the secret Oslo talks that led to the 
1993 breakthrough agreement between Israel and the Palestine 
Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat's aides say his top priority in Oslo is to win assurances  
from Clinton that Israel will slow or freeze construction of Jewish 
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The United States has 
said settlements are ``destructive'' to peace, but it has not 
publicly reprimanded Barak for approving new homes at a faster pace 
than his hard-line predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Arafat has been careful not to threaten to suspend  
negotiations over the construction. Abbas would only say Sunday 
that settlement expansion ``would be a major obstacle'' to a 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak, in turn, wants to redefine the goals of a peace  
agreement. He says the initial dream of close cooperation between 
Israelis and Palestinians aimed too high, and that the best the 
current tense climate may yield is peaceful separation enforced by 
electric fences. 
</P>
<P>
	Such talk has alarmed the Palestinians, who fear their economy  
will wither if cut off from Israeli markets. U.S. officials have 
warned the Israelis that a separation will hurt stability. 
</P>
<P>
	There may also be disagreements on the format on the  
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat is pressing Clinton to play an active role, feeling he  
needs U.S. help to face the Israelis. Barak opposes U.S. 
intervention, a position that may eventually put him at odds with 
Clinton, who is determined to forge a historic treaty before he 
leaves office in January 2001.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Coup Leader Details Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan's coup leader outlined the  
policies of his military regime today, promising to decentralize 
power, announcing the formation of an accountability bureau and 
guaranteeing freedom of the press. 
</P>
<P>
	He said rejuvenating the country's ailing economy would be a  
goal and alluded to alleged corruption in the ousted government of 
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never before so few have plundered so many,'' Gen. Pervaiz  
Musharraf told reporters in his first news conference since he 
ousted the elected government on Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had formed a National Accountability Bureau, which  
``has already started scrutinizing records.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The accountability process will be across the board and will  
start from the top ... Special speedy courts will decide the 
cases,'' he said. ``Let me assure you he (Sharif) will get a fair 
trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Musharraf, who overthrew Sharif in a bloodless coup, has accused  
him of relentless corruption, destroying institutions and 
undermining the constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of opposition parties have been pressing for quick  
action against Sharif and his close aides, who are under the army's 
detention. They complain the military regime is moving too slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	But Musharraf asked his critics to be patient. ``Just bear with  
us and we will do the job,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Pakistanis, frustrated by years of political instability,  
rampant corruption and a surge in political and religious violence, 
have welcomed the removal of Sharif's government. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite tremendous international pressure to restore democracy,  
the military regime faces little pressure from the public to hold 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Musharraf, who has suspended parliament and the constitution,  
said he wanted to decentralize some power in this poor South Asian 
nation of 140 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make people the master of their own destiny by  
devolution of power to the district level,'' he said. ``Those who 
were sitting in the parliament were not representing the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four civilians were named last week to his newly formed National  
Security Council, responsible for all policy decisions. The NSC 
also includes Musharraf as its head and chiefs of the Pakistan Navy 
and Air Force. Two civilians have been named ministers in the 
cabinet, with more likely to join the government in coming days. 
</P>
<P>
	Musharraf said a team of financial experts will soon announce  
economic policies, but he did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a total collapse of the economy. We are begging  
all over the world, putting our honor and dignity at stake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Musharraf also promised complete press freedom. ``I have nothing  
to hide,'' he said. ``There are no skeletons in the cupboard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On foreign policy, Musharraf offered talks with hostile neighbor  
India to solve the protracted Kashmir dispute between the two 
newest nuclear powers, which have fought three wars since 
independence from Britain in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hostility will be met with hostility and peace with peace. If  
India agrees to talk, we will take one step ahead,'' Musharraf 
said, but did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	New Delhi refuses to resume talks with Islamabad, saying that  
Pakistan should first stop aiding Muslim militants in Kashmir 
fighting for its merger with Islamic Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan has been ruled by the military for about 25 years of  
its 52-year turbulent history. The 11-year-long experience with 
democracy, which ended with the ouster of Sharif, saw four elected 
governments sacked on the charges of corruption and misrule.

<HEADLINE> Mitsubishi Heavy To Cut More Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. is  
expanding its plans to reduce its work force by another 2,000 to a 
total of 7,000, or nearly 10 percent of its work force, by March 
2004. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said Monday it planned to make the cuts by attrition  
rather than layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cuts will not be forced upon the employees, and we do not  
feel forced cuts are necessary,'' Managing Director Hiroshi Nanjo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The builder of airplanes, armaments, ships and nuclear power  
plants now has 71,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The job reductions include plans disclosed last month by the  
parent company reduce its work force to 35,000 from the current 
40,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Heavy hopes the restructuring will help it report a  
group pretax profit of 150 billion yen, or $1.4 billion, on sales 
of 3 trillion yen, or $28.8 billion, for fiscal 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The stronger yen is expected to continue hurting the company. A  
stronger yen hurts Japanese companies that rely on sales abroad, as 
their exports become more expensive overseas and their foreign 
profits lose value in terms of the Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Heavy said it saw large losses in the last two  
quarters because of increased competition at home and abroad, the 
poor Japanese economy, and reduced exports to the rest of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Heavy had a pretax loss of 29.74 billion yen, or $285  
million, at the parent company in the six months through Sept. 30, 
compared to a profit of 50.63 billion yen a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the term fell 18 percent to 916.36 billion yen, or  
$8.8 billion, from 1.1 trillion yen a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Work force reductions -- once unheard-of in prosperous postwar  
Japan -- have picked up in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	In October alone, No. 2 automaker Nissan Motor Co. and  
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. announced sweeping restructuring plans 
centered on job reductions in the thousands. Sumitomo and Sakura 
banks included hefty cuts as part of their merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Those announcements followed similar plans by electronic giants  
Hitachi, NEC Corp. and Sony Corp. earlier this year. Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. is also considering extensive cuts.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong, Disney OK New Theme Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Hong Kong's government and Walt Disney wrapped  
up talks today on building a theme park here, and an official said 
they had reached an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney, based in Burbank, Calif., and Hong Kong have not  
confirmed that a deal was reached. But the government announced 
that the two sides would hold a series of joint briefings in Hong 
Kong on Tuesday to explain ``the outcome of the negotiations'' to 
lawmakers, economists, journalists, tourism executives and local 
personalities. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong officials hope a Disney park will improve the battered  
economy, first by creating construction jobs and later by 
attracting more tourists. If a deal has been reached, Hong Kong 
would join Paris and Tokyo as Disney locations outside the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's leader, Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, planned an  
announcement on Disney for Tuesday morning, a government statement 
said. The territory's tourism commissioner, Mike Rowse, said 
earlier he planned to attend a series of briefings, though he 
stopped short of confirming any deal. 
</P>
<P>
	An official speaking on condition of anonymity told The  
Associated Press that an agreement had been reached, but declined 
to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives at Disney's office in Hong Kong were said to be busy  
in a meeting all day when the AP phoned repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, several Chinese-language newspapers reported today  
that the government and Disney had struck a deal that would involve 
a government investment of $2.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A Hong Kong economist at investment bank Morgan Stanley Dean  
Witter, Andy Xie, said today that construction of a Disney park 
would improve the economic outlook in Hong Kong, which has endured 
a 15-month recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have said that after the park is built, most of the jobs  
will require few skills and pay low wages. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation that a deal had been sealed helped lift traders'  
spirits on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange early today, although blue 
chips gave up early gains of almost 1 percent and finished up just 
half a percentage point.

<HEADLINE> Second Election Likely in Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- In a setback to the ruling center-right  
coalition, the candidate of the former communists appears to have a 
strong lead in Macedonia's presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters chose Sunday from among six candidates -- four Slavs and  
two Albanians -- to succeed President Kiro Gligorov, who led this 
country to independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. The constitution, 
however, requires the winner to capture an absolute majority, and 
the top two finishers face each other in a runoff in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Final results were not expected until today. The first  
unofficial results provided by Macedonia's competing parties showed 
Tito Petkovski, the candidate of the former communist Social 
Democratic Party with a strong lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Petkovski's party said their candidate had won 38 percent of the  
votes counted, while trailing second was Boris Trajkovski, the 
candidate of Macedonia's strongest party known by its initials 
VMRO, with 24.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Petkovski attributed his strong showing in part to the ruling  
coalition's failure to address the basic problems of Macedonia's 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am convinced this is just half of the race,'' he said. ``I  
expect the citizens to confirm in the runoff what they have shown 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Petkovski's apparent strong showing was seen as a rebuff to the  
ruling coalition's handling of the nation's laggard economy. 
Apparently also decisive was the alleged willingness by the ruling 
coalition to meet many of ethnic Albanian demands for more rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in Macedonia's Slav majority fear bowing to ethnic Albanian  
demands could lead to a division of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Support by ethnic Albanians, who make up around a fourth of the  
population, could play an important role in the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
	After polls closed Sunday, one of the ethnic Albanian  
candidates, Muhamed Halili, complained of ``huge irregularities'' 
in many polling stations. Halili's Party for Democratic Prosperity 
said its supporters may boycott the runoff, A1 TV reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Halili, whose party was allied with the former communists in the  
previous government, is considered more moderate than the other 
ethnic Albanian in the race, Muarem Nexhipi. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic tensions -- heightened by the Kosovo conflict -- have  
raised fears that the hatreds that exploded elsewhere in the 
Balkans could still spread to Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	During the campaign, the Slavic candidates all have been  
promising economic prosperity and closer ties with the European 
Union and NATO. Macedonia is one of the poorest Balkan countries, 
where the number of unemployed exceeds the number of people who 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from Petkovski and Trajkovski, the remaining two Slavic  
candidates were Vasil Tupurkovski, 48, and former Yugoslav diplomat 
Stojan Andov, 62.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Japan Stocks Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell late today in Tokyo as investors  
snapped up yen to buy Japanese stocks. Japan's benchmark stock 
index closed higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was trading at 104.21 yen on the Tokyo foreign  
exchange market at 5 p.m. (3 a.m. EST) today, down 0.67 yen from 
late Friday in Tokyo but above its level of 104.16 yen late Friday 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed up 54.84  
points, or 0.31 percent, to 17,996.92 at the end of the session. On 
Friday, the average rose 528.37 points, or 3.03 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar was weakened against the yen  
today by strength in Japanese stocks, dealers said. The Nikkei 225 
stock average rallied above 18,000 points for the first time since 
Oct. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the background, foreign investors are still buying Japanese  
assets,'' said Takeo Suzuki, assistant foreign exchange manager at 
Nomura Trust and Banking. ``The yen's uptrend is still 
continuing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, with the U.S. currency hovering near levels that have  
provoked yen-selling intervention by the Bank of Japan in the past, 
investors are reluctant to sell the dollar too aggressively, 
dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no sign the central bank had stepped into the market  
today, though a top Japanese finance official said yen strength had 
gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
	``The yen's rise is excessive and doesn't reflect economic  
fundamentals,'' said Haruhiko Kuroda, vice finance minister for 
international affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded between 103.72 yen and 104.35 yen today in  
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro traded at 110.16 yen, down from  
110.76 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei rose led by gains in blue-chip  
stocks such as Sony, Fujitsu, and Bridgestone. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped  
109.23 points to close at 10,731.76 on rises in high-technology 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading issues such as Toyota, Honda and NEC fell today in Tokyo  
on concerns over the strong yen. Several export-oriented companies 
recently announced weaker interim earnings results because of the 
yen's strength, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	A robust yen can hurt Japanese exporters because it makes their  
products more expensive in overseas markets and reduces the value 
of repatriated profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section closed down 1.40 points, or 0.09 percent, to 
1,562.49. The TOPIX closed up 36.79 points, or 2.41 percent, 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 484.05 million shares, down from 627.08 million shares 
Friday. Retreating issues outnumbered advancers 688 to 531 on the 
TSE First Section, while 119 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.7950 percent from Friday's finish of 1.8000 percent. Its price 
rose 0.04 point to 100.04.

<HEADLINE> JumpStart Kind to Wallets and Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Knowledge Adventure, of Torrance, Calif., is shipping a couple  
of learning products called JumpStart ABCs and JumpStart Phonics 
for both the Windows and Macintosh platforms. 
</P>
<P>
	And with them come a couple of lessons that other software  
companies ought to heed. 
</P>
<P>
	Lesson No 1:  
</P>
<P>
	Packaging. Most software companies float a slim CD in a  
half-forest's worth of brightly printed cardboard, most at least 
8-by-10 inches and a couple of inches thick, and with cover flaps. 
That's overkill for a jewel case not even 6 inches square and less 
than a half-inch thick. So it was nice to see the Knowledge 
Adventure box slip into packaging little bigger than the jewel 
case. And with no cardboard inside, either -- just the jewel case 
and registration info. 
</P>
<P>
	One need not be a tree-hugger to be upset by waste in the  
pursuit of shelf space. 
</P>
<P>
	Lesson No. 2:  
</P>
<P>
	Price. The software costs $10 each, about a third of the price  
of most educational software. That's significant to parents who 
want their children to be computer-helped but also want them 
clothed and fed, too.

<HEADLINE> Ex-GOP Sen. Smith Returns to Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith returned to the  
Republican Party today after a 111-day career as a political 
independent, and immediately staked a claim to a vacant Senate 
committee chairmanship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It became obvious that the most effective way for me to have a  
conservative impact on public policy as a senator was as a member 
of the Republican Party,'' Smith said at a news conference. He was 
joined by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and Jim Nicholson, 
chairman of the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith left the GOP in July with a withering Senate floor speech  
in which he accused the GOP of having abandoned its conservative 
principles. 
</P>
<P>
	He also announced plans to run for president as an independent  
at the time. He folded that effort last week in preparation for his 
formal return to the GOP fold. Smith said he does not intend to 
support any of the GOP presidential hopefuls at this time. 
</P>
<P>
	At his news conference, Smith acknowledged that some of ``my  
colleagues and party officials were justifiably angry, bitter and 
frustrated'' at his departure last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said, ``No disciplinary action was ever taken against  
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also made it clear he wants to become the next chairman of  
the Environment and Public Works Committee, a post that became 
vacant last week with the death of Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he had ``made my intentions known'' about returning  
to the party to Lott before Chafee's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am the next-most-senior senator in line for that  
chairmanship,'' he said of a position that customarily is awarded 
on the basis of seniority. ``I felt that since I was coming back to 
the party,'' fellow Republicans should know that before picking a 
new chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, who is one seat below Smith on  
the panel, has also made clear his desire for the chairmanship. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott told reporters after the news conference he expects to have  
the issue resolved within the next week or 10 days. He declined to 
say which contender he supports.

<HEADLINE> Cleveland High School Reopens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Students lined up to pass through metal  
detectors today at a school where four boys were arrested last week 
on charges of planning a racially motivated rampage of bombs and 
gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15 police officers patrolled inside South High School and  
a police car circled the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The four white ninth-graders pleaded innocent Sunday and  
remained in juvenile detention today. Seven other teens questioned 
in the case were suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	The school was closed Friday, the day the boys allegedly planned  
to set off bombs and open fire on classmates. No bombs or guns were 
found in several searches of the school. 
</P>
<P>
	One student returning to classes amid the tightened security was  
Rebecca Fox, 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like my privacy was being invaded because of some  
fools,'' she said. ``Why would you want to kill some kids over 
petty stuff? It's pitiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, classes at Eastlake High School in Redmond, Wash.,  
were canceled today because of threats of violence made against 
teachers and students in an Internet chat room, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The school district in the Seattle suburb declined to give  
details on the threats or say how many people were believed to be 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a feeling it's not going to take very long until we  
find out who's responsible,'' King County sheriff's spokesman John 
Urquhart said. ``Not only the school district, but we're going to 
come down on them like a ton of bricks because we don't like this 
happening,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At South High, a friend of the boys, Sarah Jedd, said they  
laughed about how Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students 
and a teacher before killing themselves last spring at Columbine 
High School in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Classmates described the four teen-agers as loners who wore  
camouflage outfits and dark trench coats and dyed their hair blue 
or shaved it. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Bailey said after Sunday's arraignment that his stepson,  
Adam Gruber, is well-behaved and respectful. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's like any typical 14-year-old who has anger problems. He  
gets angry but he's a great kid. I could tell that kid to clean the 
garage spotless and he would do it,'' Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can speak for my son. My son is not a violent child. He  
didn't plan anything violent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said a school map marked with shooting locations and  
comments reported by classmates convinced them that the threat was 
real. Two weapons were found at one boy's home during a series of 
police searches Friday, when the school was closed as a precaution 
and homecoming events were canceled.

<HEADLINE> Tears for Those Aboard Flight 990 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Hisham Ahmed Omar tried desperately to get  
on EgyptAir's direct Flight 990 to Cairo, but last-minute shopping 
got him to his travel agent a few minutes late. The office had 
closed, and Omar resigned himself to a 30-hour journey with a 
stopover in London. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was cursing my travel agent for this trip,'' he said, ``and  
it was a gift from God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, at the airport in Cairo, friends and family of the 217  
people aboard Flight 990 collapsed or wept when they learned that 
loved ones were aboard the EgyptAir jetliner that crashed nearly an 
hour after taking off from New York's Kennedy International 
Airport. Nobody was believed to have survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Fakhri Hassan said his nephew, Adel Maher, 22, called him from  
New York to let him know that Flight 990 was running late. A few 
hours later, Hassan heard about the crash on the television news 
and headed to Cairo International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if he is alive or in the water or under the  
water,'' Hassan said, holding back tears. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, few signs remained of the trauma of the night  
before. The makeshift information center in Terminal One was being 
swept clear of tissues, plastic cups and cigarette butts. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of the victims began arriving at the airport's  
EgyptAir sales office to inquire about arrangements to be flown to 
the United States to identify the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Some grieving relatives who did not have passports were  
immediately sent to apply for the documents, but they complained 
they were required to pay a photograph fee and another charge for 
the passport application. 
</P>
<P>
	At the U.S. Embassy, normal procedures were scrapped to speed up  
the issuing of visas, and a few had been issued late Sunday, said 
spokesman Dave Ballard. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of 26 relatives arrived at the embassy early today and  
got their visas promptly, embassy official Nihal Rizk said. Another 
group arrived at about 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard said the embassy had received hundreds of calls to a  
special information line it had set up, and he added that officials 
were focused on helping the State Department in Washington compile 
a list of Americans on board based on reports from relatives and 
other sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a reason to believe that a large number of American  
citizens were aboard the aircraft,'' Ballard said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 13 Canadians were also on the EgyptAir flight, Canada's  
Foreign Affairs Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamdi Hanafi was one of those inquiring at the airport today.  
His daughter, Wala, was on the plane, returning to Cairo from her 
first trip abroad. She had spent the last two months visiting her 
aunt in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanafi was holding his daughter's pink university identification  
card, showing a picture of a girl with shoulder-length dark hair 
and a big smile. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibrahim Qassem lost his son Tamer, 24, on the flight. He worked  
for the International Monetary Fund and was on his first trip 
abroad, attending a seminar in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want him to go to New York,'' Qassem said. ``I just  
had a bad feeling about this.'' The grieving father, smoking 
nervously, said he will not go to identify the body. ``I cannot do 
it.'' Instead, two of Tamer's cousins will make the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 990, which originated in Los Angeles, took off from New  
York at 1:19 a.m. local time and disappeared from radar while 
flying at 33,000 feet. It plummeted to the sea off Nantucket Island 
in two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Egypt has asked the United States to take the lead in the crash  
investigation. Egyptian experts and airline officials were planning 
to travel Tuesday to New York on an EgyptAir flight, along with 
relatives who were to help identify victims. 
</P>
<P>
	President Hosni Mubarak said today he was shocked after first  
hearing the news. ``It is a big tragedy for us,'' Mubarak told 
reporters today in a brief news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	A soccer match Sunday evening in Cairo between the Olympic teams  
of Egypt and Tunisia started with a moment of silence in honor of 
the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Omar, an engineer for the Egyptian oil company Gupco who had  
spent two weeks in New Orleans on a business course, said he called 
his brother Osama in Cairo as soon as he heard about the crash to 
let his family know he was safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Omar's wife, however, had already heard word of the crash and  
had rushed to the airport. She called her husband's company and 
received the news that he was returning through London. 
</P>
<P>
	Omar, heading home with his 18-month-old daughter Arwa in his  
arms, said he plans to stick closer to Cairo: ``It was the first 
time I went to America, and it was also the last time.''

<HEADLINE> First Lady Shows Art Treasures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans who might never have the chance to  
stroll through the White House can join first lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton on a televised tour of its varied art collection. 
</P>
<P>
	The half-hour look at the collection, which includes four  
multimillion-dollar paintings by Paul Cezanne, often called the 
father of modern art, premieres tonight on Ovation, a cable TV 
network devoted to the arts. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also a Georgia O'Keeffe work that the artist kept with  
her until her death, a portrait of President Theodore Roosevelt by 
John Singer Sargent -- and the pick of anything the first family 
wants to borrow from the national museums. 
</P>
<P>
	On the show, which Ovation will carry at 8 p.m. EST and three  
more times in November, Mrs. Clinton is accompanied by J. Carter 
Brown, chairman of the U.S. Fine Arts Commission and head of the 
network. The show has a potential audience of 16 million 
households. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady emphasized her enthusiasm for bringing modern art  
to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we were the first ever to hang a De Kooning, for  
example, or a Kandinsky,'' she said. ``In our private quarters they 
fill the space of this very long center hallway that goes from the 
east to the west end of the second floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Willem de Kooning was a Dutch-born artist who became prominent  
among American abstract painters and died in 1997. Wassily 
Kandinsky, one of the first abstractionists, died in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton pointed proudly to the sculpture garden outside the  
corridor leading to the East Wing of the White House, where 
thousands of visitors see it on regular tours. On view when the 
tour was taped were the works of modern French sculptor Auguste 
Rodin and Americans he influenced. 
</P>
<P>
	It made the first lady think of a modern British sculptor with a  
personal meaning for her as a law student at Yale, where she first 
met President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was this wonderful Henry Moore -- a seated woman -- long  
admired and in part loved because it marked our first date,'' she 
recalled on the show. ``Sculpture is a big part of our 
relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown pointed out what may be the most valuable part of the  
White House collection. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Cezanne landscape, with its blocky, chunkiness  
prefiguring cubism, is one of eight paintings by the artist ... 
bought early on by an adventurous American collector before Cezanne 
became revered as he is today,'' Brown said. Charles Loeser left 
them to the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Truman felt the National Gallery should show them,  
as they were not by an American artist,'' Brown said. ``Mrs. 
(Jacqueline) Kennedy was not long in office, however, before she 
called the gallery and asked to see them, and as a young staff 
member I was assigned to hang a selection of them in this house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the paintings have historic as well as artistic  
significance. Brown cited the portrait of George Washington by 
Gilbert Stuart, which hangs in the East Room and is sometimes seen 
on TV when presidential news conferences and public events are held 
there. He said it was the only major item left from the original 
White House. First lady Dolley Madison rescued it when British 
forces burned the city in 1814. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton cited a Stuart portrait in another room -- Mrs.  
Madison herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of my favorite predecessors,'' she said, ``who not only  
was first lady to her husband but was the hostess for Thomas 
Jefferson ... She was quite a modern woman.''

<HEADLINE> Court To Rule on Medicare Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide  
whether the millions of dollars a hospital receives for treating 
Medicare patients subjects those who bribe hospital officials to 
federal prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices said they will use a case from Volusia County,  
Fla., to resolve conflicting federal appeals court rulings on 
whether such Medicare funding can be the basis for invoking a law 
that makes it a crime to bribe agents of organizations that receive 
federal money. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Allan Fischer was convicted of violating that law and  
sentenced to five years and five months in prison after a company 
he operated and partially owned received a $1.2 million loan in 
1993 from the West Volusia Hospital Authority, a Volusia County 
agency that runs two hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Fischer had been president of Quality Medical Consultants, a  
company that performed billing audits for health care providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors said Fischer paid $10,000 to a hospital  
official's mother in return for the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Fischer was convicted after a federal trial in Orlando. In  
addition to his prison time, he was sentenced to three years of 
supervised release and ordered to pay $1.2 million in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
	He had previously left his job at QMC, and the company had filed  
for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	His Supreme Court appeal contends that ``payments to health care  
providers for services to Medicare patients do not meet the 
jurisdictional requirements'' of the federal law under which he was 
prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected  
that argument last March, but another federal appeals court has 
ruled that Medicare money cannot be the basis for such 
prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Volusia Hospital Authority received between $10 million  
and $15million in Medicare payments in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Fischer vs. U.S., 99-116.

<HEADLINE> Allianz Buying 70 Pct. of Pimco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- In the latest trans-Atlantic move by a  
European financial powerhouse, Germany's biggest insurer, Allianz 
AG, is buying roughly 70 percent of U.S.-based fund manager Pimco 
Advisors Holdings for $3.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of Allianz and Pimco would be the world's  
sixth-largest asset manager, according to data provided by the U.S. 
magazine Pensions and Investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Allianz chief executive Henning Schulte-Noelle told a news  
conference today the transaction is expected to be completed in 
March 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Allianz has hoped to bolster its $360 billion fund-management  
business by expanding in the United States. Pimco, a Newport Beach, 
Calif.-based firm, has about $250 billion in assets under 
management. 
</P>
<P>
	Schulte-Noelle said the U.S. insurance company Pacific Life,  
which holds a 30 percent stake in Pimco, planned to retain its 
stake for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
	Allianz said it had no plans currently to raise its stake in  
Pimco beyond 70 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders in Germany reacted positively, pushing Allianz stock up  
1.4 percent in early trading today despite a slight decline in the 
overall Frankfurt market. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will help Allianz catch up to its French and Swiss  
archrivals AXA and Zurich Financial Services. Both already have 
strong U.S. presences: AXA through asset manager Alliance Capital 
and other holdings, and Zurich through Scudder Kemper Investments 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	But the combined group will still trail other European asset  
managers such as Switzerland's UBS Group and Credit Suisse Group. 
</P>
<P>
	For Pimco, it provides an avenue for overseas distribution of  
its funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Pimco is the third-largest publicly traded investment-management  
company in the United States. Its Pimco Total Return Fund is the 
world's largest bond fund, with around $27 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Schulte-Noelle said that for Allianz the transaction is a  
decisive step toward making personal asset management one of its 
core activities. He said there is potential for the market in 
Europe to grow 15 percent to 20 percent a year as a younger 
generation decides how to invest family inheritances. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said a major sticking point in talks was the difficulty  
of structuring a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Pimco is a master limited partnership, which allows it to avoid  
paying the typical 35 percent corporate income tax on its profits, 
and instead pay a 3.5 percent tax on its gross income. 
</P>
<P>
	Allianz said it will pay for the cash transaction with a mix of  
debt financing, which may include exchangeable bonds, corporate 
bonds and internal group financing.

<HEADLINE> China May Cut Business Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China plans to cut 468 trade and inspection fees  
to try to lure foreign investors with reduced business costs, the 
official China Daily reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Reductions will be available to both foreign and domestic  
companies, and the fees to be cut cover customs processing, import 
and export inspections and animal and plant quarantines, the 
newspaper said. It said businesses could save about 3 billion yuan 
($360 million). 
</P>
<P>
	China has been trying to revive foreign investors' interest,  
hoping they will help boost slack economic growth. State-run media 
have touted a number of planned tax cuts and other policies aimed 
at foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign investment fell 6.8 percent to $29.4 billion in the  
first nine months of this year compared with 1998. Capital pledged 
for future projects fell 17 period in the period. 
</P>
<P>
	The promised fee cuts also are part of an ongoing government  
drive to trim and standardize government fees.

<HEADLINE> Nuggets' Billups Out With Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Denver Nuggets likely will open the season  
without starting guard Chauncey Billups, who sprained his right 
ankle during a team scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	Billups is the second Denver starter to sprain an ankle during  
the preseason. Forward Antonio McDyess has played only sparingly 
because of a sprained right ankle and migraine headaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Billups sprained his ankle and strained his left hamstring  
during practice Sunday. He is not expected to play in Denver's 
season-opener Tuesday night against Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess is expected to play against the Suns despite aggravating  
his ankle sprain Saturday. The Nuggets held McDyess out of most of 
Sunday's scrimmage as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Antonio is not going to be 100 percent Tuesday,'' coach Dan  
Issel said, ``but at 80 percent, he's still a good player.''

<HEADLINE> Top Kosovo Serb Leader Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A top moderate Kosovo Serb leader  
said today he was shot in the leg at his Pristina apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Momcilo Trajkovic, who has represented the dwindling Serb  
population in Kosovo in talks with international officials, said he 
was shot in the thigh when he opened his apartment door to unknown 
assailants Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bullet is still in my leg,'' Trajkovic told The Associated  
Press. ``I'm lucky not to be dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two ethnic Albanian men were being sought in the attack, NATO  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Stefan Eder of the NATO press office in Pristina said  
officials were unsure if the attack was an attempted assassination. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO spokesman Maj. Ole Irgens, said today that though Trajkovic  
is normally guarded 24 hours a day, on Sunday he had requested a 
break in protection ``for personal reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trajkovic, the leader of the Serb National Council, managed to  
call NATO peacekeepers after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO forces rushed him to a hospital, Trajkovic said. He added  
that he heard the culprits speak Albanian before he opened the 
door. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Kouchner, the U.N. administrator of Kosovo, was expected  
to visit Trajkovic in the hospital later today. He condemned the 
attack.

<HEADLINE> Wyo. Judge Bars `Gay Panic' Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- A judge today barred defense lawyers from  
using a ``gay panic'' defense in the murder trial of a man accused 
of beating gay college student Matthew Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
	State District Judge Barton Voigt told lawyers for Aaron  
McKinney that the strategy was, in effect, a temporary insanity or 
a diminished capacity defense, both of which are prohibited under 
Wyoming law. 
</P>
<P>
	Afton N. Timothy, McKinney's stepsister, testified that she  
learned of the beating from McKinney's then-girlfriend, Kristen 
Price, who said he and an accomplice planned to pose as homosexuals 
and rob Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
		   McKinney, 22, is charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping  
and aggravated robbery in Shepard's death last year. The 
21-year-old University of Wyoming political science major suffered 
at least 18 blows to the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say McKinney and Russell Henderson, 22, posed as  
homosexuals, lured Shepard out of a downtown bar, drove him to a 
remote fence, tied him to it and pistol-whipped him into a coma. 
Police said robbery was the main motive but that Shepard may also 
have been singled out because he was gay. 
</P>
<P>
	During opening statements, the defense told jurors that the  
crime was triggered by a combination of McKinney's drug and alcohol 
use, traumatic youthful homosexual episodes and an unwanted sexual 
advance by Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
	They had hope to borrow a page from what is informally called a  
``gay panic'' defense, built on a theory that a person with latent 
gay tendencies will have an uncontrollable, violent reaction when 
propositioned by a homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Cal Rerucha countered that such testimony would give  
others an excuse to kill people they don't like, such as 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	And the judge said today that he did not believe defense  
attorneys had offered any evidence that such a strategy would be 
relevant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if relevant, the evidence will mislead and confuse the  
jury,'' he stated in a written order released before the trial 
resumed today. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney could receive the death penalty if convicted. Henderson  
received two life sentences after pleading guilty in April to 
felony murder and kidnapping.

<HEADLINE> European Interest Rates May Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Europe's central bank is reportedly close to  
raising interest rates to keep inflation in check. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our tendency toward higher interest rates has certainly  
increased somewhat since July,'' European Central Bank president 
Wim Duisenberg was quoted Monday as telling the German economic 
daily Handelsblatt. 
</P>
<P>
	Faster economic growth and the renewed slide of the euro have  
raised speculation in recent days that the ECB would decide on its 
first rate rise -- possibly as early as this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's benchmark interest rate stands at 2.5 percent. The  
ECB has moved the rate only once since taking over monetary policy 
for the 11 euro nations on Jan. 1, lowering it from 3 percent in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	Duisenberg noted that when the 17-member ECB council debated a  
rate hike three weeks ago, it wanted to await more data to back up 
fears of an inflation risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``The latest development of the money supply'' -- a key inflation  
indicator -- ``undoubtedly confirms the trend,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said he did not know whether the policymaking ECB  
council would raise rates as early as Thursday -- its next regular 
meeting -- or continue waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts on Monday were debating not whether, but by how much  
the ECB would raise rates -- by a quarter percentage point or half a 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	``The members of the governing council have so clearly  
positioned themselves that a rate move seems unavoidable,'' said 
Ulrich Kater, economist with DGZ-DekaBank in Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
	With inflation in Germany and France -- the two main euro  
economies -- significantly below 1 percent, some analysts question 
whether a rate increase might harm fragile growth. 
</P>
<P>
	But higher rates would bolster the 10-month-old euro, which has  
dropped about 3 percent in the last two weeks. The euro was trading 
Monday around $1.06, compared to about $1.18 at its Jan. 1 debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks ago, Duisenberg said the ECB was prepared to raise  
interest rates once it sees further evidence of a strengthening 
European economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottmar Issing, the ECB's chief economist, fueled talk of a rate  
rise Friday when he said that data confirmed the growth trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is showing in the direction of stronger activity,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Motorola Unveils Cell Phone Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Motorola Inc. today introduced a new chip that  
may eventually allow mobile phones to work with most any wireless 
network in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The communications equipment maker's stock shot higher following  
the announcement, rising $3 a share to $100.31 1/2 by midday on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola said mobile phone manufacturers will be able to use the  
same chip in all products, regardless of which market they are 
being built for. 
</P>
<P>
	The DSP56690 processor can support all the commonly used  
wireless standards: code-division multiple access (CDMA), global 
system for mobile communications (GSM), integrated digital enhanced 
network (iDEN), and time division multiple access (TDMA), as well 
as satellite-based products. 
</P>
<P>
	The chip also can support satellite-based signals and deliver  
wireless Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	``No other semiconductor manufacturer in the world offers one  
baseband processor that can handle all of the world's cellular 
standards,'' said Mario Rivas, general manager of Motorola's 
wireless subscriber systems group in Austin, Texas, where the 
announcement was made. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts hailed the new chip as significant, but not enough by  
itself to make a true ``go anywhere'' mobile phone possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is only one half of what's needed to facilitate this,''  
said Seamus McAteer, an industry analyst at Jupiter Communications 
consultancy in New York. The cell phone would also need to be 
equipped with different chips for the varying radio frequency 
interfaces in use. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going forward, it's not a stretch to expect that those  
elements will be put on one piece of silicon,'' McAnteer said. 
``You're increasingly seeing more functionality being added to the 
same piece of silicon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Experts also found it noteworthy that the new chip was  
introduced by Motorola, since the Illinois-based company was badly 
beaten by rivals in the transition to digital cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a reflection that they learned the painful lesson of not  
being first to market with their second-generation cellular 
phones,'' said Herschel Shosteck, president of Herschel Shosteck 
Associates, telecommunications consultants based in Wheaton, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Developing the chip first won't pay dividends for Motorola for  
two to three years, but ``that in no way discounts or diminishes 
the advantage of being first market,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Head of Daewoo Group Offers To Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Kim Woo-choong, the disgraced chairman  
of the Daewoo Group, offered to resign to repent for the financial 
woes of his ailing conglomerate, Daewoo officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidents of the group's 12 affiliates, all under recovery  
programs overseen by government-controlled creditor banks, followed 
suit by submitting their resignations as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, 63, quietly left Seoul last week after the group's six main  
domestic creditor banks asked him to step down. The trip was seen 
as a show of displeasure at the request. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, now in Germany, called aides in Seoul over the weekend and  
offered to resign, Daewoo said. He expressed hope that the move 
would help speed up the recovery of his ailing group, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo, one of South Korea's biggest conglomerates, narrowly  
escaped becoming the nation's largest-ever bankruptcy in July when 
domestic creditors agreed to delay repayment of $5.8 billion in 
short-term debt for six months and extend $3.3 billion in new 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, Daewoo promised to cut its debt drastically by  
selling or spinning off all but 12 of its 25 subsidiaries and by 
attracting foreign investment. It is undergoing a massive 
restructuring under the supervision of domestic creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo officially reported debt totals of $36 billion at home  
and $9.94 billion abroad, with $5.48 billion maturing by the end of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the government-supervised program, Daewoo's creditor banks  
plan to convert their loans to equity holdings, thereby easing the 
burden on the group. That plan required Kim's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	The collapse of Daewoo is a huge humiliation for Kim, once a  
symbol of success. Over 32 years, Kim, 63, built Daewoo from a 
one-room textile exporter to a company with $65 billion in assets 
that last year sold $52 billion in goods, including ships, cars, 
clothes and pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1990s, Daewoo expanded its domestic and overseas business  
with huge bank loans. Its debt soared from $19 billion in 1995 to 
$48 billion last year, more than five times its equity.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Exports Hit All-Time High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Global coffee exports rose by 6.5 percent, hitting  
their highest level ever, according to preliminary 1998-99 figures 
released Monday by the International Coffee Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong growth from October 1998 to September 1999 was due in  
large part to a 39 percent rise in Brazilian coffee sales, the 
London-based agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Global coffee shipments reached 83.414 million bags in 1998-99,  
up from 78.303 million bags in 1997-98. The hike in exports just 
beat the previous record high of 82.029 million bags set in 
1996-97. 
</P>
<P>
	One bag equals 132 pounds.  
</P>
<P>
	Brazil exported 22.771 million bags of coffee in 1998-99, up  
from 16.324 million in 1997-98. But Columbia, the second biggest 
exporter of coffee, saw a drop to 10.291 million bags from 10.911 
million over the previous period. 
</P>
<P>
	The next biggest exporter in 1998-99 was Vietnam with 6.558  
million bags compared to 6.602 million bags in 1997-98.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Won't Halt Executions Their Crimes </HEADLINE>

                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court will not allow an  
international treaty to block executions of death row inmates who 
were not yet 18 when they committed their crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, acting without comment Monday, rejected the appeal  
of a convicted Nevada killer who says his execution would violate 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a treaty 
the United States ratified in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Domingues was convicted and sentenced to death for the  
1993 murders of Arjin Chanel Pechpo and her 4-year-old son, 
Jonathan Smith, at their Las Vegas home. Police said Domingues 
forced his way into the home, strangled the woman and fatally 
stabbed her son after trying unsuccessfully to electrocute him. 
</P>
<P>
	Domingues, now 22, was 16 when he committed the crimes.  
</P>
<P>
	After losing his first round of appeals, Domingues invoked the  
international treaty in an attempt to have state courts strike down 
his death sentence as illegal. The treaty prohibits the execution 
of people who committed their crimes before age 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Past Supreme Court rulings have barred as unconstitutionally  
``cruel and unusual punishment'' the execution of anyone who was 
under 16 when committing a crime. But the court has upheld capital 
punishment for killers who were 16 or 17 at the time of their 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nevada Supreme Court ruled, by a 3-2 vote, that the treaty  
permits Domingues' execution. The state court noted that when 
President Bush proposed the treaty's ratification, he stated a 
``reservation'' under which the United States retained the right to 
impose capital punishment on any person for crimes committed while 
under the age of 18. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate ratified the treaty as presented by Bush, including  
that reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Domingues' appeal to the Supreme Court argued that the Senate  
was not authorized to make a reservation that had ``the effect of 
materially altering'' the treaty. The appeal also argued that 
private citizens should be allowed to force the government to 
comply with the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked for its views, the Clinton administration urged the court  
to reject the appeal. But human rights groups in California and 
Minnesota urged the justices, in a joint friend-of-the-court brief, 
to ``enforce the (treaty) to prevent the imposition of the juvenile 
death penalty.''

<HEADLINE> NYC Ordered To Restore Art Funding Exhibit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                            *By TOM HAYS 	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal judge ordered the city today to  
restore millions of dollars to the Brooklyn Museum of Art that was 
cut off in a dispute over a controversial art exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Nina Gershon, in a 40-page opinion filed  
this morning in Brooklyn federal court, granted the museum's 
request for a preliminary injunction against the city. She 
concluded that the museum ``has established irreparable harm and a 
likelihood of success on its First Amendment claim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gershon's order bars Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and city officials  
from ``taking steps to inflict any punishment, retaliation, 
discrimination or sanction'' against the museum for the exhibit 
that opened last month, called ``Sensation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither museum or city officials had any immediate comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The museum sued the city last month, claiming its First  
Amendment rights had been violated by Giuliani's decision to freeze 
a $7.2 million subsidy -- about a third of its annual budget. It 
sought the injunction to restore funds until the legal dispute 
could be settled. 
</P>
<P>
	The art war broke out at a Sept. 22 news conference, when the  
mayor called the exhibit of works by young British artists -- which 
features a portrait of the Virgin Mary adorned with elephant dung -- 
``sick,'' sacrilegious and unworthy of taxpayer support. 
</P>
<P>
	After the museum refused to cancel the show, the city withheld a  
$497,554 payment for October, then sued in state court to evict the 
museum from a city-owned site it has leased for more than 100 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Museum supporters have likened the city's reaction to a book  
burning. At a hearing before Gershon, museum attorney Floyd Abrams 
accused the city of trying to punish free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``The behavior of the city is a First Amendment catastrophe,''  
Abrams said. The city and Giuliani are attacking the museum ``for 
doing nothing more than exercising its constitutional rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City attorneys countered that the Constitution has nothing to do  
with it. 
</P>
<P>
	They argued the museum broke its contract with the city, thereby  
creating grounds for eviction. Its lease requires the museum -- 
which contains the second largest art collection in the country -- 
to educate schoolchildren and the general public. 
</P>
<P>
	Museum supporters have accused Giuliani -- the likely Republican  
nominee for U.S. Senate next year -- of pandering to conservative 
voters. City officials allege the museum board of directors, 
British collector Charles Saatchi and sponsor, Christie's auction 
house, of trying to cash in on work by modern artists whose sole 
aim is to shock. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the portrait of the Virgin Mary decorated with  
elephant dung, the show includes mannequins with genitals as facial 
features, a glass tank featuring a fake cow's head and 20,000 live 
maggots and farm animals bisected and displayed in formaldehyde. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit has drawn large crowds.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: No Evidence of Jet Sabotage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- President Clinton said today that he was  
unaware of any ``specific threats'' against U.S. airlines or 
passengers before the EgyptAir crash and reiterated that there was 
no early indication of sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing has been ruled in; nothing has been ruled out,''  
Clinton said. ``I hope no one will draw any conclusions one way or 
another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke with reporters in Oslo, where he is attending a  
series of meetings designed to keep moving the Middle East peace 
talks along the route to a final status agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he had no new information about why the  
Boeing 767 plunged into the Atlantic on Sunday after taking off 
from New York's Kennedy Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still searching,'' Clinton said, adding that complete  
answers ``will require the recovery of as much of the airplane as 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president, who receives daily briefings from the  
intelligence community, said that he was unaware of any recent 
threats against U.S. aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there have been any such threats, I do not know about  
them,'' he said. ``I am not aware of any specific threats against 
... airplanes flying out of American airports with large numbers of 
American passengers.''

<HEADLINE> Goebel Pushes Envelope in Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Normally, the figure skating  
spotlight is reserved for the women. The men have to do something 
other-worldly to get the headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Goebel took care of that by jumping into the stratosphere  
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	With three quadruple jumps, Goebel carried men's figure skating  
into a new era. And imagine that his performance came at Skate 
America, only the first major international event of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``In these competitions, you somehow find it within yourself to  
do it,'' Goebel said after his historic performance. The first 
American to hit a quad toe loop in competition, at the ISU Junior 
Grand Prix final last year -- he also hit a quad salchow, the first 
by anyone, at the '99 World Championships -- Goebel nailed a quad 
salchow-triple toe loop, a quad toe loop and a solo quad salchow. 
It wasn't enough to beat world champion Alexei Yagudin of Russia, 
who has much more expressiveness. But it did send a message. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jump has taken a step forward, and it's great to see,''  
said Canada's Elvis Stojko, the three-time world champion who 
perfected the four-revolution jump. Stojko was on hand to witness 
Goebel's extravaganza and finished third. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was amazing to see. It's what the sport is all about, to  
push forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin, another master of the quad, now must consider putting  
another one in his programs. Already, several other rivals -- 
Russians Evgeny Plushenko and Ilia Klimkin, China's Zhengxhin Guo -- 
are doing so. For those who fear men's skating will become more 
acrobatics than artistry, Saturday night might be the measuring 
stick. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more important to do the quads than the triples,'' said  
Goebel, in only his second season as a senior. ``Maybe nine or 10 
years ago, the triple axel was the benchmark. That's changed now. 
</P>
<P>
	``In practice, I do pretty much clean programs most of the time,  
and 18-20 of them were with all three quads,'' said Goebel, a 
part-time student at Case Western. ``But even with that, it was 
still a big shock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shocking enough to shift the attention from another college  
student-skater, UCLA freshman Michelle Kwan. In her season debut, 
Kwan made things look easy, although she fell on a triple flip. But 
her elegance and technique were superb, and she even got a perfect 
6.0 for artistic impression. 
</P>
<P>
	``A 6.0 for falling?'' she said. ``You get up really fast, just  
in case they were snoozing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan, who works with the same choreographer, Lori Nichol, who  
has helped Goebel improve his artistry, also was eager to talk 
about what Goebel had achieved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked him earlier in the day, `I hear you're going to try  
three quads,''' Kwan said. ``Is that possible? What are you 
thinking?' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I didn't want to psyche him out, so I said, `You go, Tim.'  
To do it like that is amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goebel won't be trying it again until the NHK Trophy in Japan in  
December. That gave Yagudin a sense of relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``Great,'' said Yagudin, who won't be at NHK. ``We will be  
safe.''

<HEADLINE> Police Chiefs Back Child Care Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eighty-six percent of police chiefs  
participating in a survey believe the government could reduce youth 
crime by increasing after-school and child care programs, an 
advocacy group said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly nine of 10 agreed that failing to do so will cost the  
nation more in the long run in crime, welfare and other expense, 
said Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, a group lobbying Congress to 
spend more on juvenile crime-prevention efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress' failure to substantially increase funding for  
education child care and after-school programs is irresponsible and 
shortsighted,'' said Edward A. Flynn, a member of the group's board 
and police chief of Arlington County, Va. ``Congress doesn't seem 
to be listening to law enforcement or the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flynn said the results of the survey may seem surprising.  
</P>
<P>
	``For some people, perhaps, it's counterintuitive,'' he said.  
``I suspect that most people who don't know many police chiefs or 
don't know a lot about what policing has been through in the last 
several years would assume that the police policy-makers would be 
heavy on punishment, heavy on reaction and heavy on sanctions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Survey results were being released at a meeting of the  
International Association of Chiefs of Police in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was conducted from Oct. 14 to Oct. 27 by two George  
Mason University professors who received 556 responses from the 855 
randomly selected municipal police chiefs who received faxes of a 
written questionnaire. The margin of error is plus or minus 5 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The police chiefs were guaranteed anonymity, and survey  
participants did not know that Fight Crime had commissioned the 
study, professors Stephen Mastrofsky and Scott Keeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The chiefs were asked to ``guide elected officials'' by ranking  
the effectiveness of four juvenile crime-fighting strategies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sixty-nine percent gave the highest priority to providing more  
after-school programs and educational child care,'' the group 
reported. Seventeen percent chose ``prosecute more juveniles as 
adults'' their No. 1 strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen percent gave ``hire more police officers to investigate  
juvenile crime'' their highest ranking, and 1 percent said 
``install more metal detectors and surveillance cameras in 
school.''

<HEADLINE> Head of Daewoo Group Offers To Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Kim Woo-choong, the disgraced chairman  
of the Daewoo Group, offered to resign to repent for the financial 
woes of his ailing conglomerate, Daewoo officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidents of the group's 12 affiliates, all under recovery  
programs overseen by government-controlled creditor banks, followed 
suit by submitting their resignations as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, 63, quietly left Seoul last week after the group's six main  
domestic creditor banks asked him to step down. The trip was seen 
as a show of displeasure at the request. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, now in Germany, called aides in Seoul over the weekend and  
offered to resign, Daewoo said. He expressed hope that the move 
would help speed up the recovery of his ailing group, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo, one of South Korea's biggest conglomerates, narrowly  
escaped becoming the nation's largest-ever bankruptcy in July when 
domestic creditors agreed to delay repayment of $5.8 billion in 
short-term debt for six months and extend $3.3 billion in new 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, Daewoo promised to cut its debt drastically by  
selling or spinning off all but 12 of its 25 subsidiaries and by 
attracting foreign investment. It is undergoing a massive 
restructuring under the supervision of domestic creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo officially reported debt totals of $36 billion at home  
and $9.94 billion abroad, with $5.48 billion maturing by the end of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the government-supervised program, Daewoo's creditor banks  
plan to convert their loans to equity holdings, thereby easing the 
burden on the group. That plan required Kim's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	The collapse of Daewoo is a huge humiliation for Kim, once a  
symbol of success. Over 32 years, Kim, 63, built Daewoo from a 
one-room textile exporter to a company with $65 billion in assets 
that last year sold $52 billion in goods, including ships, cars, 
clothes and pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1990s, Daewoo expanded its domestic and overseas business  
with huge bank loans. Its debt soared from $19 billion in 1995 to 
$48 billion last year, more than five times its equity.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone War Victims To Get Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- The United States and Norway announced a  
plan today to provide artificial limbs and rehabilitation services 
for mutilated and disabled victims of Sierra Leone's brutal civil 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative was announced by President Clinton and Norwegian  
Prime Minister Kjell Bondevik as world leaders gathered for a 
tribute to the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, slain 
four years ago by an opponent of the Middle East peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Norway initially will contribute up to $1  
million each to support the work of nongovernmental and other 
organizations engaged in helping Sierra Leone's victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deliberate amputation of limbs of innocent civilians by  
rebel militia has impaired thousands of individuals and created 
hardships for their families,'' White House press secretary Joe 
Lockhart said in a written statement. ``In addition to overcoming 
physical challenges, victims face serious problems in adapting and 
integrating into their own communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in brief remarks with Bondevik, said the initiative  
would provide artificial limbs ``to as many people as we possibly 
can, many of them children, whose limbs were deliberately amputated 
in the cruel civil war in Sierra Leone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president and prime minister also expressed concern ``about  
the growing problem of trafficking in women for the purpose of 
placing them into slavery-like conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement, they said, ``It is important to focus on  
the economic and social structures that give rise to prostitution 
and sexual exploitation, and to find methods to empower the women 
involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Bondevik said the problem should be addressed later  
this month at a summit in Turkey of the 55-nation Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe, which deals with issues ranging 
from human rights to arms control. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a problem worldwide, although trafficking in women  
within the OSCE area has come more into focus recently,'' the 
leaders said. Norway is proposing to host a conference next spring 
on trafficking in the OSCE area, which spans from Vancouver, 
British Columbia, to Vladivostok, Russia.

<HEADLINE> Russia Reopens Border in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russia opened several border crossings  
today with Chechnya, officials said, allowing terrified refugees to 
flee Russian air and rocket attacks after they had been blocked 
from leaving for days. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials opened border crossings at Stavropol, to the north of  
Chechnya, and at Dagestan, to the east of the breakaway republic, 
Russian news reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a third border crossing in the west, three bus loads of  
refugees, including children and some injured people, crossed from 
Chechnya into the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia, which 
has already taken some 170,000 refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	But no other vehicles were let through, and a line of cars and  
trucks crammed with refugees stretched for several miles on the 
Chechen side. It was not clear why the Ingush border was not fully 
open. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are ready to let the refugees pass, but it is necessary to  
keep order,'' Col. Arkady Krimsky said. He said the border would be 
opened to refugees for six days and border-crossers would undergo 
several document checks. 
</P>
<P>
	All borders were closed last week, trapping up to 20,000  
refugees trying to flee Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	Only six miles away from the Ingushetia border crossing, Russian  
artillery today heavily shelled the Chechen town of Bamut. The town 
has been a prime target for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian jets and artillery also targeted the Chechen capital  
Grozny and several villages to the south today. Russia used Grad 
rocket launchers and howitzers to hit some targets, said Igor 
Melnikov, a spokesman with the Russian armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian jets bombed a spring overnight near the village of  
Chernorechiye, killing 10 civilians, said Ruslan Magomedov, an aide 
to Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov. 
</P>
<P>
	Magomedov said civilians had come to the spring for drinking  
water since supplies were cut shortly after the fighting began. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 200,000 people are thought to have fled Chechnya since  
Russia began its offensive in September. Chechen leaders claim some 
3,600 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in Russian 
attacks. No independent confirmation is available, although medical 
workers have reported hundreds of civilian deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials have said repeatedly that Chechen claims of  
civilian casualties are exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow has said it sent troops into Chechnya to crush the  
militants, who are also blamed for a series of deadly apartment 
explosions in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said today that Russia did  
not intend to retake control of Chechnya by force, but wouldn't 
bargain with the militants either. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no intention of conquering the republic and bringing  
its people to their knees,'' he said, according to the Interfax 
news agency. Russia's goal is ``to destroy the terrorist stronghold 
in Chechnya and make (the republic's) revival possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will never sit at a negotiating table with gangsters who  
have blood on their hands,'' Putin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin said Islamic militants, who twice invaded neighboring  
Dagestan from Chechnya this summer, were planning new attacks on 
chemical and nuclear power plants in Russia, as well as on Russia's 
transportation network. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Kazbek Makhashev said today that  
if Russia doesn't stop shelling Chechnya, the republic may be 
forced to launch ``retaliatory strikes'' in surrounding Russian 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Makhashev said he wasn't making a threat ``but a belated  
warning,'' according to Interfax.

<HEADLINE> 5 Men Charged in Armenia Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) -- Five men were charged today with first  
degree murder in connection with an attack on parliament during 
which the prime minister and seven other officials and lawmakers 
were killed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The five men had already been charged with terrorism and  
weakening state power. As part of the investigation, police were 
questioning witnesses today, said Gurgen Ambarian, a spokesman at 
the prosecutor general's office. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, the men face up to 15 years in prison or the death  
sentence, though there has been a moratorium on capital punishment 
in Armenia since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges were filed a day after Armenians buried Prime  
Minister Vazgen Sarkisian, parliamentary speaker Karen Demirchian 
and other officials and legislators killed in the shooting. The 
funerals marked the end of three days of national mourning for the 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 15,000 mourners came to Armenia's main square for the  
memorial services, which took place inside the national opera. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunmen stormed parliament last Wednesday, killing Sarkisian and  
the others during a question-and-answer session. The attackers 
surrendered the next day, releasing some 40 hostages, after they 
were allowed to speak on national television and were promised a 
fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunmen said they had opened fire to punish corrupt  
officials. They accused the government of allowing Armenia to 
disintegrate and claimed the country's elite had sapped the economy 
through corruption.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Calls Iraqi Meeting a Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. officials said the first major meeting of  
Iraqi opposition groups in seven years was a success, but the real 
test will be whether they can agree on a program for a future Iraq 
without Saddam Hussein -- and on leaders to carry it out. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition to Saddam's rule has long struggled with political,  
ethnic and religious divisions -- and this weekend's meeting was 
seen as something of a last chance to bring key opposition groups 
together and elect a credible leadership that the United States 
will support. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Iraqi resistance leader Kadhim al-Battat delivered a  
message to the 300 delegates gathered from all over the world under 
the umbrella of the Iraqi National Congress: the Iraqi people are 
suffering and starving, especially in the south. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are fighting continuously,'' said al-Battat, who arrived  
here Friday after a risky 20-day journey from his home in the 
country's southern marsh area. ``I asked the brethren here that 
they should unite. They should solidify their forces -- and send 
that message back to Iraqis that they are united.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also urged the delegates to campaign for international  
support and assistance to help oust Saddam, saying he believes the 
Iraqi leader is trying again to develop weapons of mass 
destruction, though he had no direct evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Half the delegates came from Iraq and the rest from Syria, Iran,  
Jordan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Europe, the United States and Canada, 
said Iraqi National Congress spokesman Salah Shaikhly. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven other opposition groups, however, boycotted the session,  
dismissing the INC as ineffective and too reliant on Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government funded the assembly, the INC's first since  
1992, from $3 million that Congress authorized this year for Iraqi 
opposition groups. The INC said it also hoped for contributions 
from other countries and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	As the conference neared an end Sunday night, delegates still  
hadn't debated the proposed vision for the future -- which includes 
a new constitution with a democratic government that respects human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was plenty of politicking going on for elections to a  
new 51-member central committee that will meet twice a year and act 
as a mini-parliament. The newly elected committee will in turn 
elect a small leadership council, probably after today's concluding 
session, Shaikhly said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has made toppling Saddam a major  
objective -- and it is counting on opposition inside Iraq, backed by 
opposition outside Iraq, to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior U.S. State Department official said the meeting was  
very successful before it started because it had gotten Iraqis to 
talk to each other about key issues, including a future government, 
foreign funding for the opposition and the U.S. role. 
</P>
<P>
	If the conference demonstrates growing opposition unity, chooses  
a working leadership, and sets out a post-Saddam vision ``that is 
convincing in its detail, then we would consider this a great 
success,'' the U.S. official said, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin Gilman, a New York Republican who heads the House  
International Relations Committee, told delegates Sunday that if 
they produce ``a credible plan for escalating the challenge to 
Saddam Hussein, we will do everything we can to help you carry it 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``If new tools are needed, new mechanisms, new support, we will  
try to get them for you,'' he said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Poll: N.Y. Senate Race a Toss Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Most New York voters say they've already decided  
who they'll support in the likely Senate race between Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	With the contest still a year in the future, many New Yorkers  
appear to be keenly aware of the two candidates -- neither of whom 
is officially in the race -- and their ambitions to succeed the 
retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, The New York Times reports 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times/CBS News Poll conducted from Oct. 23 though Oct. 28,  
found that Giuliani, a Republican, and Mrs. Clinton, a Democrat, 
are in a statistical dead heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani has the support of 46 percent of voters, compared with  
42 percent for Mrs. Clinton. Another 8 percent of the voters say 
they have no preference. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey polled 1,315 New York residents, with 1,026 of the  
respondents saying they're registered to vote. The poll has a 
margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	New Yorkers named health care and education as their two most  
important concerns, and said they overwhelmingly think Mrs. Clinton 
would handle them better than the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a majority of the state's voters believe Giuliani cares  
more about the needs and problems of New York City residents and 
those in the surrounding suburbs, the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
	A Times/CBS News Poll in March said the first lady led by 9  
percentage points, 48 percent to 39 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, the mayor was being criticized for the conduct of  
the city's police department which faced allegations of brutality 
aimed mostly at the city's minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, the Times said, may have benefited then from  
President Clinton's popularity in the state, and from sympathy 
among voters who saw her as a wronged but still loyal wife.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong, Disney OK New Theme Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Hong Kong's government and Walt Disney wrapped  
up talks today on building a theme park here, and an official said 
they had reached an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney, based in Burbank, Calif., and Hong Kong have not  
confirmed that a deal was reached. But the government announced 
that the two sides would hold a series of joint briefings in Hong 
Kong on Tuesday to explain ``the outcome of the negotiations'' to 
lawmakers, economists, journalists, tourism executives and local 
personalities. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong officials hope a Disney park will improve the battered  
economy, first by creating construction jobs and later by 
attracting more tourists. If a deal has been reached, Hong Kong 
would join Paris and Tokyo as Disney locations outside the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's leader, Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, planned an  
announcement on Disney for Tuesday morning, a government statement 
said. The territory's tourism commissioner, Mike Rowse, said 
earlier he planned to attend a series of briefings, though he 
stopped short of confirming any deal. 
</P>
<P>
	An official speaking on condition of anonymity told The  
Associated Press that an agreement had been reached, but declined 
to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney spokesman Chris Furean said Judson Green, chairman of the  
Disney subsidiary that operates overseas theme parks and cruises, 
will be among the Disney executives on hand Tuesday. He declined 
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, several Chinese-language newspapers reported today  
that the government and Disney had struck a deal that would involve 
a government investment of $2.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A Hong Kong economist at investment bank Morgan Stanley Dean  
Witter, Andy Xie, said today that construction of a Disney park 
would improve the economic outlook in Hong Kong, which has endured 
a 15-month recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have said that after the park is built, most of the jobs  
will require few skills and pay low wages. There have also been 
concerns that Hong Kong would have to make too many concessions to 
lure Disney. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the talks were concluded, the government said it  
would proceed with necessary reclamation work to build a theme park 
-- including hotels and restaurants -- near Penny's Bay on outlying 
Lantau Island, the site of the new Hong Kong airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation that a deal had been sealed helped lift traders'  
spirits on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange early today, although blue 
chips gave up early gains of almost 1 percent and finished up just 
half a percentage point.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Appeals Internet Access Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- AT&AMP;T is taking its case for control of  
cable Internet access to a federal appeals court, four months after 
after a judge sided with one of the first U.S. cities to stand up 
to the telecommunications giant. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T wants total control of the cable TV network it acquired in  
a merger last year with Tele-Communications Inc. AT&AMP;T now plans to 
turn the system into a high-speed data pipeline linking Portland 
homes and businesses to the Internet 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The city and Multnomah County, however, passed ordinances  
requiring AT&AMP;T to open its network -- and its Internet pipeline -- to 
competitors who would share the cable system. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T responded by taking the city and county to federal court.  
But U.S. District Judge Owen Panner ruled in favor of Portland and 
Multnomah County, granting their request last June to dismiss the 
AT&AMP;T lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T appealed, and the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals was  
scheduled to hear oral arguments in the case today in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	The city and county say the Federal Communications Commission  
has decreased its regulatory role in order to encourage 
competition, but unless local governments take action, high-speed 
access to the Net may be limited to just a handful of companies -- 
or maybe just one. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's called logical, consistent thinking, which  
unfortunately is not the way of Washington, D.C., right now,'' said 
A. Michael Noll, a University of Southern California communications 
professor and a former AT&AMP;T employee. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T claims that limiting the number of access providers may not  
be so bad, because a company that can plan its investment in all 
the equipment it requires to run the Internet through TV cables can 
offer service faster, cheaper and more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're moving into an information-based economy. People who  
don't have access are at a disadvantage,'' said Milo Medin, chief 
technology officer of Excite@Home, AT&AMP;T's cable service partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, AT&AMP;T officials have argued, telephone companies such as  
U S West have already begun providing high-speed Internet access 
competition with their digital subscriber line, or DSL, service -- a 
way of pumping data over old copper phone lines at high speed. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, and a host of other Internet service providers, also claim  
that local government regulations will vary across the nation, 
forcing costly changes in equipment and services that will 
ultimately affect the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, a group of Internet and high-tech companies wrote  
the FCC, saying the Portland cable access case could lead to 
``Balkanization'' of regulatory authority and slow Internet growth 
and innovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prospect of 30,000 local jurisdictions setting their own  
policies on matters relating to the Internet is the stuff that 
gives Internet business people like me nightmares,'' said Jerry 
Kaplan, CEO of Onsale Inc., an electronic retailer. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC has said the cable Internet market must be allowed to  
develop before it decides on regulatory policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC estimates that only 1 million Americans have high-speed  
capability right now, out of 40 million residential Internet 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of other municipalities have followed Oregon,  
including Broward County, Fla. Last week, St. Louis voted to force 
open access in a preliminary vote. The final vote should come this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	But other municipalities, including the local cable commission  
that oversees the western Portland suburbs in Tualatin Valley, have 
decided against forcing AT&AMP;T to share its network with competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th Circuit is unlikely to rule until next year.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, AT&AMP;T is staying on schedule to upgrade its cable  
network to provide both data and voice service, but it won't 
activate service until the lawsuit is resolved, company officials 
say.

<HEADLINE> Allianz Ag To Buy Pimco Holdings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- In the latest trans-Atlantic move by a  
European financial giant, Germany's biggest insurer, Allianz AG, 
said it will acquire roughly 70 percent of U.S.-based Pimco 
Advisors Holdings for $3.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The contracts were signed Sunday in Munich by the management  
board Allianz and representatives of Pimco, the insurer said in a 
brief statement. More details were to be released at a news 
conference today. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Allianz said the transaction will be closed by  
the end of the first quarter 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Allianz has long sought to bolster its $360 billion  
fund-management business by expanding in the United States. 
Analysts describe the deal with Pimco, a Newport Beach, 
Calif.,-based firm with $250 billion in assets under management, as 
a coup for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	It puts Allianz on an equal footing with its French and Swiss  
arch-rivals AXA and Zurich Financial Services. Both already have 
strong U.S. presences, AXA through asset manager Alliance Capital 
and other holdings, Zurich through Scudder Kemper Investments Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	For Pimco, it provides an avenue for overseas distribution of  
its funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Pimco is the third-largest publicly traded investment-management  
company in the United States. Its Pimco Total Return Fund is the 
world's largest bond fund, with $27 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	``A joint future with Pimco represents a decisive step forward  
in our strategy of establishing asset management as our third core 
business,'' Allianz Chief Executive Officer Henning Schulte-Noelle 
said in a statement. ``By combining the expertise of Pimco and 
Allianz we will in future be one of the top financial providers in 
global asset management.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said a major sticking point in talks was the difficulty  
of structuring a deal. Pimco's legal status made a full takeover 
nearly impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Pimco is a master limited partnership, which allows it to avoid  
paying the typical 35 percent corporate income tax on its profits, 
and instead pay a 3.5 percent tax on its gross income. 
</P>
<P>
	Allianz said it had no plans to raise its stake in Pimco beyond  
70 percent.

<HEADLINE> EgyptAir Plummet Is Focus of Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Officials are reviewing radar tapes tracking a  
terrifying two-minute plunge by EgyptAir Flight 990 as they try to 
determine whether mechanical failure or a criminal act may have 
downed the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	From 33,000 feet, the jetliner dropped nearly 14,000 feet in  
only 36 seconds early Sunday, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet during that catastrophic plummet, the jetliner apparently  
possessed enough electrical power to broadcast its fast-diminishing 
altitude from its transponder, indicating to some aviation experts 
that it did not immediately break up even if its distress was 
instant. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, somehow, the plane's descent slowed and after about 90  
more seconds it crashed into the dark, cold waters of the Atlantic 
some 60 miles south of Nantucket Island, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board quickly assumed control  
of the investigation at the request of the Egyptian government, 
which normally would have taken the lead since the plane went down 
in international waters. 
</P>
<P>
	The only certainty was that the investigation would be neither  
simple nor short. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in the early hours of this investigation,'' said Jim  
Hall, the safety board chairman. ``We do not know at this point 
what caused the crash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and other U.S. officials said there was no  
immediate evidence of terrorism, although that was being 
investigated as a possibility. ``I think it's better if people draw 
no conclusions until we know something,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety board dispatched a team of crash experts to Quonset  
Point, R.I., designated as a command post for the investigation, as 
the FBI interviewed people who had access to the plane. Egyptian 
officials rushed to help their American counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	Radar tapes indicated the plane plummeted to 19,100 feet from  
33,000 feet in the first 36 seconds. Then, at least part of it 
continued to remain visible on radar for nearly a minute and a 
half. The fall began just a few minutes after a routine voice 
communication from the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
	In that first steep fall, the plane plunged at a descent rate of  
about 23,200 feet per minute, two to three times a standard 
emergency descent rate. The continuing radar images after that 
could indicate an in-flight breakup, with smaller pieces drifting 
down more slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall wouldn't say whether the radar tapes showed an aircraft in  
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Sept. 24 ``information circular'' obtained by The  
Associated Press, the Federal Aviation Administration said several 
U.S. agencies got letters in August warning ``a bomb or explosive 
device with `spiral expansion' would soon be used on a flight 
departing from either Los Angeles airport or New York's JFK 
airport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The alert had been in effect until Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Flight 990 left Los Angeles on Saturday and stopped at John F.  
Kennedy International Airport in New York, bound for Cairo. The 
plane took off from Kennedy at 1:19 a.m. EST Sunday and disappeared 
from radar screens 33 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in Cairo, the head of EgyptAir, Mohammed  
Fahim Rayan, said he had no information about any direct threat 
against his airline. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, an FBI official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
the person who made the claim cited in the FAA memo was in prison 
and officials had no information the warning was related to the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	John Nance, an aviation analyst and veteran airline captain,  
said that if controllers knew the plane's altitude during its drop, 
it would indicate the jet still had partial electrical power. 
</P>
<P>
	While radar locates a target in the sky, controllers do not know  
the identity of the blip or its altitude without information 
broadcast from the airplane's transponder. 
</P>
<P>
	That broadcast can only be made with the help of electricity  
supplied by the plane. A continuing electrical supply could help 
the investigation because it could mean the electric-powered flight 
data recorder and cockpit voice recorder kept operating during part 
of the descent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Exactly what that means I don't know, but it is an entirely  
different situation from TWA (Flight 800) and Pan Am 103, which had 
breakups and an immediate loss of power,'' Nance said. 
</P>
<P>
	The TWA plane blew up off Long Island, N.Y., in July 1996,  
killing all 230 aboard. Investigators believe the plane's nearly 
empty center fuel tank exploded. A bomb destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 
over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, killing 270 people on 
board and on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Boyle, executive director of the Port Authority, which  
manages Kennedy airport, said the FBI was interviewing the flight 
crew that got off in New York -- replaced by another crew for the 
second leg -- as well as everyone who worked on the plane during its 
layover at JFK of just over an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were also looking at the plane's production and  
maintenance history. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane, tail number SU-GAP, was delivered to EgyptAir in  
September 1989, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	It came off Boeing's assembly line 10 years ago, shortly before  
workers went on strike, complaining of too much forced overtime. 
The next plane off the line, a 767 for Austria's Lauda Air, crashed 
in 1991 in Thailand when a system that slows the plane on the 
ground deployed in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The company knew of no relationship between the two crashes but  
``we're going to look at every possible scenario,'' a Boeing 
spokesman said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the items recovered from the plane in the first day's  
search showed burn marks pointing to a possible fire or explosion 
on board. Items included seat cushions, evacuation slides, clothing 
and passports.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: No Evidence of Jet Sabotage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- President Clinton said today that he was  
unaware of any ``specific threats'' against U.S. airlines or 
passengers before the EgyptAir crash and reiterated that there was 
no early indication of sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing has been ruled in; nothing has been ruled out,''  
Clinton said. ``I hope no one will draw any conclusions one way or 
another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke with reporters in Oslo, where he is attending a  
series of meetings designed to keep moving the Middle East peace 
talks along the route to a final status agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he had no new information about why the  
Boeing 767 plunged into the Atlantic on Sunday after taking off 
from New York's Kennedy Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still searching,'' Clinton said, adding that complete  
answers ``will require the recovery of as much of the airplane as 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president, who receives daily briefings from the  
intelligence community, said that he was unaware of any recent 
threats against U.S. aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there have been any such threats, I do not know about  
them,'' he said. ``I am not aware of any specific threats against 
... airplanes flying out of American airports with large numbers of 
American passengers.''

<HEADLINE> Actor in `Seven Samurai' Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Minoru Chiaki, the last survivor of the actors who  
played the title characters in Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, 
``Seven Samurai,'' died Monday. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiaki, born Katsuji Sasaki, also played major roles in the  
famed late director's ``Hidden Fortress'' and ``Rashomon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He died at a Tokyo hospital of acute respiratory and coronary  
failure, his family said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiaki joined a theater group in 1936 and started acting in  
movies in 1949 at Kurosawa's suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiaki made his screen debut in Kurosawa's ``Norainu'' (``Stray  
Dog''). He eventually appeared in 11 movies directed by Kurosawa, 
who died in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1975, Chiaki collapsed from a cerebral hemorrhage, but  
recovered and continued working in TV dramas. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife Fumie, 80, and three sons. A funeral  
service was scheduled for Thursday at a temple on the outskirts of 
Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Court Lets Ohio Libel Ruling Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate a  
libel and invasion-of-privacy lawsuit against an Ohio newspaper 
over a 1990 series of articles about alleged police misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, let stand rulings that threw out the  
case against The Blade by eight Toledo police officers and the 
widows of two dead policemen. 
</P>
<P>
	The articles were based on police records the newspaper had  
obtained after going to court and seeking public disclosure of 
records of the city police force's internal affairs unit. The 
articles discussed, among other things, reports of police violence, 
sexual misconduct, and drug and alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for those who sued the newspaper contended that the  
articles ``simulated investigative reporting'' but were ``merely a 
cumulative result of digging through 20 years worth of old 
complaints and allegations in internal affairs files that were for 
the most part so unsubstantiated they never resulted in any public 
charge or proceedings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for The Blade urged the justices to reject the appeal.  
They said the lawsuit long has advanced ``a profusion of meritless 
claims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A state judge in 1997 threw out the 1990 lawsuit without  
allowing it to reach a jury. A state appeals court upheld the 
dismissal and the Ohio Supreme Court refused to hear the ensuing 
appeal last March. 
</P>
<P>
	In commenting on the invasion-of-privacy allegations, the trial  
judge noted that The Blade published material it lawfully had 
obtained in a public-records request. 
</P>
<P>
	``If by some chance the custodian of those records failed to  
redact information that should have remained private, then 
punishing The Blade for publishing such matter cannot be held to 
serve a highest-order government interest,'' Judge William Skow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consequently, since the material ... was lawfully obtained and  
concerned a matter of public significance, and since punishing The 
Blade ... would not serve a state interest of the highest order, 
punishment is constitutionally precluded,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	About the libel allegations, the judge ruled that those who sued  
the newspaper had failed to prove the allegedly libelous statements 
were written with ``actual malice'' -- knowledge or ``reckless 
disregard'' of falsity. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining in the lawsuit were Toledo police officers Michael  
Early, Mary Ann Hodak, John P. Smith, George Taylor, Robert Case, 
Martin Schabor, Robert Barboza and Kimberly Kristof. Jane Lewis and 
Linda Leichty, the widows of Toledo policemen, also participated in 
the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Early vs. The Toledo Blade, 99-331.

<HEADLINE> Disney To Open Park in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- The government said Monday it has concluded  
talks with the Walt Disney Co. about building a theme park here, 
and an official said the two sides had reached a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney and Hong Kong wouldn't confirm they had reached a deal on  
the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong officials hope a Disney park can improve the battered  
economy, first by creating construction jobs and later by 
attracting more tourists. Hong Kong would join Paris and Tokyo as 
Disney locations outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's top government spokesman, Stephen Lam, said the  
talks had wrapped up, following Sunday's deadline, and that Hong 
Kong officials planned ``a series of briefings'' for Tuesday. Lam 
declined by telephone to provide any details. 
</P>
<P>
	An official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The  
Associated Press that an agreement had been reached and Disney 
executives were expected at Tuesday's briefings. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was immediately available for comment at Disney's office  
in Hong Kong, according to a woman who answered the phone. 
</P>
