Report: China's Jiang will visit Thailand late next year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's President Jiang Zemin will pay
a state visit to Thailand late next year, possibly after
September's APEC summit in New Zealand, the Bangkok Post reported
on Sunday.
	   Akaphol Sorasuchart, the government spokesman, said the visit
was confirmed during talks on Friday between Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai and visiting Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing, the Post
said.
	   He said Jiang will visit to join in the 72nd birthday
celebration of Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej. In the Buddhist
religion, the 72nd birthday is considered an auspicious event.
	   Chuan has already been invited to visit China in early 1999.
	   Mr. Li also told Chuan that China will support Thailand's
Commerce Minister Supachai Panichpakdi for president of the World
Trade Organization, a post Supachai has been campaigning for, the
Post said.

Japanese runner starts games off with near-record marathon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be led with opening ceremony; actual opening declaration
expected at 1300 GMT) &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan's Naoko Takahashi staged her own
opening ceremony for the Asian Games Sunday, winning the first gold
medal with a marathon time just one minute off the world record.
	   To avoid the worst of Bangkok's tropical heat, the women's
marathon was started at 6:30 a.m. (2330 GMT Saturday), more than 13
hours before King Bhumibol Adulyadej was to formally declare the
opening at ceremonies with trumpet fanfares and royal fireworks.
	   Takahashi needed just 2 hours, 21 minutes, 47 seconds to finish
the 42.195 kilometers (26 miles, 385 yards) _ 13 minutes better
than the second-place runner _ and might have gone faster if
temperatures had not started rising into the 30s Celsius (90s F).
	   After the fifth best women's marathon time ever, Takahashi said
that ``at 20 kilometers (12 miles), I didn't intend to lose the
pace but my body wouldn't keep going properly. I wasn't expecting a
world record here but it's true that I'll look back and think I
could have done much better over the last 10 kilometers (6
miles).''
	   Kenya's Tegla Loroupe set the world record of 2:20:47 in
Rotterdam this year, and her coach, Yoshio Koide, said that ``with
her ability now she can break the record any time the conditions
are good.''
	   Her time shattered the Asian record of 2:24:07 set by China's
Wang Junxia in 1993 and was far faster than the old games record of
2:29:32 set by China's Zhong Huangdi in 1994.
	   Japan missed a 1-2 sweep when North Korean Kim Chang outsprinted
Tomoko Kai over the final 100 meters in the main stadium. Kim took
the silver in 2:34:55, and Kai the bronze in 2:35:01.
	   Koide said the tiny 26-year-old Takahashi has a huge appetite.
	   ``Sometimes she will eat a whole plate of meat and 50 pieces of
sushi in one go,'' Koide said. ``She has noticed a Chinese
restaurant in Bangkok and wants me to go there with her tonight.
... She'll probably stop for more food at a street stall after
that.''
	   While the women marathon racers won the first medals, they were
not the first to start action at the games.
	   The original field of 23 soccer teams has been playing for a
week to narrow the field to 16 teams for the second round, opening
Monday.
	   The survivors are Turkmenistan, South Korea, China, Lebanon,
Japan, India, Qatar, Tajikistan, the United Arab Emirates, North
Korea, Thailand, Oman, Uzbekistan, Kuwait, Iran and Kazakstan.
	   Those eliminated were Vietnam, Cambodia, Nepal, the Maldives,
Hong Kong, Mongolia and Laos.
	   Among Monday's games is a contest between archrivals South Korea
and Japan, battling both for Asian supremacy and prestige in
advance of their co-host roles for the 2002 World Cup finals. A
loss at this round robin stage would not necessarily lead to
elimination from medal contention.
	   Preliminary competition also began Sunday for snooker, making
its Asian Games debut.
	   In all, 377 gold medals are at stake in 36 sports. Some 6,000
athletes from 41 nations are competing in Asia's version of the
Olympics, even though Asia's financial crisis has forced some
nations to curtail their entries.
	   The men's marathon is scheduled for the closing day, Dec. 20.

Quann sets record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) _ Fourteen-year-old Megan Quann set
her third American record at the U.S. Open with a time of 2:25.52
in the short-course 200-meter breaststroke Saturday.
	   Quann broke the old record of 2:25.84 set by Kristine Quance in
1993. Quann, a high school freshman from Puyallup, Washington, set
the American record in the short-course 100 breaststroke (1:07.41)
earlier in the competition.
	   Natalie Coughlin, 16, of Terrapins Swim Team won the 200
butterfly in the final day of competition in 2:08.32, and it was
enough for her to win the high point award with 90.
	   Coughlin finished the meet with four gold medals, and all were
meet records. She also set American record in the 200 backstroke
(2:07.46). Coughlin, who also swam to a silver in one event, is a
high school sophomore from Concord, Calif.
	   Tom Wilkens of Santa Clara led the men with 82 points. He won
200 breaststroke in 2:10.76 on Saturday, which was a meet record.
	   Southern Methodist swept the relays for the second consecutive
year in the women's division.

Newspaper: Indonesia's new president to be installed Nov. 10
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's next president will take
the oath of office on Nov. 10 after being elected by the country's
highest legislative body, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   President B.J. Habibie and the parliament agreed last week to
hold elections on June 7 for the parliament, whose members would
make up the People's Consultative Assembly along with some
appointed figures.
	   The Assembly, which is empowered to elect a new president, will
convene in late August to decide the agenda for the presidential
election.
	   The Jakarta Post daily quoted Faisal Tamin, secretary-general of
the home affairs ministry, as saying the government has set Oct. 28
as the tentative date for the start of the presidential election.
	   ``The plan is that on Nov. 10... we will see the new president
and vice president installed,'' Tamin said.
	   The current 500-member parliament, which is dominated by the
ruling Golkar party, is discussing new laws on general election and
composition of the Parliament as well as the Assembly.
	   Critics say the 1,000-member Assembly does not have the
credibility to choose a new leader for the nation of 202 million
people as it is packed with appointees of former President Suharto.
The authoritarian leader quit in May after riots and protests
against his three-decade rule.
	   New political laws are expected to be endorsed in January.
	   A total of 114 new parties have registered with the home affairs
ministry, but the government said only about ten have so far been
considered eligible for the election.
	   Following the resignation of Suharto, his successor and former
protege, Habibie, has promised political reforms and new elections.
	   However, students and pro-democracy activists charge that
Habibie wants to stall democratic reforms and is a stooge of
Suharto, now a virtual recluse in his central Jakarta home.
	   Students have staged near-daily protests demanding a trial of
77-year-old Suharto on charges of corruption and human rights
abuses.

Tennessee, Florida State appear set for national title showdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICHARD ROSENBLATT &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Tennessee's in, Florida State appears to be in,
UCLA appears to be out and Kansas State is out _ of the Fiesta
Bowl, that is.
	   On one of the wildest final days of the regular season Saturday,
only the top-ranked Volunteers (12-0) emerged with a perfect record
after No. 2 Kansas State (11-1) and No. 3 UCLA (10-1) were bumped
off.
	   ``The results are certain to keep the Volunteers in first place
in the Bowl Championship Series standings on Sunday,'' Roy Kramer,
chairman of the BCS said Saturday night. ``And the second spot
should be very close with several teams still in the picture.''
	   The most likely team to benefit from the losses would be No. 4
Florida State (11-1), which did not play on Saturday, but could
move up to No. 2 in The Associated Press' media poll and the
coaches' poll on Sunday.
	   ``We have one more big one to play,'' Vols coach Phillip Fulmer
said, ``It's been an incredible championship Saturday.''
	   The final BCS standings will be released on Sunday at 3:30 p.m.
EST, and the results could be close between the Seminoles, Bruins
and even No. 5 Ohio State (10-1). Kansas State was ranked third in
the BCS standings going in and has the least likely chance of all
to get to Tempe.
	   Florida State coach Bobby Bowden figures if Nos. 2-3 lost, his
team should move up.
	   ``I went so many years where people said I couldn't win a
national championship,'' Bowden said. ``It's been five years since
we won ours and now we get another shot at it.''
	   If the Fiesta Bowl ends up with Florida State vs. Tennessee, the
rest of the BCS games would shape up like this:
	   _ Rose Bowl: UCLA vs. Wisconsin
	   _ Orange Bowl: Florida vs. Syracuse
	   _ Sugar Bowl: Ohio State vs. Texas A and M
	   Kansas State could turn into the biggest loser, but must wait
until Sunday to find out where it will play.
	   ``This may be, in their young lives, the most difficult thing
they've had to handle,'' K-State coach Bill Snyder said. ``The pain
that comes from this is obvious.''
	   With two of the top three teams losing, there was room for both
Florida (9-2) and Ohio State in BCS games. Reports indicated the
Gators would have aced out the Buckeyes had the top three teams
won.
	   The rest of the bowl picture will be made official on Sunday,
once the BCS pairings are made.
	   Also, Saturday's results knocked No. 6 Arizona (11-1) out of its
first Rose Bowl berth and into the Holiday Bowl, where the Wildcats
will play Nebraska (9-3).
 &UR; No. 1 Tennessee 24, No. 23 Mississippi St. 14 &QC; 
	   At Atlanta, Tee Martin, harassed most of the night by incessant
blitzing, threw two touchdown passes 28 seconds apart in the fourth
quarter as the Volunteers survived to win the Southeastern
Conference championship game.
	   Mississippi State (8-4) went ahead 14-10 on Kevin Prentiss'
83-yard punt return with 8:43 remaining, but the Vols weren't about
to suffer the same fate at Kansas State and UCLA.
	   Martin, who was 15-of-32 for 208 yards, directed Tennessee's
struggling offense right down the field, throwing a 41-yard
touchdown pass to Peerless Price with 6:15 to go. Then, after Wayne
Madkin fumbled on State's next play from scrimmage, Tennessee
needed only one play to score again on Martin's 26-yard pass to
Cedrick Wilson.
 &UR; No. 10 Texas A and M 36, No. 2 Kansas St. 33, 2 OT &QC; 
	   At St. Louis, Sirr Parker caught a 32-yard touchdown pass as the
Aggies, who trailed by 15 points entering the fourth quarter,
rallied for the upset.
	   Texas A and M (11-2) tied it with 1:05 left in the fourth
quarter when Parker caught a 9-yard scoring pass from Branndon
Stewart and then grabbed a 2-point conversion pass.
	   Kansas State (11-1) almost won on the final play of regulation
when Michael Bishop completed a 55-yard Hail Mary pass to Everett
Burnett at the 2.
 &UR; Miami 49, No. 3 UCLA 45 &QC; 
	   At Miami, Edgerrin James scored from one yard out with 50
seconds left as Miami snapped UCLA's 20-game winning streak.
	   After James, who had a record-setting day with 39 carries for
299 yards and three touchdowns, gave the Hurricanes (8-3) the lead,
Cade McNown has one last chance to pull out the win.
	   The left-hander came close, moving UCLA (10-1) to the Miami 29
with four seconds left. McNown, who threw for five touchdowns and a
school-record 515 yards, lofted a pass into the end zone, but it
fell incomplete in a group of receivers and defenders.
 &UR; Air Force 20, BYU 13 &QC; 
	   At Las Vegas, Air Force shocked Brigham Young with a 59-yard
touchdown pass to Matt Farmer late in the fourth quarter to beat
the Cougars in the final Western Athletic Conference football
championship.
 &UR; Army 34, Navy 30 &QC; 
	   At Philadelphia, the 99th game between the service academies was
marred by an accident when a railing collapsed at Veterans Stadium
and nine fans were injured. The accident occurred after Ty Amey's
70-yard TD run gave Army a 31-30 lead in the highest scoring game
in the history of the series.

Rangers 2, Senators 1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KANATA, Ontario (AP) _ Todd Harvey and Niklas Sundstrom each
scored first-period goals as the New York Rangers beat the Ottawa
Senators 2-1 for their fourth straight victory.
	   The Rangers (9-9-7) reached the .500 mark for the first time in
a year and are unbeaten in five games. They have lost only one of
their last eight games overall (5-1-2) and one of six on the road.
	   Ottawa (12-8-3) has lost only three of its past 12 (6-3-3), but
blew an opportunity to set club records for for consecutive home
wins (5) and most games over .500 (6).
	   Radek Bonk scored for Ottawa.
 &UR; Bruins 2, Penguins 1
	   In Boston, Shawn Bates scored his first goal of the season and
assisted on another as the Boston Bruins extended their unbeaten
streak to seven games with a victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins.
	   The Bruins are 5-0-2 in their last seven games and 7-1-4 in
their last 12, losing only 3-1 to Dallas on Nov. 14.
	   Byron Dafoe stopped 17 of 18 shots and held Pittsburgh scoreless
on two power-play opportunities in the second period. Overall, he
turned back 33 of 34 Penguins shots.
 &UR; Maple Leafs 4, Canadiens 3, OT
	   In Montreal, Tomas Kaberle's blast from the high slot 34 seconds
into overtime lifted the Toronto Maple Leafs to a comeback victory
over the Montreal Canadiens.
	   Tie Domi had tied it with 2:20 left in regulation. Martin
Rucinsky had given Montreal a 3-2 lead 7:22 into the third period
when his wrist shot from the left side got past Curtis Joseph.
 &UR; Devils 7, Islanders 5
	   In UNiondale, New York, the New Jersey Devils got goals from
seven different players and needed every one of them as they hung
on to beat the New York Islanders.
	   Jason Arnott, Krzysztof Oliwa, Bobby Holik, Brendan Morrison,
Dave Andreychuk, Petr Sykora and Patrick Elias all scored for the
Devils, who stretched their unbeaten streak to four games (3-0-1).
Chris Terreri stopped 20 shots for his fourth win.
	   Bryan Smolinski and Ted Donato each had two goals for the
Islanders, and Barry Richter also scored.
 &UR; Flyers 2, Capitals 1
	   In Philadelphia, Rod Brind'Amour scored two power-play goals and
Ron Hextall made 22 saves as the Philadelphia Flyers beat the
Washington Capitals.
	   It was the fourth loss in the last five games for last season's
Stanley Cup finalists.
	   Brian Bellows scored the only goal for the Capitals.
 &UR; Panthers 3, Hurricanes 3
	   In Sunrise, Florida, former Panther Ray Sheppard scored his
ninth goal in the last 11 games and added an assist on the
game-tying goal to lift Carolina to a tie with Florida, extending
the Hurricanes' unbeaten streak to six games.
	   Dino Ciccarelli, out since Nov. 4 while recovering from a
hairline fracture to his back, scored two power-play goals in the
second period to give Florida a 3-2 lead heading into the final
period.
	   The Hurricanes then tied the game when Sheppard fed a streaking
Nelson Emerson in front, and Emerson beat Sean Burke on the glove
side to forge a 3-3 tie at 12:23.
 &UR; Avalanche 3, Blues 1
	   In St. Louis, Claude Lemieux scored a power-play goal with 4:50
remaining and Joe Sakic had an empty-net goal to lead the Colorado
Avalanche over the St. Louis Blues.
	   It was the second straight win for the Avalanche over the Blues
in a back-to-back series, and moved Colorado to the .500 level for
the first time this season at 11-11-2. The Avalanche started the
season at 0-4-1, the worst in franchise history.
	   Lemieux scored the game winner at 15:10 of the final period on a
shot from just in front of goaltender Jamie McLennan. The Avalanche
got the power-play opportunity when Chris McAlpine was called for
interference.
 &UR; Sabres 3, Predators 1
	   In Nashville, Tennessee, Brian Holzinger scored the winning goal
with 5:13 left and Dominik Hasek made 36 saves, as the Buffalo
Sabres defeated the Nashville Predators for their fourth straight
victory.
	   Holzinger connected from the slot, breaking a 1-1 tie. He poked
a shot past Nashville goaltender Eric Fichaud, who did the splits
but could not reach the puck.
	   Rasmussen added an insurance goal into an empty net.
	   A power-play goal by Nashville's Cliff Ronning's early in the
third period had tied the game at 1.

Unbeaten Tapia moves up in class, beats WBA welterweight champ

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ Unbeaten bantamweight Johnny
Tapia survived a knockdown and a listless performance Saturday to
win the WBA bantamweight title from Nana Konadu in a majority
12-round decision.
	   Judges John Poturaj and Uriel Aguilera scored it 115-112 and
116-111 for Tapia, while Judge Franco Priami called it a 114-114
draw. The AP had Konadu winning 116-113.
	   Konadu, 33, of Ghana, dropped to 39-4-1 with a performance that
had fans booing and chanting ``bor-ing'' midway through.
	   Tapia, a former 115-pounder fighting for a title in the
118-pound class for the first time, was cut over the right eye in
the third round and knocked down in the 11th, but he was the more
active fighter throughout.
	   Moving side to side and stopping to square up and throw his
punches, the 31-year-old American, fighter thrust his tattooed arms
into the air when the decision was announced.
	   Tapia got caught with a solid left hook and then a forearm in
the 11th to go down, but he argued the call with referee Frank
Capuccino, saying he had slipped. The slippery canvas gave fighters
trouble all night.
	   Tapia, a 115-pound champion who holds the IBF and WBO world
champion junior bantamweight title, ran his record to 45-0-2.
	   Konadu, who won his title in 1996, lost it nine months later to
Daorung Chuwatana and then won it back in a 1997 rematch with
Chuwatana. This year, he had won both of his fights.
	   Tapia's purse was dlrs 450,000, Konadu's dlrs 200,000.
	   The fight marked the first in Atlantic City in eight years for
promoter Don King, who was banned from doing business with casinos
here in 1994 because of a pending wire fraud indictment in New York
state. The ban was lifted earlier this year after King was cleared
of the charges.
	   The card, dubbed ``The King Is Back,'' included a flamboyant
entrance by the frizzle-topped promoter, whose tuxedo and
diamond-studded crucifix necklace was showered with confetti as he
stepped into the ring at the Atlantic City Convention Center ring
accompanied by the Orange High School band.
	   The ring had be soaked with soda pop before the fight after a
co-feature in which WBA welterweight champion repeatedly slipped
and fell en route to a 12-round unanimous decision over Jose Luis
Lopez.

 &UR; Chalmers tames Royal Adelaide to win Australian Open &QL; 
 &UR; By DENNIS PASSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Australian lefthander Greg Chalmers
shot a 2-under-par 70 Sunday to win the Australian Open golf
tournament by a stroke over countrymen Peter Senior and Stuart
Appleby.
	   Chalmers, 25, who recently secured his U.S. PGA tour card for
1999 after finishing 25th on the European money list _ where he
also had two second-place finishes _ just held on for the win at
the par-72 Royal Adelaide after leading by four strokes with four
holes to play.
	   He bogeyed the 18th after watching Senior, who had birdied the
two previous holes, miss a birdie putt that would have forced a
playoff. The Sydney-born lefthander finished with a four-round
total of even-par 288.
	   Chalmers won 115,200 US dlrs. It was the first victory by a
lefthander in the Australian Open since Claud Felstead, an amateur,
won at Royal Melbourne in 1909.
	   ``Ever since I was 13 years old, I've watched this event, and
you see the guys who win it,'' said Chalmers. ``Sometimes I
wondered if my name would get up there. I'm just thrilled.''
	   After three days of gusty conditions, the breeze at Royal
Adelaide finally abated Sunday, allowing for 12 sub-par rounds, the
most of the tournament.
	   Senior finished with a 70 and a four-round total of 289, level
with Appleby, who shot 72 Sunday. Appleby, the sentimental
favorite, was playing in Australia for the first time since the
death of his wife, Renay, in a car accident in London in July.
	   Appleby, in the final group with England's Nick Faldo, had a
chance to force a playoff but he missed his 15-foot birdie putt on
18 while Chalmers watched from the side of the green.
	   Chalmers, who shot a 61 at the English Open this year while
finishing second, birdied two of the first three holes to quickly
overcome the one-shot lead that Appleby took into the final round.
	   Faldo, who shot a 73 Sunday, finished tied for fourth with
Robert Allenby (71) of Australia, both with 3-over totals of 291.
	   It was a mixed day for the Presidents Cup players in the field
who will begin play next Friday at Royal Melbourne. The Americans
have won both previous events.
	   United States team player Fred Couples shot a 69 Sunday to
finish at 296, 8 over par. Teammate John Huston shot 74 Sunday,
seven better than his Saturday round.
	   On the International side, Greg Norman, who barely made the
two-round cut after an 82 Friday, shot 77 to finish at 299. Frank
Nobilo of New Zealand had a 73 and Carlos Franco of Paraguay and
Craig Parry of Australia 71 each. (djp)

 &UR; Poll outcome shows ethnic reconciliation in Taiwan &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNIE HUANG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The triumph of a politician not born in
Taiwan shows one unwelcome cultural undercurrent is clearing up _
an ethnic divide between the native majority and Chinese who fled
mainland communism half a century ago.
	   ``The Taiwanese society and our voters have matured gradually,''
Ma Ying-jeou said after declaring victory in the Taipei mayoral
race shortly before midnight Saturday. ``There is no longer any
market for the ethnic issue. Any candidates trying to capitalize on
the issue could only incite backfires.''
	   Before voters had their say, doubts had lingered over whether
Ma, who was born to mainland immigrants but moved to Taiwan when he
was just 1, could defeat a popular, native-born mayor in the
capital.
	   Ma ran for the ruling Nationalist Party, and he carried some
huge personal strengths into the campaign, a clean image, magnetic
charm and good looks _ not to mention a successful background in
government.
	   But supporters of incumbent mayor Chen Shui-bian struck some low
blows, raising questions about Ma's loyalty to Taiwan by branding
him as a pawn in a conspiracy to sell out to China.
	   Ma's party favors eventual reunification, but near the end of
the campaign Ma said he personally would go into combat with
Chinese to defend Taiwan, if necessary.
	   And the ethnic attacks didn't sit well with many voters.
	   ``The election was never about China,'' said one Ma supporter,
Lee Ya-fen, who works for a construction engineering company.
``Chen only lost votes by raising the ethnic question.''
	   Ma, a former justice minister, captured 766,000 votes, or 51
percent. He enjoyed broad support among the majority native voters
as well as minority mainland-born voters.
	   Chen comes from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party that
favors a formal declaration of independence from China _ a tactic
viewed as too risky by Taiwanese who fear China might retaliate
with a military attack.
	   After Gen. Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists were ousted from
mainland China by Mao Tse-tung's Communist forces in 1949, Chiang
fled to Taiwan with about 2 million followers, mostly soldiers and
elite members of Chinese society.
	   The mainlanders dominated Taiwanese politics, while the native
born occupied themselves in farms or businessness. They stayed away
from the political sphere, to avoid suppression or even jail.
	   But during the last decade of democratic reforms carried out by
President Lee Teng-hui, the mainlanders have been largely replaced
by native Taiwanese within the government, and new tensions
emerged.
	   Several retired or ousted politicians have sought to establish
ties with mainland Chinese leaders and attacked Lee and his
followers on allegations they were covertly pushing for Taiwanese
independence.
	   During the campaign, Chen stayed away from demanding
independence as he instead took aim at Ma.
	   Newspapers said Chen's camp tried to spread the word among
voters that ``Taiwanese don't vote for Chinese.''
	   The nasty campaign drew antagonism, especially among supporters
of the tiny New Party who are mostly mainland immigrants or their
offspring. Most dumped their own longshot candidate to vote for Ma,
figuring that since they weren't going to win anyway, their best
strategy was to get rid of Chen.
	   Days before the poll, the president helped dissolve the
lingering doubts over Ma's loyalty by urging voters to accept the
mainlanders as ``New Taiwanese.''
	   Lee earlier had lamented about ``the sadness of Taiwanese'' who
first let Japanese and later mainlanders determine their fates.
Taiwan had been ruled by Japan for 50 years as a colony before it
was returned to China after World War II.
	   Lee then appealed for reconciliation ``to help us walk out of
the past shadows.''

Grieving Jewish families target of hate mail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Grieving families of the Maccabiah
bridge disaster victims had become targets of anti-Semitic hate
mail, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry said Sunday.
	   Four Australian athletes were killed and dozens of others
injured when a bridge collapsed at last year's Maccabiah Games, the
so-called Jewish Olympics, in Israel.
	   Executive Council of Australian Jewry vice-president Jeremy
Jones said some of these families had received letters which said:
``I wish more of you had died.
	   ``You can imagine how upset these grieving families would have
been when they got these types of letters,'' he said.
	   Jones said the number of anti-Semitic incidents had risen to
324, an increase of 22 percent over the past 12 months.
	   The results were reported at the Executive Council of Australian
Jewry's annual meeting in Sydney on Sunday.
	   Jones said ECAJ did not have a theory why Jews had become a
prime target for prejudice.
	   ``We don't know whether it was economic or to do with an event,
but it doesn't seem to be in any way related to what a Jewish
person does, it doesn't seem to be related to what is happening in
Israel or internationally,`` he said.
	   ``It seems to be much more a factor of the racist than any other
thing.''

Grieving Jewish families target of hate mail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Grieving families of the Maccabiah
bridge disaster victims had become targets of anti-Semitic hate
mail, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry said Sunday.
	   Four Australian athletes were killed and dozens of others
injured when a bridge collapsed at last year's Maccabiah Games, the
so-called Jewish Olympics, in Israel.
	   Executive Council of Australian Jewry vice-president Jeremy
Jones said some of these families had received letters which said:
``I wish more of you had died.
	   ``You can imagine how upset these grieving families would have
been when they got these types of letters,'' he said.
	   Jones said the number of anti-Semitic incidents had risen to
324, an increase of 22 percent over the past 12 months.
	   The results were reported at the Executive Council of Australian
Jewry's annual meeting in Sydney on Sunday.
	   Jones said ECAJ did not have a theory why Jews had become a
prime target for prejudice.
	   ``We don't know whether it was economic or to do with an event,
but it doesn't seem to be in any way related to what a Jewish
person does, it doesn't seem to be related to what is happening in
Israel or internationally,`` he said.
	   ``It seems to be much more a factor of the racist than any other
thing.''

 &UR; Poll outcome shows ethnic reconciliation in Taiwan &QL;

 &UR; By ANNIE HUANG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The triumph of a politician not born in
Taiwan shows one unwelcome cultural undercurrent is clearing up _
an ethnic divide between the native majority and Chinese who fled
mainland communism half a century ago.
	   ``The Taiwanese society and our voters have matured gradually,''
Ma Ying-jeou said after declaring victory in the Taipei mayoral
race shortly before midnight Saturday. ``There is no longer any
market for the ethnic issue. Any candidates trying to capitalize on
the issue could only incite backfires.''
	   Before voters had their say, doubts had lingered over whether
Ma, who was born to mainland immigrants but moved to Taiwan when he
was just 1, could defeat a popular, native-born mayor in the
capital.
	   Ma ran for the ruling Nationalist Party, and he carried some
huge personal strengths into the campaign, a clean image, magnetic
charm and good looks _ not to mention a successful background in
government.
	   But supporters of incumbent mayor Chen Shui-bian struck some low
blows, raising questions about Ma's loyalty to Taiwan by branding
him as a pawn in a conspiracy to sell out to China.
	   Ma's party favors eventual reunification, but near the end of
the campaign Ma said he personally would go into combat with
Chinese to defend Taiwan, if necessary.
	   And the ethnic attacks didn't sit well with many voters.
	   ``The election was never about China,'' said one Ma supporter,
Lee Ya-fen, who works for a construction engineering company.
``Chen only lost votes by raising the ethnic question.''
	   Ma, a former justice minister, captured 766,000 votes, or 51
percent. He enjoyed broad support among the majority native voters
as well as minority mainland-born voters.
	   Chen comes from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party that
favors a formal declaration of independence from China _ a tactic
viewed as too risky by Taiwanese who fear China might retaliate
with a military attack.
	   After Gen. Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists were ousted from
mainland China by Mao Tse-tung's Communist forces in 1949, Chiang
fled to Taiwan with about 2 million followers, mostly soldiers and
elite members of Chinese society.
	   The mainlanders dominated Taiwanese politics, while the native
born occupied themselves in farms or businesses. They stayed away
from the political sphere, to avoid suppression or even jail.
	   But during the last decade of democratic reforms carried out by
President Lee Teng-hui, the mainlanders have been largely replaced
by native Taiwanese within the government, and new tensions
emerged.
	   Several retired or ousted politicians have sought to establish
ties with mainland Chinese leaders and attacked Lee and his
followers on allegations they were covertly pushing for Taiwanese
independence.
	   During the campaign, Chen stayed away from demanding
independence as he instead took aim at Ma.
	   Newspapers said Chen's camp tried to spread the word among
voters that ``Taiwanese don't vote for Chinese.''
	   The nasty campaign drew antagonism, especially among supporters
of the tiny New Party who are mostly mainland immigrants or their
offspring. Most dumped their own longshot candidate to vote for Ma,
figuring that since they weren't going to win anyway, their best
strategy was to get rid of Chen.
	   Days before the poll, the president helped dissolve the
lingering doubts over Ma's loyalty by urging voters to accept the
mainlanders as ``New Taiwanese.''
	   Lee earlier had lamented about ``the sadness of Taiwanese'' who
first let Japanese and later mainlanders determine their fates.
Taiwan had been ruled by Japan for 50 years as a colony before it
was returned to China after World War II.
	   Lee then appealed for reconciliation ``to help us walk out of
the past shadows.''

Snooker makes its debut in style

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Snooker made its Asian Games debut in
style Sunday with elated officials greeting the opening with
muffled clapping, in keeping with the sport's strict etiquette.
	   A total of 19 countries will vie for 10 gold medals in snooker
and billiards. The preliminary elimination rounds began Sunday.
	   ``This is the brightest day for us,'' said Manmohanjit Singh,
the Singapore-born president of the International Billiards and
Snooker Federation, the sport's world governing body.
	   Players wearing vests, neckties and shining shoes took their
turns as Thai officials kept watch on about 100 spectators to
ensure that they did not infringe on etiquette.
	   ``This is indeed a high step and this will greatly help to make
the sport more popular in Asia, which is coming up fast,'' said
Singh, whose family migrated to Singapore from India several
decades ago.
	   With the addition of snooker, the Asian Games now have 36
sports.

China's gymnasts aim for Asian Games domination
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ When famed Japanese gymnast Mitsuo
Tsukahara watches his son take on the Chinese Monday in the battle
for Asian Games gold, he'll see twists, jumps and vaults that were
inconceivable in his heyday as an Olympic multi-gold medalist.
	   So good was the elder Tsukahara in the 1960s and 1970s that two
gymnastics moves, a vault and a high bar somersault, are named
after him. But two decades later, those once-daring maneuvers are
so standard that Tsukahara's son, Naoya, learned them in junior
high.
	   ``In the whole world, there was me, the only one,'' said the
trim-looking 50-year-old elder Tsukahara, recalling his dominance
of days gone by. Now his namesake moves are ``easy, easy,'' he
said.
	   Japan hopes the father has taught his son well. The younger
Tsukahara, a double bronze medalist at last year's World
Championships, is among Japan's leading contenders to break what
otherwise threatens to be a Chinese takeover of the Asian Games
gymnastics championship.
	   China won 13 of 14 gymnastics golds at the last Asian Games in
1994, its stranglehold broken only by South Korea in the men's
vault. This time, China has set its sights only a little lower:
it's going for more than 10 golds, said team manager Zhang Jian.
	   The competition kicks off Monday with the men's team event.
China, the favorite, is fielding a mixture of veterans and
newcomers that is essentially the same squad that is expected to
compete at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia, Zhang said in an
interview.
	   ``They are pretty much China's strongest athletes,'' he said.
``We have strength in basically all of the disciplines.''
	   Three members of the six-man team are veterans of China's 1997
victory at the World Championships. They include 21-year-old Zhang
Jinjing, who also won a World Championship team gold in 1995, and
the world title on parallel bars two years later.
	   China's women, meanwhile, include four members of the bronze
medal-winning team from last year's worlds. Zhang, the manager,
said only a ``big mistake'' could stop the Chinese men and women
from winning the Asian Games team titles.
	   But the competition for individual titles could be fiercer.
	   Tsukahara, 21, is Japan's reigning three-time national champion,
a title he first won at age 19 _ the youngest Japanese man ever to
do so. His two bronze medals at the 1997 World Championships came
in the all-around competition and parallel bars, which was won by
China's Zhang.
	   Despite the tough Chinese competition, the elder Tsukahara said
he fancies his son for gold in the all-around, the parallel bars
and the vault.
	   ``If he does his best performance and does what he does in
practice, he has a good chance,'' he said in an interview.
	   The elder Tsukahara won a total of five golds in Olympics in
1968, 1972 and 1976 and pioneered his two namesake moves. For the
Tsukahara vault, a gymnast cartwheels onto the vault, hitting it
sideways before springing off into a back flip. His high bar
maneuver is a full-twisting, double back somersault.
	   Tsukahara said he was 22 when he invented the vault and 24 when
he first did the high bar salto. His son learned both by age 15.
The moves are rated a ``C'' on a difficulty scale that now climbs
as high as ``Super E,'' according to several judges who will be
marking the gymnastics competition.

Relatives of plane crash victims express frustration over slow

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Nearly one year after a Singapore plane
mysteriously plunged from the Indonesian sky, relatives of the
victims on Sunday expressed frustration and anger over the lack of
progress in the investigation at a memorial service.
	   Silk Air flight MI185 crashed into the Sumatran jungle on Dec.
19, 1997, killing all 104 passengers and crew on board the Boeing
737-300 airplane.
	   Most of the victims were Singaporeans and Indonesians, though
Americans, Japanese, Malaysians, Germans, French, an Australian, a
Taiwanese and an Indian also perished.
	   The Indonesian authorities charged with investigating the
accident have made little headway, and have not even issued a
preliminary report yet.
	   ``The absolute quietness and inadequate transparency to the
investigation...does not seem to help anybody, be it the families,
the airline or the aircraft manufacturer,'' said Seet Choo Chua,
who lost his son Colin, during a speech on behalf of the victims'
families.
	   ``But I can assure you, it certainly continues to hurt the
feelings of the bereaved families,'' he added.
	   The victims' relatives ``urge all relevant parties, and in
particular the Indonesian authorities, to release more accurate
information on an ongoing basis,'' said Seet.
	   Speculation over the cause of the accident has focused on two
possible theories: a mechanical error with the plane's rudder, or a
pilot suicide.
	   Earlier this year, the Asian Wall Street Journal reported that
the debt-ridden captain had taken out a last-minute life insurance
policy, and that he had tampered with a cockpit tape recording of a
previous flight to hide an error.
	   The accident's chief investigator, Oetarjo Diran, gave little
new information to the victims' families when they last met in
August, though he told them that psychologists had joined the
inquiry to study the crew's background.
	   David Beevers, whose pregnant wife Suryani Rianto died in the
crash, told The Associated Press that Diran was due to meet some of
the victims' families again in Singapore shortly before the first
anniversary, which will be marked by a more elaborate ceremony near
Palembang, Indonesia.
	   ``I don't think its a cover-up, but I think there are things
they're not releasing,'' said Beevers, a Briton. During one of the
most poignant moments in the ceremony, he chocked with emotion on
the name of his dead wife while reading aloud the list of the
victims.
	   ``In short, please help us towards some type of closure,''
pleaded Seet in his address to about 300 people _ including Silk

Pakistan A team forfeits match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, New Zealand (AP) _ The Pakistan A cricket team
forfeited its match against New Zealand A on Sunday when it refused
to take the field after the pitch was damaged overnight by vandals.
	   Pakistan A refused to resume its second innings on the third
morning of the scheduled four-day match after the damage.
	   Pakistan was 15 without loss, trailing New Zealand A by 164
runs. Despite the efforts of match officials and New Zealand
Cricket chief executive Chris Doig, the Pakistan management was
adamant their team would not carry on with the match.
	   The umpires put the start of play back an hour while ground
officials repaired the one contentious area of the pitch.
	   The match was awarded to New Zealand A by forfeit, and continued
an ill-starred tour for the Pakistanis, who have had one
first-class game called off due to a dangerous pitch and another
washed out.
	   Doig spoke to Pakistan A's coach, former international Mohsin
Khan, several times Sunday.
	   ``They never said at any stage that they thought the pitch was
dangerous _ the word dangerous was never mentioned,'' Doig said.
	   ``They thought that on a length the damage that was done would
create an unfavorable mindset for the Pakistani batsmen, and they
were so shocked by the occurrence that they would not be able to
concentrate on their cricket, and as such they weren't prepared to
play the game.''
	   Doig said he believed the Pakistani team had made a ``kneejerk
reaction'' to the vandalism.

Police: Accused letter-bomber to face more charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The man accused of sending a letter
bomb that exploded at the Canberra postal sorting center will face
more charges when he appears in court on Tuesday, police said
Sunday.
	   Colin George Dunstan, 43, was arrested Friday after he was
admitted to Canberra Hospital with a slashed wrist.
	   A hospital spokesman said Dunstan remained in a stable condition
Sunday.
	   Dunstan was the subject of a nationwide search last week, with
police wanting to question him over a nationwide letter bomb
campaign.
	   During a brief bedside court hearing Saturday, he was remanded
in custody to appear in court on Tuesday.
	   Australian Federal Police Acting Sergeant Daryl Webb confirmed
Sunday that Dunstan will face more charges when he appeared in
court.
	   Police told Saturday's court hearing that a search of Dunstan's
home had revealed bomb related items and documentation relating to
people to whom other explosive devices were sent.
	   ``It is also believed that the defendant has been involved in
the construction and subsequent mailing of 27 further explosive
devices in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales,
Queensland and Victoria,'' police said.
	   Dunstan was formally charged Saturday with one count of damaging
property with an explosive device, with intent to endanger life.
	   The charge related to Wednesday's explosion at the postal
center, which slightly injured one worker. No plea was entered.
	   Police stressed Sunday that they believed they had found all the
devices and there remained no danger to the public.

Election results offer rebirth for Taiwan's Nationalists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos TPE101-103 &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party found
its hand considerably strengthened Sunday, a day after elections
which endorsed its moderate policies toward mainland China and
steady management of the economy.
	   Candidates were out early, parading with supporters who banged
drums and gongs in a traditional thanks to the voters, as Taiwan
awakened to what observers called a rebirth for the 104-year-old
party that has ruled Taiwan since its leaders fled China 49 years
ago.
	   The new clout means President Lee Teng-hui can deal with China
from a position of increased strength by ignoring critics who have
called for more aggressive moves towards reunification as well as
those who want formal independence, said Liaw Guang-sheng, a
political science professor at National Chengchi University.
	   ``This election confirmed the Nationalist leadership and
strengthens its bargaining position,'' Liaw said early Sunday at a
seminar where experts gave their perspectives on Saturday's
elections.
	   ``Rumors that the Nationalists are falling apart or crumbling
have proved to be false,'' Liaw said. But like many election
watchers, Liaw said he was surprised by the extent of the
Nationalists' wins.
	   Voters chose Nationalist challenger Ma Ying-jeou to replace the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party incumbent Chen Shui-bian as
mayor of the capital city of Taipei.
	   Ma's victory reversed opposition gains from local elections last
year and seemed to validate the party's efforts to shake its
lingering reputation for corruption and inefficiency.
	   The Nationalists also held onto the national legislature, taking
123 of 225 seats, compared to just 70 won by the DPP.
	   The tiny New Party, a Nationalist offshoot that supports greater
efforts toward integration with China, got 11 seats. Smaller
parties and independents ended up with the remaining 21 seats.
	   The DPP consoled itself with an upset win in the major race for
the mayorship of Kaohsiung, a major city in southern Taiwan.
	   Scholars said the vote reflects a new consensus that while the
island's sovereignty can't be compromised, relations with China
must be stable and peaceful.
	   Extremes of opinion on relations toward China, which claims
Taiwan as a breakaway province, have alienated voters.
	   China and Taiwan separated after a civil war in 1949, but
Beijing still says it would meet any formal declaration of
Taiwanese independence with military force.
	   Though negotiations on reconciliation remain stalled, the sides
have taken gradual steps over the past year to renew talks that
China broke off in 1995 in anger over Taiwan's efforts to assert
itself internationally.
	   The Nationalist's performance should assure Beijing that their
familiar rivals have consolidated their power, reducing the
likelihood of having to deal directly with the DPP anytime soon,
said Ming Chu-cheng, a professor at National Taiwan University.
	   ``The leaders in Beijing could go to bed without taking an
aspirin Saturday, knowing their old friends will still be around,''
Ming said.
	   Voters also gave the Nationalists credit for keeping the economy
growing at a time when many neighboring economies are suffering
recessions brought on by the Asian economic crisis, observers said.
	   Nationalist control of the Legislature should ensure smooth
passage of measures to stimulate further growth, they said.
	   ``It's the politics of accountability,'' said Jou Sheu,
professor of diplomacy at National Chengchi University in Taipei.
``Most voters abandoned high politics for more immediate issues
like the economy.''
	   Still, Jou added: ``Moderation won the day.''

	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ An unbroken sixth-wicket partnership
by Victoria state prevented England from taking complete control of
the four-day cricket match Sunday at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
	   At stumps on the second day, Victoria was 177-5 in reply to
England's first innings of 373. The home side crashed to 87-5
before an unbroken 90- run stand between Shawn Craig and Peter
Roach frustrated the tourists.
	   Roach went to stumps unbeaten on 54 and Craig was not out 39.
	   Paceman Dean Headley claimed two victims, a catch and a runout,
while Ben Hollioake and off spinner Robert Croft each took one
wicket.
	   Earlier, England lost its last five wickets for 17 runs after
resuming Sunday at 308-5. (djp)

	   BASILAN, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine government troops have
arrested a Muslim rebel leader suspected of carrying out
kidnappings in the southern Philippines, including the abduction of
a recently freed Italian priest, officials said Sunday.
	   Soldiers and policemen arrested Angoling Sali, who heads a
breakaway group of the Moro National Liberation Front, during a
raid on his house in a rural area near Lantawan town in Basilan
province on Saturday, officials said.
	   Sali allegedly masterminded at least six recent kidnappings in
southern Mindanao region, including that of Italian missionary Rev.
Luciano Benedetti and relatives of a Taiwanese hotel chain owner,
said police spokesman Jerry Bayabos.
	   Benedetti was kidnapped Sept. 8 near his parish in the southern
Zamboanga peninsula and freed unharmed 68 days later. The day after
Benedetti's abduction, kidnappers snatched the mother of a
Taiwanese businessman, his wife, a daughter and a maid in nearby
Zamboanga City.
	   The wife and daughter have been freed, but the mother and the
maid remain with their captors.
	   Police suspect Sali played a role in both abductions. The rebel
leader also has several other criminal cases pending in a local
court, Bayabos said.
	   The MNLF was once the largest Muslim group fighting the central
Philippine government in Mindanao, the traditional homeland of
Muslim Filipinos. It signed a peace accord with the government in
September 1996, ending a quarter century of insurrection that
killed more than 120,000 people.
	   After that, many MNLF fighters returned to normal life. But
others joined Muslim separatist groups still at war with the
federal government in Manila of turned to banditry to survive.

Milosevic's new target at home: best and brightest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ William Faulkner went first. Then
Thomas Pynchon and Edgar Allan Poe.
	   More volumes of American plays went into boxes as the professor
who taught them at Belgrade University had to pack and leave. He
was sacked in the ongoing government purge of unruly
intelligentsia.
	   With a heavy heart but ``without regret,'' Srdjan Vujica emptied
his office, as did more than two dozen other university teachers
fired or forced into early retirement in the past weeks by the
regime of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The purge that appears to have pushed Serbia yet another notch
deeper into totalitarianism began with a new university law,
enacted last summer while the world focused on ethnic warfare in
the Serbian Kosovo province.
	   Under the new law, the government vastly expanded its authority
over state-run universities in the country and appointed new deans
-- strict Milosevic loyalists.
	   The new appointees, in turn, demanded the teaching staff sign
new contracts confirming they accept new state-imposed terms.
	   ``It was a loyalty oath,'' Vujica says. ``I just couldn't do
that. The new law is intended as punishment, a way to purge
teachers who supported earlier protests'' against Milosevic.
	   Reaction so far has been a massive strike by some 20,000
students from Literature, Electronics and Law departments in the
Belgrade University, against what they see as a general crackdown
on the educated who form the core of opposition to Milosevic.
	   The pillar of Milosevic's 10-year rule have always been less
educated people, who form a vast majority in Yugoslavia, where
about a third of 10 million people are functionally illiterate.
	   ``The West has forced Milosevic to stop his forces against
(ethnic) Albanians in Kosovo, but we here can count only on
ourselves when we want to defy his autocracy. That's what we are
doing,'' said 23-year old law student, Katarina Jakovljevic.
	   The atmosphere at the university is similar to late 1996 when
students spearheaded months-long anti-Milosevic protests that
nearly toppled the government. Boycotting classes now, the students
gather to listen to fiery speeches by protest leaders. They are
getting increasing support from remaining professors who appear
suddenly emboldened by the students' resolve not to give in.
	   ``The regime wants to introduce full dictatorship,'' a student
leader, Boris Karajicic said. ``They are replacing eminent
professors with some mediocre, pro-government teachers. It's the
limitless desire for power that brings such laws.''
	   The protest may snowball into a much bigger and wider one, said
Karajicic, as the authorities show no sign of giving up the
crackdown.
	   The government has also brought a restrictive media law that
effectively shut down several independent papers and led to heavy
fines for several others whose articles were deemed anti-state
activity.
	   One of the papers was punished for running an ad by a student
group called Otpor (Resistance), urging all to a general resistance
to the government. An Otpor member was later jailed for 10 days for
spraying the group's symbol, a clenched fist, on a building in
downtown Belgrade.
	   ``What they did to free media means suppressing freedom. It's
the same with the university,'' English language major, Uros
Vasiljevic, said. ``Resisting that means dealing with the main
problem of this country, the nature of this regime.''
	   ``The intentions behind the new laws are purely political. Their
consequences can be devastating for science, for education for
everything,'' Vujica said, who like other sacked teachers is banned
from even entering university premises.
	   But, the crackdown could backlash, he said.
	   ``When only those without integrity and knowledge remain working
in state institutions, the whole system will collapse,'' he said.

Jail sentences, fines for lavish weddings in Emirates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Those planning a lavish
wedding in the Emirates now have to consider more than a guest list
and a venue _ the possibility of a jail term.
	   A new law imposes a prison sentence or a 500,000 dirham (dlrs
137,000) fine on couples that opt for expensive weddings, the Gulf
News reported Sunday.
	   The aim of the law, imposed by Emirates President Sheik Zayed
bin Sultan al-Nahyan, is to make it possible for more young people
to marry by making weddings affordable, the paper said.
	   ``First, there is a lot of waste. Secondly, Sheik Zayed does not
want to see young men over the age of 18 unmarried because of a
lack of finances,'' the paper quoted Sheik Mohammed bin Rakad
al-Amiri, an official with the Emirates' Marriage Fund, as saying.
	   The state-run Marriage Fund was established in 1992 to help
cover wedding expenses by donating 70,000 dirhams (dlrs 19,000) to
each couple that marries.
	   Al-Amiri said the length of the prison sentence had not been set
and he did not give a figure for what would he considered excessive
wedding costs.
	   But he said a groom should pay no more than a 50,000 dirham
(dlrs 13,700) dowry and slaughter no more than 21 camels on his
wedding night, the paper reported. A dowry is the money a groom
must pay to a bride's family for permission to marry her.
	   The legislation aims at encouraging citizens to forgo exorbitant
weddings and lavish parties that sometime last for days.
	   Dowries and other wedding expenses, including the cost of a
dress and jewelry, can add up to more than dlrs 70,000. The groom's
family is expected to share in the expenses.
	   High dowry and wedding costs have forced many men in the
Emirates to seek foreign brides.
	   Expatriate workers make up about three-quarters of the 2.4
million people in this oil-rich Gulf country. Officials worry that
the native population will dwindle further if men continue to marry
foreigners.

Vajpayee asserts his authority on government hard-liners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Bruised in provincial elections, Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has moved to reassert his authority
over his government with the appointment of three key aides to his
Cabinet.
	   India's Sunday newspapers interpreted the expansion of his
cabinet on Saturday as a slap at the hard-liners in the ruling
Bharatiya Janata Party and a snub of the partners in the fractious
19-party coalition.
	   Without consulting his allies, Vajpayee appointed Jaswant Singh,
his chief negotiator on nuclear issues, to be his foreign minister;
Pramod Mahajan, a close adviser, as his information minister; and
Jagmohan, a former governor of Kashmir, as his communications
minister. Jagmohan uses only one name.
	   It was the first reorganization of his cabinet team since
Vajpayee took office eight months ago. Earlier plans to bring new
ministers into the government were thwarted by competition and
backbiting in his party and among his coalition partners.
	   The three newcomers are considered moderates in the BJP, which
is generally seen as having a Hindu nationalist social policy and a
protectionist economic policy.
	   After the BJP's humiliating defeat in legislative elections last
month in three key states, Vajpayee apparently believed the
hard-liners were hurting his government's popularity, and sought
``to show them who's boss,'' said the Calcutta-based Statesman
newspaper.
	   A public opinion survey published Sunday by The Times of India
said 52 percent of those questioned were dissatisfied with the
performance of the government, while 40 percent approved of its
actions. Eight percent had no opinion.
	   But while his government was losing popularity, Vajpayee
personally remained the first choice for prime minister, outpolling
opposition leader Sonia Gandhi of the Congress Party by 46 to 36
percent, said the poll of 2,072 urban adults conducted by
Development and Research Services. No margin of error was given.
	   If elections were held today, the survey showed a sharp swing
away from the BJP. It said Congress was preferred by 35 percent and
the BJP by 32 percent. In the last election earlier this year, 40
percent of the respondents said they voted for the BJP and 26
percent voted for Congress.

Thai prime minister leads off torch run to open Asian Games

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Waiting for the most auspicious hour
before taking his first step, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai led off
the relay of runners Sunday carrying the torch that will light the
flame signaling the opening of the 13th Asian Games.
	   Chuan hit the road at 9:09 a.m. local time (0209 GMT),
reflecting popular belief that nine is a lucky number. King
Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-reigning monarch, is the
ninth king of the current dynasty. He will pronounce the games open
at Sunday's lavish ceremonies.
	   The two-week Olympic-style competition, bringing together 6,000
athletes from 41 countries, should give Thais a welcome respite
from the anxieties of the economic crisis that has engulfed the
region and temporarily jeopardized cash-strapped Bangkok's right to
host the event.
	   For the competing nations _ many sending reduced teams to ease
the pinch of the Asian crisis _ the games are a proving ground for
the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
	   ``It's not just getting a gold, it's getting a gold with a
result that is close or at world standards,'' said Li Furong,
deputy head of China's Asian Games delegation. ``The main target is
the 2000 Olympics.''
	   Sunday's focus was more on pageantry, beginning with the
slightly built Thai prime minister setting off from the Sanam
Luang, or royal fields, where the flame had been displayed since
King Bhumibol lit it Thursday.
	   Chuan jogged 300 meters and passed the torch to Sheik Ahmad
al-Fahad al-Sabah of Kuwait, president of the Olympic Council of
Asia. It was then to be borne by 214 prominent Thais past historic
sites like the royal palace and Temple of the Emerald Buddha, the
country's most sacred shrine, along with tourist traps.
	   Boxer Somluck Khamsing, who won Thailand's first Olympic gold
medal in Atlanta two years ago, was to carry the torch the final
300 meters (yards) at 19:09 local time (1209 GMT) and touch it to a
cauldron. Somluck will be seeking another gold to match the one he
won at the Asian Games four years ago in Hiroshima, Japan.
	   The three-hour ceremonies will feature 7,614 performers in
lavishly produced acts with the theme ``Friendship Beyond
Frontiers.'' Songs written by the king, a talented jazz composer,
will be played by the Bangkok Symphony Orchestra.
	   Performers in ancient Thai garb will parade across the field,
followed by people-drawn chariots. Hundreds of primary school
students dressed in colorful outfits will celebrate the unity of
Asia and Chai-yo, the cartoon elephant mascot of the games.
	   Then comes the entry procession by the athletes _ the real stars
of what organizers are billing as the last major sporting event of
the 20th century.
	   The artistic high point will be a show based on the Indian
Ramayana epic, the basis for much of traditional Thai mythology,
literature and performing and fine arts. The field will become a
swirl of giant snakes, swans, birds, angels, and other mystical
creatures.
	   Another performance celebrating the unity of Asia caps the show,
with four large swan floats pulled to the middle of the field, to
each tethered a giant balloon symbolizing the sun, moon, earth and
a giant lotus.
	   The combined budget for the opening and closing ceremonies is 70
million baht (dlrs 1.94 million), including a large share of
donated and at-cost labor.
	   The ceremonies have had their share of controversy. Bhichai
Rattakul, a deputy prime minister and chairman of the Bangkok Asian
Games Organizing Committee, came under fire from Thailand's
political opposition for setting aside 1,000 prime seats worth
5,000 baht (dlrs 138) each for members of Parliament and their
aides.
	   Opposition leaders tried to strike a populist chord with
recession-stricken Thais by threatening not to take the tickets _
until Bhichai pointed out that most of rank-and-file opposition
legislators had already picked up their tickets.

 &UR; Chalmers tames Royal Adelaide to win Australian Open &QL;

 &UR; By DENNIS PASSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Australian lefthander Greg Chalmers
survived two late bogeys and a determined but fruitless run by his
two closest chasers to win the Australian Open golf tournament
Sunday.
	   Chalmers, who played on this year's European circuit and who
recently secured his 1999 card for the U.S. PGA tour, bogeyed the
15th and 18th holes after he led by four shots with four holes to
play.
	   Playing partner Peter Senior, the 1991 champion, birdied the
16th and 17th holes to pull within a stroke of Chalmers, then
missed a birdie putt on 18 that would have forced a playoff after
Chalmers bogeyed.
	   But the waiting wasn't over for Chalmers, who watched countryman
Stuart Appleby, in the final group of the day, leave his 15-foot
birdie putt inches from the hole that would have left the two
level.
	   ``When you have a player the caliber of Stewie coming up behind
you, there are nine chances in 10 that he is going to hole that
putt,'' said a relieved Chalmers.
	   He said the experience of gaining his U.S. card through six
tough rounds of qualifying three weeks ago gave him the mental
toughness to survive the final round Sunday.
	   ``The last round of the tour school, I went out and shot
2-under,'' said Chalmers. ``I was so nervous there that I was out
of control. But I said to myself that if I can shoot 2-under when
you are shaking that much, you can do it again.''
	   Chalmers, 25, finished on even-par 288 after a 70 over the tough
par-72 and wind-blown Royal Adelaide course that had taken its
share of victims over the previous three days.
	   Senior, with a closing 70, and Appleby, 72, finished a stroke
back on 289, with Australian Robert Allenby and England's Nick
Faldo a stroke further back at 291. Faldo shot a 73 Sunday and
Allenby 71.
	   Chalmers won 115,200 US dlrs. It was the first victory by a
lefthander in the Australian Open since Claud Felstead, an amateur,
won at Royal Melbourne in 1909.
	   ``Ever since I was 13 years old, I've watched this event, and
you see the guys who win it,'' said Chalmers. ``Sometimes I
wondered if my name would get up there. I'm just thrilled.''
	   After three days of gusty conditions, the breeze at Royal
Adelaide finally abated Sunday, allowing for 12 sub-par rounds, the
most of the tournament.
	   Appleby, the sentimental favorite, was playing in Australia for
the first time since the death of his wife, Renay, in a car
accident in London in July.
	   ``I suppose I feel as good as I can without winning,'' said
Appleby. ``At 18, I hit a good putt, but it didn't break. That's
the way it goes sometime _ you misread them.''
	   In his trophy acceptance speech, Chalmers, with tears in his
eyes, said he felt like a ``villain'' for beating Appleby on a day
when the galleries were solidly behind his Australian foe.
	   ``The whole country is behind, you, Stewie,'' said Chalmers.
	   But Appleby said Chalmers deserved the win.
	   ``I would try to beat him, too,'' said Appleby. ``That's our
job.''
	   It was a mixed day for the Presidents Cup players in the field
who will begin play next Friday at Royal Melbourne. The Americans
have won both previous events.
	   United States team player Fred Couples shot a 69 Sunday to
finish at 296, 8 over par. Teammate John Huston shot 74 Sunday,
seven better than his Saturday round.
	   On the International side, Greg Norman, who barely made the
two-round cut after an 82 Friday, shot 77 to finish at 299. Frank
Nobilo of New Zealand had a 73 and Carlos Franco of Paraguay and
Craig Parry of Australia 71 each. (djp)

Philippines comes prepared to end China's run
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada has pledged 2
million pesos (dlrs 51,200) for gold at the Asian Games but one
medal would be priceless to sports fans in the Philippines.
	   The nation has sent a well-prepared and fully professional men's
basketball lineup to the games in a bid to end China's winning run
of three titles and protect its own record of four Asian Games
golds.
	   After the Philippines dominated the early years of the games,
the launch of a pro league took precedence. But this year,
authorities have been prepared to starve their own national league
of the top players and spend big, sending the Asian team touring
through the United States in recent weeks.
	   Estrada made the cash promise last week as he sent off a team of
257 athletes. The country won just three golds at Hiroshima in
1994, all in boxing, while China won 135.
	   ``I have no doubt that you will perform well,'' Estrada told the
team. ``I have always believed in the skill and the fighting spirit
of the Filipinos, especially our athletes.''
	   The team's fighting spirit could not be contained on the 22-day
U.S. tour, when its match against the University of Minnesota
erupted into a bench-clearing brawl in the opening minutes. The
98-55 loss also showed up some serious flaws and coach Tim Cone, an
American based in the Philippines, admits, ``We've got to
overachieve to beat China.''
	   The Philippines was Asia's best team before the country started
its pro league in 1975. The leading players moved into the league
and were no longer picked on the amateur squads for following
championships.
	   The 1992 Olympics opened the way for a return by pro players and
the country met with moderate success by winning the Asian Games
bronze in a playoff against Japan in Hiroshima four years ago.
	   The Philippines Basketball Association is paying for this
attempt to regain past glories, suffering in the process as crowds
stay away from a league missing its star players.
	   China is expecting its golden run to continue but admits to
being wary about the Philippines' approach.
	   ``The Philippines have very good outside players,'' captain Gong
Xiaobin said Sunday. ``But their big men still lack the skills and
strength to play against us.''
	   Gong led the team to a 78-70 victory over the Philippines in
their previous meeting.
	   Coach Wang Fei has an impressive lineup with 2.12-meter (7-foot)
center Wang Zhizhi and Asian all-stars Hu Weidong and Gong and is
confident of the gold medal.

Plushenko wins men's title at NHK Trophy figure skating

<TEXT>
	   SAPPORO, Japan (AP) _ Evgeny Plushenko, a 16-year-old Russian,
won the men's singles event Sunday at the NHK Trophy figure skating
meet, his second career Grand Prix victory.
	   Plushenko, the gold medalist in the Skate Canada four weeks ago,
landed a clean quadruple-triple jump combination in the free
program. So did Li Chengjiang of China, who won the bronze medal.
	   Japan's Takeshi Honda landed a quadruple toe loop, but in a
single jump. Still, he won the silver as Li wobbled on a couple of
jumps, at one point reducing an intended triple axel-double
combination to a single axel and a double toe loop sequence.
	   So far, only three skaters have done quadruple-triple
combinations at international competitions. They include three-time
world champion Elvis Stojko of Canada, who did it at the 1997 Grand
Prix Final.
	   Plushenko, the bronze medalist in the world championships, first
did the quad-triple jump in the Sun Life Skate Canada International
on Nov. 8 as he finished ahead of Stojko, who won the silver.
	   On Sunday, Plushenko started with a quad toe loop and a triple
toe loop combination, followed by a triple axel and a triple toe
loop sequence and five more triple jumps, all in perfect execution
and style.
	   The crowd clapped along with the beat of the music midway
through the 4 1-2 minutes of performance.
	   Judges gave him eight 5.9s and a 5.8 of a possible 6.0 for
content and techniques, and a 6.0, six 5.9s and two 5.8s for
presentation.
	   ``It was the first 6.0 I've ever received, and I know how
precious a 6.0 mark is,'' said a jubilant Plushenko. ``A perfect
6.0 mark is an ultimate goal for all the competitors. Yet, you
know, only a few have had the honor.''
	   Honda landed a quadruple and six perfect triples, while Li did a
quadruple toe loop and triple toe loop combination and three clean
triples.
	   ``I'm glad I did it again,'' said the 17-year-old Honda,
referring to the first perfect quadruple he did in a single jump in
the preliminary for the world championships in March. He qualified
and placed 11th in the meet.
	   Li, 19, reigning national champion of China, said he regrets
having made a few errors during his jumps. ``In practice, I've done
it clean and perfect,'' he said. ``Of course, I'll try harder and
practice harder not to make easy mistakes.''
	   In the compulsory program Friday, Li was second to Plushenko,
and Honda was in third place.
	   On Saturday, Tatyana Malinina of Uzbekistan won the women's
singles title, her first victory in international competition.
	   World champions Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze of
Russia won the pairs title, and Marina Anissina and Gwendal
Peizerat of France _ second in the world championships _ won in ice
dancing.
	   The NHK Trophy is the sixth and last event in the International
Skating Union's Grand Prix series. Under a points-scoring system,
the series lead to the Grand Prix Final in Russia in March, two
weeks before the world championships in Finland.

Foreign workers protest wage cuts, abuse in Hong Kong

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Fearing more layoffs and pay cuts amid a
deepening recession, about 400 foreign workers in Hong Kong, most
of them Filipino maids, staged a protest on Sunday.
	   The demonstrators attacked a recent proposal from a city council
member who wants to cut the government-set minimum wage of U.S.
dlrs 494 per month by 20 percent. They called the idea racist,
sexist and a violation of workers' rights.
	   ``Migrant women workers like the domestic helpers, being treated
already as second-class citizens, are even more vulnerable,''
Dolores Balladares, vice-president of the United Filipinos, told a
gathering to mark International Human Rights Day.
	   She was surrounded by thousands of workers spending their
one-day weekend like they usually do: Chatting, eating, singing and
dancing in a nearby downtown park.
	   This time, activists had also placed banners across the road
that said: ``No to wage cuts. Protect workers' rights.''
	   Balladares said the proposed pay cuts assume ``foreign workers
do not have the same rights and privileges as local workers simply
because they are different.''
	   As Hong Kong slips further into recession and as more local
workers lose their jobs or see their pay cut, the government is
facing increasing pressure to reduce the number of foreign workers
allowed to work here, and to lower their wages.
	   A job in Hong Kong has become more valuable as inflation and
unemployment soar in other Asian countries.
	   The Hong Kong dollar is the only convertible Asian currency not
to have devalued since last year because it is linked to the U.S.
dollar _ making earnings here worth many times more when workers
send wages back home to their families.
	   The minimum wage for maids is meager by Hong Kong standards.
	   But it was double the pay of a skilled factory worker in the
Philippines and higher than that of a senior government official in
Indonesia, even before the value of Asian currencies plummeted in
the regional financial crisis.
	   Hong Kong is home to about 170,000 imported domestic workers,
more than 80 percent of them Filipinos. Others are from Thailand,
Indonesia, Nepal and Sri Lanka.
	   Rosalyn Magbanua, 37, of Iloilo, the Philippines, who has been
working in Hong Kong for seven months, said she and her farmer
husband would not be able to afford tuition for her five children,
aged 7 to 16, if her wages are cut.
	   She also has to repay a loan of 47,000 pesos (U.S. dlrs 1,200)
for agency and government fees she needed to get a job in Hong
Kong.
	   ``My children are small, and my husband's only a farmer. They
need the money,'' she said.
	   Tarcisius Fernando, coordinator of the Association of Sri
Lankans in Hong Kong, said some employers have already cut wages
illegally. But foreign workers are reluctant to report them because
they fear they would be fired.
	   ``The situation at home is getting worse. Losing their job here
would affect the survival of their families,'' he said.
	   Unemployment in Hong Kong is at a record 5.3 percent and
expected to grow early next year as companies restructure their
operations ahead of the Chinese New Year in February.
	   Many companies, including the territory's largest bank, HSBC,
have either frozen or cut wages.

Reports: Eight killed by shopping mall fire in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING, China (AP) _ Fire erupted in a shopping mall in
northwestern China, killing at least eight people and injuring 23
others, state media reported Sunday.
	   The fire broke out Friday evening on the third floor of the
six-story People's Shopping Mall in the city of Baoji in Shaanxi
province, the newspaper Guangming Daily and the Xinhua News Agency
said.
	   Six of the dead suffocated and two were killed when they fell
trying to escape, the reports said.
	   It took more than 400 firefighters and 31 fire engines some
three hours to extinguish the flames.
	   The cause of the fire is under investigation, the reports said.

Chalmers leads Australian young guns into U.S. competition

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Newly crowned Australian Open
champion Greg Chalmers will begin his U.S. PGA tour campaign next
year with the blessings of one of Australia's elder golf statesmen
and one of its already rising stars.
	   Australasian and European tour veteran Peter Senior said the
25-year-old lefthander was one of a new guard of Australian
players. PGA tour player Stuart Appleby predicted Australia could
have up to a dozen players earning big money on the U.S. circuit
within 15 years.
	   Chalmers held off dual runners-up Senior and Appleby to win the
Open at Royal Adelaide by one stroke with a 2-under-par 70 at Royal
Adelaide Sunday.
	   Chalmers recently secured his U.S. PGA tour card for 1999. He
finished 25th on the European money list _ where he also had two
second-place finishes.
	   Florida-based Appleby, who for the first time will play in the
President's Cup tournament as a member of the international team in
Melbourne next week, said Chalmers' future was unlimited.
	   ``This is just the start of things to come for him and for
Australian golf, especially those players playing overseas and
especially in the U.S.,'' said Appleby, 27.
	   ``I suppose I was the start of the young guys and I'll be the
old guy soon.
	   ``There will be half a dozen to a dozen guys playing the U.S.
tour in the
	   next 15 years from Australia, and all starting in their 20s,''
he said.
	   Former Australian Open winner and 1990 European Open champion
Senior said
	   he had ``no doubt'' Chalmers would make a mark in international
golf.
	   ``The better guys are getting younger,'' Senior said, conceding
to being one of the old guard. ``Hopefully we can stick around for
a few more years, make a few more dollars then get out before they
start winning everything.''
	   Asked if it felt good to be going to the United States as the
Australian Open champion, Chalmers said: ``It's great to go
anywhere as the Australian Open champion.
	   ``(The (U.S.) is going to be fantastic. I can't wait.''

New, pro-Khatami party founded in Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A new, reformist political party was set up
in Iran by a group of senior government officials, the Iran Daily
reported Sunday.
	   The newspaper said the Participation Front of Islamic Iran was
launched Saturday by 100 supporters of President Mohammad Khatami.
	   The party's founders include a number of ministers and other
officials, such as Masoumeh Ebtekar, vice president for
environmental affairs and the highest ranking woman in Khatami's
Cabinet, and Zahra Shojei, the presidential adviser on women's
affairs.
	   The party aims ``to overcome the long-standing economic and
social obstacles and upheavals, and to bring about an encouraging
area for the blossoming of culture and science,'' the paper quoted
the party statement as saying.
	   The statement also called for the respect of ``critical
thoughts,'' a reference to a recent crackdown by government
hard-liners on newspapers and opposition figures critical of the
government.
	   In their statement, the group praised Khatami's election in 1997
as a manifestation of the spirit of the Iran's Islamic revolution
of 1979.
	   Khatami's election ``increased the clarity of the ideals of the
revolution'' and ``accelerated the movement of the people towards a
just and virtuous society,'' the paper quoted the statement as
saying.
	   Powerful government hard-liners have been locked in a power
struggle with Khatami over his liberal reforms. They have jailed a
number of journalists and closed down several outspoken newspapers.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Fearing more layoffs and pay cuts amid a
deepening recession, about 400 foreign workers in Hong Kong, most
of them Filipino maids, staged a protest on Sunday.
	   The demonstrators attacked a recent proposal from a city council
member who wants to cut the government-set minimum wage for foreign
workers of U.S. dlrs 494 per month by 20 percent. They called the
idea racist, sexist and a violation of workers' rights.
	   ``Migrant women workers like the domestic helpers, being treated
already as second-class citizens, are even more vulnerable,''
Dolores Balladares, vice-president of the United Filipinos, told a
gathering to mark International Human Rights Day.
	   She was surrounded by thousands of workers spending their
one-day weekend like they usually do: Chatting, eating, singing and
dancing in a nearby downtown park.
	   This time, activists had also placed banners across the road
that said: ``No to wage cuts. Protect workers' rights.''
	   Balladares said the proposed pay cuts assume ``foreign workers
do not have the same rights and privileges as local workers simply
because they are different.''
	   As Hong Kong slips further into recession and as more local
workers lose their jobs or see their pay cut, the government is
facing increasing pressure to reduce the number of foreign workers
allowed to work here, and to lower their wages.
	   A job in Hong Kong has become more valuable as inflation and
unemployment soar in other Asian countries.
	   The Hong Kong dollar is the only convertible Asian currency not
to have devalued since last year because it is linked to the U.S.
dollar _ making earnings here worth many times more when workers
send wages back home to their families.
	   The minimum wage for maids is meager by Hong Kong standards.
	   But it was double the pay of a skilled factory worker in the
Philippines and higher than that of a senior government official in
Indonesia, even before the value of Asian currencies plummeted in
the regional financial crisis.
	   Hong Kong is home to about 170,000 imported domestic workers,
more than 80 percent of them Filipinos. Others are from Thailand,
Indonesia, Nepal and Sri Lanka.
	   Rosalyn Magbanua, 37, of Iloilo, the Philippines, who has been
working in Hong Kong for seven months, said she and her farmer
husband would not be able to afford tuition for her five children,
aged 7 to 16, if her wages are cut.
	   She also has to repay a loan of 47,000 pesos (U.S. dlrs 1,200)
for agency and government fees she needed to get a job in Hong
Kong.
	   ``My children are small, and my husband's only a farmer. They
need the money,'' she said.
	   Tarcisius Fernando, coordinator of the Association of Sri
Lankans in Hong Kong, said some employers have already cut wages
illegally. But foreign workers are reluctant to report them because
they fear they would be fired.
	   ``The situation at home is getting worse. Losing their job here
would affect the survival of their families,'' he said.
	   Unemployment in Hong Kong is at a record 5.3 percent and
expected to grow early next year as companies restructure their
operations ahead of the Chinese New Year in February.
	   Many companies, including the territory's largest bank, HSBC,
have either frozen or cut wages.

Russia's second city holds legislative elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Polls open 0500 gmt and close at 1900 gmt. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ More than 500 candidates Sunday
vied for 50 Legislative Assembly seats in an election preceded by
contract killings, beatings of candidates and and dirty tricks by
campaigners.
	   A total of 577 names were on the ballot and observers predicted
that none of the candidates would get the 51 percent of the vote
needed to win a seat in the assembly, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said. A second round of balloting was likely to be held Dec. 20, it
said.
	   In early morning voting, few residents were seen casting
ballots.
	   St. Petersburg, Russia's second largest city, was at the
forefront of this country's democracy movement a decade ago, but as
it headed into the elections, its politics appeared as dirty and
deadly as anywhere in Russia.
	   There have been several attacks on prominent figures, including
politicians and businessmen.
	   Last year, the city's deputy governor was gunned down on a
central St. Petersburg street. In the past two months, hitmen have
claimed the lives of a legislative aide, a high-ranking city
official and a prominent banker.
	   Last month's killing of Galina Starovoitova, the country's most
prominent female politician, drew international condemnation and
focused attention on St. Petersburg's crime problems.
	   Boris Nemtsov, the former first deputy premier, recently visited
the city and called it ``the crime capital of Russia.''
	   Unlike many cities in Russia, where the city legislature has
little power, the assembly could be quite influential. A new city
charter calls for the legislature to be a full-time body with
extensive powers.
	   Alexander Yakovlev, the city's mayor, strongly opposed the new
charter, which curtails his clout. He is not on the ballot, but
critics say he has contributed to the mean-spirited atmosphere
surrounding the election.
	   Opponents of Yakovlev have found that people with the same name
were mysteriously proposed as candidates. This has been done in an
attempt to confuse voters and take away votes from liberals.
	   In addition, anti-Semitic leaflets have been handed out asking
citizens not to vote for Jewish candidates, and one candidate's
posters were defaced with slurs against Jews.
	   There have also been multiple reports of attempts to bribe
voters.
	   St. Petersburg's 3.7 million voters seem fed up with the city's
crime and corruption, and its poor economic performance, and
election officials predicted that only 35 percent of the electorate
would turn out for Sunday's polling, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Some 5,000 police were deployed to ensure law and order during
the balloting, the news agency said. Before polls opened, police
examined 1,500 polling stations, looking for explosives or other
items that could disrupt voting, it said.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Nearly one year after a Singapore plane
mysteriously plunged from the Indonesian sky, relatives of the
victims on Sunday expressed frustration and anger over the lack of
progress in the investigation at a memorial service.
	   Silk Air flight MI185 crashed into the Sumatran jungle on Dec.
19, 1997, killing all 104 passengers and crew on board the Boeing
737-300 airplane.
	   Most of the victims were Singaporeans and Indonesians, though
Americans, Japanese, Malaysians, New Zealanders, Germans, French,
an Australian, a Taiwanese and an Indian also perished.
	   The Indonesian authorities charged with investigating the
accident have made little headway, and have not even issued a
preliminary report yet.
	   ``The absolute quietness and inadequate transparency to the
investigation...does not seem to help anybody, be it the families,
the airline or the aircraft manufacturer,'' said Seet Choo Chua,
who lost his son Colin, during a speech on behalf of the victims'
families.
	   ``But I can assure you, it certainly continues to hurt the
feelings of the bereaved families,'' he added.
	   The victims' relatives ``urge all relevant parties, and in
particular the Indonesian authorities, to release more accurate
information on an ongoing basis,'' said Seet.
	   Speculation over the cause of the accident has focused on two
possible theories: a mechanical error with the plane's rudder, or a
pilot suicide.
	   Earlier this year, the Asian Wall Street Journal reported that
the debt-ridden captain had taken out a last-minute life insurance
policy, and that he had tampered with a cockpit tape recording of a
previous flight to hide an error.
	   The accident's chief investigator, Oetarjo Diran, gave little
new information to the victims' families when they last met in
August, though he told them that psychologists had joined the
inquiry to study the crew's background.
	   David Beevers, whose pregnant wife Suryani Rianto died in the
crash, told The Associated Press that Diran was due to meet some of
the victims' families again in Singapore shortly before the first
anniversary, which will be marked by a more elaborate ceremony near
Palembang, Indonesia.
	   ``I don't think it's a cover-up, but I think there are things
they're not releasing,'' said Beevers, a Briton. During one of the
most poignant moments in the ceremony, he choked with emotion on
the name of his dead wife while reading aloud the list of the
victims.
	   ``In short, please help us towards some type of closure,''
pleaded Seet in his address to about 300 people _ including Silk
Air officials _ attending the ceremony.
	   Children and adults placed wreaths, flower petals and some
victim's personal belongings against the simple memorial, which
lists in etched gold all 104 passengers and crew.
	   A teddy bear belonging to one of the children who died rested
against the black marble memorial, which sits in the shade of a
tree at Singapore's largest cemetery.
	   A minute of silence in memory of lost family and friends was
punctuated by muted crying. Some paid their respects to the dead in
silence, while other were helped away from the memorial as they
sobbed uncontrollably.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ When Wall Street philanthropist Alan Slifka sees
a problem, he looks to the circus for solutions.
	   Slifka isn't clowning around. As the founder of the Big Apple
Circus, Slifka knows a thing or two about life under the big top.
His experience with entertainers and acrobats has given him
inspiration for his latest act: helping Arabs and Jews in Israel to
get along.
	   ``The circus is about community, doing things together,
cooperation,'' Slifka said. ``Watching cooperation is joyful.
Therefore, the circus is a metaphor for coexistence, of people
being able to do amazing things collaboratively.''
	   For nearly a decade, Slifka has served as co-founder and
chairman of The Abraham Fund, a not-for-profit venture dedicated to
furthering coexistence in Israel. It has donated millions of
dollars to schools, summer camps, hospitals and charities that try
to bring the two peoples closer together.
	   Slifka, 69, speaks with the enthusiasm of a naive campus
activist, yet maintains the discerning eye of a seasoned venture
capitalist. He calls himself a ``social entrepreneur,'' searching
the cultural landscape for ``unmet needs'' that must be filled.
	   For a mere dlrs 100 a student, Slifka says the programs he
supports can teach Arab and Jewish children how to get along for
the rest of their lives.
	   ``It's the bargain of a lifetime,'' he says.
	   The Abraham Fund is located in the same Madison Avenue building
that houses Slifka's investment management company _Halcyon/Alan B.
Slifka Management Company LLC _ which handles about dlrs 900
million in assets.
	   His professional commitments also include serving on the board
of Pall Corp., which specializes in filtration systems, and
chairman of Global Telesystems Group, a telecommunications company
with interests in eastern Europe and Asia.
	   Still, Slifka says he devotes about half of his time to The
Abraham Fund.
	   Israel has nearly 6 million citizens, roughly 80 percent Jewish
and 20 percent Arab. Yet they have little contact, attending
separate schools and living in separate neighborhoods. Israel Arab
villages overwhelmingly tend to be worse off economically than
Jewish areas.
	   ``The Arabs are not going anywhere. The Jews are not going
anywhere. There's no alternative to coexistence,'' he said.
	   Given the constant tensions in Israel, it is easy to dismiss
Slifka, who is Jewish, as hopelessly idealistic. But the social
entrepreneuer has succeeded before.
	   The Big Apple Circus, established to bring classical
European-style circus arts to the United States, now is
internationally acclaimed. He also helped found a school in New
York City for Jewish children of varying religious backgrounds.
Enrollment has grown tenfold to 400 in 15 years.
	   And Global Telesystems Group, once a nonprofit venture to
promote Soviet-American cooperation during the Cold War, is now a
dlrs 2.8 billion behemoth. Slifka's stake in the business is
reportedly dlrs 150 million.
	   The Abraham Fund, founded in 1989 with the encouragement of
Israeli leaders from across the political spectrum, also is showing
signs of growth.
	   Named after the patriarch of the Jewish and Arab peoples, the
organization has distributed more than dlrs 4 million to dozens of
Israeli organizations over the past five years. While Slifka
donates dlrs 1 million a year, he also claims 2,000 donors.
	   Following Slifka's belief that coexistence must be taught, many
projects have focused on education. There are training seminars for
teachers, and programs for children such as summer camps, choruses
and orchestras.
	   And as in the investment world, the grants are often meant to
start up the programs, not keep them running.
	   Among his favorites: hiring an Arabic teacher for children in an
Orthodox school in Jerusalem's Old City; training Arab youths to
serve as guides at a Holocaust museum; and funding a scholarship to
bring Arab and Jewish students to study at Brandeis University in
suburban Boston.
	   Despite their vast differences, the two recipients _ Forsan
Hussein, a Muslim Arab from northern Israel, and Yoav Borowitz, a
Jew from Tel Aviv _ have become best friends.
	   ``This proves the two nations, two religions, and two segments
in Israel can really get closer,'' Borowitz said.
	   Slifka realizes most children in his programs won't become best
friends. But he believes three or four meetings over several years
can teach that ``the others are not demons. They are human beings
with whom one can create a community.''
	   In fact, his biggest challenge appears to be lack of money.
While awarding grants to some 75 groups last year, the fund had to
turn down requests from 180 others.
	   ``That's a tremendous lost opportunity. That's an opportunity we
cannot afford to lose,'' Slifka said.

New, pro-Khatami party founded in Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A new, reformist political party was set up
in Iran by a group of senior government officials, the Iran Daily
reported Sunday.
	   The newspaper said the Participation Front of Islamic Iran was
launched Saturday by 100 supporters of President Mohammad Khatami.
	   The party's founders include a number of ministers and other
officials, such as Masoumeh Ebtekar, vice president for
environmental affairs and the highest ranking woman in Khatami's
Cabinet, and Zahra Shojei, the presidential adviser on women's
affairs.
	   The party aims ``to overcome the long-standing economic and
social obstacles and upheavals, and to bring about an encouraging
area for the blossoming of culture and science,'' the paper quoted
the party statement as saying.
	   The statement also called for the respect of ``critical
thoughts,'' a reference to a recent crackdown by government
hard-liners on newspapers and opposition figures critical of the
government.
	   In their statement, the group praised Khatami's election in 1997
as a manifestation of the spirit of the Iran's Islamic revolution
of 1979.
	   Khatami's election ``increased the clarity of the ideals of the
revolution'' and ``accelerated the movement of the people towards a
just and virtuous society,'' the paper quoted the statement as
saying.
	   Powerful government hard-liners have been locked in a power
struggle with Khatami over his liberal reforms. They have jailed a
number of journalists and closed down several outspoken newspapers.

Myanmar intelligence chief attends Christmas carol program
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar's intelligence chief, Gen. Khin
Nyunt, attended a program of Christmas carol singing in Yangon to
raise money for the Myanmar Institute of Christian Theology, a
government press release said on Sunday.
	   Khin Nyunt, who attended the program on Saturday evening, is one
of the four most powerful generals in the military government of
Myanmar, also known as Burma. Myanmar is a predominantly Buddhist
country.
	   Two years ago, Myanmar's state-run press sharply criticized
opposition leader and 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu
Kyi for attending a Christmas celebration for one of her party
members who happened to be Christian.
	   Government newspapers attacked Suu Kyi for attending an event
which they characterized as disrespectful of Buddhism and Myanmar's
traditional culture.

United States to send cash and grain to Georgia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ The United States is putting together an
aid package for Georgia that will include dlrs 5 million in cash
and 35,000 tons of wheat, a presidential aide said Sunday.
	   The aid package was unveiled at a meeting Saturday between
President Eduard Shevardnadze and U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Yallovic,
presidential spokemsan Vakhtang Abashidze told reporters.
	   The cash will be used to support social programs in Georgia, he
said.
	   Georgia's central bank, meanwhile, has ceased propping up the
lari and introduced a floating rate for the currency, according to
Teimuraz Basilia, a presidential economic aide.
	   He said the decision allowing the currency to float freely has
the full support of the International Monetary Fund.
	   Georgia has asked the IMF to help cope with the impact of
Russia's economic crisis, poor harvests and a lack of fuel.
	   A drought last summer halved Georgia's grain harvest and caused
a significant reduction in hydroelectric output. The power shortage
has already forced authorities to ration energy and residents of
Tbilisi are getting electricity for just six hours a day.
	   Basilia said the German government plans to extend a 40-year
credit of 63 million marks (dlrs 37 million) to Georgia to restore
a number of electric power plants on Vartsikhe river in the
Southern Georgia.

KLA accuses Serbs of ambushes, seeks more withdrawals

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo Albanian rebels accused Serb
forces Sunday of launching unprovoked attacks in the shooting
deaths of more than a dozen ethnic Albanians in the past few days.
	   They said more Serb forces must pull back in order to avoid more
violence in the tense standoff between the two sides, which have
clashed sporadically since an October peace agreement.
	   The killings have heightened fears full-scale combat may resume
soon in Kosovo after halting two months ago when Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic agreed to a withdrawal of many forces from the
separatist Serbian province.
	   In a statement published in the ethnic Albanian newspaper Koha
Ditore, the Kosovo Liberation Army blamed the Serbs for the
escalation of violence, saying they had attacked both villages and
KLA positions despite the cease-fire.
	   The two deadliest recent shootings _ the killings of three
ethnic Albanians by unidentified assailants in Pristina and eight
KLA fighters by border guards on the Albanian border _ were Serb
ambushes, the rebels said.
	   They disputed the position of international officials that both
sides are to blame for the rising violence in Kosovo.
	   ``It is unacceptable for the international community to equate
the KLA with Serb forces'' and hold both responsible, the statement
said.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is coordinating an international monitoring mission in Kosovo,
condemned Kosovo violence last week but declined to single out
either side in the recent shootings.
	   Some 500 unarmed verifiers now patrol Kosovo daily _ a total
that is rising almost daily as the OSCE tries to put about 2,000 on
duty in the province.
	   Driving through tense villages in bright orange trucks, the
verifiers have brought a sense of added security for ethnic
Albanians even though they have no weapons.
	   ``Hopefully, the deployment of the OSCE verification mission
will create a new environment, a new atmosphere,'' ethnic Albanian
political Ibrahim Rugova said Friday.
	   About 700 French NATO troops were expected in neighboring
Macedonia on Sunday as part of a rapid-reaction force being
established there to evacuate the Kosovo monitors if needed. About
180 personnel were already on hand doing preparatory work for the
French-led backup force, which is to total about 1,500.
	   The KLA said in its statement Sunday that it has urged
international officials to push for Serb withdrawals from several
more positions. It also said the Serbs should stop patrolling some
roads for reasons of the population's security.
	   A precise deployment of allowed Serb deployments was not
specified in the October agreement brokered by U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke.
	   The embattled southern province in Serbia, which is the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia, has a population of 2 million which
consists mostly of ethnic Albanians.
	   Serbia used force this year to try to crush separatist rebels
and keep Kosovo from seceding. Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic
Albanian civilians, were killed and as many as 300,000 were
displaced from their homes.
	   Dozens have been killed since the October agreement. In the
latest violence, the ethnic Albanians' Council for the Defense of
Human Rights said a Serb sniper killed an Albanian in his field
Saturday in Klina, 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of Pristina.

With sword hanging, Asian Games means a lot to Sri Lankan village

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Susantika Jayasinghe, the Sri Lankan
village girl who rose to international athletic fame and then
became embroiled in doping questions, is set to start a new life at
the Asian Games.
	   The Asian version of the Olympics, which opens Sunday, is her
first international meet since drug issues arose in March.
	   ``I don't need to cheat to be among the best athletes in the
world,'' Jayasinghe, 23, said as she prepared for her favorite 100-
and 200-meter sprints.
	   ``I am going to prove that at the Asian Games,'' said
Jayasinghe, who practiced barefoot among rubber trees in central
Sri Lanka because her father could not afford running shoes.
	   Her trip to Bangkok was cleared when track and field's world
governing body, the International Amateur Athletic Federation,
referred her doping case to arbitration three weeks ago, saying
that until a decision is made she is free to run.
	   But her practice and concentration were affected by persistent
reports in Sri Lanka media that quoted unnamed local officials as
saying she was under some kind of suspension.
	   Jayasinghe, who had made the war-scarred nation proud by
finishing ahead of Jamaican runner Merlene Ottey at the 1997 World
Track Championships at Athens and bagging silver, said in earlier
interviews with The Associated Press that she feared her urine
sample had been tampered with. She said it was part of an effort to
defame her.
	   ``What is intriguing is that Sri Lankan officials never followed
all the rules and regulations,'' she said. ``This leads me to
believe that there was a deep-rooted conspiracy to see that I am
out and down.''
	   Jayasinghe had tested positive for Nandralone-19 at the 1995
Asian Championship in Jakarta. A ban imposed then was lifted by the
IAAF following medical evidence that Ovral, a drug to delay women's
menstrual cycles, has organic compounds similar to those found in
Nandralone. Jayasinghe admitted that she had often taken Ovral.
	   Jayasinghe tested positive again in March for the steroid
Nandralone-19. She was later cleared by the Sri Lankan federation
by a 2-1 verdict after maintaining that she only took Ovral to
control her menstrual cycle.
	   Meanwhile, she has accused government ministers and officials of
sexual harassment. She also has said that powerful politicians were
plotting to kill her husband.
	   Her accusations, which received wide publicity in conservative
Sri Lanka, reached the country's Parliament, with deputies and
ministers making charges and counter-charges.
	   Jayasinghe is only the second Sri Lankan athlete to win a medal
at a major international meet in 49 years. Duncan White won a
silver in the 400-meter hurdles at the 1948 Olympics.
	   If she wins medals in Bangkok, she still faces the possibility
of having them stripped if the IAAF arbitration panel finds her
guilty of a doping offense.

Cambodians hope end of Khmer Rouge will bring lasting peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS FONTAINE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ News of the surrender of the last
known group of Khmer Rouge guerrilla holdouts led many Cambodians
on Sunday to hope that a lasting peace could finally be at hand for
their tragedy-stricken country.
	   Although the rebels staged sporadic attacks as recently as
April, it has been several years since the Khmer Rouge posed a
serious threat to the central government in Phnom Penh.
	   Yet despite the steady winnowing of their ranks, government
offensives never completely vanquished the guerrillas, and at times
it seemed the Maoist movement, which killed as many as 2 million
Cambodians, would never die.
	   The guerrillas' demise removed a chaotic, violent force that
instilled fear not just in remote villages, but in the psyches of
all Cambodians.
	   It also comes on the heels of a reconciliation between
Cambodia's other armed factions and the formation of a new
coalition government led by Prime Minister Hun Sen after more than
a year and a half of deadly political stalemate.
	   The sudden surge of positive developments had Cambodians in the
capital city looking favorably on a future that appeared bleak
following Hun Sen's ouster of his co-prime minister Prince Norodom
Ranariddh in a violent coup d'etat last year.
	   Chrung Veasna, a 27-year-old waiter at a Phnom Penh cafe, said
he believed the agreement forged last month between Hun Sen and
Ranariddh to form a new government had convinced the Khmer Rouge
that their war could not be won.
	   ``I think maybe we won't have fighting again,'' Chrung Veasna
said. ``They have been living on the border and fighting the
government for a long time. They don't want to follow (Khmer Rouge
army chief) Ta Mok anymore.''
	   Just a day before the surrender deal, Ranariddh's resistance
forces announced their reintegration into the Cambodian army,
ending the royalists' battlefield cooperation with the Khmer Rouge.
	   Ta Mok's chief of staff, Khem Nuon, negotiated the rebels'
surrender with the Cambodian army on Friday at Preah Vihear temple
near the border with Thailand.
	   In a nationally televised speech, Khem Nuon and seven Khmer
Rouge commanders denounced their notorious leaders Ta Mok, Khieu
Samphan and Nuon Chea as ``criminals'' and promised their forces
would join the Cambodian army.
	   Khem Nuon later told a journalist that the three leaders _ all
of whom are implicated in killings the Khmer Rouge perpetrated when
they ruled the country from 1975-79 _ had ``retired.'' He refused
to give more details.
	   Hun Sen, sworn in as sole prime minister last week, welcomed the
defection as a historic moment for Cambodia in a television speech
on Sunday.
	   The Khmer Rouge surrender ends more than 30 years of civil war
that began with the guerrillas' insurgency against the government
in the late 1960s.
	   The end of armed insurrection has provided Hun Sen with an
unprecedented opportunity to change the fortunes of his
impoverished country.
	   Foreign aid cut because of the coup could return by early next
year. Japan, Cambodia's largest donor, has called on foreign
governments and aid agencies to meet in Tokyo as soon as possible
to discuss a full resumption of financial assistance.
	   On Friday, the United Nations, which refused to recognize Hun
Sen's rule after his coup, readmitted the Cambodian government into
the General Assembly.
	   Hun Sen also has pushed for Cambodia's admission into the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations before the regional
grouping's Dec. 15-16 summit in Hanoi.
	   Cambodia was set to become ASEAN's 10th member last year, but
its membership application was put on hold after Ranariddh's
ouster.

Turkish Cypriots go to polls to elect new parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Polls close at 1600 GMT Sunday, results expected on Monday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A row between President Rauf Denktash and
an opposition center-left party over the island's membership in the
European Union cast a shadow on Turkish Cypriot parliamentary
elections Sunday.
	   More than 85 percent of 121,000 eligible voters were expected to
turn up at voting stations to elect 50 lawmakers from among 352
candidates fielded by seven political parties.
	   On the eve of the elections, Denktash called on voters to
support center-right parties, including one run by his son Serdar
Denktash, who have opposed Turkish Cypriots joining in negotiations
for the island's membership in the European Union.
	   Denktash, who wants formal recognition for the self-declared
state, strongly opposes Cyprus' membership in the EU saying this
would amount to the island's integration with EU-member Greece.
	   He accused the center-left Republican Turkish Party of wanting
to sell out the Turkish Cypriot cause, and of opposing Turkey, who
also objects to Cyprus' EU membership. In turn, the center-left
party accused Denktash of favoring his son's party.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkey sent in troops
after a coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece. Nine
years later, Turkish Cypriots proclaimed the Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus, which has been recognized only by Turkey.
	   Opinion polls showed that Prime Minister Dervis Eroglu's
center-right party would come out with the largest number of seats
in the elections. But it was not clear if he would have a majority
that would allow him to govern alone, although his party won a
landslide victory in local elections earlier this year.
	   Eroglu has led the government, made up of his National Unity
Party and a Social Democrat partner, since 1996.
	   Turkish Cypriot opposition parties complain the election will be
dominated by the large number of settlers from the Turkish mainland
who have been given voting rights.
	   A recent report by the European Union Commission put the number
of recent settlers at 111,000 out of a total population of 200,000.
Opposition parties claim that about half the candidates are
settlers.
	   Polling stations were to close at 1600 GMT. Results were
expected on Monday.
	   The general elections came at a time when Denktash is seeking a
nonaggression pact with Greek Cypriots to ensure peace on the
island.
	   Greek Cypriot plans to deploy Russian-made anti-aircraft
missiles on the island have escalated tension. Turkey has
threatened to hit missile batteries if they are deployed.
	   UN-sponsored talks for reunification of Cyprus deadlocked
following Denktash's demands for recognition of his state and the
cancellation of Greek Cyprus' talks on joining the European Union.

Strong earthquake rocks eastern Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A strong earthquake rocked parts of
eastern Indonesia on Sunday, a week after a devastating temblor
killed dozens and damaged hundreds of buildings on a remote island
in the province of Maluku.
	   There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from the
5.5-magnitude quake that occurred at 9:47 a.m. (0047 GMT Saturday),
said the Jakarta station of Indonesia's Meteorology and Geophysics
Agency.
	   Last Sunday, a 6.5-magnitude earthquake struck Mangole and
adjacent islands in the Maluku Sea, damaging hundreds of buildings
and killing at least 50 people.
	   The latest quake was centered beneath the Maluku Sea, 165
kilometers (103 miles) southeast of Bitung, or about 250 kilometers
(156 miles) north of the deadly earthquake a week ago.
	   Bitung is located in North Sulawesi, about 21,225 kilometers
(1,320 miles) northeast of the Indonesian capital city of Jakarta.
	   ``It was strong enough and caused panic among residents, but
thank God, it caused no damage or casualties,'' said Wahab Konoras,
a local official in the North Maluku capital of Ternate.
	   Indonesia, the world's largest archipelago nation, is prone to
seismic upheavals because of its location on the Pacific ``Ring of
Fire,'' a series of volcanoes and fault lines from North America
through Japan and Southeast Asia to the South Pacific.

Saturday in Klina, 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of Pristina.

	   INAGI, Japan (AP) _ Japan's 26-year-old pro Katsumasa Miyamato
beat Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki in a four-hole sudden death playoff
Sunday and won the 100 million yen (dlrs 833,000) Golf Nippon

the 6,960-yard, par-70 Tokyo Yomiuri Country Club course on the
outskirts of Tokyo.
	   In the playoff, Miyamoto and ``Jumbo'' Ozaki started with pars
on the 224-yard, par-3 18th and 535-yard, par-5 17th holes and then
went back to the 17th hole, where both shot pars again.
	   On their second extra try on the 18th, Miyamoto won the playoff
with a birdie as ``Jumbo'' Ozaki shot a par.
	   ``It is like a dream,'' said Miyamoto who received the first
prize money of 30 million yen (dlrs 250,000).
	   ``Jumbo'' Ozaki collected 13 million yen (dlrs 108,000) for the
second place, assuring him of his 12th Japan PGA money earnings
title.
	   With one tournament left this season, ``Jumbo'' Ozaki has 179.6
million yen (dlrs 1.49 million) with three victories __ more than
83 million yen (dlrs 692,000) ahead of Brandt Jobe of the United
States, who stood at second place with 96 million yen (dlrs
800,000).
	   Even if Jobe wins the Daikyo Open Golf tournament next week, he
will not be able to catch up with ``Jumbo'' Ozaki.
	   Shingo Katayama shot a 68 and placed third with a 276 total.
	   Tied for fourth place with a 279 were Eduardo Herrera of
Colombia and Kazuhiko Hosokawa of Japan. Herrera shot the day's
best score of 67 and Hosakawa had 70 Sunday.
	   Defending champion Shigeki Maruyama shot a 70 for a 280 and tied
sixth place with two other Japanese __ Naomichi ``Joe'' Ozaki and
Toru Taniguchi. ``Joe'' Ozaki, the youngest brother of ``Jumbo,''
and Taniguchi both shot 69s.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A snooker game between longtime Asian
rivals India and Pakistan led to a flareup of tempers Sunday,
showing a depth of differences that shocked Thai organizers and
spectators at the Asian Games.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since becoming
independent in 1947.
	   A Thai referee's decision that India's Yashin Merchant had
committed a foul during a decisive frame sparked a fierce debate
with the referee that forced stoppage of play for 15 minutes.
	   Merchant defeated Mohammad Saleh 5-4 after order was restored,
but the incident not only violated the sport's strict etiquette,
but showed the distrust between the two neighbors that often has
spilled over into sports.
	   The referee ruled that Merchant's white cue ball had first
touched the black before hitting the target, red. Merchant
protested.
	   With the referee refusing to reverse his decision, Merchant
sought help from the Indian team. Several Indian team members went
to the playing arena, and one of them wrote a quick protest letter
using the snooker table as a writing platform. Disgusted spectators
viewed it as a breach of snooker etiquette.
	   ``It does not look nice for grownup men wearing neckties to
fight,'' said Pakistani team manager Shahnawaz Khan.
	   ``We just watched the whole drama,'' he said.
	   Pakistani team officials did not intervene, instead staying in
their allocated seats.
	   ``It was made very clear to everybody that a referee's decision
will be final, but now that the Indians have lodged a formal
complaint, we have also done so,'' Khan said.
	   The Indian complaint, however, has no meaning now as Merchant
has won. Indian officials were not available for comment.
	   The match was one of the first as snooker made its Asian Games
debut in style, with elated officials greeting the opening with
muffled clapping, in keeping with the sport's etiquette.
	   A total of 19 countries are vying for 10 gold medals in snooker
and billiards. The preliminary elimination rounds began Sunday.
	   ``This is the brightest day for us,'' said Manmohanjit Singh,
the Singapore-born president of the International Billiards and
Snooker Federation, the sport's world governing body.
	   ``This is indeed a high step and this will greatly help to make
the sport more popular in Asia, which is coming up fast,'' said
Singh, whose family migrated to Singapore from India several
decades ago.
	   With the addition of snooker, the Asian Games now have 36
sports.

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ More than 500 candidates Sunday
vied for 50 Legislative Assembly seats in an election preceded by
contract killings, beatings of candidates and and dirty tricks by
campaigners.
	   A total of 577 names were on the ballot and observers predicted
that none of the candidates would get the 51 percent of the vote
needed to win a seat in the assembly, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said. A second round of balloting was likely to be held Dec. 20, it
said.
	   Initial voter turnout was low, with only 2.57 percent of the
city's registered voters casting ballots by midday, the Interfax
news agency said. Preliminary election results were expected early
Monday.
	   St. Petersburg, Russia's second largest city, was at the
forefront of this country's democracy movement a decade ago, but as
it headed into the elections, its politics appeared as dirty and
deadly as anywhere in Russia.
	   There have been several attacks on prominent figures, including
politicians and businessmen.
	   Last year, the city's deputy governor was gunned down on a
central St. Petersburg street. In the past two months, hitmen have
claimed the lives of a legislative aide, a high-ranking city
official and a prominent banker.
	   Last month's killing of Galina Starovoitova, the country's most
prominent female politician, drew international condemnation and
focused attention on St. Petersburg's crime problems.
	   Boris Nemtsov, the former first deputy premier, recently visited
the city and called it ``the crime capital of Russia.''
	   Unlike many cities in Russia, where the city legislature has
little power, the assembly could be quite influential. A new city
charter calls for the legislature to be a full-time body with
extensive powers.
	   Alexander Yakovlev, the city's mayor, strongly opposed the new
charter, which curtails his clout. He is not on the ballot, but
critics say he has contributed to the mean-spirited atmosphere
surrounding the election.
	   Opponents of Yakovlev have found that people with the same name
were mysteriously proposed as candidates. This has been done in an
attempt to confuse voters and take away votes from liberals.
	   In addition, anti-Semitic leaflets have been handed out asking
citizens not to vote for Jewish candidates, and one candidate's
posters were defaced with slurs against Jews.
	   There have also been multiple reports of attempts to bribe
voters.
	   St. Petersburg's 3.7 million voters seem fed up with the city's
crime and corruption, and its poor economic performance, and
election officials predicted that only 35 percent of the electorate
would turn out for Sunday's polling, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Some 5,000 police were deployed to ensure law and order during
the balloting, the news agency said. Before polls opened, police
examined 1,500 polling stations, looking for explosives or other
items that could disrupt voting, it said.

	   LIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) _ More than 30 years after President Omar
Bongo came to power, Gabonese voters were deciding Sunday whether
the long-serving autocrat should be elected to another seven year
term.
	   There were scattered reports of stone-throwing and other
violence in Libreville overnight, but voting was going calmly early
Sunday morning at a sampling of the capital city's polling
stations.
	   No injuries were immediately reported from the overnight
violence, and it was not clear what had sparked it. Soldiers were
standing watch at all the city's polling stations Sunday.
	   A number of polling stations had opened late, election monitors
said, but there were no other reports of problems in the early
hours of the voting.
	   ``It went fine,'' said Jusline Bassalila, after voting in a
working class Libreville neighborhood.
	   Bongo, who ran a single party state from 1967-1990, is facing
his second multi-party competition in the election. His opponents
have claimed for weeks that the campaign has been marred by
extensive voter fraud.

Former drug cheat back in the swim of things
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's swim team will hit the water at
the Asian Games on Monday with a reminder of the darkest chapter in
its story of drug shame.
	   Xiong Gouming, one of the 11 Chinese athletes who tested
positive for steroids in Hiroshima four years ago, will compete in
the men's 400-meter individual medley, taking his place on a team
that is constantly forced to defend itself.
	   Head coach Zhang Xiong said Xiong Gouming ``feels fine'' about
being back at an Asian Games. ``That was the past,'' said Zhang,
brushing off drug questions Sunday. ``We hope that we will be
clean.''
	   The Chinese Olympic Committee tested athletes before their
departure for Bangkok, and Chinese media said the swimmers were
subjected to four surprise tests conducted by world governing body
FINA.
	   ``We treat this as a major issue to make sure no Chinese
athletes will test positive,'' COC vice president Li Furong said.
	   Earlier this year China announced, through FINA, that any of its
athletes testing positive for steroids would be banned for life.
Under those criteria, Xiong would never have had his second chance
at an Asian Games.
	   Xiong won four golds in Hiroshima but has been mediocre since
returning to international competition at the East Asian Games a
year ago. He was one of many poor performers at the world
championships in Perth in January, as the Chinese appeared
demoralized by yet another scandal.
	   After female swimmer Yuan Yuan was caught trying to smuggle 13
vials of human growth hormone through Sydney Airport, four of her
teammates were nabbed with masking agents in their systems and
thrown out of the games.
	   Chinese women swimmers won 12 of the 16 golds at stake in the
1994 Rome world championships and all 15 of their races in the 1994
Asian Games.
	   The team won three gold medals at this year's world
championships. Two of those went in the medley events to world
record holders Chen Yan and Wu Yanyan, who will lead the Chinese
team here.
	   Fellow world record holders Le Jingyi and He Cihong were left
off a generally young squad assembled with a view ahead to the 2000
Olympics.
	   Japan's rising talent will test the inexperienced Chinese after
a successful world championships.
	   Mai Nakamura, a silver medalist in the 100-meter backstroke and
bronze medalist over 200; Ayari Aoyama, silver medalist in the
100-meter butterfly, and Yasuko Tajima, bronze medalist in the
400-meter medley, give the Japanese team undoubted class.

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ A leaderless coalition of former opponents
of the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha was leading early results
gathered overnight from Nigeria's key local government elections,
officials said Sunday.
	   The Peoples' Democratic Party, a grouping of 34 traditional
chiefs, academics, businessmen and ex-military generals, was the
top vote-getter in the majority of Nigeria's 36 states, several
National Electoral Commission officials said on condition of
anonymity.
	   The party has a murky platform and no leader although former
military ruler Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo has donated dlrs 2.5 million
to the party and is campaigning for the party's presidential
nomination expected later this month or in January.
	   Elections officials were releasing no national or regional
figures, emphasizing that it would take time for them to finalize
the results. It was not clear when an announcement would be made.
	   The turnout was higher than expected. More than 50 million
people in this country, Africa's most populous, were registered for
the vote. Foreign observers and local human rights groups were
monitoring the poll.
	   Problems in vote counting were caused by a lack of logistics.
Votes in some remote rural communities were being collected by
donkeys and camels while polling stations in the major cities had
to deal with a higher-than-expected turnout with a shortage of
officials and materials.
	   Saturday's poll was seen as a test run ahead of presidential
elections on February 15. Although voting went ahead largely
peacefully, it was marred by scattered reports of ballot shortages
and inaccurate voters' lists.
	   At least six people were killed when rival supporters of two
parties _ the PDP and the Alliance for Democracy _ clashed outside
a polling station near the town of Warri about 200 kilometers (125
miles) southeast of Lagos, witnesses said.
	   Although many voters said they were planning to vote for change,
Obasanjo and the PDP appeared to be a compromise choice offering
military stability in combination with increased civilian
participation in government.
	   Obasanjo, who assumed control in 1976 after a failed coup
attempt took the life of military leader Gen. Murtala Muhammed,
became the only military ruler to relinquish power and retire in
1979.
	   Although a southerner, Obasanjo has strong support in the
predominantly-Muslim north, the power base for the Nigerian
military which has ruled for all but 10 years since independence
from Britain in 1960.
	   Preliminary election results also showed strong results for two
other new political entities _ the All Peoples' Party and the
Alliance for Democracy, which includes some members of political
parties formerly allied to Abacha, electoral officials said.
	   Only parties which obtain at least 5 percent of Saturday's vote
in 24 of Nigeria's 36 states will be allowed to participate in
February's poll.

Japanese runner starts games off with near-record marathon

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan's Naoko Takahashi staged her own
opening ceremony for the Asian Games Sunday, winning the first gold
medal with a marathon time just one minute off the world record.
	   To avoid the worst of Bangkok's tropical heat, the women's
marathon was started at 6:30 a.m. (2330 GMT Saturday), more than 13
hours before King Bhumibol Adulyadej was to formally declare the
opening at ceremonies with trumpet fanfares and royal fireworks.
	   The tiny 26-year-old Japanese received her medal at the
ceremonies' stadium, 40 minutes before the scheduled start of the
opening overture.
	   Takahashi needed just 2 hours, 21 minutes, 47 seconds to finish
the 42.195 kilometers (26 miles, 385 yards) _ 13 minutes better
than the second-place runner _ and might have gone faster if
temperatures had not started rising into the 30s Celsius (90s F).
	   After the fifth best women's marathon time ever, Takahashi said
that ``at 20 kilometers (12 miles), I didn't intend to lose the
pace but my body wouldn't keep going properly. I wasn't expecting a
world record here but it's true that I'll look back and think I
could have done much better over the last 10 kilometers (6
miles).''
	   Kenya's Tegla Loroupe set the world record of 2:20:47 in
Rotterdam this year, and her coach, Yoshio Koide, said that ``with
her ability now she can break the record any time the conditions
are good.''
	   Her time shattered the Asian record of 2:24:07 set by China's
Wang Junxia in 1993 and was far faster than the old games record of
2:29:32 set by China's Zhong Huangdi in 1994.
	   ``This race changes marathon history. I believe she is the
fastest runner in the world at the moment,'' said Shigeru So, chief
of the Japanese athletic federation's athlete development program
for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
	   Japan missed a 1-2 sweep when North Korean Kim Chang outsprinted
Tomoko Kai over the final 100 meters in the main stadium. Kim took
the silver in 2:34:55, and Kai the bronze in 2:35:01.
	   It was the North Koreans' first Asian Games medal in eight
years. They skipped the 1994 games in Hiroshima, Japan.
	   Japanese delegation leader Teruji Kogake said, ``Getting a gold
and a bronze in the very first event of the games should be an
inspiration to the others. Receiving their medals before everyone
at the opening ceremony is certain to move the others.''
	   While the women marathon racers won the first medals, they were
not the first to start action at the games.
	   The original field of 23 soccer teams has been playing for a
week to narrow the field to 16 teams for the second round, opening
Monday.
	   The survivors are Turkmenistan, South Korea, China, Lebanon,
Japan, India, Qatar, Tajikistan, the United Arab Emirates, North
Korea, Thailand, Oman, Uzbekistan, Kuwait, Iran and Kazakstan.
	   Those eliminated were Vietnam, Cambodia, Nepal, the Maldives,
Hong Kong, Mongolia and Laos.
	   Among Monday's games is a contest between archrivals South Korea
and Japan, battling both for Asian supremacy and prestige in
advance of their co-host roles for the 2002 World Cup finals. A
loss at this round robin stage would not necessarily lead to
elimination from medal contention.
	   Preliminary competition also began Sunday for snooker, making
its Asian Games debut, and tempers quickly flared over a game
between longtime Asian rivals India and Pakistan.
	   India's protests over a foul call led to a 15-minute halt to
play, and spectators attuned to the sport's strict etiquette were
aghast when Indian team members used a snooker table as a platform
to write a protest letter.
	   India's Yashin Merchant went on to defeat Pakistan's Mohammad
Saleh 5-4, and both sides' protests were thrown out because neither
paid the required dlrs 50 filing fee, officials said.
	   In all, 377 gold medals are at stake in 36 sports. Some 6,000
athletes from 41 nations are competing in Asia's version of the
Olympics, even though Asia's financial crisis has forced some
nations to curtail their entries.
	   The men's marathon is scheduled for the closing day, Dec. 20.

China executes two for smuggling computers, pagers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING, China (AP) _ In the midst of a sweeping crackdown on
illegal imports, China said Sunday that it has executed a computer
executive and an office worker for smuggling computers, pagers and
other electronic goods into the country.
	   The deaths come as China carries out a campaign to enforce trade
barriers that shield its industries from foreign competition in an
attempt to quash a multibillion-dollar market for illegally
imported products.
	   Tang Mihong, general manager of the Beijing Huilu Computer
Development Co., and office worker Zhao Jian were convicted of
running a smuggling ring from 1992 to 1995, the state-run Xinhua
News Agency said.
	   With the help of accomplices at research institutes and trading
companies, the pair imported electronic goods worth a total of 56
million yuan (dlrs 6.8 million), the report said.
	   In at least 10 shipments, the smugglers evaded duties at customs
offices in cities ranging from Guangzhou in southern China to
Tianjin and Beijing in the north, Xinhua said.
	   China has maintained the value of its currency while those of
other countries has plunged recently, creating the potential for
huge profits to smugglers who can get goods bought cheaply abroad
into the Chinese market.
	   Smuggling is believed to account for as much as 15 percent of
Chinese imports, or some dlrs 30 billion a year.
	   Quotas and high tariffs that keep out most foreign goods have
shielded China from the Asian financial crisis. But a flood of
imports has pushed down domestic prices for industrial materials
and consumer goods so low that Chinese companies complain they
cannot compete.
	   Since launching its crackdown in July, China has punished
thousands of smugglers and dismissed hundreds of customs officials
for taking bribes.
	   China says the effort has led to higher prices for industrial
materials and consumer goods. But state media disclosed this week
that in at least one industry _ chemical fibers _ a resurgence of
smuggling has pushed prices back down to record lows.
	   Supreme People's Court deputy chief Liu Jiashen said such
smuggling is ``seriously disrupting efforts to establish economic
stability,'' according to the Xinhua report.
	   Two accomplices of Tang and Zhao were sentenced to 15 and 11
years in prison, respectively, the report said.

Report: Malaysian opposition party chairman released after five-day
</HEADLINE>
remand

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The chairman of a Malaysian
opposition party has been freed on bail after a five-day remand
which immediately followed his initial release from jail last week,
a local newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Chua Tian Chang, 35, better known as Tian Chua, was freed
Saturday and ordered to appear at the Petaling Jaya neighborhood
police station in Kuala Lumpur on December 19 to hear any charges
filed against him or have his bail extended, the New Sunday Times
said.
	   Tian, chairman of the opposition Coalition of People's
Democracy, had originally won a bail appeal after being held on
separate charges last week, but was arrested again as soon as he
walked out of the courthouse.
	   Police have acted in response to Tian's call for political
reforms and protest campaign against the government of Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Tian was taken into custody last month on charges of disobeying
police orders to disperse an unlawful assembly in the capital city
on November 21. He was then rearrested for alleged possession of
seditious printed materials.
	   After his release on Saturday, Tian said he would continue to
fight for democracy in Malaysia and the ``right to voice out
opinions,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying.

Yugoslav leader seems strong as ever despite American pressure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Washington may claim the
violence-plagued rule of Slobodan Milosevic is weakening, but the
Yugoslav president's supporters and even some critics at home say
he is as strong as ever.
	   Ignoring U.S. pressure on his government, he is purging the
police and military in apparent preparation for another major
crackdown: this time on pro-independence elements in Montenegro,
the small republic that with Serbia forms present-day Yugoslavia.
	   The purge prompted State Department spokesman James P. Rubin to
declare last Monday that ``President Milosevic's grip on power is
weakening.''
	   Rubin accused Milosevic of being ``at the center of every
crisis'' during and since the breakup of the old Yugoslav
federation. ``He is not simply part of the problem; Milosevic is
the problem,'' the spokesman added.
	   Washington has always blamed Milosevic for the ethnic conflicts
in the Balkans, and it imposed diplomatic and economic sanctions on
his government. But the Clinton administration has worked closely
with him since 1995 trying to ensure a lasting peace in Bosnia,
formerly a Yugoslav republic.
	   Rubin's remarks led to news media speculation that Washington
has concluded there can't be a secure peace with Milosevic in power
and now is encouraging his ouster.
	   Yet many of Milosevic's domestic allies and opponents alike
agree that the Yugoslav president's rule is as strong as ever and
that the recent sacking of his army chief, Gen. Momcilo Perisic,
and secret police head, Jovica Stanisic, herald more trouble for
the Balkans.
	   Both Stanisic and Perisic were replaced by officers loyal to
Milosevic's neo-communist wife, Mirjana Markovic. Her hard-line
loyalists have recently assumed most top posts in Yugoslavia,
further strengthening Milosevic.
	   Milosevic has also moved against independent news media _ the
only real source of information for most Yugoslavs _ by introducing
harsh press laws and banning and closing newspapers and radio
stations. He recently purged Belgrade University, the traditional
center of rebellion, by sacking professors and replacing them with
his supporters.
	   Despite the new crackdown _ and unhappiness over Yugoslavia's
deep economic problems _ there have been no street protests like
those two years ago when Milosevic's rule was seriously shaken by
three months of demonstrations. Those protests ended in a major
disappointment for his opponents when their leaders split up over
personal differences.
	   Military and police purges have been common for Milosevic ahead
of major actions against his opponents, and the latest ousters were
a clear sign of his strength rather than weakness, his opponents
say.
	   ``The purges seem to me like a reorganization of his ranks
before a new offensive against Montenegro,'' said Montenegro's
pro-Western president, Milo Djukanovic, a strong critic of
Milosevic.
	   Milosevic ``has remained in power for years by engineering
crisis,'' Djukanovic said.
	   Elected last year over a Milosevic ally, Djukanovic has been
targeted by state-run Yugsolav media, which regularly criticize his
pro-Western, reformist and independent-minded views.
	   Both Perisic and Stanisic had publicly opposed any crackdown on
Montenegro, which many people fear would bring bloodshed like that
previously in Bosnia, Croatia and Slovenia.
	   ``Their sacking will have negative consequences for
Montenegro,'' said Serbia's opposition leader, Vesna Pesic.
	   Some people said the main Yugoslav problem is the lack of an
alternative to Milosevic.
	   ``The democratic changes in our country depend less on America
than on the local population, which I'm not sure is fed up with
Milosevic,'' said Dejan Anastasijevic, an analyst for the
independent Belgrade weekly Vreme.
	   Montenegro's deputy parliament spokesman, Predrag Popovic,
agreed. He said Milosevic ``will not leave his duties soon, despite
some announcements from Washington.''
	   Asked about the comments from Washington, Milosevic spokesman
Ivica Dacic said: ``The hatred is mutual.''
	   Milosevic's ultra-nationalist ally, Vojislav Seselj, was even
more blunt: ``Those supported by Americans have no chance in
Serbia. There is a curse in Serbia: `Hope Americans support you in
the elections.'''

Report: Villagers burn trucks, loot fertilizer storehouse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of Indonesian farmers
protesting higher fertilizer prices burned vehicles and looted
fertilizer storehouses, a local report said Sunday.
	   The riots occurred Saturday night in Blora, about 312 miles (500
kilometers) east of the Indonesian capital city of Jakarta, the
state-run Antara news agency reported.
	   The farmers damaged the house and office of a private storehouse
owner, along with a storehouse run by a farmers' cooperative, the
report said.
	   They were angered by a price hike at the privately-run
storehouse and unavailability of cheaper fertilizer at the
cooperative, it said.
	   There were no reports of arrests or injuries, Antara said.
	   Indonesia, the world's fourth biggest country, is facing its
worst economic crisis in decades. Civil disturbances have increased
amid mass unemployment and rising prices for staple food items and
other basic goods.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Amid pomp and pageantry, world leaders are marking
the 50th anniversary this week of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights. But there is only limited room for celebration.
	   Adopted in the aftermath of World War II, the declaration was
intended to prevent a repetition of the horrors of the Holocaust
and other atrocities.
	   Beginning with the pronouncement that ``all human beings are
born free and equal in dignity and rights,'' the United Nations
document set out to cover the range of human existence.
	   It has become at once the most quoted and most ignored
international document of modern times.
	   Since its inauguration on Dec. 10, 1948, millions of people have
been denied their most basic right _ that of life _ as a result of
massacres such as those in Cambodia, Rwanda and Bosnia. In many
other countries, inhabitants can only dream of basic civil
liberties.
	   And the world is far from fulfilling the declaration's
pronouncements on economic rights. ``Everyone has the right to a
standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of
himself and his family,'' says Article 25.
	   According to U.N. figures, 1.5 billion people must get by on
less than dlrs 1 a day. In South Asia, half of all children under 5
are malnourished. Only a third of the people in sub-Saharan Africa
are likely to live past 40.
	   ``The problem for the common people is that they don't
understand their rights,'' said Sri Bintang Pamungkas, a former
political prisoner in Indonesia.
	   The declaration's 30 articles are short, between one and four
sentences each. They proclaim the right to life and freedom from
slavery and torture. They also spell out equality in marriage and
divorce, freedom of religion and the right to education.
	   In an effort to raise awareness of the declaration, human rights
groups have spent the anniversary year staging street plays, pop
concerts and school competitions to pass along its message.
	   Official observances culminate this week in ceremonies Tuesday
in Paris and Thursday in New York with world leaders like French
President Jacques Chirac and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   There is consensus among activists that despite blatant
violations of the declaration's principles, there has been
progress.
	   ``Even if it's not implemented, it's THE point of reference for
governments and people around the world,'' said Isabelle Scherer of
Amnesty International.
	   Most advocates cited Britain's arrest and possible extradition
of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain on charges of
genocide and torture as evidence of a changing international mood.
	   ``Pinochet's arrest makes a very nice 50th anniversary
present,'' said Kenneth Roth, executive director of the New
York-based Human Rights Watch.
	   Peter Thomas Burns, chairman of the U.N. committee on torture,
said: ``Twenty years ago, dictators, when deposed, could look
forward to a happy, comfortable retirement. International human
rights law has caught up with them.''
	   U.N. organizations set up to monitor compliance with the
declaration and related treaties meet frequently in Geneva.
Although the bodies have little power other than to cajole or
rebuke, rights advocates say their pressure makes a difference.
	   Many Asian nations have long argued that human rights are a
purely internal matter, but there are signs of changing attitudes.
Both Indonesia and the Philippines criticized Malaysia's government
this year over the detention of a former deputy prime minister,
Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Yet, while China recently signed a U.N. treaty on civil and
political rights and maintains it respects the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, it still punishes anyone who doesn't
toe the official line.
	   Many Chinese echo the government's position that national
prosperity takes precedence over individual rights.
	   ``First, we must have economic change. As the economy has
developed over the past 20 years, people have more rights,'' a
Chinese businessman, who gave his name as Mr. Wang, told a
reporter. ``Twenty years ago, I could not be standing here talking
to you.''
	   Although there has been increasing recognition of women's rights
in U.N. documents, it has made little impact on the plight of
millions of women in developing countries.
	   In Kenya, for instance, growing economic hardship is blamed for
a big increase in physical abuse of women. Women's groups there
plan to mark the declaration's anniversary Thursday by putting
husbands of battered women ``on trial'' to highlight the problem.
	   The declaration has frequently served as an inspiration to the
oppressed.
	   Alexander Podrabinek, 46, who spent five years in Siberian exile
during communist rule in the Soviet Union, said the declaration was
long a touchstone for dissidents. He recalled how the KGB routinely
confiscated copies of the document as ``anti-Soviet literature.''
	   Conditions are better now in Russia, but there are still
widespread violations of human rights, he said, citing religious
discrimination and appalling conditions in prisons.
	   ``The broad public is largely unaware of the declaration,'' he
added. ``But it remains some kind of a distant ideal.''

Settlers at a loss how to stop West Bank pullback
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHILO, West Bank _ Fatigue lined the round, open face of settler
leader Aharon Domb after another day of meetings aimed at trying to
halt Israel's West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   But damage control has replaced idealism, and even true
believers in the right of Israelis to live in the West Bank are
talking of just preserving as much as they can.
	   Dejected, Domb said his movement has taken a body blow from a
government most settlers voted for, and has been pushed to the
fringe of Israeli politics. He said settlers are ``confused and
upset,'' but that he didn't know what to do to help.
	   Some settlers are taking action, grabbing hilltops in the West
Bank with the tacit support of the same government that signed the
agreement with the Palestinians.
	   Standing near his two-story house at the edge of the Shilo
settlement in the heart of the West Bank, Yisrael Medad pointed to
one such enclave across a valley on a hilltop. There, a few
trailers were lined up, and a portable generator providing them
with electricity whined across the empty space.
	   ``We have three families living there now,'' Medad said proudly,
adding that more hilltops were being seized.
	   Still, the 51-year-old Medad, who has lived in Shilo for 18
years, is bitter.
	   Most settlers voted for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in
1996, believing he would champion their cause. But in October,
Netanyahu signed an agreement to hand over 13 percent more of the
West Bank to the Palestinians.
	   At the same time, Netanyahu's government is encouraging
settlement expansion, granting settlers generous tax breaks and
subsidies.
	   But Domb reacted to a mention of the government's settlement
policy by slapping his forehead and emitting a long, audible sigh.
An allocation of dlrs 114 million for settlements in 1999 is
``aspirin for cancer,'' he said.
	   His gloom lifted when he talked of Sebastia, an abandoned train
station north of the West Bank town of Nablus where the religious
settlement movement scored a major victory 23 years ago.
	   At Sebastia, a youthful Domb and his comrades danced in circles
and sang ``The sons came back home'' _ a reference to the belief
that Israel's capture of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1967
Mideast war brought the Jewish people closer to redemption by
restoring the rest of the land promised to them by God.
	   In seizing Sebastia, the fledgling movement tested then-Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin's resolve not to allow settlements in the
heart of the West Bank. Rabin lost.
	   From then on, settlement after settlement was established, for a
total of 144 that are home to 176,000 Israelis today.
	   But the glory days appear to be over.
	   ``The people here are angry,'' said Ron Nachman, mayor of Ariel,
a West Bank settlement of 15,000 people living in small apartment
buildings and detached houses.
	   A member of Netanyahu's Likud Party, Nachman said that after the
Wye accord, Ariel residents had expected ``warmth'' from their
government, a visit by a minister. But no one came.
	   Sitting behind his cluttered desk, Nachman watched as the
television suspended from the ceiling showed pictures of a dozen
Palestinians attacking an Israeli car at a West Bank junction,
beating the driver and passenger and setting the car on fire.
	   Nachman picked up the phone and called a deputy Cabinet
minister. They discussed the incident in heated tones, but came up
with no solutions.
	   There will be more violence now, said Shmuel Gross, 32, who
moved to Shilo three years ago. His brother, a settler in the West
Bank town of Hebron, was stabbed to death there by a Palestinian
several years ago.
	   ``In another month or two, we'll be driving down the road and
they'll be shooting at the car,'' he warned.
	   None of this deters the settlers of Shilo.
	   Ariella Ben Eliezer, 46, a tall, angular woman wearing a long
dress and hat common to Orthodox Jewish women, set her blue eyes
determinedly. ``This land is a present from God, so we must live
here,'' she declared.
	   However, a majority of the settlers moved to the West Bank in
search of a suburban life they couldn't afford in Israel's cities.
Now, some talk openly of leaving.
	   Domb's Council of Settlements claims to represent both types of
settlers, but its leadership is made up of ideologues.
	   Their disarray following the Wye River accord was evident.
	   During the nine-day summit that led up to the agreement, the
council called settlers to block intersections. Only a few hundred
responded. A well-advertised demonstration in Tel Aviv drew about
40,000, but many were brought in by council buses.
	   Domb said demonstrations are not the proper vehicle under the
present circumstances, but he was at a loss to point to an
effective tool.
	   The veteran settler activist, gone paunchy and gray two decades
after Sebastia, acknowledged that he faced a new reality.
	   ``The `nationalist camp' has folded its flag,'' he said, ``and
now we have to muster our forces to hoist the flag again. We know
it will never be raised to the top of the flagpole. So we'll raise
it to half-staff.''

Ariane rocket launches Mexican satellite
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ An Ariane rocket placed a Mexican
telecommunications satellite into orbit overnight, after a 24-hour
delay due to a technical glitch with the SATMEX 5, officials with
the European Space Agency said Sunday.
	   The launch from Guiana Space Center in French Guiana, on the
northern edge of South America, took place at 9:43 p.m. Saturday
(0043 GMT Sunday), officials said.
	   It was the 114th launch of an Ariane 4 and the 10th of the year,
and it was the first time the rocket was using a more-efficient
fuel system for the third stage.
	   SATMEX 5, built by U.S.-based Hughes Space and Communications,
is the third Mexican telecommunications satellite placed in orbit
by Ariane. It was placed in orbit over the Pacific to support TV
and telephone relays for the next 15 years.
	   The next Ariane 4 launch is slated for Dec. 21, carrying a U.S.
Panamsat.
	   Arianespace, the European Space Agency's commercial arm, also
plans next year to begin using its new Ariane 5, after a successful
test launch in October.
	   Twice as powerful as the Ariane 4, it is to gradually replace
Arianespace's workhorse in an effort to maintain the company's lead
in the world's commercial launch market.
	   The first Ariane 5 crashed in June 1996 and a launch a year ago
was less than perfect, making October's final test launch critical.

Offsides in Bangkok: Viagra and night life
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo XBK114 Dec. 4 &QL; 
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ For some teams, ``out of bounds'' at
the Asian Games means more than just a line on a soccer field or
basketball floor.
	   That's because the host city offers the punchy mix of Viagra and
notorious night life.
	   The Pakistanis say all their athletes and officials for the
games opening Sunday have been told not to even think of the wonder
drug and ``night life ideas.''
	   The Indian team's solution is mandatory meetings for all
athletes before bedtime.
	   The Sri Lankan participants, who had to sign a code of conduct
before coming to Bangkok, are being watched by an army brigadier
with a track record of high discipline.
	   The Chinese have done their homework on staying out of trouble.
	   Thailand, especially the capital Bangkok, is known worldwide for
its titillating night life. From taxi drivers to local tourist
magazines distributed free at hotels, there are messengers aplenty
to advertise massage parlors and escort services. Minutely detailed
photo albums seek to arouse sensual fantasies.
	   Estimates of the number of female sex workers in Thailand, a
country of 60 million, range from more than 300,000 to 2 million.
	   Under Thailand's drug rules, Viagra is not available in drug
stores, but is sold only in hospital pharmacies with a prescription
from a urologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist or psychiatrist for
400 baht (about dlrs 10) a dose.
	   But there is a black market in the drug that might prove an
attraction for some among the more than 15,000 athletes, officials
and media personnel in Bangkok.
	   ``No way,'' said Gurdayal Singh Mander, leader of the Indian
contingent, when asked if there was a risk of lack in discipline.
	   ``I believe no one will try anything silly in Bangkok. Even if
they try, our watching system is watertight and we will know,''
said Mander, a former police officer. Indian officials in charge of
various sports meet their athletes at 10 p.m. before bedtime at the
Asian Games village.
	   The Pakistanis have opted for trust and nationalism.
	   ``Oh, Viagra,'' exclaimed Pakistani medical officer Yousef Baig.
	   ``They know all about it and they know all about Bangkok. We
have told them, don't break our trust and keep the good name of
Pakistan flying high,'' Dr. Baig said.
	   China has taken a similar approach.
	   ``We don't treat them as kids, telling them don't do this, don't
do that. We just told them to leave a good impression of Chinese
athletes,'' said Li Furong, deputy head of the Chinese delegation.
	   For the Sri Lankans, ``we have told them that they will not be
allowed outside the games village until they finish their
discipline,'' said Upali Bandaratillaka, a serving brigadier in the
Sri Lankan army.
	   ``Even if they want to go to shopping, one of us will accompany
them,'' Bandaratillaka said. His deputy is a police officer.
	   Host Thailand is stressing that sex isn't lurking around every
corner.
	   A ``Traditional Thai Massage Parlor'' has been opened at the
games' village.
	   ``Thai traditional massage is considered an art form,'' said
Prarop Laovanich, secretary of the Asian Games Sub-Committee for
Culture and Performance. ``A skilled masseur can cure ailments and
muscular fatigue.''
	   And one must wear baggy white pajamas before a traditional Thai
massage.

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Guoming in 2nd and 3rd grafs &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's swim team will hit the water at
the Asian Games on Monday with a reminder of the darkest chapter in
its story of drug shame.
	   Xiong Guoming, one of the 11 Chinese athletes who tested
positive for steroids in Hiroshima four years ago, will compete in
the men's 400-meter individual medley, taking his place on a team
that is constantly forced to defend itself.
	   Head coach Zhang Xiong said Xiong Guoming ``feels fine'' about
being back at an Asian Games. ``That was the past,'' said Zhang,
brushing off drug questions Sunday. ``We hope that we will be
clean.''
	   The Chinese Olympic Committee tested athletes before their
departure for Bangkok, and Chinese media said the swimmers were
subjected to four surprise tests conducted by world governing body
FINA.
	   ``We treat this as a major issue to make sure no Chinese
athletes will test positive,'' COC vice president Li Furong said.
	   Earlier this year China announced, through FINA, that any of its
athletes testing positive for steroids would be banned for life.
Under those criteria, Xiong would never have had his second chance
at an Asian Games.
	   Xiong won four golds in Hiroshima but has been mediocre since
returning to international competition at the East Asian Games a
year ago. He was one of many poor performers at the world
championships in Perth in January, as the Chinese appeared
demoralized by yet another scandal.
	   After female swimmer Yuan Yuan was caught trying to smuggle 13
vials of human growth hormone through Sydney Airport, four of her
teammates were nabbed with masking agents in their systems and
thrown out of the games.
	   Chinese women swimmers won 12 of the 16 golds at stake in the
1994 Rome world championships and all 15 of their races in the 1994
Asian Games.
	   The team won three gold medals at this year's world
championships. Two of those went in the medley events to world
record holders Chen Yan and Wu Yanyan, who will lead the Chinese
team here.
	   Fellow world record holders Le Jingyi and He Cihong were left
off a generally young squad assembled with a view ahead to the 2000
Olympics.
	   Japan's rising talent will test the inexperienced Chinese after
a successful world championships.
	   Mai Nakamura, a silver medalist in the 100-meter backstroke and
bronze medalist over 200; Ayari Aoyama, silver medalist in the
100-meter butterfly, and Yasuko Tajima, bronze medalist in the
400-meter medley, give the Japanese team undoubted class.

D.C. United 2, Vasco da Gama 0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida (AP) _ D.C. United became the first
U.S. team to win the InterAmerican Cup, as Eddie Pope and Tony
Sanneh scored Saturday in a 2-0 second-leg victory over Brazilian
club Vasco da Gama.
	   D.C. United won the two-game series, which pitted the North and
South American club champions, by an aggregate score of 2-1. Vasco
da Gama won the first leg match 1-0 in Washington on Nov. 14.
	   For Vasco da Gama, the loss to a U.S. club that's been playing
for just three years will be a major source of embarrassment. It
also caps a 23-day trip away from Rio de Janeiro that included a
2-1 loss to Real Madrid in the Intercontinental Cup on Tuesday in
Tokyo.
	   United's win closed out coach Bruce Arena's three-year tenure
with the club, which included two Major League Soccer titles.
	   Sanneh gave United a 1-0 lead in the 34th minute by running onto
a far post low cross played by defender Jeff Agoos through the
middle of the Vasco da Gama defense.
	   With the aggregate scored deadlocked at one, the Brazilians
picked up the pace in the second half, but to no avail.
	   In the 56th minute, Donizete hit the post from a wide angle, and
seconds later he forced D.C. goalkeeper Scott Garlick into a diving
save from nearly the same spot.
	   D.C. United made it 2-0 and took the lead in the series on
Pope's goal in the 77th minute. The goal started with Marco
Etcheverry's corner kick that was headed by Roy Lassiter to an open
Pope.
	   D.C. defender Carlos Llamosa blocked a volley by Vasco's
Guilherme in the 89th minute to preserve the win for United.

Report: Singapore's No. 2 leader says crisis management to speed
</HEADLINE>
recovery

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's deputy leader said his country's
crisis management efforts amid a regionwide economic slump will
attract foreign investors and help the economy recover, a local
newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The tiny island republic will lure more overseas capital and
business because of its ``good track record in reacting to
unexpected events,'' Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was
quoted as saying in The Sunday Times.
	   ``Singapore may be in the same region, but we are different from
other countries,'' said Lee, who has directed his country's
response to the Asian financial crisis.
	   The government recently unveiled cost-cutting measures worth
dlrs 6 billion to boost Singapore's competitiveness and position
its economy for a rebound.
	   Workers will bear the brunt of the massive cost-cutting package
_ which totals about 7 percent of the entire gross domestic product
_ through steep reductions in pay and other benefits.
	   Although there has been some grumbling, few workers have
challenged this approach. After years of successful economic
planning nation, most Singaporeans seem ready to make the
sacrifice.
	   ``We must get used to the idea that the boom that preceded this
crisis is over,'' Lee was quoted as saying.

Birthday wellwishers gather outside Malaysian prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Supporters of a jailed Malaysian
opposition figure gathered Sunday outside a prison after they were
refused entry to wish the political dissident a happy birthday, a
local report said.
	   The wellwishers carried balloons and placards in front of the
jail where Lim Guan Eng, deputy secretary-general of the Democratic
Action Party, has been held, the state-run Bernama news agency
reported.
	   Lim is serving an 18-month jail sentence after having been found
guilty of violating Malaysia's Seditious Act and Publications and
Printing Presses Act.
	   He is the son of Lim Kit Siang, who is the opposition leader in
the Southeast Asian nation's Parliament, and secretary-general of
the Democratic Action Party.
	   Prison officials would not allow Lim's supporters to meet with
him, citing regulations limiting visitors to family members and
lawyers.
	   Officials initially refused even to pass gifts or messages on to
Lim, but eventually relented by allowing prison guards to deliver a
birthday card to the prisoner.

Election results offer rebirth for Taiwan's Nationalists

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party found
its hand considerably strengthened Sunday, a day after elections
which endorsed its moderate policies toward mainland China and
steady management of the economy.
	   Candidates were out early, parading with supporters who banged
drums and gongs in a traditional thanks to the voters, as Taiwan
awakened to what observers called a rebirth for the 104-year-old
party that has ruled Taiwan since its leaders fled China 49 years
ago.
	   The new clout means President Lee Teng-hui can deal with China
from a position of increased strength by ignoring critics who have
called for more aggressive moves towards reunification as well as
those who want formal independence, said Liaw Guang-sheng, a
political science professor at National Chengchi University.
	   ``This election confirmed the Nationalist leadership and
strengthens its bargaining position,'' Liaw said early Sunday at a
seminar where experts gave their perspectives on Saturday's
elections.
	   ``Rumors that the Nationalists are falling apart or crumbling
have proved to be false,'' Liaw said. But like many election
watchers, Liaw said he was surprised by the extent of the
Nationalists' wins.
	   Voters chose Nationalist challenger Ma Ying-jeou to replace the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party incumbent Chen Shui-bian as
mayor of the capital city of Taipei.
	   Ma's victory reversed opposition gains from local elections last
year and seemed to validate the party's efforts to shake its
lingering reputation for corruption and inefficiency.
	   The Nationalists also held onto the national legislature, taking
123 of 225 seats, compared to just 70 won by the Democratic
Progressive Party.
	   The DPP consoled itself with an upset win in the major race for
the mayorship of Kaohsiung, a major city in southern Taiwan. But
the party's immediate future was cloudy, with some members already
clamoring for new leadership.
	   Defeated mayor Chen, the DPP's top politician, left Taipei on
Sunday, saying he had to visit an ill relative elsewhere on the
island. Chen declined to answer one of the big questions raised by
Saturday's results _ whether he will run for president in 16
months, when Lee is set to retire.
	   Meanwhile, DPP lawmaker Chou Po-lun called for the party's
chairman, Lin Yi-hsiung, to take responsibility for ``this terrible
defeat'' by resigning.
	   Lin said he would meet with party strategists before making any
decision.
	   The tiny New Party, a Nationalist offshoot that supports greater
efforts toward integration with China, got 11 seats. Smaller
parties and independents ended up with the remaining 21 seats.
	   The DPP consoled itself with an upset win in the major race for
the mayorship of Kaohsiung, a major city in southern Taiwan.
	   Scholars said the vote reflects a new consensus that while the
island's sovereignty can't be compromised, relations with China
must be stable and peaceful.
	   Extremes of opinion on relations toward China, which claims
Taiwan as a breakaway province, have alienated voters.
	   China and Taiwan separated after a civil war in 1949, but
Beijing still says it would meet any formal declaration of
Taiwanese independence with military force.
	   Though negotiations on reconciliation remain stalled, the sides
have taken gradual steps over the past year to renew talks that
China broke off in 1995 in anger over Taiwan's efforts to assert
itself internationally.
	   The Nationalist's performance should assure Beijing that their
familiar rivals have consolidated their power, reducing the
likelihood of having to deal directly with the DPP anytime soon,
said Ming Chu-cheng, a professor at National Taiwan University.
	   ``The leaders in Beijing could go to bed without taking an
aspirin Saturday, knowing their old friends will still be around,''
Ming said.
	   Voters also gave the Nationalists credit for keeping the economy
growing at a time when many neighboring economies are suffering
recessions brought on by the Asian economic crisis, observers said.
	   Nationalist control of the Legislature should ensure smooth
passage of measures to stimulate further growth, they said.
	   ``It's the politics of accountability,'' said Jou Sheu,
professor of diplomacy at National Chengchi University in Taipei.
``Most voters abandoned high politics for more immediate issues
like the economy.''
	   Still, Jou added: ``Moderation won the day.''

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ More than 500 candidates Sunday
vied for 50 Legislative Assembly seats in an election preceded by
contract killings, beatings of candidates and and dirty tricks by
campaigners.
	   A total of 577 names were on the ballot and observers predicted
that none of the candidates were likely to get the 51 percent of
the votes cast needed to win a seat in the assembly, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said. A second round of balloting was likely to be held
Dec. 20, it said.
	   Alexander Vishnyakov, head of Russia's Central Election
Commission, predicted that at least 25 percent of the electorate
would vote by the end of the day, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Vishnyakov, in St. Petersburg to observe the elections, said
that so far, there had been ``no serious irregularities,'' in the
balloting.
	   Preliminary election results were expected early Monday.
	   St. Petersburg, Russia's second largest city, was at the
forefront of this country's democracy movement a decade ago, but as
it headed into the elections, its politics appeared as dirty and
deadly as anywhere in Russia.
	   There have been several attacks on prominent figures, including
politicians and businessmen.
	   Last year, the city's deputy governor was gunned down on a
central St. Petersburg street. In the past two months, hitmen have
claimed the lives of a legislative aide, a high-ranking city
official and a prominent banker.
	   Last month's killing of Galina Starovoitova, the country's most
prominent female politician, drew international condemnation and
focused attention on St. Petersburg's crime problems.
	   Boris Nemtsov, the former first deputy premier, recently visited
the city and called it ``the crime capital of Russia.''
	   Unlike many cities in Russia, where the city legislature has
little power, the assembly could be quite influential. A new city
charter calls for the legislature to be a full-time body with
extensive powers.
	   Alexander Yakovlev, the city's mayor, strongly opposed the new
charter, which curtails his clout. He is not on the ballot, but
critics say he has contributed to the mean-spirited atmosphere
surrounding the election.
	   Opponents of Yakovlev have found that people with the same name
were mysteriously proposed as candidates. This has been done in an
attempt to confuse voters and take away votes from liberals.
	   In addition, anti-Semitic leaflets have been handed out asking
citizens not to vote for Jewish candidates, and one candidate's
posters were defaced with slurs against Jews.
	   There have also been multiple reports of attempts to bribe
voters.
	   St. Petersburg's 3.7 million voters seem fed up with the city's
crime and corruption, and its poor economic performance, and
election officials predicted that only 35 percent of the electorate
would turn out for Sunday's polling, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Some 5,000 police were deployed to ensure law and order during
the balloting, the news agency said. Before polls opened, police
examined 1,500 polling stations, looking for explosives or other
items that could disrupt voting, it said.

Walkout in 10th day; poll indicates millions of riders fed up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French railroad conductors' strike dragged into
its 10th day Sunday, with a new poll indicating commuters are fed
up and support President Jacques Chirac's call for minimum service
during chronic transit walkouts.
	   Despite a promise Saturday night by the Communist transport
minister to hire more ticket checkers, an estimated 4,500 employees
remained off the job and idled about 35 percent of the service.
	   Along with stranding millions of commuters in wintry weather,
the walkout was a serious blow to the state railroad SNCF, cutting
its ridership and revenue as it tries to restructure and struggles
to stem its losses.
	   The railroad's latest strike will help inflate 1998 losses to an
estimated 700 million francs (dlrs 125 million), instead of the
earlier-projected 500 million francs (dlrs 89 million), the Journal
de Dimanche reported Sunday.
	   The newspaper published a poll indicting 82 percent of those
questioned back Chirac's call Friday for minimum service during
strikes in the public sector. Only 16 percent disagreed with the
conservative president.
	   The Ifop agency survey questioned a nationally representative
sampling of 668 people. No margin of error was given, but French
polls of that magnitude usually have an error margin of plus or
minus 2-3 percent.
	   Hoping to take the wind out of the walkout, Transport Minister
Jean-Claude Gayssot said in an interview on TF-1 television
Saturday night that ``there would be an increase in the number of
conductors.'' But he provided no figures.
	   Strikers remained unimpressed, causing expected delays or
cancellations Sunday in 16 of the SNCF's 23 regions across the
country.
	   Regional express trains were to remain in full service in the
Paris area, Alsace, Brittany, Champagne-Ardenne, Picardie and
Nord-Pas-de-Calais, officials said.
	   Long-distance service was also to remain normal for the
cross-Channel Eurostar, Thalys to Brussels, and lines to
Switzerland.
	   Talks remained at a standstill, with union-management meetings
planned Monday and Tuesday that SNCF officials insisted were only
aimed at exchanging information, not negotiating.
	   The Socialist-leaning French Labor Confederation, or CFDT,
reiterated it demand for new negotiations and called for 600 new
jobs, aimed at cutting the work week.
	   The leftist government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin is facing
budget restrictions as it tries to carry out its own law aimed at
cutting the work week to 35 hours in order to spread jobs around
and fight double-digit unemployment.

Ahead of European summit, EU split on key expansion issues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Only days from a European summit, the
15 European Union governments remained divided Sunday on issues
that must be resolved before a dozen newcomers can join them in the
years ahead.
	   The EU foreign ministers began a two-day session to close a rift
on how to finance a near-doubling of the EU. That and the issue of
how fast to expand the EU will top the agenda of the two-day summit
opening in Vienna Friday.
	   Austria, which concludes its six-month EU presidency Dec. 31,
has made little progress because September elections in Germany
brought EU business to a standstill.
	   ``What we can expect from the Vienna summit is a lot of
positive, but vague language about EU expansion,'' said a European
Commission official. That would leave it to Germany, which assumes
the EU presidency Jan. 1, to clinch a deal. The main problems are:
	   _ Money:
	   Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland fear they will lose money to
finance the entry of Cyprus and 10 East European nations. But
Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden say they pay too much
already and want to freeze the EU budget, which totals 85 billion
European currency units (dlrs 100 billion) in 1998.
	   Britain negotiated an annual refund in 1984 _ when it was poorer
than today _ to offset its net payments. It refuses to give up its
rebate which totals 2.6 billion pounds (dlrs 4 billion) this year.
	   The European Commission has proposed to link EU spending to
economic growth which would add 20 billion ecu (dlrs 23.6 billion)
to the budget by 2006.
	   The budget is funded by sales taxes and membership dues from 15
member nations. They can be asked to pay up to 1.27 percent of
their annual gross national product.
	   _ Agricultural Reform:
	   Subsidies guaranteeing the EU's 10 million farmers minimum
prices eat up half of the budget. The European Commission has
proposed cuts of up to 30 percent in subsidies, which just about
every government opposes. Equally unpopular is the suggestion to
pay farmers more from national coffers.
	   _ The speed of expansion:
	   The EU is negotiating with Cyprus, Poland, Hungary, the Czech
Republic, Slovenia and Estonia but refuses to set an entry date.
	   The Netherlands, Germany, France and Italy don't want a divided
Cyprus in at all.
	   Preliminary talks have begun with Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia,
Romania and Bulgaria. The European Commission says Latvia,
Lithuania and Slovakia do so well they should join the fast-track
talks. Germany and France oppose that.
	   _ Decision-making reforms and defense:
	   Britain, for one, long rejected an EU defense machinery,
majority voting in foreign policy and ending national vetoes to
accelerate decision-making. Last week, it endorsed an EU defense
dimension but there is no deal on a slew of institutional reforms.

Thai boxing hero looks for Asian gold after ankle injury
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai boxing hero Somluck Khamsing said
Sunday he had overcome an ankle injury and he expressed confidence
of winning a second Asian Games gold medal.
	   ``It's finished now, no more problem,'' said Somluck, who won
Thailand's first Olympic gold medal in Atlanta in 1996. ``I feel
very good about my chances.''
	   Somluck was awaiting the result of the draw to see whom he would
fight in the featherweight class.
	   The Thai press has reported that he looked sluggish in training
and might have difficulty repeating his Asian Games gold medal
performance from Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994.
	   Somluck is host nation Thailand's greatest sports hero and was
chosen to carry the Asian Games torch on its final leg before
touching it to the cauldron in Sunday's opening ceremonies.

Pope says Christmas makes people feel like children again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Christmas makes old people feel like children, says
Pope John Paul II, who on Sunday told youngsters how he stays fresh
in spirit.
	   Speaking to more than 100 cheering school-age children at a
parish in an upper class Rome neighborhood, John Paul said: ``I
know why you're happy. It's because Christmas is coming.''
	   Later, to a group of adults, the 78-year-old pontiff referred to
the encounter and said that Christmas is joyful for old people,
too, because they feel ``like children again.''
	   And to the children he added: ``Stay young. If you can't with
physical strength, then with the spirit. This I feel even in my own
experience.''
	   The ailing pope, who has trouble walking and often tires during
public appearances, frequently seems invigorated by meetings with
young people. On Sunday he spoke with a strong clear voice and
seemed relaxed.

Schroeder's much-discussed job talks open Monday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder opens job
talks among lawmakers, employers and unions on Monday aimed at
finding ways to put Germany's nearly 4 million unemployed back to
work.
	   During round one of the talks, expected to last three hours,
Labor Minister Walter Riester will present a program for creating
100,000 jobs for young people. Also on the agenda is the
controversial proposal for earlier retirement, at 60, according to
government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye.
	   The so-called ``Alliance for Jobs'' among government, unions and
industry is a key project of Schroeder's government, which was
elected largely on promises to cut unemployment, now at 10.1
percent.
	   Besides Schroeder, his ministers of labor, finance and economics
will attend the talks.
	   The union side will have representatives from Federation of
German Unions; IG Metall; the chemical workers' IG Chemie; the
public sector union OeTV; and the employees' union DAG.
	   Employers will be represented by leaders of the German Industry
Association BDI; the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce; the
craftsmen's association and the employers association.
	   The next round of talks will be in February, Heye said.

Pace of inspections speeds up as more teams arrive

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The pace of U.N. weapons inspections was
likely to speed up as more teams arrived Sunday in Baghdad.
	   ``This is particularly a busy period,'' said Caroline Cross,
spokesman for the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees the
inspections.
	   She said more teams were arriving but declined to say how many.
	   U.N. officials have been saying very little about their work
since it resumed on Nov. 18 after the last crisis, apparently in an
effort to reduce tension.
	   Iraq in August and October halted the commission's inspection
work, prompting the United States and Britain to threaten military
action to force cooperation. Iraq relented on Nov. 14, and the
inspectors returned to Iraq several days later from nearby Bahrain.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before punishing trade sanctions can be lifted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
limit the sale of oil, ban air travel and bar other financial
dealings.
	   Cross said the Special Commission was determined to take
advantage of Iraq's pledge of full cooperation to get its job done
``before they pull the shutters down again, which hopefully they
won't.''
	   In an effort to show it is cooperating, Iraq's National
Monitoring Directorate, which provides escorts for the inspectors,
has been issuing daily statements on the inspectors' activities.
	   The state-run Al-Qadissiya newspaper said Sunday that although
Iraq was cooperating, it feared the U.N. inspectors were still
``collecting intelligence information on its armed forces'' to help
America plan future military strikes.
	   Iraq has long accused the inspectors of working on behalf of the
United States to prolong the sanctions.

South Korean Kang Wook-soon wins Omega PGA Championship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ South Korean Kang Wook-soon birdied the last
two holes Sunday for a 4-under-par 66 and won the U.S. dlrs 500,000
Omega PGA Championship by three strokes over Taiwan's Hsieh
Chin-sheng.
	   Kang, who also won the Hong Kong Golf Open last Sunday, became
the first player in Asian PGA history to win back-to-back events.
	   The 32-year-old South Korean, who also captured the Omega Order
of Merit title, finished on a four-round total of 17-under-par 263.
	   ``I really felt the pressure today. It was the first time I felt
nervous all week,'' Kang said. He received U.S. dlrs 80,750 for his
victory.
	   Hsieh, who was four strokes behind Kang overnight, returned a 65
Sunday over the 6,096-yard Clear Bay Golf and Country Club.
	   Two strokes behind the Taiwanese was American Eric Rustland, who
equaled the course record with an 8-under-par 62 to finish at 268.
	   Another stroke behind was Thailand's Boonchu Ruangkit, who shot
a 67.
	   China's Zhang Lianwei and American Eric Meeks were tied for 5th
place at 270. Zhang carded a 68 Sunday, while Meeks had a 65.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic can
now participate in NATO strategy planning, because all NATO member
states have approved their joining the alliance, German defense
minister Rudolf Scharping said this weekend.
	   The Netherlands early this week became the last country to
ratify NATO expansion to include the three former Warsaw Pact
nations.
	   The three are expected to join in April, as part of marking
NATO's 50th anniversary. With their membership secure, they also
can participate in planning for the NATO summit in April.
	   Scharping, ending a two-day visit, said Saturday that Poland was
well prepared to join the alliance. Germany has been a strong
advocate of Poland's access to NATO, saying it will serve European
security and stability.

New massacre by militants reported as prime minister prepares exit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: To be led after prime minister's speech, expected to begin

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Muslim militants in Algeria killed seven more
people in a mountain town west of Algiers overnight, French media
reported Sunday, as Algeria's embattled prime minister prepared his
exit ahead of early elections.
	   The attack Saturday night occurred in the town of Merad, French
radio and television said, though no further details were
immediately available.
	   If independently confirmed, the latest violence in the
petroleum-rich nation would bring to 52 the number killed in a new
wave of attacks by militants that began last Wednesday. More than
75,000 people have died in a nearly 7-year-old insurgency.
	   The violence, barely two weeks before the holy month of Ramadan,
came before a state-of-the-nation speech planned Sunday afternoon
by Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia, who was expected to announce his
resignation ahead of the elections.
	   Ouyahia has been plagued by strikes in recent weeks that have
protested the military-backed government's efforts to cut subsidies
and bailouts of a mostly state-owned economy, allowing some
companies to fail.
	   The restructuring _ forced by falling world petroleum prices and
foreign debt payments _ has thrown thousands more out of work,
compounding unemployment that officially is 30 percent. Independent
estimates put the figure much higher.
	   Meanwhile, militant attacks had ebbed in recent weeks after an
army offensive against militant strongholds over the past year. But
new violence in recent days indicate Ramadan will again prove
bloody, as it has been every year of the insurgency.
	   Ouyahia has repeatedly drawn derision for having insisted that
the insurgency had been reduced to only ``residual terrorism.''
	   Security forces have markedly stepped up their security in
recent days, setting up new roadblocks on the southern outskirts of
Algiers along highways leading into the mountains. Hospital
visitors in Algiers have been increasingly searched in recent days.
	   The latest wave of violence began early Wednesday when militants
attacked a mountain village in the Sidi Rached region 100 kms (60
miles) west of Algiers and killed a 12 people in their sleep,
official and hospital sources said.
	   The insurgency broke out in the former French colony after the
government canceled January 1992 elections the Islamic Salvation
Front was expected to win.
	   Reports of the eventual resignation of Ouyahia, in office since
January 1996, circulated since President Liamine Zeroual announced
in September that he would cut short his term.
	   Early presidential elections are set for April and Ouyahia's
name is among those circulating as potential presidential
candidates.
	   Algerian media have reported that Smail Hamdani, a senator and
former ambassador to Paris, was expected to succeed Ouyahia.

One killed in small-plane crash at Turkey's Istanbul airport

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ A small plane crashed at Istanbul
airport shortly after takeoff Sunday and caught fire, killing its
pilot and injuring the co-pilot, reports said.
	   There were no passengers on board.
	   The airport was temporarily closed for takeoffs and landings
until firefighters extinguished the blaze.
	   The plane, a privately-owned DE-30, crashed just off a runway,
hit an empty cargo container and caught fire, the Anatolia news
agency reported.
	   It was flying to the Mediterranean resort of Antalya, some 725
kilometers (435 miles) south when it headed back to the airport
after the crew reported a technical problem.
	   The cause of the crash was not known.

Report: BMW expects more resignations over Rover Group losses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: REPEATING for European wires &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ BMW expects three more top managers to
resign over the crisis in Rover Group, which could post losses this
year of 1.1 billion marks (dlrs 650 million), a news magazine
reported.
	   The Die Spiegel report, issued Saturday just days after the
resignation of Rover Group chairman Walter Hasselkus, said Rover
executives in charge of quality and finance were to leave their
posts as well as a Bayerische Motoren Werke AG executive.
	   The report, based on an interview with BMW chief Bernd
Pischetsrieder, did not identify the executives.
	   Hasselkus announced his resignation Wednesday, a week after the
company and leaders of its unions reached agreement on a plan to
trim 2,500 jobs from the current work force of 39,000. BMW hopes to
save dlrs 250 million per year due to the job cuts and the
introduction of new working practices.
	   In addition to high losses in Rover Group, BMW expects to lose
300 million marks this year in its subsidiary Rolls Royce. The BMW
brand, however, expects record profits this year of 3.3 billion
marks, according to the report.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan won the team title and the open weight
division crown on Sunday and Germany took the heavyweight title in
the amateur Sumo World Championships.
	   In the team competition, Japan beat the United States 3-0 in the
finals.
	   Keiji Tamiya, the 1998 Japanese university student champion,
pulled down Sione Pulotu and Toru Kakizoe pushed out American
Emanuel Yarbrough. Japan's Koichi Kato sent out Wayne Vierra from
behind.
	   Yarbrough is the heaviest wrestler in the tournament, having
weighed in at 300 kilograms (660 pounds).
	   Japan beat Germany 3-0 and the United States downed Poland 2-1
in the semifinals.
	   The United States won the silver medal and the bronze medal was
shared between Germany and Poland.
	   Wrestlers from 32 countries took part in the two-day
competition, the seventh annual holding of the event at Tokyo's
Ryogoku Kokugikan sumo arena.
	   In sumo, two wrestlers pair off in a ``dohyo,'' a ring outlined
on a raised mound of tightly packed dirt. The goal is to force
one's opponent out of the ring or make him touch the dirt with any
part of the body other than the soles of his feet.
	   Most matches last only a few seconds.
	   In the open division, Tamiya pulled down Mark Robinson of South
Africa to win the title.
	   Tamiya had driven out Jacek Jaracz of Poland and Robinson threw
down Fred Craig of New Zealand in the semifinals. The silver medal
went to Robinson and bronze medals were awarded to Jaracz and
Craig.
	   In the heavyweight division for wrestlers weighing more than 115
kilograms (253 pounds), Jorg Bruemmer of Germany drove out Marcos
Santana of Brazil in the semifinals and toppled Nacanieli Qerawaqa
of Fiji with an arm throw in the finals to win the title.
	   Qerawaqa bested Koichi Kato, the 1998 amateur champion from
Japan.
	   On Saturday, Savetoslav Binev of Bulgaria won the title in the
under 85 kilogram (187 pounds) lightweight division and Tatsuro
Takahama of Japan took the crown in the 115 kilogram (253-pound)
middleweight class.
	   Unlike Sunday's amateur championships, competition in
professional sumo, one of Japan's most popular sports, is not
divided into weight classes.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Pope John Paul II has extended a planned
visit to his native Poland and may address parliament while in
Warsaw, according to a weekend newspaper report.
	   The pope's trip will begin June 5 and last until June 14, one
day longer than originally planned, the daily Zycie reported
Saturday. He has added new cities to his itinerary _ Stary Sacz,
Sosnowiec and Gliwice, all in the south _ increasing his stops to
19.
	   The newspaper also said a parliament address is likely what
government spokesman Jaroslaw Selling meant when he said he
expected a ``political surprise'' during the pope's visit.
	   The trip would be John Paul's eighth to Poland since becoming
pope in 1978. During his stay, he is expected to beatify more than
100 Poles killed under Nazi occupation.
	   Warsaw will be the last leg of a tour that probably will begin
with a mass at the Baltic coast resort of Sopot. Other stops: the
coastal cities of Gdansk and Oliwa, and nearby Pelplin and Elblag;
Bydgoszcz, Torun, Elk and Wigry in the north; Lichen, Lowicz,
Siedlce and Drohiczyn in central and eastern Poland; and Krakow,
Sandomierz, Zamosc in the south.
	   The extra cities were added during a planning visit by Vatican
envoy the Rev. Roberto Tucci. Tucci leaves Poland on Saturday.

More U.N. weapons inspectors arriving in Baghdad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspections into Iraqi weapons
programs broadened with the arrival Sunday of more teams of weapons
experts in Baghdad.
	   ``This is particularly a busy period,'' said Caroline Cross,
spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees the
inspections. She said more teams were arriving Sunday but declined
to say how many.
	   In an apparent effort to limit tension, U.N. officials have been
saying very little about their work since it resumed on Nov. 18
after their latest crisis with Baghdad.
	   Iraq in August and October halted the commission's inspection
work, prompting the United States and Britain to threaten military
action to force cooperation. Iraq relented on Nov. 14, and the
inspectors returned to Iraq several days later from nearby Bahrain.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before punishing trade sanctions can be lifted.
The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, limit
the sale of oil, ban air travel and bar other financial dealings.
	   Cross said the Special Commission was determined to take
advantage of Iraq's most recent pledge of full cooperation to get
its job done ``before they pull the shutters down again, which
hopefully they won't.''
	   In an effort to show it is cooperating, Iraq's National
Monitoring Directorate, which provides escorts for the inspectors,
has been issuing daily statements on the inspectors' activities.
	   The state-run Al-Qadissiya newspaper said Sunday that although
Iraq was cooperating, it feared the U.N. inspectors were still
``collecting intelligence information on its armed forces'' to help
America plan future military strikes.
	   Iraq has long accused the inspectors of working on behalf of the
United States to prolong the sanctions.

Mandela rejects idea of blanket amnesty for rights violations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela
opposes a general amnesty for human rights violators who failed to
apply for amnesty, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   In an interview with the Sunday Independent, Mandela said that
people allegedly responsible for apartheid era killings and torture
should face criminal prosecution.
	   He is the highest official to dismiss recent suggestions that
people like his ex-wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, and Zulu
nationalist leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi should be spared
prosecution for alleged crimes.
	   Madikizela-Mandela and Buthelezi, a possible candidate for the
deputy presidency in next year's elections, were among many leaders
found culpable of human rights violations in a milestone report by
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission released in October.
	   ``Everybody must apply for amnesty as an individual,'' Mandela
was quoted as saying. ``There is no question ... of a general
amnesty and I will resist with every power that I have.''
	   Under the law that set up the human rights panel, those who did
not seek amnesty for alleged crimes must face prosecution. The
application deadline was May of last year.
	   A top prosecutor, Jan d'Oliveira, said last month that
investigations have begun into key figures including
Madikizela-Mandela, officials of the African National Congress and
two unnamed generals in the apartheid state's security apparatus.
	   Buthelezi _ who heads the Inkatha Freedom Party _ has denied the
panel's findings that he accepted backing from the security forces
of the white-minority government to wage low-scale war against
Mandela's ANC.
	   More than 5,000 people died in those clashes in KwaZulu-Natal in
the four years leading up to the first democratic elections in
1994.
	   Madikizela-Mandela has also refuted allegations she helped
torture and murder young blacks suspected of being government
spies.
	   Some political leaders warned last month that such controversial
prosecutions would derail South Africa's efforts to reconcile with
its violent past.
	   Bantu Holomisa, a former ANC politician who has started a new
party, the United Democratic Movement, predicted that violence
would return on a large scale to KwaZulu-Natal if Buthelezi were to
stand trial.
	   The Truth Commission in October released a report assigning
major blame for human rights violations to the National Party,
apartheid's architect, but it also cited black liberation groups
for excesses.
	   The report dealt with investigation into more than 30,000
reports of human rights violations. But an independent amnesty
committee is expected to take another year to consider about 2,000
remaining applications for amnesty.

Kuwaiti sentenced to life in prison for drug conviction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Egyptian court on Sunday convicted a
Kuwaiti national of trading in drugs and sentenced him to life in
prison at hard labor.
	   The Giza Criminal Court found Nasser Mohammed Hamad al-Saqar
guilty of smuggling a half kilogram (a pound) of heroin into Egypt
eight months ago. The heroin had a street value of 500,000 pounds
(dlrs 147,000).
	   Police officials said that they acted on a tip and arrested
al-Saqar at a five-star hotel in Cairo. They said he was trying to
sell the heroin, which was hidden inside a radio-cassette recorder.
	   The officials, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity,
noted that people convicted of smuggling and selling drugs in Egypt
can be sentenced to death.

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Muslim militants slashed the throats of
seven more people in a mountain town overnight, authorities said
Sunday, as Algeria's embattled prime minister prepared his exit
ahead of early elections.
	   The victims were killed ``with savagery'' Saturday night in the
town of Merad, near Tipaza, 100 kms (60 miles) west of the capital,
a brief government statement said.
	   Hospital officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
militants slashed the seven to death, and they shot and wounded
five people who tried to flee.
	   The latest violence in the petroleum-rich nation brought to 52
the number killed in a new wave of attacks by militants that began
last Wednesday. More than 75,000 people have died in a nearly
7-year-old insurgency.
	   Barely two weeks before the holy month of Ramadan, the violence
also came before a state-of-the-nation speech planned Sunday
afternoon by Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia, who was expected to
announce his resignation ahead of the elections.

Texaco chairman meets with crown prince on oil proposals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Texaco on Sunday became the first
American oil company to take advantage of Saudi Arabia's invitation
to submit plans for development of its energy resources.
	   Peter Bijur, Texaco's chairman and chief executive, put forward
his ideas in a meeting here with Crown Prince Abdullah, an oil
official said.
	   He said the Texaco chief showed Abdullah proposals for joint
ventures for both the oil and gas sectors. The official, who spoke
on condition anonymity, did not give any details.
	   Bijur, who arrived here Saturday on a four-day visit, also met
with Oil Minister Ali Naimi and head of the state-owned Saudi
ARAMCO, Abdullah Jumaa, the official said.
	   Abdullah met with senior executives from seven U.S. oil
companies during a visit to Washington in September and asked for
``recommendations and suggestions'' on ways the Americans could
contribute to the development of the kingdom's energy resources.
	   Abdullah's overture marked the first time the Saudis sought
outside participation since the kingdom nationalized its oil
industry in 1973. Since then, no foreign companies have been
involved in exploration or production in Saudi Arabia.
	   The Saudis are looking for outside investments because of
financial problems stemming from low world oil prices and growing
competition from other producers, such as Venezuela and Mexico.
	   Abdullah has been overseeing day-to-day running of the
government since 1995, when his half-brother, King Fahd, had a
stroke. Abdullah is next in line for the throne.
	   Those attending the September meeting with Abdullah included
senior executives from Mobil Corp., Exxon Corp., Texaco Inc. and
Chevron Corp. _ all partners in the Arabian American Oil Co. in the
1930s.
	   Also present were executives from Atlantic Richfield Co., Conoco
Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co.
	   Saudi Arabia has the world's largest known oil reserves _ more
than 260 billion barrels _ and the lowest extraction costs. Its oil
production at about 8 million barrels a day is second only to the
United States.

French troops set up NATO mission for Kosovo in Macedonia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Braving snow and wind, four huge French
Hercules military planes landed Sunday in Macedonia to set up a
NATO force to protect international civilians seeking to maintain
the cease-fire in neighboring Kosovo.
	   ``We are glad to be here, but I hope we have no job to do in
Kosovo,'' Lt. Col. Charles de Kersabiec, a media officer of the
initial contingent, said.
	   He arrived at the Petrovec military airport with another 30
officers and 40 tons of equipment, mostly machinery needed to
unload future transport planes.
	   In about two weeks, the force will grow up to a 1,700-man NATO
mission, led by France. The troops will include about 700 French,
350 British and 200 soldiers each from Italy, Germany and the
Netherlands.
	   They will serve as a back-up security for up to 2,000 civilian
peace officials verifying a truce in Serbia's Kosovo province,
where ethnic Albanian separatists fought bitterly against Serbian
government forces.
	   If the Kosovo peace verifiers run into trouble, the NATO
soldiers will swiftly engage in a cross-border action from
Macedonia to extract them and bring to safety. Macedonia has
agreed, somewhat reluctantly, to host the NATO force.

Britain hopeful after talks on Pan Am bombing suspects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Libya

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain said Sunday that following U.N. talks with
Libya, two Libyans suspected in the bombing of a Pan Am jet over
Lockerbie, Scotland may be in custody by Dec. 21, the 10th
anniversary of the disaster.
	   ``I think you could sum up our mood as one of qualified
optimism,'' Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a British
Broadcasting Corp. television interview.
	   But Cook said Britain will not budge on the demand by Washington
and London that the suspects must serve in a Scottish jail any
sentence passed by Scottish judges sitting at the special court in
the Netherlands.
	   In talks in a desert tent in Libya on Saturday, U.N.
Secretary-general Kofi Annan and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi
failed to make a deal on handing over the suspects. But Annan he
believed an agreement could be reached soon.
	   Cook said he spoke with Annan Sunday and was ``very encouraged
by what he tells me.''
	   Libya, the United States and Britain have agreed in principle to
the Netherlands court arrangement. But Libya wants the suspects
jailed in the Netherlands or Libya if convicted.
	   Cook said it would be a great comfort to the relatives of the
270 victims of Pan Am Flight 103 if the suspects, Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, are brought to trial by the
anniversary.
	   Annan, Cook added, succeeded in getting across to Gadhafi ``the
message that we are serious about this trial _ there is no hidden
agenda.''
	   Jim Swire, spokesman for most families of the British victims,
said Annan's meeting was important because Gadhafi has expressed
fears of a trick and complained of being left out of the
negotiations about the trial.
	   ``What he needs, I think, is reassurance that this really is an
offer of a fair trial and I can't think of anybody better than Kofi
Annan to give that reassurance,'' said Swire.

Government human rights group calls for dealing with detainees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A government human rights council on
Sunday recommended that 35 prisoners, including 30 accused of
illegal currency trading, be tried or released.
	   The recommendation was reported by the official Sudan News
Agency, which quoted Ahmed el-Mufti of the Advisory Council on
Human Rights in Sudan.
	   El-Mufti said 30 of the detainees were accused of economic
sabotage and illegal trading in hard currency, SUNA said.
	   The others have been described as ``political prisoners,'' but
el-Mufti said they had been detained ``in accordance with the
Sudanese national security law.''
	   He did not name them or say why they were in custody but said
they, too, should be tried or freed.

<TEXT>
	   ODDUCHUDDAN, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's deputy defense
minister narrowly escaped a mortar attack Sunday believed launched
by Tamil Tiger rebels at a northern town captured by government
forces two days earlier, military officers said. Four military
personnel were killed and 42 wounded.
	   Four mortar shells exploded close to Anuruddha Ratwatte, but the
deputy defense minister escaped unhurt, the military officers said
on condition of anonymity.
	   The military blamed the attack on the rebels fighting for a
separate homeland for Tamil minority, who say they are
discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese. More than 56,000
people have been killed in the 15-year-old war.
	   The guerrillas didn't immediately claim responsibility for the
attack.
	   Among the four killed was a bodyguard of Ratwatte, who is
coordinating the government's war effort against the rebels.
	   The minister visited the town on Sunday for a religious ceremony
in a Hindu temple, which also was attended by hundreds of soldiers
and civilians. Odduchuddan is a town in Mullativu district 260
kilometers (160 miles) northeast of Colombo, the Sri Lankan
capital.
	   The mortar shells landed as the minister stepped out of the
temple, the military officers said.
	   Government forces captured the town two days ago, just as they
were calling off their bloody offensive to capture a vital highway
in the northern war zone. The failed campaign cost more than 7,000
lives since May 1997.
	   Maj. Gen. Neil Dias, who led the highway offensive, sustained
minor nose injuries in Sunday's attack.
	   Ratwatte, 52, returned to the Sri Lankan capital in a
helicopter.

Kenya's Kabiga wins Fukuoka International Marathon by 6 seconds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FUKUOKA, Japan (AP) _ Jackson Kabiga of Kenya, pulling away from
Japan's Nobuyuki Sato in the final two kilometers (1.2 miles), won
the 52nd Fukuoka International Marathon by six seconds on Sunday.
	   The 22-year-old Kabiga covered the 42.195 kilometers (26 miles,
385 yards) in 2 hours, 8 minutes, 42 seconds.
	   Sato was second with a 2:08.48 finish, followed by three other
Japanese _ Tadayuki Ojima in 2:09.10, Noriaki Igarashi in 2:09.38
and Muneyuki Ojima in 2:09.50.
	   Ambesse Tolosa of Ethiopia came in sixth at 2:10.27 and fellow
countryman Moges Taye was seventh in 2:11.12.
	   Running in clear weather with temperatures of about 14 degrees
Celsius (57 F), Kabiga took the lead by pulling ahead of the
leaders group of 20 runners 11 kilometers (6.6 miles) into the
race.
	   But Sato and Ojima caught up with him after 38 kilometers (22.8
miles) and the three ran shoulder-to-shoulder for a while.
	   Sato briefly took the lead, but Kabiga spurted after 40
kilometers (24 miles) and went on to win.
	   ``I had the lead alone in the early phase because the pace was
slow,'' Kabiga said. ``But after the two Japanese runner caught up
with me, I burst back into the lead because I thought I could
win,'' he said.
	   ``I will try to work hard for a win in the Olympics'' in Sydney
in 2000, said Kabiga, whose previous best was 2:09.15.
	   A field of 117, including 14 non-Japanese, competed in the race.

KLA accuses Serbs of ambushes, seeks more withdrawals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with advance party of NATO force arriving in
Macedonia; CLARIFIES how many advance party arrived Sunday. no

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo Albanian rebels accused Serb
forces Sunday of launching unprovoked attacks in the shooting
deaths of more than a dozen ethnic Albanians in the past few days.
	   They said more Serb forces must pull back in order to avoid more
violence in the tense standoff between the two sides, which have
clashed sporadically since an October peace agreement.
	   To add muscle to that agreement, the advance party of a NATO
European military force arrived Sunday in neighboring Macedonia to
be on standby to rescue if necessary the international civilians
trying to verify compliance with the October accord.
	   The recent killings in Kosovo have heightened fears full-scale
combat may resume soon after halting two months ago when Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to a withdrawal of many forces
from the separatist Serbian province.
	   In a statement published in the ethnic Albanian newspaper Koha
Ditore, the Kosovo Liberation Army blamed the Serbs for the
escalation of violence, saying they had attacked both villages and
KLA positions despite the cease-fire.
	   The two deadliest recent shootings _ the killings of three
ethnic Albanians by unidentified assailants in Pristina and eight
KLA fighters by border guards on the Albanian border _ were Serb
ambushes, the rebels said.
	   They disputed the position of international officials that both
sides are to blame for the rising violence in Kosovo.
	   ``It is unacceptable for the international community to equate
the KLA with Serb forces'' and hold both responsible, the statement
said.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is coordinating an international monitoring mission in Kosovo,
condemned Kosovo violence last week but declined to single out
either side in the recent shootings.
	   Some 500 unarmed verifiers now patrol Kosovo daily _ a total
that is rising almost daily as the OSCE tries to put about 2,000 on
duty in the province.
	   Driving through tense villages in bright orange trucks, the
verifiers have brought a sense of added security for ethnic
Albanians even though they have no weapons.
	   ``Hopefully, the deployment of the OSCE verification mission
will create a new environment, a new atmosphere,'' ethnic Albanian
political Ibrahim Rugova said Friday.
	   In the Macedonian capital Skopje, four huge French Hercules
military planes with about 30 military officers and 40 tons of
equipment landed Sunday in driving wind and snow to set up the NATO
force to protect the civilian verifiers.
	   Over the next two weeks, the force will grow up to a 1,700-man
NATO mission, led by France. The force will include about 700
French, 350 British and 200 soldiers each from Italy, Germany and
the Netherlands.
	   If the Kosovo peace verifiers run into trouble, the NATO
soldiers will swiftly engage in a cross-border action from
Macedonia to extract them and bring to safety.
	   ``We are glad to be here, but I hope we have no job to do in
Kosovo,'' Lt. Col. Charles de Kersabiec told reporters.
	   In its statement Sunday, the KLA said it has urged international
officials to push for Serb withdrawals from several more positions.
It also said the Serbs should stop patrolling some roads for
reasons of the population's security.
	   A precise deployment of allowed Serb deployments was not
specified in the October agreement brokered by U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke.
	   The embattled southern province in Serbia, which is the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia, has a population of 2 million which
consists mostly of ethnic Albanians.
	   Serbia used force this year to try to crush separatist rebels
and keep Kosovo from seceding. Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic
Albanian civilians, were killed and as many as 300,000 were
displaced from their homes.
	   Dozens have been killed since the October agreement. In the
latest violence, the ethnic Albanians' Council for the Defense of
Human Rights said a Serb sniper killed an Albanian in his field
Saturday in Klina, 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of Pristina.

Newspaper: Government foils smuggling attempt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi authorities foiled an attempt to
smuggle a high-tech machine out of the country, the newspaper Babil
reported Sunday.
	   The paper, published by President Saddam Hussein's son Odai,
said loss of the machine would have halted production at Al-Hatten,
one of the main weapons factories run by the Military
Industrialization Commission.
	   It said the machine had an electronic control system and was
worth millions of dinars. The paper gave no other description of
the equipment.
	   The paper said that two Iraqi workers at the factory allegedly
were involved in the incident and that an investigation was under
way.
	   It did not say why the men wanted to remove the machine from
Iraq or when the alleged smuggling attempt occurred.
	   Under U.N. resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq is
required to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction. But it is
allowed to have conventional weapons.

Settlers at a loss on how to stop West Bank pullback

<TEXT>
	   SHILO, West Bank _ Fatigue lined the round, open face of settler
leader Aharon Domb after another day of meetings aimed at trying to
halt Israel's West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   But damage control has replaced idealism, and even true
believers in the right of Israelis to live in the West Bank are
talking of just preserving as much as they can.
	   Dejected, Domb said his movement has taken a body blow from a
government most settlers voted for, and has been pushed to the
fringe of Israeli politics. He said settlers are ``confused and
upset,'' but that he didn't know what to do to help.
	   Some settlers are taking action, grabbing hilltops in the West
Bank with the tacit support of the same government that signed the
agreement with the Palestinians.
	   Standing near his two-story house at the edge of the Shilo
settlement in the heart of the West Bank, Yisrael Medad pointed to
one such enclave across a valley on a hilltop. There, a few
trailers were lined up, and a portable generator providing them
with electricity whined across the empty space.
	   ``We have three families living there now,'' Medad said proudly,
adding that more hilltops were being seized.
	   Still, the 51-year-old Medad, who has lived in Shilo for 18
years, is bitter.
	   Most settlers voted for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in
1996, believing he would champion their cause. But in October,
Netanyahu signed an agreement to hand over 13 percent more of the
West Bank to the Palestinians.
	   At the same time, Netanyahu's government is encouraging
settlement expansion, granting settlers generous tax breaks and
subsidies.
	   But Domb reacted to a mention of the government's settlement
policy by slapping his forehead and emitting a long, audible sigh.
An allocation of dlrs 114 million for settlements in 1999 is
``aspirin for cancer,'' he said.
	   His gloom lifted when he talked of Sebastia, an abandoned train
station north of the West Bank town of Nablus where the religious
settlement movement scored a major victory 23 years ago.
	   At Sebastia, a youthful Domb and his comrades danced in circles
and sang ``The sons came back home'' _ a reference to the belief
that Israel's capture of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1967
Mideast war brought the Jewish people closer to redemption by
restoring the rest of the land promised to them by God.
	   In seizing Sebastia, the fledgling movement tested then-Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin's resolve not to allow settlements in the
heart of the West Bank. Rabin lost.
	   From then on, settlement after settlement was established, for a
total of 144 that are home to 176,000 Israelis today.
	   But the glory days appear to be over.
	   ``The people here are angry,'' said Ron Nachman, mayor of Ariel,
a West Bank settlement of 15,000 people living in small apartment
buildings and detached houses.
	   A member of Netanyahu's Likud Party, Nachman said that after the
Wye accord, Ariel residents had expected ``warmth'' from their
government, a visit by a minister. But no one came.
	   Sitting behind his cluttered desk, Nachman watched as the
television suspended from the ceiling showed pictures of a dozen
Palestinians attacking an Israeli car at a West Bank junction,
beating the driver and passenger and setting the car on fire.
	   Nachman picked up the phone and called a deputy Cabinet
minister. They discussed the incident in heated tones, but came up
with no solutions.
	   There will be more violence now, said Shmuel Gross, 32, who
moved to Shilo three years ago. His brother, a settler in the West
Bank town of Hebron, was stabbed to death there by a Palestinian
several years ago.
	   ``In another month or two, we'll be driving down the road and
they'll be shooting at the car,'' he warned.
	   None of this deters the settlers of Shilo.
	   Ariella Ben Eliezer, 46, a tall, angular woman wearing a long
dress and hat common to Orthodox Jewish women, set her blue eyes
determinedly. ``This land is a present from God, so we must live
here,'' she declared.
	   However, a majority of the settlers moved to the West Bank in
search of a suburban life they couldn't afford in Israel's cities.
Now, some talk openly of leaving.
	   Domb's Council of Settlements claims to represent both types of
settlers, but its leadership is made up of ideologues.
	   Their disarray following the Wye River accord was evident.
	   During the nine-day summit that led up to the agreement, the
council called settlers to block intersections. Only a few hundred
responded. A well-advertised demonstration in Tel Aviv drew about
40,000, but many were brought in by council buses.
	   Domb said demonstrations are not the proper vehicle under the
present circumstances, but he was at a loss to point to an
effective tool.
	   The veteran settler activist, gone paunchy and gray two decades
after Sebastia, acknowledged that he faced a new reality.
	   ``The `nationalist camp' has folded its flag,'' he said, ``and
now we have to muster our forces to hoist the flag again. We know
it will never be raised to the top of the flagpole. So we'll raise
it to half-staff.''

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ More than 500 candidates Sunday
vied for 50 Legislative Assembly seats in an election preceded by
contract killings, beatings of candidates and and dirty tricks by
campaigners.
	   A total of 577 names were on the ballot and observers predicted
that none of the candidates were likely to get the 51 percent of
the votes cast needed to win a seat in the assembly, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said. A second round of balloting was likely to be held
Dec. 20, it said.
	   Alexander Vishnyakov, head of Russia's Central Election
Commission, predicted that at least 25 percent of the electorate
would vote by the end of the day, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Vishnyakov, in St. Petersburg to observe the elections, said
that so far, there had been ``no serious irregularities,'' in the
balloting.
	   Preliminary election results were expected early Monday.
	   St. Petersburg, Russia's second largest city, was at the
forefront of this country's democracy movement a decade ago, but as
it headed into the elections, its politics appeared as dirty and
deadly as anywhere in Russia.
	   There have been several attacks on prominent figures, including
politicians and businessmen.
	   Last year, the city's deputy governor was gunned down on a
central St. Petersburg street. In the past two months, hitmen have
claimed the lives of a legislative aide, a high-ranking city
official and a prominent banker.
	   Last month's killing of Galina Starovoitova, the country's most
prominent female politician, drew international condemnation and
focused attention on St. Petersburg's crime problems.
	   Boris Nemtsov, the former first deputy premier, recently visited
the city and called it ``the crime capital of Russia.''
	   Unlike many cities in Russia, where the city legislature has
little power, the assembly could be quite influential. A new city
charter calls for the legislature to be a full-time body with
extensive powers.
	   Alexander Yakovlev, the city's mayor, strongly opposed the new
charter, which curtails his clout. He is not on the ballot, but
critics say he has contributed to the mean-spirited atmosphere
surrounding the election.
	   Opponents of Yakovlev have found that people with the same name
were mysteriously proposed as candidates. This has been done in an
attempt to confuse voters and take away votes from liberals.
	   In addition, anti-Semitic leaflets have been handed out asking
citizens not to vote for Jewish candidates, and one candidate's
posters were defaced with slurs against Jews.
	   There have also been multiple reports of attempts to bribe
voters.
	   St. Petersburg's 3.7 million voters seem fed up with the city's
crime and corruption, and its poor economic performance, and
election officials predicted that only 35 percent of the electorate
would turn out for Sunday's polling, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Some 5,000 police were deployed to ensure law and order during
the balloting, the news agency said. Before polls opened, police
examined 1,500 polling stations, looking for explosives or other
items that could disrupt voting, it said.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan plans to spend 2.508 trillion
pounds (dlrs 1.09 billion) during the fiscal year beginning Jan. 1,
an increase of 28 percent over this year, state-run television
said.
	   The television quoted Finance Minister Abdel-Wahab Osman as
telling Parliament on Saturday that revenues were expected to rise
nearly 24 percent to 2.192 trillion pounds (dlrs 953 million).
	   The deficit of 316 billion pounds (dlrs 137 million) will be
covered by borrowing from the banking system, he said. He predicted
the deficit would be less than 1 percent of the country's gross
domestic product.
	   The budget is to be approved by the Parliament on Dec. 19.
	   The minister promised the deputies that the salaries of
government workers would increase 27 percent, after adjustment for
inflation.

	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ The Four Seasons Hotel chain has
signed a memorandum of understanding with Saudi billionaire Prince
Alwaleed bin Talal's Kingdom Center to manage 10 floors, the
prince's office said in a statement Sunday.
	   An additional six floors of the high-rise, which is currently
under construction, was bought by the United Saudi Bank, of which
the prince is one of the major shareholders, the statement said.
	   When Alwaleed's 30-story, 300-meter (990 feet) landmark
skyscraper, is completed in the year 2000, it will be the tallest
structure in the Middle East.
	   Alwaleed is one of the world's richest men, with a fortune
estimated at more than dlrs 12 billion. He holds a 25 percent stake
in Four Seasons Hotels Inc.
	   The Kingdom Center, which got its name from Alwaleed's flagship
Kingdom Holding Co., is also expected to house the prince's
corporate headquarters and provide space for some of his other
holdings, such as a Saks Fifth Avenue store.
	    &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund is winding
up negotiations with Jordan on dlrs 600 million in loans and
donations to support economic reforms in the next three years, a
Cabinet official said Sunday.
	   Planning Minister Nabil Ammari said an agreement is expected to
be signed soon. He declined to provide other details.
	   An IMF structural adjustment program launched in 1989 ends next
February amid a downturn in the economy blamed on an unfavorable
regional environment, a faltering Middle East peace process and
turmoil in neighboring Iraq.
	   IMF support is needed to secure rescheduling of the 4.5 billion
dinars (dlrs 6.3 billion) foreign debt whose annual servicing will
top dlrs 800 million in 1999, against around dlrs 500 million now.
	   Jordan's reserves had fallen by dlrs 400 million to dlrs 1.3
billion in August from a peak dlrs 1.7 billion at the end of 1997.
	   Economic growth also fell from 2.2 percent in 1996 to 0.8
percent in 1997. Estimates for this year are even lower.
	    &UR; ___
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt is now getting about 16 percent of its
oil and 30 percent of its natural gas from fields in the Western
Desert, Oil Minister Hamdy el-Banbi was quoted Sunday as saying.
	   The English-language Egyptian Gazette quoted el-Banbi as saying
that wells in the western region were producing 130,000 barrels of
crude per day, or about 16 percent of the country's output.
	   He said natural gas production in the western region was 400
million cubic feet (12 million cubic meters) a day, or 30 percent
of gas output, the paper said.
	   He made the comments during a tour of Western Desert operations,
the paper said. He noted increased drilling operations in the area
and said several oil companies had expressed interest in further
exploration. The names of the companies were not given.
	   The sites el-Banbi visited included a Tunisian concession, where
a new well has an estimated output of 15,000 barrels per day of
crude oil and 30 million cubic feet (900,000 cubic meters) of gas,
the paper said.
	    &UR; ___
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's housing minister, Mohammed Ibrahim
Suleiman, on Sunday inaugurated a 140 million pound (dlrs 41
million) water purification station in the southern town of Kom
Ombo. The new station has a capacity of 34,000 cubic meters (1.2
million cubic feet) daily.
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted Suleiman as saying the
per capita availability of drinking water has risen to 205 liters
(217 quarts) a day from 65 liters (69 quarts) in Kom Ombo, which is
40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Aswan.
	   He said 10 major drinking water and sewerage projects are to be
built in Aswan province during the current five-year development
plan, which ends in the year 2002, at a cost of 1 billion pounds
(dlrs 294 million).

Paper: Saudi man dies of AIDS following liver transplant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A Saudi man has died of AIDS that he
apparently contracted during a liver transplant operation in
Southeast Asia, Al-Madina newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The paper said the 36-year-old man underwent a liver transplant
two years ago. The paper did not give the man's name or identify
the Southeast Asian country.
	   It was the first AIDS death reported in Saudi Arabia, where the
media is tightly controlled by the government. The strict Islamic

Iraq's Aziz in Moscow for talks on U.N compliance

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz arrived in
Moscow Sunday for talks focusing on Iraq's compliance with the U.N.
Security Council resolutions in return for the lifting of
sanctions.
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Posuvalyuk told the Interfax news
agency Sunday that Russia will reiterate the ``need for Baghdad's
carrying out the measures detailed in the pertinent resolutions.''
	   Posuvalyuk said Aziz would meet on Monday with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
	   ``Russia's task is to stave off a new crisis around Iraq, to
continue a constructive solution of all remaining questions and to
remove tension in the Gulf zone,'' Ivanov said on the eve of Aziz'
visit, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Aziz and the Russians will discuss the situation in Iraq,
``particularly in the context of a comprehensive review by the U.N.
Security Council of the fulfillment of its resolutions by
Baghdad,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement Friday.
	   Russia has staunchly opposed the use of force against Iraq,
while urging it to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors. The
Iraqi government credited Russian diplomacy for helping end
peacefully last month's crisis over U.N. inspections.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has destroyed its weapons
of mass destruction before the Security Council will lift sanctions
imposed in 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait. The sanctions limit the
sale of oil, ban air travel and bar other financial dealings.
	   Iraq has long accused the inspectors of working on behalf of the
United States to prolong the sanctions.
	   The two sides will also discuss the participation of Russian
companies in the U.S. ``oil for food'' program, Posuvalyuk said.

Former coup leader favorite to win Venezuela presidential vote

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ In presidential elections Sunday,
Venezuelans chose between a former army paratrooper who once staged
a bloody coup attempt and a Yale-educated businessman promising
peace and prosperity.
	   The ex-coup plotter was the clear favorite to win under the
latest polls.
	   Because of former Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez's meteoric rise in the
polls, the vote turned into a confrontation between rich and poor _
and a flashing red warning sign for the rest of Latin America.
	   For the first time in 40 years of democracy, neither of
Venezuela's two traditional parties fielded candidates.
	   In an effort to head off a Chavez victory, both the center-left
Democratic Action Party and the center-right COPEI Party dumped
their respective candidates during the past week and threw their
support to independent candidate Henrique Salas Romer, who was
running second in the polls.
	   In 1992, Chavez tried and failed to overthrow Venezuela's
democratically elected government. His candidacy blew a hole
through the conventional wisdom that said democracy and free
markets were inescapable in Latin America.
	   ``These are historic elections. Nothing like these elections has
happened in Venezuela's political history,'' U.S. Ambassador John
Maisto told international reporters Saturday.
	   Most polling stations opened on schedule Sunday morning, and
voting was described as peaceful and orderly. It appeared turnout
would be high.
	   privatizationprivatizationChavez's leftist Patriotic Pole
coalition, which calls for a slowing of privatization and
free-market economic reforms, already won a plurality of Congress
in Nov. 8 regional elections, breaking the two traditional parties'
40-year political stranglehold.
	   The eleventh-hour attempt by COPEI and Democratic Action to
close ranks around Salas did not appear successful. A poll taken
earlier in the week by the private Datanalisis firm showed Chavez
with a comfortable 16-point lead _ he had 53 percent support
compared to Salas's 37 percent. The survey of 1,000 likely voters
had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent.
	   Yet Salas supporters pointed out that the well-greased political
machinery of the old-style parties could bring out the vote and
enable their candidate to stage an upset victory on Sunday.
	   Until this week, Salas had taken great pains to distance himself
from Democratic Action and COPEI _ aware that most Venezuelans
blame them for squandering the world's largest oil reserves outside
the Middle East.
	   The campaign took on overtones of class warfare. Those who
oppose Salas, a former governor of industrial Carabobo state, said
he would defend the interests of the oligarchy if elected.
	   And Chavez's opponents said he is a dictator-in-waiting.
	   ``To those who call us coup leaders or tyrants, we have to
respond to them as Jesus of Nazareth: Forgive them, Lord, for they
know not what they do,'' Chavez bellowed to hundreds of thousands
of supporters at his closing rally in Caracas Wednesday night.
	   Yet Chavez's militaristic rhetoric and his trademark red
parachutist's beret, worn by his supporters at campaign rallies,
terrified middle and upper class Venezuelans, many of whom have
already fled to Miami.
	   An acute economic crisis caused by a 12-year low in oil prices
has made making ends meet all but impossible for most Venezuelans,
whose standard of living has been steadily declining for more than
15 years.
	   On Sunday, 11 million of the country's 23 million inhabitants
were eligible to vote.
	   Among the trailing candidates was former Miss Universe Irene
Saez, who had led the polls until earlier this year. Her candidacy
was badly damaged by confusion among her staff and an endorsement
by COPEI, which many people thought compromised her independence.

Ship rescues scores of immigrants tossed into sea near Malta
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A Russian merchant ship rescued some 50 clandestine
immigrants who were tossed by their smugglers into the sea in the
waters south of Malta, Italian state television reported Sunday.
	   The smugglers apparently panicked when they saw the Russian ship
approach Saturday night in the Mediterranean about 90 miles south
of the island and threw the illegal immigrants into the water, the
RAI state TV report said.
	   About 10 people were believed missing, RAI said, and officials
aboard an Italian naval vessel helping in the rescue said there was
little hope the search would find any survivors Sunday in the
rough, cold waters.
	   Most of the immigrants were from Africa. RAI showed the
survivors, some of them wrapped in blankets, getting off the
Russian ship which brought them to Valletta, Malta's main port on
Sunday.
	   The smugglers were likely taking the people to Sicily, RAI said.
	   Thousands of people try to slip into Italy illegally to seek
work or families in Western Europe. Italy's long, largely
unpatrolled coasts attract smugglers, who pull up to beaches during
the night and drop off the immigrants who have paid thousands of
dollars for the voyage.

<TEXT>
	   JERBA, Tunisia (AP) _ After meeting Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi in a desert tent, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he
thinks an arrangement for bringing two suspects to trial in the
bombing of a Pan Am airliner could be secured in the ``not too
distant future.''
	   Annan's comments came Saturday after he and Gadhafi failed to
agree on handing over Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah, who are suspected in the 1988 bombing that killed 270
people.
	   Annan spoke to reporters in the Libyan capital of Tripoli after
the meeting and later when he arrived back at this Tunisian island,
where he had begun the day of diplomacy that lasted nearly 15
hours.
	   The 60-year-old Annan is trying to get Libya to go along with a
U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects before a panel of
Scottish judges in the Netherlands for the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing
over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   ``The talks have been fruitful and positive,'' Annan said in
Tripoli. ``Libya has confirmed its seriousness and readiness to
find a solution to the Lockerbie problem.
	   ``Libya has also agreed to a trial in a third country and
believes that it ought to be possible to find answers to all other
outstanding issues,'' he said.
	   ``So I hope that in the not too distant future we will be able
to give the families good news,'' he added, referring to the
relatives of victims who have lobbied extensively for a trial.
	   On Sunday, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in an
interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. that ``I think you
could sum up our mood as one of qualified optimism.''
	   He said he spoke with Annan on Sunday and was ``very encouraged
by what he tells me.''
	   But Cook said Britain will not budge on the demand by Washington
and London that the suspects serve any sentence in a Scottish jail.
	   Annan said he was tired after arriving back in Jerba. He left
Sunday for a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a federation
of six Gulf states, which begins Monday in the United Arab
Emirates.
	   In Washington, James Foley, a State Department spokesman, said
the United States is awaiting a briefing from Annan but is
``disappointed'' that Libya has not complied with U.N. Security
Council resolutions.
	   ``Compliance means turnover of the two suspects for trial,''
Foley said. ``It's been almost 10 years since the Pan Am 103
tragedy, this has gone on for far too long.''
	   The meeting with Gadhafi took place after Libya's official news
agency, JANA, reported that Annan might not be able to meet with
the Libyan leader because Gadhafi was ``in the desert.''
	   JANA reported that Annan met with Libya's foreign minister, Omar
al-Muntasser, in Sirte, 250 miles (400 kilometers) east of Tripoli.
	   State-run Libyan Radio quoted an unnamed official in the Foreign
Liaison Secretariat, which is the equivalent of a foreign ministry,
as saying Sunday that ``a solution to this crisis is within
reach.''
	   He credited Annan's talks with al-Muntasser. The broadcast was
monitored by the BBC.

Japan's Nakajima prevents clean sweep by Thais in FIM Asia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Japan's Youichi Nakajima dominated
the final-leg of the FIM Asia Road Racing Championship Sunday at
the Johor Circuit in southern peninsular Malaysia's Pasir Gudang.
	   The Japanese rider walked away with the 250cc title, preventing
a clean sweep by the Thais. Nakajima, riding a Yamaha TZR 250,
blazed the track to romp home in 24:55.97, collecting full points
and the overall title with 95 points.
	   Malaysia's Kuan Meng Heng, who was timed at 25:02.86, came in
second and also took second in the overall standings with 76
points.
	   Nakajima attributed his success to strong team work.
	   ``When I started the race I was single-minded about winning the
race. And I am happy with the results. I owe my win to the team,''
he said.
	   The 150cc category was a Thai-dominated race with ace rider
Direk Achawong leading the way with a time of 20:36.62. He was
closely followed by teammate Christmas Wilairoj with a time of

Thai king opens Asian Games with 6,000 athletes

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In rites building from low flares
symbolizing dawn to a fiery cauldron lighting, Thailand's king
opened the Asian Games Sunday night, giving Thais some respite from
an economic crisis that once threatened the continent's
Olympic-style event.
	   King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-reigning monarch,
was upstaged slightly by Japan's Naoko Takahashi. In a marathon run
in early morning, to avoid the worst of Bangkok's tropical heat,
she won the games' first gold medal in a time just one minute off
the world record.
	   Her medal ceremony immediately preceded the official opening
festivities for two weeks of competition among 6,000 athletes from
41 nations. In all, 377 gold medals are at stake in 36 sports,
including Asian specialities such as kabaddi and sepak takraw.
	   But the king not only made the key proclamation and released the
royal pigeon, he also anointed a plaque for the Royal Main Stadium
and composed some of the music. Songs written by the king, a
talented jazz composer, were played by the Bangkok Symphony
Orchestra.
	   Thai officials who approached him at the ceremony did so on
their knees. Others greeting the king included International
Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch.
	   A cascade of fireworks in honor of his 71st birthday Saturday
and dancers who prostrated themselves on the field welcomed the
monarch to his seat in the royal box.
	   Then came the athletes, starting with Cambodia and ending with
the host Thai team. Saudi Arabia, which withdrew its team at the
last minute, was represented by only a flag bearer.
	   The Sri Lankan team was led by six dancers in bright costumes,
who delighted the crowd in the 60,000-seat stadium with acrobatic
maneuvers.
	   Each team was led by a Thai beauty queen holding its signboard.
After the parade, five of the women collapsed, and three were taken
out on stretchers.
	   A giant cauldron atop the stadium was lit by touching a torch to
a smaller cauldron inside a model of a temple, which then was
lifted on an elevator and sent an explosion of sparks into the
games' flame receptacle.
	   Outside the stadium before the ceremony, long lines of people
waited to take photos of themselves in front of a plastic statue of
the games' elephant mascot, ``Chai-yo.''
	   One, Sakchai Pungsrinon, a 30-year-old piping engineer, who paid
1,000 baht (dlrs 26) for his ceremonies ticket, said, ``Thailand
has many problems. Asia also has many problems. For two weeks,
maybe we can forget about all these problems.''
	   Several thousand people without tickets milled around outside,
waving small Thai flags and waiting for a glimpse of the king.
Security measures included bomb-sniffing dogs.
	   For the competing nations _ many sending reduced teams to ease
the pinch of the Asian crisis _ the games are a proving ground for
the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
	   ``It's not just getting a gold, it's getting a gold with a
result that is close or at world standards,'' said Li Furong,
deputy head of China's Asian Games delegation. ``The main target is
the 2000 Olympics.''
	   Sunday's focus was more on pageantry, beginning with slightly
built Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai leading off a torch relay at
9:09 a.m. (0209 GMT), reflecting popular belief that nine is a
lucky number. Bhumibol is the ninth king of the current dynasty.
	   The three-hour ceremonies featured 7,614 performers in lavishly
produced acts with the theme ``Friendship Beyond Frontiers.''
	   Performers in ancient Thai garb paraded across the field,
followed by people-drawn chariots. A martial arts display
celebrated Asian unity, and hundreds of primary school students
dressed in colorful outfits introduced the games' mascot.
	   Parts of the ceremony were built around the Indian Ramayana
epic, the basis for much of traditional Thai mythology, literature
and performing and fine arts. The field became a swirl of giant
snakes, swans, birds, angels, and other mystical creatures.
	   Another performance celebrating the unity of Asia was to cap the
show, with four large swan floats pulled to the middle of the
field, each tethered to a giant balloon symbolizing the sun, moon,
earth and a giant lotus.
	   The combined budget for the opening and closing ceremonies was
70 million baht (dlrs 1.94 million), including a large share of
donated and at-cost labor _ part of Thailand's remedy for
overcoming financial problems that hit the games.
	   In warming up the audience before the ceremonies, a Thai
comedian jested: ``If you're Saudi, raise your hand.''
	   Saudi Arabia withdrew from the games at the last minute,
throwing some of the scheduling into disarray. It cited a national
holiday and the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, but many Thais saw
the move as retaliation for the failure of Thai police to solve a
number of serious crimes against Saudi citizens.

Pope says Christmas makes people feel like children again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS one graf with other remarks by pope &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Christmas makes old people feel like children, says
Pope John Paul II, who on Sunday told youngsters how he stays fresh
in spirit.
	   Speaking to more than 100 cheering school-age children at a
parish in an upper class Rome neighborhood, John Paul said: ``I
know why you're happy. It's because Christmas is coming.''
	   Later, to a group of adults, the 78-year-old pontiff referred to
the encounter and said that Christmas is joyful for old people,
too, because they feel ``like children again.''
	   And to the children he added: ``Stay young. If you can't with
physical strength, then with the spirit. This I feel even in my own
experience.''
	   The ailing pope, who has trouble walking and often tires during
public appearances, frequently seems invigorated by meetings with
young people. On Sunday he spoke with a strong clear voice and
seemed relaxed.
	   Later, when he returned to the Vatican to address pilgrims and
tourists in St. Peter's Square, he used the image of children
continually asking ``Why'' to illustrate his appeal to adults to
press their search for truth in a world struggling to cope with
what he called a ``whirling'' flow of fast-moving news and
information.

Students protest at Acropolis against education reforms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Students gathered at the entrance of the
Acropolis Sunday to protest against education reforms which have
provoked street rallies, strikes and the occupation of hundreds of
school buildings around Greece.
	   About 40 students from technical colleges in Athens chanted
slogans and displayed large protest banners outside the ancient
site for about an hour, discouraging many tourists from entering.
	   Over 400 state schools are being occupied by children in an
attempt to pressure Education Minister Gerasimos Arsenis to abandon
reforms which will shake up courses and marking systems at schools
and universities.
	   Arsenis Sunday ruled out amending the measures, arguing that
protesting children have been ``deliberately misinformed'' by
strike-minded teachers and private night schools which help kids
cram for exams.
	   More marches and roadblocks are planned in Athens and other
cities this week, while the number of school occupations is growing
rapidly.
	   School teachers, who for years have been fighting for higher pay
and better conditions, will hold a 24-hour strike Wednesday and
will join a student street rally.

In colorful dress, athletes show off Asia's diversity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In a lavish display of Asia's rich
diversity, athletes donned colorful turbans, flowing robes and
smart suits Sunday for their moment in the spotlight at the opening
ceremony of the Asian Games.
	   Many of the most beautiful costumes were worn by athletes from
some of Asia's poorest nations in the parade around the 60,000-seat
national stadium.
	   The Mongolians wore resplendent white and blue robes with
pointed hats and horsemen's boots, reflecting the nomadic tradition
of life on the rolling steppes of their country.
	   Sri Lanka's athletes were accompanied by drummers and gyrating
dancers. India's men wore saffron yellow turbans and smart blue
blazers in a mix of modern and traditional styles. The women wore
yellow saris under blazers.
	   A small contingent of Iranian women wore light-gray Islamic
chadors. Burma's men and women wore long skirts.
	   Many of the teams, including the region's main sporting powers _
China, Japan and South Korea _ opted for suits. The North Koreans,
making their first Asian Games appearance in eight years, also wore
suits.
	   The Palestinians wore white, red, green and black track suits,
the Uzbekis wore blue, white and green.
	   Tajikistan's track-suited athletes carried an intricately woven
carpet emblazoned with the five Olympic rings spread between them.
	   Smiling women in long, colorful Thai-style dresses carrying
placards identifying the athletes' countries led the teams into the
stadium.
	   Before the opening ceremony, the athletes waited for several
hours in an adjacent stadium. During the long wait, one threw a
paper plane that flew halfway across the stadium, raising a cheer
from the others.
	   Some 6,000 athletes from 41 countries are joining in the
two-week games, Asia's equivalent of the Olympics. But organizers
reportedly allowed just 3,500 athletes and officials to attend the
opening ceremony to make space for all the delegations.

Italian press: Telecom, Murdoch near accord on digital TV
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Telecom Italia and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. are
near agreement on an Italian digital television platform, Italian
newspapers reported Sunday.
	   Quoting unidentified sources, several papers including financial
daily Il Sole-24 Ore said Telecom's new chief executive officer
Franco Bernabe was likely to lower Telecom's participation in the
planned venture to safeguard against high costs associated with it.
	   According to daily La Repubblica, Telecom, which now has a 100
percent stake in Stream digital television group, will keep a stake
of only 15-20 percent. The rest, to be held by Murdoch and French
broadcaster TF1, is not expected to be more than 49 percent,
according to reports.
	   Papers said there were still doubts about which other Italian
companies would side with Telecom in the new venture.
	   ``It's inevitable that there will be two digital platforms, both
with foreigners present,'' La Repubblica quoted Communications
Ministry undersecretary Michele Lauria as saying, ``but Italian
companies must have the majority.''
	   French pay-television network Canal Plus is also negotiating to
reduce its stake in Italian ally Telepiu from 90 percent to 45
percent, so as to allow the entry of Italian state broadcaster RAI,
cellular telephone consortium Wind and Banca Commerciale Italiana,
according to reports.

Japanese runner starts games off with near-record marathon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with games' formal opening, ceremonies &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan's Naoko Takahashi staged her own
opening ceremony for the Asian Games Sunday, winning the first gold
medal with a marathon time just one minute off the world record.
	   To avoid the worst of Bangkok's tropical heat, the women's
marathon was started at 6:30 a.m. (2330 GMT Saturday), more than 13
hours before King Bhumibol Adulyadej formally declared the opening
at ceremonies with trumpet fanfares and royal fireworks.
	   The tiny 26-year-old Japanese received her medal at the
ceremonies' stadium, 40 minutes before the start of the opening
overture. Children's games, temple bells, epic dance drama and a
symbolic dawn all figured in the rites that followed.
	   Takahashi needed just 2 hours, 21 minutes, 47 seconds to finish
the 42.195 kilometers (26 miles, 385 yards) _ 13 minutes better
than the second-place runner _ and might have gone faster if
temperatures had not started rising into the 30s Celsius (90s F).
	   After the fifth best women's marathon time ever, Takahashi said
that ``at 20 kilometers (12 miles), I didn't intend to lose the
pace but my body wouldn't keep going properly. I wasn't expecting a
world record here but it's true that I'll look back and think I
could have done much better over the last 10 kilometers (6
miles).''
	   Kenya's Tegla Loroupe set the world record of 2:20:47 in
Rotterdam this year, and her coach, Yoshio Koide, said that ``with
her ability now she can break the record any time the conditions
are good.''
	   Her time shattered the Asian record of 2:24:07 set by China's
Wang Junxia in 1993 and was far faster than the old games record of
2:29:32 set by China's Zhong Huangdi in 1994.
	   ``This race changes marathon history. I believe she is the
fastest runner in the world at the moment,'' said Shigeru So, chief
of the Japanese athletic federation's athlete development program
for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
	   Japan missed a 1-2 sweep when North Korean Kim Chang outsprinted
Tomoko Kai over the final 100 meters in the main stadium. Kim took
the silver in 2:34:55, and Kai the bronze in 2:35:01.
	   It was the North Koreans' first Asian Games medal in eight
years. They skipped the 1994 games in Hiroshima, Japan.
	   Japanese delegation leader Teruji Kogake said, ``Getting a gold
and a bronze in the very first event of the games should be an
inspiration to the others. Receiving their medals before everyone
at the opening ceremony is certain to move the others.''
	   While the women marathon racers won the first medals, they were
not the first to start action at the games.
	   The original field of 23 soccer teams has been playing for a
week to narrow the field to 16 teams for the second round, opening
Monday.
	   The survivors are Turkmenistan, South Korea, China, Lebanon,
Japan, India, Qatar, Tajikistan, the United Arab Emirates, North
Korea, Thailand, Oman, Uzbekistan, Kuwait, Iran and Kazakstan.
	   Those eliminated were Vietnam, Cambodia, Nepal, the Maldives,
Hong Kong, Mongolia and Laos.
	   Among Monday's games is a contest between archrivals South Korea
and Japan, battling both for Asian supremacy and prestige in
advance of their co-host roles for the 2002 World Cup finals. A
loss at this round robin stage would not necessarily lead to
elimination from medal contention.
	   Preliminary competition also began Sunday for snooker, making
its Asian Games debut, and tempers quickly flared over a game
between longtime Asian rivals India and Pakistan.
	   India's protests over a foul call led to a 15-minute halt to
play, and spectators attuned to the sport's strict etiquette were
aghast when Indian team members used a snooker table as a platform
to write a protest letter.
	   India's Yashin Merchant went on to defeat Pakistan's Mohammad
Saleh 5-4, and both sides' protests were thrown out because neither
paid the required dlrs 50 filing fee, officials said.
	   In all, 377 gold medals are at stake in 36 sports. Some 6,000
athletes from 41 nations are competing in Asia's version of the
Olympics, even though Asia's financial crisis has forced some
nations to curtail their entries.
	   The men's marathon is scheduled for the closing day, Dec. 20.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ One of two jaguars that escaped from their cage in
a zoo in western France fatally mauled a small boy and attacked his
father as he desperately tried to fight off the animal, officials
said Sunday.
	   Authorities were investigating how the animals escaped through a
small tunnel shortly before 3-year-old Gregoire was attacked
Saturday afternoon at the zoo in Douai-la-Fontaine, 250 kms (150
miles) southwest of Paris.
	   The boy died of his wounds and his father was hospitalized in
serious condition with wounds he suffered while battling the
jaguar.
	   Police in the small town near Saumur killed one of the animals
and captured the other, authorities said. The zoo was immediately
shut down pending the investigation.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Students gathered at the entrance of the
Acropolis Sunday to protest against education reforms which have
provoked street rallies, strikes and the occupation of hundreds of
school buildings around Greece.
	   About 40 students from technical colleges in Athens chanted
slogans and displayed large protest banners outside the ancient
site for about an hour, discouraging many tourists from entering.
	   Over 400 state schools are being occupied by children in an
attempt to pressure Education Minister Gerasimos Arsenis to abandon
reforms which will shake up courses and marking systems at schools
and universities.
	   Arsenis Sunday ruled out amending the measures, arguing that
protesting children have been ``deliberately misinformed'' by
strike-minded teachers and private night schools which help kids

	   More marches and roadblocks are planned in Athens and other

Deutsche Telekom seeks merger, plans job cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Former German telephone monopoly Deutsche
Telekom plans to trim 20,000 jobs by the year 2000 and will seek
partners for possible mergers, a company spokesman said Sunday.
	   The job cuts are part of Deutsche Telekom's efforts to balance
price cuts with market volume growth and cost-cutting measures as
the company winds up its first year in a free market.
	   Since facing competition for the first time last Jan. 1 with the
liberalization of Germany's telecommunications market to meet
European Union standards, Deutsche Telekom has slashed prices and
cut 40,000 jobs to compete with a growing number of rivals.
	   Chairman Ron Sommer, in an interview in the weekly Bild am
Sonntag newspaper, said he is concerned about the coming business
year. ``We will do everything to present our shareholders an
attractive dividend also for 1999,'' he said.
	   Sommer also said that Deutsche Telekom, which is still mostly
government owned, cannot avoid acquisitions and mergers if it hopes
to become a global player.
	   ``It will be vital for industrial giants to have a headquarters
in Germany, not just for automobiles but also for
telecommunications,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Spokesman Klaus Lissek confirmed the content of the interview,
saying that while there are no concrete plans for mergers, Telekom
must acquire new partners if it hopes to survive in the industry.

Netanyahu accuses Palestinian Authority of fomenting violence
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on
Sunday accused Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority of fomenting
violent street protests in the West Bank.
	   At least two Palestinians were injured Sunday when demonstrators
threw stones at Israeli troops outside the Jewish settlement of
Ariel in the northern West Bank, and the soldiers responded with
rubber bullets and tear gas.
	   A day earlier, 27 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers were
injured in similar clashes throughout the West Bank.
	   The protests, coupled with a hunger strike by hundreds of
Palestinian prisoners, grew out of an increasingly bitter dispute
over Palestinian prisoners to be released under the
land-for-security accord.
	   Under it, Israel is to release 750 Palestinian prisoners. It
freed 250 of them last month, but most were criminals. The
Palestinians want so-called security prisoners _ those being held
for anti-Israel activity _ to be released instead.
	   Netanyahu on Sunday demanded the Palestinian Authority stop
encouraging violent protests and instead clamp down on them.
	   ``The Palestinian Authority stands behind the inflaming of the
demonstrations and the hunger strikes,'' the prime minister said
during a Cabinet meeting, according to official minutes. ``The
Palestinians have been asked to stop the violence and incitement to
violence.''
	   Ahmed Tibi, a top aide to Arafat, denied the Palestinian
Authority had any ``work plan'' to encourage the protests.
	   The latest angry exchange on the prisoner issue came only six
days before U.S. President Bill Clinton was slated to arrive for a
three-day visit to try to help move along implementation of the
peace accord.
	   The Israeli government has threatened to hold up its promised
withdrawal from another 5 percent of the West Bank over the
dispute, but Washington has said the pullback should proceed as
scheduled.
	   Even some on the Israeli side acknowledged that steps were
needed to address Palestinian anger over the prisoners.
	   Gidon Ezra, a member of the Netanyahu's Likud party and former
deputy chief of the Shin Bet intelligence, Gidon Ezra, called on
the prime minister to release Palestinian prisoners over the age of
45 who have served at least 20 years.
	   ``We need, somehow, to show them the light at the end of the
tunnel,'' Ezra told Israel radio.
	   On other issues, Netanyahu called on Arafat to begin inviting
members of the Palestinian National Council, the Palestinian
parliament-in-exile, to next week's meeting in Gaza. Most of the
more than 500 members of the PNC live abroad.
	   At the Gaza gathering, in Clinton's presence, the Palestinians
are to reaffirm the nullification of clauses in their national
charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   Israel has also demanded that the PNC hold an actual vote rather
than simply proclaiming the charter changed, but the Palestinians
on Sunday repeated their objections to that.
	   ``They haven't the right to give us instructions,'' Arafat said
in response upon his arrival in Gaza Sunday from a European trip.
	   Meanwhile, Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian parliament,
warned of more violence if Israel continues to expand Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the Palestinians
hope to establish a future state.
	   ``If settlement activity continues, then all means of resistance
are open,'' Qureia told reporters in the West Bank town of
Ramallah.
	   Settlers have established makeshift communities on several West
Bank hilltops since the Wye accord was signed in October, in a bid
to keep the land from being turned over to the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu repeated another demand Sunday: that Arafat refrain
from threatening to unilaterally declare a Palestinian state on May
4, 1999, after the expiration of the Oslo interim peace accords.
	   The Palestinian leader has said he has a right to declare
statehood in the absence of any negotiated agreement. But he said
Saturday in Sweden that Israel and the new Palestinian entity
should co-exist ``by mutual agreement and acceptance.''

Kosovo Albanians accuse Serbs of ambushes, seek more withdrawals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with advance party of NATO force arriving in
Macedonia; CLARIFIES how many from the advance party arrived
Sunday. &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo Albanian rebels accused Serb
forces Sunday of launching unprovoked attacks in the shooting
deaths of more than a dozen ethnic Albanians in the past few days.
	   They said more Serb forces must pull back in order to avoid more
violence in the tense standoff between the two sides, which have
clashed sporadically since an October peace agreement.
	   To add muscle to that agreement, the advance party of a NATO
European military force arrived Sunday in neighboring Macedonia to
be on standby to rescue if necessary the international civilians
trying to verify compliance with the October accord.
	   The recent killings in Kosovo have heightened fears full-scale
combat may resume soon after halting two months ago when Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to a withdrawal of many forces
from the separatist Serbian province.
	   In a statement published in the ethnic Albanian newspaper Koha
Ditore, the Kosovo Liberation Army blamed the Serbs for the
escalation of violence, saying they had attacked both villages and
KLA positions despite the cease-fire.
	   The two deadliest recent shootings _ the killings of three
ethnic Albanians by unidentified assailants in Pristina and eight
KLA fighters by border guards on the Albanian border _ were Serb
ambushes, the rebels said.
	   They disputed the position of international officials that both
sides are to blame for the rising violence in Kosovo.
	   ``It is unacceptable for the international community to equate
the KLA with Serb forces'' and hold both responsible, the statement
said.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is coordinating an international monitoring mission in Kosovo,
condemned Kosovo violence last week but declined to single out
either side in the recent shootings.
	   Some 500 unarmed verifiers now patrol Kosovo daily _ a total
that is rising almost daily as the OSCE tries to put about 2,000 on
duty in the province.
	   Driving through tense villages in bright orange trucks, the
verifiers have brought a sense of added security for ethnic
Albanians even though they have no weapons.
	   ``Hopefully, the deployment of the OSCE verification mission
will create a new environment, a new atmosphere,'' ethnic Albanian
political Ibrahim Rugova said Friday.
	   In the Macedonian capital Skopje, four huge French Hercules
military planes with about 30 military officers and 40 tons of
equipment landed Sunday in driving wind and snow to set up the NATO
force to protect the civilian verifiers.
	   Over the next two weeks, the force will grow up to a 1,700-man
NATO mission, led by France. The force will include about 700
French, 350 British and 200 soldiers each from Italy, Germany and
the Netherlands.
	   If the Kosovo peace verifiers run into trouble, the NATO
soldiers will swiftly engage in a cross-border action from
Macedonia to extract them and bring to safety.
	   ``We are glad to be here, but I hope we have no job to do in
Kosovo,'' Lt. Col. Charles de Kersabiec told reporters.
	   In its statement Sunday, the KLA said it has urged international
officials to push for Serb withdrawals from several more positions.
It also said the Serbs should stop patrolling some roads.
	   Precise details of where and how remaining Serb troops can be
deployed were not specified in the October agreement with
Milosevic, brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   The embattled southern province in Serbia, which is the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia, has a population of 2 million which
consists mostly of ethnic Albanians.
	   Serbia used force this year to try to crush separatist rebels
and keep Kosovo from seceding. Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic
Albanian civilians, were killed and as many as 300,000 were
displaced from their homes.
	   Dozens have been killed since the October agreement. In the
latest violence, the ethnic Albanians' Council for the Defense of
Human Rights said a Serb sniper killed an Albanian in his field
Saturday in Klina, 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of Pristina.

New minister say Lebanese should face financial realities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ In an apparent swipe at the
reconstruction program of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, the
new finance minister said Sunday it's time cash-strapped Lebanon
live within its means.
	   ``We should not build dreams that lack some realism,'' Finance
Minister George Korom told reporters, in an apparent reference to
Hariri's multibillion program to rebuild the country after the
1975-90 civil war.
	   ``We are among those calling for Lebanon to live according to
its real capabilities,'' said Korom.
	   The change in government last week came after Hariri bowed out
in an apparent power struggle with new President Emile Lahoud,
sparking fear the reconstruction process could come to a halt.
	   The government of Hariri, a billionaire businessman, borrowed
heavily to finance huge reconstruction projects. The new government
inherited a dlrs 16 billion debt and a budget deficit of 40 percent
to 50 percent.
	   The new Cabinet has set economic reform and cleaning up
corruption in government as priorities.
	   Prime Minister Salim Hoss promised last week that reconstruction
would continue and contracts would be honored. He added, however,
that the government would exercise austerity in reconstruction
contracts and the 1999 budget.
	   Korom also said Sunday that the government also was looking to
increase revenues through tax reform and strengthening the
collection of taxes.
	   Asked about investors' fears of an end to reconstruction, new
Economy and Trade Minister Nasser Saidi said: ``There is no need to
worry.''
	   But he suggested the government may reconsider some enterprises
of low priority and delay the implementation of secondary projects.

	   JERBA, Tunisia (AP) _ After meeting Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi in a desert tent, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he
thinks an arrangement for bringing two suspects to trial in the
bombing of a Pan Am airliner could be secured in the ``not too
distant future.''
	   Annan's comments came Saturday after he and Gadhafi failed to
agree on handing over Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah, who are suspected in the 1988 bombing that killed 270
people.
	   On Sunday, state-run Libyan Radio quoted an unnamed official in
the Foreign Liaison Secretariat, which is the equivalent of a
foreign ministry, as saying that ``a solution to this crisis is
within reach.''
	   He credited Annan's talks with Omar al-Muntasser, Libya's
foreign minister, who met with Annan in Sirte before Annan went on
to talks with Gadhafi. Sirte is 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of
the Libyan capital Tripoli.
	   The official spoke of ``fruitful talks'' but gave no details.
The broadcast was monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp.
	   Also Sunday, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in an
interview with the BBC that he had spoken with Annan on Sunday and
was ``very encouraged by what he tells me.''
	   He added: ``I think you could sum up our mood as one of
qualified optimism.''
	   Britain would like to see the two suspects in custody by Dec.
21, the 10th anniversary of the Pan Am bombing.
	   But Cook said Britain will not budge on the demand by Washington
and London that the suspects serve any sentence in a Scottish jail.
Libya has asked that any prison terms be served in the Netherlands
or Libya.
	   Annan spoke to reporters in Tripoli after the meeting with
Gadhafi and later when he arrived back at this Tunisian island,
where he had begun the day of diplomacy that lasted nearly 15
hours.
	   The 60-year-old Annan is trying to get Libya to go along with a
U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects before a panel of
Scottish judges in the Netherlands for the 1988 bombing over
Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   ``The talks have been fruitful and positive,'' Annan said in
Tripoli. ``Libya has confirmed its seriousness and readiness to
find a solution to the Lockerbie problem.
	   ``Libya has also agreed to a trial in a third country and
believes that it ought to be possible to find answers to all other
outstanding issues,'' he said.
	   ``So I hope that in the not too distant future we will be able
to give the families good news,'' he added, referring to the
relatives of victims who have lobbied extensively for a trial.
	   Annan left Jerba on Sunday for the United Arab Emirates, where
he will attend a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a
federation of six Arab Gulf states.
	   In Washington, James Foley, a State Department spokesman, said
the United States is awaiting a briefing from Annan but is
``disappointed'' that Libya has not complied with U.N. Security
Council resolutions.
	   ``Compliance means turnover of the two suspects for trial,''
Foley said. ``It's been almost 10 years since the Pan Am 103
tragedy, this has gone on for far too long.''
	   The meeting with Gadhafi took place after Libya's official news
agency, JANA, reported that Annan might not be able to meet with
the Libyan leader because Gadhafi was ``in the desert.''
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Annan was taken on an hour's
trip into the desert in a four-wheel drive vehicle to meet with
Gadhafi in a tent with a roaring fire outside.
	   Earlier, Libyan media suggested that Gadhafi had no authority to
hand over the suspects _ an indication he was giving himself room
in case he decides against giving up the two men wanted by the
United States and Britain.
	   JANA indicated a decision on handing over the two suspects would
have to be approved by some 500 grassroots national committees
before being considered by the Parliament.
	   Libyan radio reported that the Parliament had been called to
meet Tuesday in Sirte but did not say whether the Lockerbie issue
would be discussed.
	   Annan flew into Libya aboard a special plane from Jerba after
receiving clearance from the U.N. Sanctions Committee. Libya has
been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its refusal to hand over
the two suspects.
	   The U.N. sanctions ban air travel in and out of the country but
do not cover oil exports, Libya's economic lifeblood.

	   PARIS (AP) _ One of two jaguars that escaped from their cage in
a zoo in western France fatally bit and mauled a small boy, then
attacked his father as he desperately tried to fight off the
animal, officials said Sunday.
	   Authorities were investigating how 3-year-old Gregoire was
attacked Saturday afternoon at the zoo in Doue-la-Fontaine, 250 kms
(150 miles) southwest of Paris.
	   Police in the small town near Saumur killed one of the two
100-kilo (200-pound) female jaguars and captured the other,
authorities said. The Zoo Doue was immediately shut down pending
the investigation.
	   ``The child didn't pass through any security zone,'' said state
prosecutor Yves Gambert told France Info radio. The jaguar went
after the boy ``the moment it came out of a small tunnel.''
	   Repeatedly bitten in the head, the boy died of his wounds and
his father was hospitalized in serious condition with mostly head
wounds he suffered while battling the jaguar.
	   The father ``acted courageously, because there wasn't much he
could do, and two other children were nearby,'' nurse Noura Oumaziz
told French television LCI.

Libya wants the suspects jailed in the Netherlands or Libya if
convicted, but the United States and Britain insist they be
imprisoned in Scotland.

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A row between President Rauf Denktash and
an opposition center-left party over the island's membership in the
European Union cast a shadow on Turkish Cypriot parliamentary
elections Sunday.
	   Some 121,000 voters were eligible to elect 50 lawmakers from
among 352 candidates fielded by seven political parties in the
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was declared by Turkish
Cypriots in 1983 and is recognized only by Turkey.
	   Results were expected on Monday.
	   On Saturday, the eve of the elections, Denktash called on voters
to support center-right parties, which have opposed Turkish
Cypriots joining in negotiations for the island's membership in the
European Union. One of the parties is run by his son, Serdar
Denktash.
	   Denktash contends Cyprus' membership in the EU would amount to
the island's integration with EU-member Greece.
	   The center-left accused Denktash of favoring his son's party.
	   ``The elections show that we exist and that we are not an
artificial state,'' Denktash said.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkey sent in troops
after a coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
	   Opinion polls indicated that Prime Minister Dervis Eroglu's
center-right party would win the largest number of seats. But it
was not clear if he would have a majority.
	   Eroglu has led the government, made up of his National Unity
Party and a Social Democrat partner, since 1996.
	   Turkish Cypriot opposition parties complain the election will be
dominated by the large number of settlers from the Turkish mainland
who have been given voting rights.
	   A recent report by the European Union Commission put the number
of recent settlers at 111,000 out of a total population of 200,000.
Opposition parties claim that about half the candidates are
settlers.
	   Denktash is seeking a non-aggression pact with Greek Cypriots,
who plan to to deploy anti-aircraft missiles on the island. Turkey
has threatened to hit missile batteries if they are deployed.
	   UN-sponsored talks for reunification of Cyprus deadlocked
following Denktash's demands for recognition of his state and the
cancellation of Greek Cyprus' talks on joining the European Union.

 &UR; Poll outcome shows ethnic reconciliation in Taiwan
 &UR; EDs: CLARIFIES difference between native Taiwanese and those from
mainland in 12th-13th grafs; EDITS thruout.
 &UR; By ANNIE HUANG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The triumph of a politician not born in
Taiwan in weekend elections shows one unwelcome cultural
undercurrent has begun to disappear _ an ethnic divide between the
island's native-born majority and those who arrived from mainland
China half a century ago.
	   ``The Taiwanese society and our voters have matured gradually,''
Ma Ying-jeou said after declaring victory in the Taipei mayoral
race shortly before midnight Saturday.
	   ``There is no longer any market for the ethnic issue. Any
candidates trying to capitalize on the issue could only incite
backfires,'' he said.
	   Before voters had their say, doubts lingered over whether Ma,
who was born to mainland immigrants but moved to Taiwan when he was
just one-year old, could defeat a popular, native-born mayor in the
capital city.
	   Ma ran for the ruling Nationalist Party, and he carried some
huge personal strengths into the campaign, a clean image, magnetic
charm and good looks _ not to mention a successful background in
government.
	   But supporters of incumbent mayor Chen Shui-bian struck some low
blows, raising questions about Ma's loyalty to Taiwan by branding
him as a pawn in a conspiracy to sell out to China.
	   Ma's party favors eventual reunification, but near the end of
the campaign Ma said he personally would go into combat with
Chinese to defend Taiwan, if necessary.
	   And the ethnic attacks didn't sit well with many voters.
	   ``The election was never about China,'' said one Ma supporter,
Lee Ya-fen, who works for a construction engineering company.
``Chen only lost votes by raising the ethnic question.''
	   Ma, a former justice minister, captured 766,000 votes, or 51
percent. He enjoyed broad support among the majority native voters
as well as minority mainland-born voters.
	   Chen comes from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party that
favors a formal declaration of independence from China _ a tactic
viewed as too risky by Taiwanese who fear China might retaliate
with a military attack.
	   After Gen. Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists were ousted from
mainland China by Mao Tse-tung's Communist forces in 1949, Chiang
fled to Taiwan with about 2 million followers, mostly soldiers and
elite members of Chinese society.
	   During his rule, Gen. Chiang prohibited the Taiwanese dialect
from being used in schools and offices, but the native culture and
way of speaking have been revived in the past decade.
	   Though there is little physical difference between mainland
Chinese and their island brethren, those from the mainland have
traditionally dominated politics, while native born Taiwanese
concentrated on running farms or businesses.
	   But during the last decade of democratic reforms carried out by
President Lee Teng-hui, the mainlanders have been largely replaced
by native Taiwanese within the government, and new tensions
emerged.
	   Several retired or ousted politicians have sought to establish
ties with mainland Chinese leaders and attacked Lee and his
followers on allegations they were covertly pushing for Taiwanese
independence.
	   During the campaign, Chen stayed away from demanding
independence as he instead took aim at Ma.
	   Newspapers said Chen's camp tried to spread the word among
voters that ``Taiwanese don't vote for Chinese.''
	   The nasty campaign drew antagonism, especially among supporters
of the tiny New Party who are mostly mainland immigrants or their
offspring. Most dumped their own longshot candidate to vote for Ma,
figuring that since they weren't going to win anyway, their best
strategy was to get rid of Chen.
	   Days before the poll, the president helped dissolve the
lingering doubts over Ma's loyalty by urging voters to accept the
mainlanders as ``New Taiwanese.''
	   Lee earlier had lamented about ``the sadness of Taiwanese'' who
first let Japanese and later mainlanders determine their fates.
Taiwan had been ruled by Japan for 50 years as a colony before it
was returned to China after World War II.
	   Lee then appealed for reconciliation ``to help us walk out of
the past shadows.''

Thousands rally in Somali capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Thousands of people demonstrated in
the Somali capital Sunday in support of the newly-established
municipal administration and its decision to snub an international
delegation.
	   On Saturday, faction leaders Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Hussein
Mohamed Aidid, former rivals who joined forces recently to set up a
municipal administration for Mogadishu, rejected an international
fact-finding delegation after it failed to arrive first in the
capital before heading to the town of Merca, 100 kilometers further
south.
	   The 23-member delegation, which included representatives of the
regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the United
Nations, the European Union, the Arab League and the ambassadors of
Egypt and Italy to Somalia, arrived in the indpendent northern
Somaliland last week.
	   The delegation, which was seeking a way of ending seven-years of
civil war in Somalia, had been slated to arrive in Mogadishu
Saturday, but landed in Merca instead, insulting Aidid and Ali
Mahdi. It was unclear why the team changed its plans.
	   Aidid said the last-minute changes were ``meant to create chaos
and divergence to the reconciliation process of Somalia,'' and
ordered the team to leave the country.
	   Ali Mahdi, who was faction leader in north Mogadishu, and Aidid,
who controlled southern Mogadishu in the formerly divided city, set
up the new joint administration in mid-October, despite dissent by
other rival faction leaders in their parts of the city.
	   After seven years of civil strife in Somalia, which have pitted
factions and clans against each other in armed conflict over
control of regions of the country, faction leaders are wary of
outside intervention.
	   On Sunday, supporters of Ali Mahdi and Aidid rallied in
Mogadishu stadium in the south of the city carrying placards
denouncing Italy and calling for the release of Hashi Ali Omar, a
Somali national indicted in Rome for the slaying of two Italian
journalists in Mogadishu in 1994.
	   The demonstrators also burned an Italian flag, while Aidid
accused Italian ambassador to Somalia Francesco Shortino of trying
to move the capital from Mogadishu to an undisclosed alternative
location.
	   Shortino was among the members of the international delegation
visiting Somalia.
	   Somalia has been at war since clan leaders collaborated in 1991
to oust President Mohamed Siad Barre, and then turned on each
other, leaving the country at war with no central government.

London-based dissident's sister detained in Saudi Arabia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ The sister of exiled Saudi dissident
Mohammad al-Massari has been detained in Saudi Arabia, an Islamic
human rights group said in a statement Sunday.
	   Suha al-Massari, 33, was taken into custody in the Red Sea port
city of Jiddah upon arrival from London last Monday, the Islamic
Observation Center said in a statement.
	   She was taken on the same day to Al-Hayer prison in the Saudi
capital Riyadh, the statement said.
	   A Saudi official confirmed the detention and said authorities
were questioning Suha al-Massari about her brother's activities in
London. The official, who spoke on customary condition of
anonymity, did not give any other details.
	   Mohammad Al-Massari heads the Committee for the Defense of
Legitimate Rights. The opposition group seeks far-reaching reforms
in conservative Saudi Arabia and sharply criticizes what it views
as widespread corruption and mismanagement by members of the ruling
Al Saud family.
	   Al-Massari said his sister was not involved in any political
activity and was in London for the past 18 months caring for his
children.
	   ``The Saudi authorities acted without thinking,'' he told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview from London. ``If they
arrested her to extract information they will be disappointed,
because she is not involved in my work.''
	   She had decided to return to Saudi Arabia to be with her family
during the holy month of Ramadan, which starts around Dec. 20, said
an official of the Islamic Observation Center. He asked that his
name not be used.
	   The center, an advocacy group for human rights for Moslems
around the world, said it had sent a letter to Saudi Arabia's Crown
Prince Abdullah saying that Suha al-Massari's arrest without charge
violated Islamic principles. The center urged Abdullah to intervene
on her behalf.
	   The group will hold a sit-in in front of the Saudi embassy in
London next Friday to protest her arrest, the official said.
	   In 1996 Saudi authorities arrested Mohammad al-Massari's son and
three brothers. It freed them eight months later.

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Several hundred opponents of President
Alexander Lukashenko gathered outside his official residence Sunday
to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
	   Although police had ordered the rally moved to another square in
the center of the city, the demonstrators went ahead with the rally
at Oktyabryskaya Square, about 200 meters (yards) from Lukashenko's
residence. There were no arrests and no reports of violence.
	   Organizers of the rally complained, however, they they were
summoned to police headquarters before the rally.
	   ``The attitude of the authorities to this rally shows that in
this country there is no power of law, but the power of force. The
human rights of life, information and law are violated in
Belarus,'' said Youri Khadyka, deputy chairman of the Popular
Front, the main opposition organization.
	   In speeches at the rally, opposition leaders complained that
Lukashenko, an authoritarian president who would like to revive the
Soviet Union, has consistently violated human rights.
	   Oleg Belyavsky, the main organizer of the protest, charged that
500 people had been unjustly arrested or beaten by authorities this
year, and that thousands of people have been politically repressed
over the past four years of Lukashenko's rule.
	   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the
U.N. General Assembly on Dec. 10, 1948.

Thai king opens Asian Games with 6,000 athletes

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ceremonies ending with fireworks &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In rites building from low flares
symbolizing dawn to a fiery cauldron lighting, Thailand's king
opened the Asian Games Sunday night, giving Thais some respite from
an economic crisis that once threatened the continent's
Olympic-style event.
	   King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-reigning monarch,
was upstaged slightly by Japan's Naoko Takahashi. In a marathon run
in early morning, to avoid the worst of Bangkok's tropical heat,
she won the games' first gold medal in a time just one minute off
the world record.
	   Her medal ceremony immediately preceded the official opening
festivities for two weeks of competition among 6,000 athletes from
41 nations. In all, 377 gold medals are at stake in 36 sports,
including Asian specialities such as kabaddi and sepak takraw.
	   But the king not only made the key proclamation and released the
royal pigeon, he also anointed a plaque for the Royal Main Stadium
and composed some of the music. Songs written by the king, a
talented jazz composer, were played by the Bangkok Symphony
Orchestra.
	   Thai officials who approached him at the ceremony did so on
their knees. Others greeting the king included International
Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch.
	   A cascade of fireworks in honor of his 71st birthday Saturday
and dancers who prostrated themselves on the field welcomed the
monarch to his seat in the royal box.
	   Then came the athletes, starting with Cambodia and ending with
the host Thai team. Saudi Arabia, which withdrew its team at the
last minute, was represented by only a flag bearer.
	   The Sri Lankan team was led by six dancers in bright costumes,
who delighted the crowd in the 60,000-seat stadium with acrobatic
maneuvers.
	   Each team was led by a Thai beauty queen holding its signboard.
After the parade, five of the women collapsed, and three were taken
out on stretchers.
	   A giant cauldron atop the stadium was lit by touching a torch to
a smaller cauldron inside a model of a temple, which then was
lifted on an elevator and sent an explosion of sparks into the
games' flame receptacle.
	   Outside the stadium before the ceremony, long lines of people
waited to take photos of themselves in front of a plastic statue of
the games' elephant mascot, ``Chai-yo.''
	   One, Sakchai Pungsrinon, a 30-year-old piping engineer, who paid
1,000 baht (dlrs 26) for his ceremonies ticket, said, ``Thailand
has many problems. Asia also has many problems. For two weeks,
maybe we can forget about all these problems.''
	   Several thousand people without tickets milled around outside,
waving small Thai flags and waiting for a glimpse of the king. They
also could watch the ceremony on a large television screen.
Security measures included bomb-sniffing dogs.
	   For the competing nations _ many sending reduced teams to ease
the pinch of the Asian crisis _ the games are a proving ground for
the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
	   ``It's not just getting a gold, it's getting a gold with a
result that is close or at world standards,'' said Li Furong,
deputy head of China's Asian Games delegation. ``The main target is
the 2000 Olympics.''
	   Sunday's focus was more on pageantry, beginning with slightly
built Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai leading off a torch relay at
9:09 a.m. (0209 GMT), reflecting popular belief that nine is a
lucky number. Bhumibol is the ninth king of the current dynasty.
	   The three-hour ceremonies featured 7,614 performers in lavishly
produced acts with the theme ``Friendship Beyond Frontiers.''
	   Performers in ancient Thai garb paraded across the field,
followed by people-drawn chariots. A martial arts display
celebrated Asian unity, and hundreds of primary school students
dressed in colorful outfits introduced the games' mascot.
	   Parts of the ceremony were built around the Indian Ramayana
epic, the basis for much of traditional Thai mythology, literature
and performing and fine arts. The field became a swirl of giant
snakes, swans, birds, angels, and other mystical creatures.
	   Another performance celebrating the unity of Asia capped the
show, with four large swan floats pulled to the middle of the
field, each tethered to a giant balloon symbolizing the sun, moon,
earth and a giant lotus.
	   Fireworks burst overhead, searchlights played across the stadium
and lasers split the darkness before the royal anthem concluded the
program.
	   The combined budget for the opening and closing ceremonies was
70 million baht (dlrs 1.94 million), including a large share of
donated and at-cost labor _ part of Thailand's remedy for
overcoming financial problems that hit the games.
	   In warming up the audience before the ceremonies, a Thai
comedian jested: ``If you're Saudi, raise your hand.''
	   Saudi Arabia withdrew from the games at the last minute,
throwing some of the scheduling into disarray. It cited a national
holiday and the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, but many Thais saw
the move as retaliation for the failure of Thai police to solve a
number of serious crimes against Saudi citizens.

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Ethnic militants hurled hand grenades
at a police station and traded gunfire with Pakistani security
forces in the southern port city of Karachi on Sunday, killing at
least one civilian and wounding two policemen.
	   Police believe the men belonged to the ethnic Muttahida Qami
Movement (MQM). The militants also set fire to more than a dozen
shops in central Liquatabad area to protest a government-run
cleanup operation by security force, the police said.
	   The violent protest spun out of control as militants hurled
grenades at a police station and sent neighboring residents
scurrying for cover. The militants set stores on fire and took over
control of the entire neighborhood, while police tried to quell the
violence, officials said.
	   The area is a stronghold of the largest MQM faction led by
exiled leader Altaf Hussein. The MQM, which claims to represent
Urdu speaking immigrants to Pakistan after 1947, is fighting for
political and economic concessions from the government.
	   Its members are heavily armed.
	   In an attempt to end the relentless violence in Karachi, Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif last month dismissed the government there,
imposed federal rule, suspended civil rights and brought in the
army to arrest and try suspected terrorists.
	   The government also brought in disarmament experts from Colombia
to help collect an estimated 11,000 illegal weapons in the city.
	   Armed men battled police throughout Sunday. They were positioned
on rooftops and in narrow lanes. Police and paramilitary rangers
surrounded the area. Residents were hunkered down inside their
homes afraid to go outside.
	   The ethnic violence in Karachi has left more than 1,000 people
dead so far this year. Sharif took the extreme measures of imposing
federal rule after a former governor, Hakim Said, was gunned down.
Sharif blamed members of Hussein's MQM group.
	   The MQM denies the charge and accuses the government of
``state-sponsored terrorism'' against its ethnic group.
	   The MQM, formerly known as the Mohajir Qami Movement, is locked
in a bloody conflict with its dissident faction known as the Haqiqi
faction.

Turkey says Syria must fulfill security obligations 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey told President Hosni Murabak, who
mediated a standoff between Turkey and Syria, that Damascus still
needs to do more before normal relations could be restored, reports
said Sunday.
	   Mubarak ended Sunday his two-day visit to Turkey aimed at
improving economic ties and discussing Turkey's strained relations
with Syria.
	   On Saturday, Mubarak forwarded a message for friendship from
Syrian President Hafez Assad which was publicly welcomed by Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel.
	   However, Demirel told Mubarak in private that Turkey was still
watching Syria to see if it would uphold a security agreement
reached in October in which Damascus pledged to end support Kurdish
rebels fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey, the Turkish
daily Radikal said.
	   Although the Kurdish rebel leader, Abdullah Ocalan, left Syria
after the deal was struck, Ankara believes that Syria has yet to
expel hundreds of Ocalan's fighters.
	   Egyptian press reported last month that Syria would not return
them to Turkey because they were considered to be Syrian citizens.
Ocalan was detained in Italy last month after he flew to Rome from
Moscow.
	   Mubarak intervened personally between Ankara and Damascus after
Turkey threatened military action against Syria unless it stopped
sheltering Turkish Kurdish rebels.
	   On Sunday, Mubarak urged closer economic cooperation in the
region.
	   ``The time is one for cooperation,'' Mubarak said at a meeting
of Turkish and Egytian businessmen.
	   Turkey and Egypt are aiming for a free trade agreement that
would more than double two-way trade to dlrs 2 billion, next year.
	   A deal for Turkey to purchase a total of 10 billion cubic meters
of natural gas is also in the offing.

New strike at state-owned Air Algerie grounds nation's only carrier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Employees at Air Algerie launched a new
strike against the state-owned carrier Sunday and grounded all its
flights, protesting restructuring plans to cut jobs and losses.
	   Air Algerie, the country's only carrier, suffered a two-week
strike in October that was suspended when management agreed to talk
with unions about the restructuring.
	   But an umbrella group of unions representing the airline's
workers called its members off the job again Sunday because it said
the company wants to shut down nearly 112 offices and lay off
``several hundred technicians.''
	   The strike was part of a wave of job actions against the
military-backed government that is struggling to cut its deficit
and pay its foreign debt. Revenues from its huge state petroleum
industry, comprising 95 percent of Algeria's export income, have
fallen due to sliding world oil prices.
	   Foreign airlines have halted serving Algeria during a nearly
7-year-old Muslim insurgency that has left more than 75,000 people
dead. Militants hijacked an Air France jetliner from Algiers to
Marseille in December 1994.

Palestinian police launch weapons-confiscation campaign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian police said Sunday they had
launched a campaign to confiscate illegal weapons, an important
provision of the new peace accord.
	   A statement by Palestinian police chief Ghazi Jabali, calling on
people to turn in their illegal arms and warning that those who did
not would be brought to trial, ran on the front pages of three
Palestinian daily newspapers.
	   In Gaza, Jabali said the police were taking steps to collect
unlicensed weapons, but would not provide any details.
	   A crackdown on illegal arms _ which are rife in the Palestinian
lands _ is one of the security pledges made by the Palestinians as
part of the U.S.-brokered Wye River accord signed in October.
	   The Palestinians say they are continuing to implement the
accord's provisions, although Israel has threatened to scrap a
promised troop pullback this month unless the Palestinians meet new
conditions.
	   In addition to collecting unlicensed guns, the Palestinians have
promised to put a legal framework in place for importing,
manufacturing, selling and possessing weapons. The United States is
to assist in this.

Chinese divers predict Asian Games gold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's women divers expect to clinch
Asian Games gold in the platform competition but could face stiff
competition from Kazakstan in the springboard.
	   ``If we make no big mistake, the gold should be ours,'' Chinese
platform diver Li Na said Sunday, on the eve of the start to the
diving competition.
	   The diminutive 14-year-old, competing in her first major
international competition, told China's state-run Xinhua News
Agency that she sees her 16-year-old teammate Cai Yuyan as her main
opponent in the platform.
	   But she acknowledged that Kazakstan's Irina Vyguzova could
challenge China in the women's three-meter springboard, Xinhua
said.
	   ``Irina is an excellent diver,'' said Li. ``If she gives her
best in the competition, she has the chance to snatch the gold away
from Chinese divers.''
	   Guo Jingjing and Yang Lan will represent China in the women's
springboard contest.

Thousands rally in Somali capital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: rewords graf 4 for clarification &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Thousands of people demonstrated in
the Somali capital Sunday in support of the newly-established
municipal administration and its decision to snub an international
delegation.
	   On Saturday, faction leaders Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Hussein
Mohamed Aidid, former rivals who joined forces recently to set up a
municipal administration for Mogadishu, rejected an international
fact-finding delegation after it failed to arrive first in the
capital before heading to the town of Merca, 100 kilometers further
south.
	   The 23-member delegation, which included representatives of the
regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the United
Nations, the European Union, the Arab League and the ambassadors of
Egypt and Italy to Somalia, arrived in the self-declared
independent northern Somaliland last week.
	   The delegation, which was seeking a way of ending seven-years of
civil war in Somalia, had been slated to arrive in Mogadishu
Saturday, but landed in Merca instead. Aidid and Ali Mahdi took
offense. It was unclear why the team changed its plans.
	   Aidid said the last-minute changes were ``meant to create chaos
and divergence to the reconciliation process of Somalia,'' and
ordered the team to leave the country.
	   Ali Mahdi, who was faction leader in north Mogadishu, and Aidid,
who controlled southern Mogadishu in the formerly divided city, set
up the new joint administration in mid-October, despite dissent by
other rival faction leaders in their parts of the city.
	   After seven years of civil strife in Somalia, which have pitted
factions and clans against each other in armed conflict over
control of regions of the country, faction leaders are wary of
outside intervention.
	   On Sunday, supporters of Ali Mahdi and Aidid rallied in
Mogadishu stadium in the south of the city carrying placards
denouncing Italy and calling for the release of Hashi Ali Omar, a
Somali national indicted in Rome for the slaying of two Italian
journalists in Mogadishu in 1994.
	   The demonstrators also burned an Italian flag, while Aidid
accused Italian ambassador to Somalia Francesco Shortino of trying
to move the capital from Mogadishu to an undisclosed alternative
location.
	   Shortino was among the members of the international delegation
visiting Somalia.
	   Somalia has been at war since clan leaders collaborated in 1991
to oust President Mohamed Siad Barre, and then turned on each
other, leaving the country at war with no central government.

Report: British asylum for Rwandan genocide suspect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A former Rwandan army officer implicated in the
murder of 22 children and young people during the 1994 massacres of
some 500,000 Rwandans has been given political asylum in Britain,
The Sunday Times reported.
	   Lt. Col. Tharcisse Muvunyi, under investigation by a U.N.
tribunal, is living on welfare with his wife and three children in
south London, is studying English at college, and has permission to
stay until 2002, the newspaper said.
	   Britain's Home Office, which handles asylum, refused to comment.
A spokeswoman, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, told
the AP that all applications for and grants of political asylum
were confidential.
	   Muvunyi is accused by the U.N. Tribunal of ordering the rounding
up of the youngsters from the Benebikira convent in the
southwestern Rwandan town of Butare on April 30, 1994.
	   Nuns had hidden the youngsters, aged between five and 22, and
most of whom had seen their parents slaughtered in the killings
organized by the Hutsi-dominated government.
	   The victims were mainly members of the Tutsi ethnic minority.
	   Sunday Times reporter Jon Swain quoted nuns still at the now
dilapidated convent as saying that soldiers burst in on the morning
of April 30.
	   Sister Marie Juvenal Mukamurama was quoted as saying that when
she demanded to know on whose authority the youngsters were being
taken, a lieutenant handed her a paper signed ``Col. Muvunyi.'' It
carried the words in French: ``Seizure of all people and suspicious
objects.''
	   The newspaper quoted Muvunyi as saying from his London home that
he was ``not aware'' of giving orders to search the convent.
	   He maintained he had tried to prevent the genocide and, in
particular, had provided a retired bishop and several priests with
a military escort through road blocks mounted by by militia
wielding machetes.
	   ``I tried to protect the religious centers,'' Muvunyi is quoted
as saying.
	   Trials of Rwandam genocide suspects are going on both in Rwandan
courts and before a U.N. tribunal in Arusha, Tanzania.
	   The Sunday Times said the tribunal had been unaware that Muvunyi
was in Britain.
	   The tribunal has 32 suspects in custody. Two have been sentenced
to life in prison, the maximum sentence the tribunal can impose.
	   Although British officials made no comment, extradition of
Muvunyi to appear before the tribunal would appear at least
possible because the U.N. body cannot impose the death sentence.
	   Britain and other European Union countries will not extradite
anyone who could be sentenced to death.
	   Rwanda's crowded jails hold 130,000 genocide suspects, most of
them Hutus.
	   So far, more than 350 people have been tried and at least 120
have been sentenced to death. Firing squads executed 22 people on
April 24.

Indian demonstrators protests the destruction of mosque six years
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Police arrested 300 opposition
demonstrators in a northern Indian city to prevent them clashing
with marching Hindu nationalists on the sixth anniversary of the
razing of an ancient mosque, Press Trust of India news agency said.
	   Armed police and anti-riot squads were on alert in cities and
towns across India on Sunday for fear of inter-religious fighting
on the anniversary. The attack in 1992 set off riots in which more
than 2,000 people were killed.
	   In the northern Hindu pilgrimage center of Varanasi, 675
kilometers (420 miles) east of New Delhi, demonstrators from the
Communist Party of India and a socialist party clashed with police
during their march to protest the mosque razing. Hindu nationalists
also marched there to remember Hindus killed by police in 1992.
	   The opposing marches both marked events surrounding the 1992
razing by Hindu nationalists of the Babri mosque in Ayodhya, 550
kilometers (350 miles) east of New Delhi.
	   In Ayodhya itself, 21 activists of the Hindu right-wing Shiv
Sena party were arrested for trying to organize a rally to honor
those who demolished the mosque. Such ``victory'' rallies by Hindus
were banned by police.
	   In Bombay, India's financial capital, a group of 150 Muslims
marched with their faces covered with black scarves to express
their hurt over the mosque's destruction.
	   The communist and socialist protesters demanded the dismissal of
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government, saying his
Bharatiya Janata Party and allies bore the blame for the mosque
demolition.
	   In day-long rallies in New Delhi, Bombay and several other
Indian cities and towns, the marchers also demanded the arrest of
three BJP leaders who have been charged in court with involvement
in the mosque razing.
	   The BJP leaders deny the charges.
	   Two of them, Interior Minister L.K. Advani and Human Resources
Development Minister M.M. Joshi, admit they were present at the
mosque razing but deny they were involved.
	   ``It is very ironic that such people are in the federal
government. They should be fired and arrested,'' said Ranjit
Abhigyan, general-secretary of the leftwing All India Student's
Association, who organized a march in New Delhi.
	   Hindu mobs razed the mosque after Hindu and Muslim leaders
failed to reconcile their rival claims to the Babri mosque. Hindu
leaders say the mosque was built by Mogul invaders in the 16th
century after destroying a temple. The site is widely believed to
be the birthplace of Ram, Hinduism's supreme god.

Netanyahu accuses Palestinian Authority of fomenting violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos expected &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on
Sunday accused Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority of fomenting
violent street protests in the West Bank.
	   At least two Palestinians were injured Sunday when demonstrators
threw stones at Israeli troops outside the Jewish settlement of
Ariel in the northern West Bank, and the soldiers responded with
rubber bullets and tear gas.
	   A day earlier, 27 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers were
injured in similar clashes throughout the West Bank.
	   The protests, coupled with a hunger strike by hundreds of
Palestinian prisoners, grew out of an increasingly bitter dispute
over Palestinian prisoners to be released under the
land-for-security accord.
	   Under it, Israel is to release 750 Palestinian prisoners. It
freed 250 of them last month, but most were criminals. The
Palestinians want so-called security prisoners _ those being held
for anti-Israel activity _ to be released instead.
	   Netanyahu on Sunday demanded the Palestinian Authority stop
encouraging violent protests and instead clamp down on them.
	   ``The Palestinian Authority stands behind the inflaming of the
demonstrations and the hunger strikes,'' the prime minister said
during a Cabinet meeting, according to official minutes. ``The
Palestinians have been asked to stop the violence and incitement to
violence.''
	   Ahmed Tibi, a top aide to Arafat, denied the Palestinian
Authority had any ``work plan'' to encourage the protests.
	   The latest angry exchange on the prisoner issue came only six
days before U.S. President Bill Clinton was slated to arrive for a
three-day visit to try to help move along implementation of the
peace accord.
	   The Israeli government has threatened to hold up its promised
withdrawal from another 5 percent of the West Bank over the
dispute, but Washington has said the pullback should proceed as
scheduled.
	   Even some on the Israeli side acknowledged that steps were
needed to address Palestinian anger over the prisoners.
	   Gidon Ezra, a member of the Netanyahu's Likud party and former
deputy chief of the Shin Bet intelligence, Gidon Ezra, called on
the prime minister to release Palestinian prisoners over the age of
45 who have served at least 20 years.
	   ``We need, somehow, to show them the light at the end of the
tunnel,'' Ezra told Israel radio.
	   On other issues, Netanyahu called on Arafat to begin inviting
members of the Palestinian National Council, the Palestinian
parliament-in-exile, to next week's meeting in Gaza. Most of the
more than 500 members of the PNC live abroad.
	   At the Gaza gathering, in Clinton's presence, the Palestinians
are to reaffirm the nullification of clauses in their national
charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   Israel has also demanded that the PNC hold an actual vote rather
than simply proclaiming the charter changed, but the Palestinians
on Sunday repeated their objections to that.
	   ``They haven't the right to give us instructions,'' Arafat said
in response upon his arrival in Gaza Sunday from a European trip.
	   Meanwhile, Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian parliament,
warned of more violence if Israel continues to expand Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the Palestinians
hope to establish a future state.
	   ``If settlement activity continues, then all means of resistance
are open,'' Qureia told reporters in the West Bank town of
Ramallah.
	   Settlers have established makeshift communities on several West
Bank hilltops since the Wye accord was signed in October, in a bid
to keep the land from being turned over to the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu repeated another demand Sunday: that Arafat refrain
from threatening to unilaterally declare a Palestinian state on May
4, 1999, after the expiration of the Oslo interim peace accords.
	   The Palestinian leader has said he has a right to declare
statehood in the absence of any negotiated agreement. But he said
Saturday in Sweden that Israel and the new Palestinian entity
should co-exist ``by mutual agreement and acceptance.''

Report: Police in Japan raid group suspected of harassing Koreans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police in central Japan have raided the offices of
a political group suspected of harassing a pro-North Korean
residents' association, a local report said Sunday.
	   The report comes as the government has ordered law enforcement
agencies to crack down on a wave of threats against ethnic Koreans
following North Korea's surprise launch of a rocket over Japan in
August.
	   The search was triggered by suspicions the group had sent
intimidating letters and razor blades to a branch of the General
Association of Korean Residents in Japan located in Gifu
prefecture, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   The home of the group's leader was also searched, Kyodo said,
citing unnamed police sources.
	   A police spokesman in Gifu, located 274 kilometers (171 miles)
west of Tokyo, was unable to confirm the report.
	   The Pro-Pyongyang association has recently complained about
receiving envelopes containing razor blades along with threatening
letters, as well as about ultra-rightists shouting slogans near
Korean schools.
	   Last month, a bottle filled with burning gasoline was thrown
onto the grounds of the association's headquarters in Tokyo. No one
was injured in the attack.
	   In October, a charred body was found after a pre-dawn fire
occurred at the association's branch office in Chiba, just east of
Tokyo. Police suspect arson.
	   The North's rocket launch, which Pyongyang claims was conducted
to put a satellite in orbit, caused an uproar in Japan, where many
were unnerved by the brash display of advanced missile technology.
	   About 640,000 Koreans live in Japan, many of whom are the
descendants of workers and conscripts brought over during Tokyo's
1910-1945 colonial rule on the Korean peninsula.
	   Ethnic Koreans in Japan often face discrimination in hiring and
marriage. Roughly 180,000 are believed to loyal to the North,
though there is no official tally.

Palestinian police launch weapons-confiscation campaign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian police said Sunday they had
launched a campaign to confiscate illegal weapons, an important
provision of the latest peace accord with the Israelis.
	   A statement by Palestinian police chief Ghazi Jabali, calling on
people to turn in their illegal arms and warning that those who did
not would be brought to trial, ran on the front pages of three
Palestinian daily newspapers.
	   In Gaza, Jabali said the police were taking steps to collect
unlicensed weapons, but would not provide any details.
	   A crackdown on illegal arms _ which are rife in the Palestinian
lands _ is one of the security pledges made by the Palestinians as
part of the U.S.-brokered Wye River accord signed in October.
	   The Palestinians say they are continuing to implement the
accord's provisions, although Israel has threatened to scrap a
promised troop pullback this month unless the Palestinians meet new
conditions.
	   In addition to collecting unlicensed guns, the Palestinians have
promised to put a legal framework in place for importing,
manufacturing, selling and possessing weapons. The United States is
to assist in this.

	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Prince Abdullah, the eldest son of
Jordan's King Hussein, handed Sunday a letter from his father to
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, Libyan radio reported.
	   It said Abdullah congratulated Gadhafi on his recovery from hip
surgery and wished him good health, the radio said, without giving
further details.
	   The report was monitored by the British Broadcasting
Corporation.
	   Gadhafi underwent surgery in July after injuring his hip,
reportedly while exercising.

Plushenko wins men's title at NHK Trophy figure skating

<TEXT>
	   SAPPORO, Japan (AP) _ Evgeny Plushenko, a 16-year-old Russian
figure skater, received his first perfect mark of 6.0 Sunday as he
took the men's singles title at the NHK Trophy, his second career
Grand Prix victory.
	   ``It was the first 6.0 I've ever received, and I know how
precious a 6.0 mark is,'' said a jubilant Plushenko. ``A perfect
6.0 is an ultimate goal for all the competitors. Yet, you know,
only a few have had the honor.''
	   Plushenko, fresh from winning in the Skate Canada four weeks
ago, started his free program with a rare quadruple toe loop-triple
toe loop combination, followed by a triple axel-triple toe loop
sequence and five more triple jumps, all in perfect execution and
style.
	   The crowd clapped along with the beat of the music midway
through his 4 1-2 minutes of performance.
	   Judges gave the rising star skater eight 5.9s and a 5.8 for
content and techniques, and a 6.0 plus six 5.9s and two 5.8s for
presentation.
	   ``It was indeed the best performance I've ever put up,'' said
Plushenko, the gold medalist in the 1996 world junior
championships.
	   For Plushenko, it wasn't his first quad-triple combination. The
world championships bronze medalist first did it in the Skate
Canada as he finished ahead of three-time world champion Elvis
Stojko of Canada, who won the silver there.
	   And the Russian skater wasn't the only one who landed a
quad-triple combination Sunday. Li Chengjiang of China did it and
placed third behind Japan's Takeshi Honda.
	   The 17-year-old Honda landed a quadruple toe loop himself, but
in a less impressive single jump. Still, he won the silver as Li
wobbled on a couple of jumps, at one point reducing an intended
triple axel-double combination to a single axel-double toe loop
sequence.
	   The quad-triple combination is so rare that only three skaters
have done it so far in international competition, according to NHK
Trophy organizers. Stojko became the first to do it at the 1997
Grand Prix Final, they said.
	   On Sunday, Honda landed a quadruple and then six perfect
triples, while Li did a quadruple toe loop-triple toe loop
combination and then three clean triples.
	   ``I'm glad I did it again,'' said Honda, referring to his first
perfect quadruple in a single jump in the preliminary for the world
championships in March. He qualified and placed 11th in the meet.
	   Li, the 19-year-old national champion of China, said he regrets
having made a few errors during his jumps.
	   ``In practice, I've done the program clean and perfect on a
number of occasions,'' he said. ``I'll have to try harder and
practice harder not to make easy mistakes.''
	   In the compulsory program on Friday, Li was second to Plushenko,
and Honda was in third place.
	   On Saturday, Tatyana Malinina of Uzbekistan won the women's
singles title, her first victory in international competition.
	   World champions Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze of
Russia won the pairs title, and Marina Anissina and Gwendal
Peizerat of France _ second in the world championships _ won in ice
dancing.
	   The NHK Trophy is the sixth and last event in the International
Skating Union's Grand Prix series. Under a points-scoring system,
the series lead to the Grand Prix Final in Russia in March, two
weeks before the world championships in Finland.

Schroeder's much-discussed job talks open Monday

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder opens job
talks Monday among lawmakers, employers and unions aimed at finding
ways to put Germany's nearly 4 million unemployed back to work.
	   Schroeder, five cabinet ministers and nine representatives of
German industrial groups and unions will participate in the first
round of talks, expected to last three hours.
	   Labor Minister Walter Riester will present a program for
creating 100,000 jobs for young people. Also on the agenda is the
controversial proposal for earlier retirement at 60, according to
government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye.
	   The so-called ``Alliance for Jobs'' among government, unions and
industry is a key project of Schroeder's government, which was
elected largely on promises to cut unemployment, now at 10.1
percent.
	   ``I hope we will have success,'' talks participant Dieter Hundt,
president of the German Industry Association BDI, was quoted as
saying in Sunday's edition of the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper.
	   Union representatives also were cautiously optimistic, mindful
that the previous government, led by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, tried
to get the three sides to cooperate for job creation with little
success.
	   ``If Alliance for Jobs doesn't work this time, the idea will be
dead,'' Dieter Schulte of the Federation of German Unions was
quoted as saying. Schulte also is attending the talks.
	   Not invited to Monday's session were medium-sized businesses,
those with no more than 500 workers andh annual sales up to 100
million marks (dlrs 59 million). This was a disappointment, group
chief Mario Ohoven was quoted as saying, considering that Germany's
medium-sized businesses employ 25 million workers.
	   Other employee groups at the talks will include the German
Chamber of Industry and Commerce, the craftsmen's association and
the employers association. On the union side: IG Metall; the
chemical workers' IG Chemie; the public sector union OeTV; and the
employees' union DAG.
	   The next round of talks will be in February.

Thousands rally in Somali capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Thousands of people demonstrated in
the Somali capital Sunday in support of the city's new coalition
government and its decision to snub an international peace
delegation.
	   On Saturday, faction leaders Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Hussein
Mohamed Aidid, former rivals who joined forces recently to set up a
municipal administration for Mogadishu, said an international
fact-finding delegation would be unwelcome.
	   The 23-member delegation, which includes representatives of the
regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the United
Nations, the European Union, the Arab League and the ambassadors of
Egypt and Italy to Somalia, arrived in the self-declared
independent northern Somaliland earlier last week.
	   The delegation, which was seeking a way of ending seven-years of
civil war in Somalia, had been slated to arrive in Mogadishu on
Saturday, but went instead to Merca, 100 kilometers (60 miles)
further south.
	   Aidid and Ali Mahdi took offense.
	   It was unclear why the team changed its plans.
	   Aidid said the last-minute changes were ``meant to create chaos
and divergence to the reconciliation process of Somalia,'' and
ordered the team to leave the country.
	   Ali Mahdi, who was faction leader in north Mogadishu, and Aidid,
who controlled southern Mogadishu in the formerly divided city, set
up the new joint administration in mid-October, despite dissent by
other rival faction leaders in their parts of the city.
	   After seven years of civil strife in Somalia, which have pitted
factions and clans against each other in armed conflict over
control of regions of the country, faction leaders are wary of
outside intervention.
	   On Sunday, supporters of Ali Mahdi and Aidid rallied in
Mogadishu stadium in the south of the city carrying placards
denouncing Italy and calling for the release of Hashi Ali Omar, a
Somali national indicted in Rome for the slaying of two Italian
journalists in Mogadishu in 1994.
	   The demonstrators also burned an Italian flag, while Aidid
accused Italian ambassador to Somalia Francesco Shortino of trying
to move the capital from Mogadishu to an undisclosed alternative
location.
	   Shortino was among the members of the international delegation
visiting Somalia.
	   Somalia has been at war since clan leaders collaborated in 1991
to oust President Mohamed Siad Barre, and then turned on each
other, leaving the country at war with no central government.

Condums distributors sponsor bicycle race to fight AIDS

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Hoping to help raise awareness about the
deadliness of AIDS, a humanitarian agency on Sunday sponsored a
bicycle race through the Kenyan capital, where infection of the
killer disease is on the rise.
	   More than 170 Kenyans took to their bicycles, hoping to win top
prize of Kenya Shillings 10,000 (dlrs 165) or one of the
diminishing nine runner up prizes while helping a good cause.
	   Promoting the use of condoms, the race was organized by the
non-governmental organization Population Services International,
which markets condoms through a mass-media social marketing
campaign at subsidized prices.
	   Trust, the condom brand supplied by PSI, sponsored the event.
	   ``We are the sole marketer of condoms here and we are trying to
educate people on how to use them,'' said Kenneth Muriuki of Trust.
	   Estimates say nearly one in four adults in Kenya are HIV
infected and that most Kenyans are not educated to the disease.
Those admitting to being an AIDS victim are often shunned from
their communities, leading many to hide their condition, experts
say.
	   PSI, which also holds seminars and other awareness-raising
campaigns, said it often uses bicycles to help broaden condom sales
to otherwise inaccessible rural areas around the country.
	   The agency said it has a sales force of 50 men on bicycles who
sell approximately 1 million subsidized condoms each month.

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ BMW expects three more top managers to
resign over the crisis in Rover Group, which could post losses this
year of 1.1 billion marks (dlrs 650 million), a news magazine
reported over the weekend.
	   The Die Spiegel report, issued Saturday just days after the
resignation of Rover Group chairman Walter Hasselkus, said Rover
executives in charge of quality and finance were to leave their
posts as well as a Bayerische Motoren Werke AG executive.
	   The report, based on an interview with BMW chief Bernd
Pischetsrieder, did not identify the executives.
	   Hasselkus announced his resignation Wednesday, a week after the
company and leaders of its unions reached agreement on a plan to
trim 2,500 jobs from the current work force of 39,000. BMW hopes to
save dlrs 250 million per year due to the job cuts and the
introduction of new working practices.
	   In addition to high losses in Rover Group, BMW expects to lose
300 million marks this year in its subsidiary Rolls Royce. The BMW
brand, however, expects record profits this year of 3.3 billion
marks (dlrs 1.9 billion), according to the report.

Newspaper report: South African cricketer investigated for rape
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's top cricket
official on Sunday confirmed that a player being considered for the
next test against West Indies was being investigated for
allegations of rape.
	   But he dismissed the allegations.
	   ``I've spoken to the cricketer concerned and I'm absolutely
certain of his innocence,'' Ali Bacher, managing director of the
United Cricket Board, told The Associated Press. ``There are
reasons why we are confident of his innocence.''
	   The Sunday Independent of Johannesburg reported the story of the
alleged rape. It cited a report in a local East London newspaper
that said the cricket player, who was unnamed, had allegedly raped
a next door neighbor. The local paper said the alleged victim had
changed her story several times, the Independent said.
	   A police spokesman _ who was also unnamed _ said the cricket
player had not been formally charged with rape since detectives
were still investigating the charges, the Sunday Independent
reported.
	   Police officials who were handling the case could not be reached
for comment.

resignation of Rover Group chairman Walter Hasselkus, said Rover
executives in charge of quality and finance were to leave their
posts as well as a Bayerische Motoren Werke AG executive.
	   The report, based on an interview with BMW chief Bernd
Pischetsrieder, did not identify the executives.
	   Hasselkus announced his resignation Wednesday, a week after the
company and leaders of its unions reached agreement on a plan to
trim 2,500 jobs from the current work force of 39,000. BMW hopes to
save dlrs 250 million per year due to the job cuts and the
introduction of new working practices.
	   In addition to high losses in Rover Group, BMW expects to lose
300 million marks this year in its subsidiary Rolls Royce. The BMW
brand, however, expects record profits this year of 3.3 billion
marks (dlrs 1.9 billion), according to the report.

<TEXT>
	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ A Russian merchant ship rescued 52
clandestine African immigrants from rough waters south of Malta,
but navy officials said Sunday there was little hope of finding
five missing people.
	   Authorities in Valletta, where the immigrants arrived Sunday,
said the immigrants had been aboard a rickety boat for two days
without food or water. They said it was unclear whether the people
had been abandoned by smugglers or set out on their own.
	   First reports said smugglers had tossed them into the sea before
fleeing when the Russian ship turned up some 90 miles south of
Malta, but it appeared that the immigrants had jumped into the sea
in hopes of being rescued when they spotted the Russians.
	   The would-be immigrants were apparently hoping originally to
reach Sicily, reports indicated.
	   Thousands of people try to slip into Italy illegally to seek
work or families in Western Europe. Italy's long, largely
unpatrolled coasts attract smugglers, who pull up to beaches during
the night and drop off the immigrants who have paid thousands of
dollars for the voyage.

British forces to stay until Iraq complies

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A Royal Air Force squadron will not leave Kuwait
until Iraq fulfills its promise to fully cooperate with United
Nations weapons inspectors, Britain's chief of the defense staff
said Sunday.
	   The United States and Britain stepped back from the brink of war
after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein promised Nov. 14 to restore
access to suspected weapons sites for U.N. inspectors.
	   ``We have decided that we are going to be here to make quite
sure that what was agreed in middle November by Saddam Hussein''
will be carried out, said Gen. Sir Charles Guthrie.
	   Guthrie, who commands Britain's air force, navy and army, was on
a one-day visit to Kuwait, his second since the oil-rich state was
liberated from a seven-month Iraqi occupation in 1991.
	   He was speaking to reporters at Ali al-Salem Air Base that hosts
12 Tornado bombers and about 400 Royal Air Force personnel who
service them.
	   There were no plans for reducing the number of aircraft, Guthrie
said. He said he did not ``wish to discuss operational plans,''
when asked if there were plans to increase the British forces in
Kuwait.
	   Guthrie said if Iraq failed to comply, London and Washington
will use force without any warning.
	   The U.N. inspectors are responsible for destroying Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction. U.N. economic sanctions imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait cannot be lifted until that mission
is completed.
	   Kuwait and Britain signed a 10-year defense agreement after the
Gulf War. Similar pacts were also concluded with the Untied States,
France and Russia.

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A Haitian-American from Boston who
returned to his home island for a vacation was shot and killed by
robbers who took his shoes, the victim's sister said Saturday.
	   Rulx ``JJ'' Damas, 33, of Boston's Dorchester section, was
killed in the attack while driving with his father and girlfriend
in the Santos area near the capital of Port-au-Prince on Thursday,
according to his sister Melissa Damas.
	   A Haitian security official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, confirmed that the killing occurred, but provided few
details.
	   Rulx Damas' girlfriend, Esther Gaugette, and his father,
Francois Damas, survived by lying on the ground and playing dead,
Ms. Damas said.
	   Gaugette described the attack in a phone call to a Boston
television station: ``I just heard somebody tap on the window. They
started breaking windows. They were shooting at the car,'' she
said. ``I thought JJ was pretending he was dead. I didn't realize
he was shot.''
	   Ms. Damas said the robbers then looted the car.
	   ``They took everything,'' she said. ``My father has diabetes.
They took his insulin, I mean, what can you do with insulin? They
took the shoes off my brother's feet.''
	   Frico Damas, the victim's brother, said that it took an
ambulance more than an hour to arrive. His father and girlfriend
have been put up in a hotel by officials with the U.S. Embassy
while they try to leave the country, she said.
	   Embassy personnel could not be reached for comment Saturday.
	   The killing comes one year and one day after Willy and Alicia
Merisier of Boston suffered the same fate when they returned to
their home island with $30,000 in cash and traveler's checks to
build a retirement home.
	   Haiti is the poorest country in the western hemisphere and the
official said police suspect robbery was the motive in both
killings.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ A small plane crashed at Istanbul
airport shortly after takeoff Sunday and caught fire, killing its
two pilots, reports said.
	   There were no passengers on board.
	   The pilot was killed instantly while his co-pilot died in a
hospital a few hours after the crash.
	   The airport was temporarily closed for takeoffs and landings
until firefighters extinguished the blaze.
	   The plane, a privately-owned DE-30, crashed just off a runway,
hit an empty cargo container and caught fire, the Anatolia news
agency reported.
	   It was flying to the Mediterranean resort of Antalya, some 725
kilometers (435 miles) south when it headed back to the airport
after the crew reported a technical problem.
	   The cause of the crash was not known.

Report: Deutsche Bank to spend more to retain Bankers Trust

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Deutsche Bank will spend more than dlrs 590
million to secure the loyalty of top managers at recently acquired
Bankers Trust, according to a news magazine report released Sunday.
	   The figure exceeds the dlrs 400 million given by Chairman Rolf
Breuer when the German bank announced its takeover of Bankers Trust
last month, Die Spiegel reported in an advance copy of this week's
edition.
	   Breuer's counterpart at Bankers Trust, Frank Newman, will
receive dlrs 10 million in a payout to remain at Deutsche Bank, the
report said.
	   A spokesman refused to comment on the amount paid to retain
Newman and said Deutsche Bank stood by its earlier statements
regarding other staff payments in the deal.
	   The dlrs 10 billion Bankers Trust takeover will make Deutsche
Bank the world's largest financial institution. With assets of more
than dlrs 800 billion, the combined bank would surpass UBS AG of
Switzerland, currently the No. 1 bank, and the recently formed
Citigroup Inc.
	   The purchase will be the largest takeover of a U.S. financial
institution by a foreign bank.

Afghan Taliban release 118 opposition prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban Islamic militia released
118 prisoners belonging to the northern-based opposition alliance,
an opposition spokesman said Sunday.
	   The prisoners were released from Pul-e-Charki jail on the
outskirts of the beleaguered capital of Kabul. While the Taliban
have said the prisoners were soldiers captured during the
relentless fighting devastating this central Asian nation, the
opposition said the freed men were all civilians.
	   ``They (prisoners) are all civilian people and none of them is a
fighter,'' said opposition spokesman Abdullah, who uses only one
name.
	   The opposition alliance and the Taliban agreed in October to
swap prisoners in a bid to reach a lasting peace agreement that
would end the fighting much of which is currently centered in
northern Afghanistan.
	   The agreement was the result of mediations by Said Jalal, a
close confidant of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah.
	   The two sides also agreed to a cease-fire, but that quickly
disintegrated into fresh fighting.
	   The Taliban militia, which controls roughly 90 percent of the
country including Kabul, is facing tough resistance from former
military chief Ahmed Shah Massood.
	   Massood was a defense minister in the ousted government of
president Burhanuddin Rabbani.
	   The Taliban are Sunni Muslims and are mostly Pashtun _ the
majority ethnic group of Afghanistan, while the opposition
comprises religious and ethnic minorities including the Shiites,
Tajiks, Hazaras and Uzbeks.

Russian lawmakers in Serbia for Kosovo fact-finding
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A delegation of Russian Duma met
Sunday with Serbian officials here in a show of support to the
government side in the ongoing Kosovo crisis.
	   Eight Russian lawmakers, headed by the vice president of Duma's
foreign affairs committee, Sergei Glotov, met with their Serbian
counterparts while on the ``fact-finding mission'' regarding the
Kosovo crisis, Tanjug news agency reported.
	   Glotov is also a member of a parliamentary group called
``anti-NATO.''
	   ``The (Russian) delegation confirmed its stand... supporting
peaceful solution of Kosovo (crisis) and for preserving territorial
integrity and sovereignty of Serbia and Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia'' Tanjug news agency reported after the delegation
visited the Serbian parliament.
	   The Russians arrived late Saturday and first attended a dinner
given in their honor by Serbian ultranationalist vice-premier,
Vojislav Seselj, who said then ``regardless of all blackmail and
ultimatum by the United States of America and its followers, Serbia
will succeed in defending every step of its territory.''
	   Seselj was referring to U.S. pressure on Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to halt his crackdown on ethnic Albanian
separatists in Kosovo and grant them a substantial autonomy.
	   ``We want to take a closer look at problems in solving relations
between ethnic communities and see what prevents the leader of
Kosovo Albanians, Ibrahim Rugova... to start a dialogue on solving
Kosovo crisis peacefully,'' Glotov was quoted as saying.
	   Milosevic's authorities have rejected a US plan granting a broad
autonomy to Kosovo fearing it would lead to secession of the
province. Ethnic Albanians openly demand the independence and have
declined government offers for direct talks as well as a Serb
proposal for Kosovo autonomy.
	   Kosovo is within Serbia which, together with Montenegro, forms
present-day Yugoslav federation.
	   A statement from Seselj's Serbian Radical Party said the meeting
with the Duma delegation also discussed an idea for closer ties and
possibly a formal alliance of Russia, Belarus and Yugoslavia,
apparently in the spirit of common Slavic roots, Orthodox religion
and common distrust to West and NATO.
	   The four-day Russian visit is to continue Monday with meetings
in Kosovo with ethnic Albanian leaders.

Ahonen win ends Schmitt winning streak and own runner-up streak
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHAMONIX, France (AP) _ Reigning world champion Janne Ahonen of
Finland brought an end to Martin Schmitt's winning streak Sunday,
clinching the season's fourth World Cup ski jumping event.
	   The victory also ended Ahonen's own string of runnerup finishes,
the 21-year-old placing second behind Schmitt in the three other
World Cup events this season.
	   It was consistency which earned Ahonen the win on the 95-meter
hill, the Finn jumping 98 and 97.5 meters for a total of 248
points, beating out double Olympic champion Kazuyoshi Funaki of
Japan by a solid 4.5 points.
	   For Funaki it was another frustrating day, the Japanese
finishing a disappointing third in Saturday's competition despite
breaking the hill record in his initial jump.
	   Once more it was Funaki's second jump which cost him the
victory.
	   The Japanese again executed a stellar opening effort, soaring
100.5 meters, earning him near-perfect style marks of 20 from two
judges and 19.5 from three others to take the lead.
	   But a weaker jump of 94.5 meters in the second round left Funaki
with a total of 243.5, and a 12th career win out of reach.
	   Schmitt, who won both K120 events in Lillehammer, Norway last
week and Saturday's K95, settled for third with jumps of 99.5 and
95 and 240.5 points.
	   Second after the first round, Olympic bronze medallist Masahiko
Harada slipped to fourth with 240 points after a feeble second
jump.
	   A solid performance in the second leg boosted Finland's Mika
Laitinen from seventh to fifth with 225.5.
	   Noriaki Kasai of Japan and Norway's Morten Aagheim tied for
sixth with 225.
	   Schmitt remains atop the standings table with 360, with Ahonan
closing the gap, just 20 points behind.
	   Funaki, the normal hill Olympic silver medallist in Nagano, sits
third with 250, followed by world jumior champion Wolfgang Loitzl
of Austria, fourth with 137.

Thai king opens Asian Games with 6,000 athletes

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In rites building from low flares
symbolizing dawn to a fiery cauldron lighting, Thailand's king
opened the Asian Games Sunday night, giving Thais some respite from
an economic crisis that once threatened the continent's
Olympic-style event.
	   King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-reigning monarch,
was upstaged slightly by Japan's Naoko Takahashi. In a marathon run
in early morning, to avoid the worst of Bangkok's tropical heat,
she won the games' first gold medal in a time just one minute off
the world record.
	   Her medal ceremony immediately preceded the official opening
festivities for two weeks of competition among 6,000 athletes from
41 nations. In all, 377 gold medals are at stake in 36 sports,
including Asian specialities such as kabaddi and sepak takraw.
	   But the king not only made the key proclamation and released the
royal pigeon, he also anointed a plaque for the Royal Main Stadium
and composed some of the music. Songs written by the king, a
talented jazz composer, were played by the Bangkok Symphony
Orchestra.
	   Thai officials who approached him at the ceremony did so on
their knees. Others greeting the king included International
Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch.
	   A cascade of fireworks in honor of his 71st birthday Saturday
and dancers who prostrated themselves on the field welcomed the
monarch to his seat in the royal box.
	   Then came the athletes, starting with Cambodia and ending with
the host Thai team. Saudi Arabia, which withdrew its team at the
last minute, was represented by only a flag bearer.
	   The Sri Lankan team was led by six dancers in bright costumes,
who delighted the crowd in the 60,000-seat stadium with acrobatic
maneuvers.
	   Each team was led by a Thai beauty queen holding its signboard.
After the parade, five of the women collapsed, and three were taken
out on stretchers. Nurses at the stadium said later that all were
treated and sent home. They said at least another 15 performers in
the ceremonies also suffered heat exhaustion, and at least one was
sent to a hospital by ambulance.

Report: British asylum for Rwandan genocide suspect
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Graf 5, CORRECTS to read Hutu-dominated, sted Hutsi; 10th
graf, deletes duplicated word `by' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A former Rwandan army officer implicated in the
murder of 22 children and young people during the 1994 massacres of
some 500,000 Rwandans has been given political asylum in Britain,
The Sunday Times reported.
	   Lt. Col. Tharcisse Muvunyi, under investigation by a U.N.
tribunal, is living on welfare with his wife and three children in
south London, is studying English at college, and has permission to
stay until 2002, the newspaper said.
	   Britain's Home Office, which handles asylum, refused to comment.
A spokeswoman, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, told
the AP that all applications for and grants of political asylum
were confidential.
	   Muvunyi is accused by the U.N. Tribunal of ordering the rounding
up of the youngsters from the Benebikira convent in the
southwestern Rwandan town of Butare on April 30, 1994.
	   Nuns had hidden the youngsters, aged between five and 22, and
most of whom had seen their parents slaughtered in the killings
organized by the Hutsi-dominated government.
	   The victims were mainly members of the Tutsi ethnic minority.
	   Sunday Times reporter Jon Swain quoted nuns still at the now
dilapidated convent as saying that soldiers burst in on the morning
of April 30.
	   Sister Marie Juvenal Mukamurama was quoted as saying that when
she demanded to know on whose authority the youngsters were being
taken, a lieutenant handed her a paper signed ``Col. Muvunyi.'' It
carried the words in French: ``Seizure of all people and suspicious
objects.''
	   The newspaper quoted Muvunyi as saying from his London home that
he was ``not aware'' of giving orders to search the convent.
	   He maintained he had tried to prevent the genocide and, in
particular, had provided a retired bishop and several priests with
a military escort through road blocks mounted by by militia
wielding machetes.
	   ``I tried to protect the religious centers,'' Muvunyi is quoted
as saying.
	   Trials of Rwandam genocide suspects are going on both in Rwandan
courts and before a U.N. tribunal in Arusha, Tanzania.
	   The Sunday Times said the tribunal had been unaware that Muvunyi
was in Britain.
	   The tribunal has 32 suspects in custody. Two have been sentenced
to life in prison, the maximum sentence the tribunal can impose.
	   Although British officials made no comment, extradition of
Muvunyi to appear before the tribunal would appear at least
possible because the U.N. body cannot impose the death sentence.
	   Britain and other European Union countries will not extradite
anyone who could be sentenced to death.
	   Rwanda's crowded jails hold 130,000 genocide suspects, most of
them Hutus.
	   So far, more than 350 people have been tried and at least 120
have been sentenced to death. Firing squads executed 22 people on
April 24.

Japanese runner starts games off with near-record marathon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Thai hope in snooker losing, graf 20 &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan's Naoko Takahashi staged her own
opening ceremony for the Asian Games Sunday, winning the first gold
medal with a marathon time just one minute off the world record.
	   To avoid the worst of Bangkok's tropical heat, the women's
marathon was started at 6:30 a.m. (2330 GMT Saturday), more than 13
hours before King Bhumibol Adulyadej formally declared the opening
at ceremonies with trumpet fanfares and royal fireworks.
	   The tiny 26-year-old Japanese received her medal at the
ceremonies' stadium, 40 minutes before the start of the opening
overture. Children's games, temple bells, epic dance drama and a
symbolic dawn all figured in the rites that followed.
	   Takahashi needed just 2 hours, 21 minutes, 47 seconds to finish
the 42.195 kilometers (26 miles, 385 yards) _ 13 minutes better
than the second-place runner _ and might have gone faster if
temperatures had not started rising into the 30s Celsius (90s F).
	   After the fifth best women's marathon time ever, Takahashi said
that ``at 20 kilometers (12 miles), I didn't intend to lose the
pace but my body wouldn't keep going properly. I wasn't expecting a
world record here but it's true that I'll look back and think I
could have done much better over the last 10 kilometers (6
miles).''
	   Kenya's Tegla Loroupe set the world record of 2:20:47 in
Rotterdam this year, and her coach, Yoshio Koide, said that ``with
her ability now she can break the record any time the conditions
are good.''
	   Her time shattered the Asian record of 2:24:07 set by China's
Wang Junxia in 1993 and was far faster than the old games record of
2:29:32 set by China's Zhong Huangdi in 1994.
	   ``This race changes marathon history. I believe she is the
fastest runner in the world at the moment,'' said Shigeru So, chief
of the Japanese athletic federation's athlete development program
for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
	   Japan missed a 1-2 sweep when North Korean Kim Chang outsprinted
Tomoko Kai over the final 100 meters in the main stadium. Kim took
the silver in 2:34:55, and Kai the bronze in 2:35:01.
	   It was the North Koreans' first Asian Games medal in eight
years. They skipped the 1994 games in Hiroshima, Japan.
	   Japanese delegation leader Teruji Kogake said, ``Getting a gold
and a bronze in the very first event of the games should be an
inspiration to the others. Receiving their medals before everyone
at the opening ceremony is certain to move the others.''
	   While the women marathon racers won the first medals, they were
not the first to start action at the games.
	   The original field of 23 soccer teams has been playing for a
week to narrow the field to 16 teams for the second round, opening
Monday.
	   The survivors are Turkmenistan, South Korea, China, Lebanon,
Japan, India, Qatar, Tajikistan, the United Arab Emirates, North
Korea, Thailand, Oman, Uzbekistan, Kuwait, Iran and Kazakstan.
	   Those eliminated were Vietnam, Cambodia, Nepal, the Maldives,
Hong Kong, Mongolia and Laos.
	   Among Monday's games is a contest between archrivals South Korea
and Japan, battling both for Asian supremacy and prestige in
advance of their co-host roles for the 2002 World Cup finals. A
loss at this round robin stage would not necessarily lead to
elimination from medal contention.
	   Preliminary competition also began Sunday for snooker, making
its Asian Games debut, and tempers quickly flared over a game
between longtime Asian rivals India and Pakistan.
	   India's protests over a foul call led to a 15-minute halt to
play, and spectators attuned to the sport's strict etiquette were
aghast when Indian team members used a snooker table as a platform
to write a protest letter.
	   India's Yashin Merchant went on to defeat Pakistan's Mohammad
Saleh 5-4, and both sides' protests were thrown out because neither
paid the required dlrs 50 filing fee, officials said.
	   There were tearful news conferences, by both the athlete and his
mother, after Thailand's gold medal hope, James Wattana, lost his
opening match 5-1 to Hong Kong's Chan Kwok-ming.
	   In all, 377 gold medals are at stake in 36 sports. Some 6,000
athletes from 41 nations are competing in Asia's version of the
Olympics, even though Asia's financial crisis has forced some
nations to curtail their entries.
	   The men's marathon is scheduled for the closing day, Dec. 20.

<TEXT>
	   SUN CITY, South Africa (AP) _ Nick Price held off a charge by
Tiger Woods to win his third Million Dollar Challenge in a
thrilling five-hole playoff Sunday.
	   The 41-year-old Price birdied on the 374-meter (409-yard) par-4
17th for his third win at the tournament after Woods, whose ball
was just off the edge, had to two-putt the hole.
	   Price called Woods, who at 22 is old enough to be his son, a
``phenomenal player.''
	   ``To go 77 holes of a championship and it comes down to one putt
is about as good as it gets. I don't know what we're going to do
next year for an encore,'' Price said.
	   Woods, plagued during the tournament by bad breaks on his
putting, fought his way back after an opening round par-72. He
started the day four strokes back and forced the playoff on the
par-4, 422-meter (462-yard) 18th hole.
	   Price, leading the field at 15 under, was up a stroke. He
two-putted for par. But then Woods, his ball about 20 feet away on
the fringe, used a sand wedge to sink a superb birdie. He pumped
his trademark uppercut into the air, and went into the sudden-death
playoff.
	   It was the first appearance by Woods in the tournament, and in
Africa for that matter. He was greeted as a hero by South Africa's
majority black population and mobbed at each of the holes.
	   Price, the defending champion and course record-holder with a
24-under in 1993, started the round four strokes back, after
leading for the first-two rounds. But the Zimbabwean, who treats
this course like home, surged back Sunday with eight birdies,
including six in a row from holes 8-14.
	   Justin Leonard finished third, a stroke behind, with a 3-under
69 at the 7,597-yard (6,947-meter) Gary Player Country Club course.
	   European sensation Lee Westwood, who had grabbed the lead
Saturday from Price, shot his worst round of the tournament, a 73,
and finished with a combined 276, even with two-time major winner
Mark O'Meara, whose final round was a 68.
	   Jim Furyk tied the course record of 64 set four years ago by
Nick Faldo, but finished in the bottom half along with Tom Watson,
Colin Montgomerie, David Duval and Jesper Parnevik -- who still
picked up checks for dlrs 100,000.

Aussie star stuns Celtic by returning home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Australian international Marko Viduka
has stunned Glasgow Celtic by walking out on the club before even
playing a game. But the striker, who has been suffering from
depression, says he hopes to be back once he has regained full
mental and physical fitness.
	   Viduka, who signed from Croatia Zagreb on Thursday, was expected
to make his debut in Sunday's televized Scottish Premier League
game against Hearts. But he missed training Friday and Saturday and
returned home to Australia.
	   While Celtic owners, players and fans wondered what had gone
wrong, Viduka issued a statement Sunday through his agent.
	   ``It was only after I arrived in Glasgow last week that I
started to realize how much I had been affected by events in Zagreb
over the last few months where I had been under enormous personal
pressure,'' he said.
	   ``I arrived ready and wanting to play, but it finally became
apparent that having thought a change would be as good as a rest, I
realized I actually badly needed a rest.
	   ``It would have been relatively easy for me to cover this up for
a few weeks, but that would not have been fair on the club, the
fans or my family,'' Viduka said.
	   ``I just hope everyone realizes this is not easy for me and
appreciates my honesty. I realize this is causing great
embarrassment and disappointment at the club who have been very
supportive and understanding. I would just ask everyone to be
patient while I get back to full fitness as soon as possible.''

Two jaguars escape; son fatally mauled, father in serious condition

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with second jaguar put to sleep, new nurse quote,
officials now saying boy was 4 years old

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ One of two jaguars that escaped from their cage in
a zoo in western France bit and mauled a small boy to death, then
attacked his father as he desperately tried to fight off the
animal, officials said Sunday.
	   Authorities were investigating how 4-year-old Gregoire was
attacked Saturday afternoon at the zoo in Doue-la-Fontaine, 250 kms
(150 miles) southwest of Paris.
	   Police in the small town near Saumur killed one of the two
100-kilo (200-pound) female jaguars and captured the other and put
it to sleep Sunday morning, authorities said. The Zoo Doue was
immediately shut down pending the investigation.
	   ``The child didn't pass through any security zone,'' said state
prosecutor Yves Gambert told France Info radio. The jaguar went
after the boy ``the moment it came out of a small tunnel.''
	   Repeatedly bitten in the head, the boy died of his wounds and
his father was hospitalized in serious condition with mostly head
wounds he suffered while battling the jaguar.
	   The father, bare-handed, was ``very courageous,because he tried
to free his son from the claws of the animal,'' nurse Noura Oumaziz
told French television LCI. ``Then he confronted it to prevent it
from attacking his other children nearby.'
	   The jaguar grabbed the father by the head, and the man suffered
``serious lesions,'' she said. ``But generally, he's out of
danger.''

	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Police in a northern Indian state arrested
more than 700 people Sunday to prevent clashes between opposition
activists and Hindu nationalists on the sixth anniversary of the
razing of a Muslim shrine, a state government spokesman said.
	   Armed police and anti-riot squads were on alert in Uttar Pradesh
state and in cities and towns across India for fear of a replay of
the inter-religious fighting that followed the 1992 attack on the
mosque by Hindu mobs. More than 2,000 people were killed in the
rioting.
	   No substantial inter-religious violence was reported Sunday.
	   However, police clashed with demonstrators from the opposition
Communist Party of India and Socialist Party during a protest march
in Varanasi, a Hindu pilgrimage center 675 kilometers (420 miles)
east of New Delhi.
	   Uttar Pradesh spokesman R.C. Goyal said that among the more than
700 people arrested were 272 opposition demonstrators and 55 allies
of the governing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party who
marched in Varanasi.
	   The day's events marked the 1992 razing by Hindu nationalists of
the Babri mosque in Ayodhya, 550 kilometers (350 miles) east of New
Delhi.
	   In Ayodhya itself, police arrested 40 activists of the
right-wing Shiv Sena party when they tried to defy a ban and march
through the streets.
	   Nearly 1,000 supporters of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, an ally of the
ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, met in a conference hall in Ayodhya
and praised those who demolished the Muslim shrine. They dispersed
quietly.
	   In Lucknow, capital of Uttar Pradesh state, police arrested 400
activists of opposition Socialist Party who gathered in a park. The
protesters volunteered to be arrested after condemning the
destruction of the historic mosque.
	   In Bombay, India's financial capital, a group of 150 Muslims
marched with their faces covered with black scarves to express
their hurt over the mosque's destruction.
	   The communist and socialist protesters demanded the dismissal of
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government, saying his
Bharatiya Janata Party and allies bore the blame for the mosque
demolition.
	   In day-long rallies in New Delhi, Bombay and several other
Indian cities and towns, the marchers also demanded the arrest of
three BJP leaders who have been charged in court with involvement
in the mosque razing.
	   The BJP leaders deny the charges.
	   Two of them, Interior Minister L.K. Advani and Human Resources
Development Minister M.M. Joshi, admit they were present at the
mosque razing but deny they were involved.
	   ``It is very ironic that such people are in the federal
government. They should be fired and arrested,'' said Ranjit
Abhigyan, general-secretary of the leftwing All India Student's
Association, who organized a march in New Delhi.
	   Hindu mobs razed the mosque after Hindu and Muslim leaders
failed to reconcile their rival claims to the Babri mosque. Hindu
leaders say the mosque was built by Mogul invaders in the 16th
century after destroying a temple. The site is widely believed to
be the birthplace of Ram, Hinduism's supreme god.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Five of the Thai beauty queens who
carried signboards for national teams marching into the Asian Games
opening ceremonies collapsed in the heat Sunday night.
	   The five fainted after the 40-minute athletes' parade, and three
were taken off the field on stretchers. Two others were helped to
walk to clinics in the stadium.
	   Nurses said later all five were sent home after treatment.
	   In addition, they said, at least 15 performers in various parts
of the opening ceremonies program suffered heat exhaustion, and at
least one was sent to a hospital by ambulance.
	   In interviews before the ceremonies, some of the beauty queens
complained that the signs were heavy, making their march in
high-heeled shoes and long gowns more arduous. Some said they
worked out with weights to keep in shape for the task.
	   Each of the 42 national delegations to the games was preceded by
a female Thai sign carrier.
	   The 60,000-seat stadium was filled for the ceremony, where King
Bhumibol Adulyadej declared the two-week games open.

Lazio stuns Juventus on the road on a late goal by Salas

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Chilean striker Marcelo Salas revived
Lazio's title hopes and pushed two-time defending league champion
Juventus on the brink of a severe crisis as he scored a late game
winner for the Roman team in Sunday's big match of the Italian
Serie A.
	   Salas' goal, with nine minutes left at Turin's Delle Alpi arena,
gave Lazio a 1-0 victory and 17 points overall, eight behind leader
Fiorentina which downed Bologna on a goal by its Argentine striker
Gabriel Batistuta in one of the three first division matches played
Saturday.
	   It was Lazio's second victory on the road this season while
injury-crippled Juventus suffered its third defeat in the last four
league matches, extending its winless streak to one month.
	   Juvventus, missing its stellar forward Alessandro Del Piero and
forced to start a teenage keeper from the junior teams, slipped to
fifth place with 18 points, in a tie with another struggling great
Internazionale of Milan.
	   Inter, with new coach Mircea Lucescu on the bench and its
Brazilian star Ronaldo fielded only in the last 15 minutes, was
lucky to escape defeat at Vicenza.
	   Young French defender Mickael Silvestre kicked in the 1-1
equalizer in second-half injury time to even a first-half penalty
kick by Pasquale Luiso.
	   At San Siro stadium AC Milan, coming from a 0-4 rout by Parma in
the previous round, downed Udinese 3-0 and moved to fourth place
with 21 points, one behind AS Roma and Parma which were tied for
the second spot.
	   Roma trounced Perugia 5-1 at the Olympic stadium and Parma
downed Sampdoria 2-0 at Genoa Saturday.
	   Goals for AC Milan were tallied by its international strikers
George Weah, Leonardo and Oliver Bierhoff.
	   In other matches Sunday last-place Venezia upset Cagliari 1-0 on
the road; Piacenza and Empoli played to a goalless draw; Bari
scored an injury time equalizer for a 2-2 draw at Salernitana.

Libya's Gadhafi meets son of Jordan's kin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with report saying King Hussein reiterated
support for Libya. CHANGES dateline. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Jordan's King Hussein offered Libya its
support to confront ``unjust measures'' imposed against it, Libyan
radio reported Sunday.
	   Hussein's message came in a letter delivered Sunday by his
eldest son Prince Abdullah to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, said
the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation.
	   It quoted Hussein's letter as saying that Jordan would continue
to ``exert its efforts until these unjust measures are lifted.''
	   The radio broadcast did not say what the measures were, but it
was apparently referring to a U.N. embargo that was imposed on
Libya in 1992 for its refusal to hand over for trial two suspects
in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner.
	   The U.N. sanctions ban air travel in and out of the country but
do not cover oil exports, Libya's economic lifeblood.
	   Also, the radio did not say how Jordan would help Libya to fight
the ``measures.''
	   It said Abdullah congratulated Gadhafi on his recovery from hip
surgery and wished him good health, the radio said, without giving
further details.
	   Gadhafi underwent surgery in July after injuring his hip,
reportedly while exercising.
	   King Hussein is receiving cancer treatment in the United States.
	   Abdullah, widely seen as a special envoy to the king, delivers
verbal and written messages from Hussein to foreign leaders.

Prime Minister Vajpayee accuses Pakistan of meddling in Kashmir

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee vowed
Sunday that Pakistan will never succeed in what he alleged was its
campaign to break Jammu-Kashmir state away from India.
	   ``I have a message today for the rulers of Pakistan and the
people of the world,'' Vajpayee said upon arriving Sunday for a
two-day visit to the troubled region. ``Kashmir is not merely a
piece of land for us in India .... Kashmir is the one of the best
symbols of India's ancient civilization and modern nationhood.''
	   This is Vajpayee's first visit to Srinagar, the summer capital
of Kashmir and the center of a Muslim insurgency, since he became
India's prime minister in March.
	   Heightened security kept local residents mostly indoors. Shops
and businesses remained closed in response to a two-day general
strike called by militant groups who have been fighting for
secession from India since 1989.
	   India accuses Pakistan of training and arming the militants, a
charge Islamabad denies. Pakistan says it offers only moral and
diplomatic support to the Kashmiris.
	   Vajpayee urged the Kashmiri youth to give up arms and eschew the
path of violence. ``The youth should not look outside the country
for a solution to their problems,'' Vajpayee told nearly 500
people, including government ministers and officials, in a speech
at a reception organized by the provincial government in Srinagar.
	   Vajpayee acused Pakistan of ``creating tension and
provocations'' along the border with India despite the two
countries resuming bilateral talks on a range of issues last
months. ``This must stop, for this is a futile exercise,'' he said
in his statement.
	   He also described as futile Pakistan's attempts to bring in a
third party to intermediate between India and Pakistan on Kashmir
and said the issue should be resolved bilaterally.
	   The prime minister met separately with military commanders and
state government officials and discussed steps to counter
insurgency by the rebels.
	   He accused Pakistan of waging a proxy war in Kashmir.
	   ``The state has been converted into a theater for a proxy war by
those who have hatched an evil design to take Jammu-Kashmir away
from India. Their conspiracy will never succeed,'' he said.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over the Himalayan
territory of Kashmir in the past 51 years. India controls
two-thirds of Kashmir and Pakistan the rest. Kashmir is the only
Muslim majority state in a predominantly Hindu India.

Lazio stuns Juventus on the road on a late goal by Salas

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Chilean striker Marcelo Salas revived
Lazio's title hopes and pushed two-time defending league champion
Juventus on the brink of a severe crisis as he scored a late game
winner for the Roman team in Sunday's big match of the Italian
Serie A.
	   Salas' goal, with nine minutes left at Turin's Delle Alpi arena,
gave Lazio a 1-0 victory and 17 points overall, eight behind leader
Fiorentina which downed Bologna on a goal by its Argentine striker
Gabriel Batistuta in one of the three first division matches played
Saturday.
	   It was Lazio's second victory on the road this season while
injury-crippled Juventus suffered its third defeat in the last four
league matches, extending its winless streak to one month.
	   Juventus, missing its stellar forward Alessandro Del Piero and
forced to start a teen-age keeper from the junior teams, slipped to
fifth place with 18 points, in a tie with another struggling great
Internazionale of Milan.
	   Inter, with new coach Mircea Lucescu on the bench and its
Brazilian star Ronaldo fielded only in the last 15 minutes, was
lucky to escape defeat at Vicenza.
	   Young French defender Mickael Silvestre kicked in the 1-1
equalizer in second-half injury time to even a first-half penalty
kick by Pasquale Luiso.
	   At San Siro stadium AC Milan, coming from a 0-4 rout by Parma in
the previous round, downed Udinese 3-0 and moved to fourth place
with 21 points, one behind AS Roma and Parma which were tied for
the second spot.
	   Roma trounced Perugia 5-1 at the Olympic stadium and Parma
downed Sampdoria 2-0 at Genoa on Saturday.
	   Goals for AC Milan were tallied by its international strikers
George Weah, Leonardo and Oliver Bierhoff.
	   In other matches Sunday, last-place Venezia upset Cagliari 1-0
on the road; Piacenza and Empoli played to a goalless draw; Bari
scored an injury time equalizer for a 2-2 draw at Salernitana.

Report: Ministers oppose Lafontaine's tax plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Signaling conflict inside Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder's new government, some cabinet members are
opposing Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine's tax reform program, a
news magazine reported Sunday.
	   Other ministers have compiled an 11-page, 31-point report
arguing that the reforms are too sweeping and ambitious, according
to an advance copy of this week's issue of Focus.
	   Among the complaints: the Labor Ministry says tax on accumulated
interest should be cut by 25 percent instead of in half, and the
Economic Ministry is fighting to preserve tax write-offs for small
businesses.
	   Schroeder and Lafontaine have billed tax reform as a weapon
against unemployment, the No. 1 national problem. The goal is to
ease Germany's high tax burden on businesses and individuals by 15
billion marks (dlrs 9 billion).
	   The gradual reforms took a first step Friday when parliament's
lower house passed a tax cut for low earners and more government
money for families with children. The two measures will cost the
government 7.8 billion marks (dlrs 4.67 billion.)

Older South Africans register to vote in droves; not so the young
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Older people who weathered
apartheid's storms were more likely to register than younger people
as the first push to create a multiracial voters roll ended on
Sunday, preliminary figures showed.
	   About 23 percent of South Africa's voters _ or 5.8 million _
have been entered into the central computers of the Independent
Electoral Commission over the past week and a half.
	   The tally was expected to reach 9 to 10 million _ or 36 to 40
percent _ after information from outlying areas is gathered, said
Lydia Young of the IEC.
	   The massive registration effort is seen as a test of South
Africa's ability to hold free and fair elections next year _ only
the second since the end of white rule.
	   About 2 percent in the under-20-years crowd signed up, a trend
that IEC chairman Johann Kriegler called alarming. Minimum voting
age is 18.
	   ``Maturity seems to correlate with political awareness. Those
who were part of the struggle are very much more alert,'' Kriegler
was quoted by the Sunday Times of Johannesburg as saying.
	   The highest percentage to register was 34 percent in the 70 to
80-year old group.
	   The IEC originally hoped to register an estimated 24.7 million
voters by the end of November, but logistical and communications
problems have forced it to provide added registration sessions in
January and February.
	   At the last minute, the government supplied 70,000 civil
servants and military cadres to help register after the IEC pleaded
shortage of funds.
	   Some voters were confused by a late decision to delay
registration in four southern provinces to Dec. 3, after they were
told for months beforehand that the registration would take place
in November.
	   Others lacked the right documents or information on location of
the registration booths _ even President Nelson Mandela was sent to
the wrong place.
	   In the first all-race elections in 1994, which marked the end of
apartheid and brought Mandela's African National Congress to power,
people simply had to show up at any polling station and produce any
of several versions of an official ID card.
	   In the 1999 election, only South Africans on the voter list will
be able to vote, using only a bar-coded ID card.
	   The earliest possible election date is May 1, but no date has
been announced.

Former coup leader favorite to win Venezuela presidential vote

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ In presidential elections Sunday,
Venezuelans chose between an ex-army paratrooper who once staged a
bloody coup attempt and a Yale-educated former governor promising
peace and prosperity.
	   The ex-coup leader was the favorite to win.
	   Because of former Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez's meteoric rise in the
polls, the vote has turned into a confrontation between rich and
poor _ and a flashing red warning sign for the rest of Latin
America. For the first time in 40 years of democracy, neither of
Venezuela's two traditional parties fielded candidates.
	   ``These are historic elections. Nothing like these elections has
happened in Venezuela's political history,'' said U.S. Ambassador
John Maisto.
	   In an effort to head off a Chavez victory, both the center-left
Democratic Action Party and the center-right COPEI Party dumped
their respective candidates during the past week and threw their
support to independent candidate Henrique Salas Romer, who is
running second in the polls.
	   In 1992, Chavez tried and failed to overthrow Venezuela's
democratically elected government. His candidacy has blown a hole
through the conventional wisdom that said democracy and free
markets were inescapable in Latin America.
	   ``Today a new Venezuela is being born,'' Chavez told reporters
after casting his ballot amid a roaring throng.
	   Most polling stations opened on schedule, and voting was
described as orderly. It appeared turnout would be high.
	   Reports that Chavez supporters would stage violent protests if
their candidate loses prompted a call to peace from President
Rafael Caldera.
	   ``The government and armed forces have promised to respect the
electoral results. That respect will be sacrosanct,'' Caldera
vowed, adding that ``at the same we demand that the results be
accepted in peace.''
	   Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition, which calls for a
slowing of privatizations and free-market economic reforms, already
won a plurality of Congress in Nov. 8 regional elections, breaking
the two traditional parties' 40-year political stranglehold.
	   Chavez's call for a new constitution and the dissolving of
Congress has scared investors and exacerbated an economic crisis.
Foreign oil companies, including Exxon, Mobile, Shell and British
Petroleum, have put investment plans on hold.
	   Venezuela is the number one exporter of oil to the United
States.
	   The eleventh-hour attempt by COPEI and Democratic Action to
close ranks around Salas appeared to have failed. A poll taken
earlier this week by the private Datanalisis firm showed Chavez
with a comfortable 16-point lead - he had 53 percent support
compared to Salas's 37 percent. The survey of 1,000 likely voters
had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent.
	   Yet Salas supporters pointed out that the well-greased political
machinery of the old-style parties could enable their candidate to
stage an upset victory.
	   ``I am absolutely convinced that together we are going to return
happiness to Venezuela,'' Salas told reporters after casting his
ballot in his home city of Valencia.
	   Until this week, Salas had taken great pains to distance himself
from Democratic Action and COPEI _ aware that most Venezuelans
blame them for squandering the world's largest oil reserves outside
the Middle East.
	   The campaign took on overtones of class warfare. Those who
oppose Salas, a former governor of industrial Carabobo state, said
he would defend the interests of the oligarchy if elected.
	   And Chavez's opponents said he is a dictator-in-waiting.
	   ``To those who call us coup leaders or tyrants, we have to
respond to them as Jesus of Nazareth: Forgive them, Lord, for they
know not what they do,'' Chavez bellowed to hundreds of thousands
of supporters at his closing rally in Caracas Wednesday night.
	   Yet Chavez's militaristic rhetoric and his trademark red
parachutist's beret, worn by his supporters at campaign rallies,
terrify middle and upper class Venezuelans, many of whom have
already fled to Miami.
	   ``That things have to get better, I agree, but without
violence,'' said 78-year-old Caracas resident Recino Carbajal.
	   An economic crisis caused by a 12-year low in oil prices has
made making ends meet all but impossible for most Venezuelans,
whose standard of living has been steadily declining for more than
15 years.
	   ``We want a change. If Chavez doesn't make this change, what is
going to happen is a social explosion, a revolution,'' said Gabriel
Jimenez, a 45-year-old telecommunications technician.
	   On Sunday, 11 million of the country's 23 million inhabitants
were eligible to vote.
	   Among the trailing candidates was former Miss Universe Irene
Saez, who had led the polls until earlier this year. Her candidacy
was badly damaged by confusion among her staff and an endorsement
by COPEI, which many people thought compromised her independence.

British forces to stay until Iraq complies

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A Royal Air Force squadron will not leave Kuwait
until Iraq fulfills its promise to fully cooperate with U.N.
weapons inspectors, Britain's chief of the defense staff said
Sunday.
	   The United States and Britain stepped back from the brink of war
after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein promised Nov. 14 to restore
access to suspected weapons sites for U.N. inspectors.
	   ``We have decided that we are going to be here to make quite
sure that what was agreed in middle November by Saddam Hussein''
will be carried out, said Gen. Sir Charles Guthrie.
	   Guthrie, who commands Britain's air force, navy and army, was on
a one-day visit to Kuwait, his second since the oil-rich state was
liberated from a seven-month Iraqi occupation in 1991.
	   He was speaking to reporters at Ali al-Salem Air Base that hosts
12 Tornado bombers and about 400 Royal Air Force personnel who
service them.
	   There were no plans for reducing the number of aircraft, Guthrie
said. He said he did not ``wish to discuss operational plans,''
when asked if there were plans to increase the British forces in
Kuwait.
	   Guthrie said if Iraq failed to comply, London and Washington
will use force without any warning.
	   The U.N. inspectors are responsible for destroying Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction. U.N. economic sanctions imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait cannot be lifted until that mission
is completed.
	   Kuwait and Britain signed a 10-year defense agreement after the
Gulf War. Similar pacts were also concluded with the Untied States,
France and Russia.

Report: Angolan rebels allow U.N. evacuation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The U.N. special envoy to Angola has
reached an agreement with rebel movement UNITA to evacuate 14 U.N.
peacekeepers based in UNITA's central highland strongholds, which
are under government attack, news reports said Sunday.
	   Issa Diallo told the Portuguese news agency Lusa that three U.N.
peace monitors _ one Swedish, one Brazilian and one Senegalese _
already had left Andulo, 480 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of
the capital Luanda, to Huambo, almost 200 kilometers (125 miles)
southwest of Andulo.
	   The remaining staff, based in UNITA's other stronghold Bailundo,
about 125 kilometers (80 miles) southwest of Andulo, shortly will
join the others in Huambo, Lusa quoted Diallo as saying.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Friday said he would hold
UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi personally responsible for the security
of his peacekeepers, and called on him to allow an evacuation
flight into Andulo and Bailundo.
	   Annan's appeal followed reports that the government was
attacking the two strongholds which UNITA has refused to relinquish
despite pressure from the United Nations.
	   The U.N. envoy also said both sides had informed him of a
government offensive near Andulo and Bailundo, according to Lusa.
	   The United Nations brokered the 1994 pact ending a two-decade
civil war between the government and UNITA, which followed the 1975
independence from Portugal's colonial rule.
	   Souring relations between both sides and mutual accusations of
military action have stymied the peace process since.
	   The United Nations has reduced its observer mission in Angola
from 7,000 peacekeepers in 1994 to about 1,000.

New massacre as prime minister prepares exit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ouyahia speech, resignation expected Thursday
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Muslim militants slashed the throats of
seven more people in a mountain town overnight, authorities said
Sunday, though Algeria's embattled prime minister insisted the
insurgency was under control.
	   The victims were killed ``with savagery'' Saturday night in the
town of Merad, near Tipaza, 100 kms (60 miles) west of the capital,
a brief government statement said.
	   Hospital officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
militants slashed the seven to death, and they shot and wounded
five people who tried to flee.
	   The latest violence in the petroleum-rich nation brought to 52
the number killed in a new wave of attacks by militants that began
last Wednesday. More than 75,000 people have died in a nearly
7-year-old insurgency.
	   Barely two weeks before the holy month of Ramadan _ a
characteristically bloody period during the insurgency _ the
violence also came shortly before a state-of-the-nation speech
Sunday afternoon by Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia.
	   In his two-hour televised talk before the Parliament, Ouyahia
argued the country's security situation ``is constantly
improving.'' He has repeatedly drawn derision for having insisted
that the insurgency had been reduced to only ``residual
terrorism.''
	   But Ouyahia also told the lawmakers of the need for ``vigilance
and mobilization.''
	   Ouyahia did not mention his expected departure from office ahead
of an early presidential election slated for April.
	   But an official source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the prime minister was likely to announce his resignation Thursday.
Ouyahia is seen as a potential candidate for the election President
Liamine Zeroual announced Sept. 11. Zeroual is not running.
	   Sen. Smail Hamdani, a former ambassador to France considered a
technocrat without strong party links, was expected to be appointed
caretaker prime minister as early as next Saturday.
	   Ouyahia pledged government help for terror victims and for
families demanding information on their missing loved ones arrested
by security forces.
	   On the economic front, Ouyahia said that through an austerity
plan the government cut inflation from 29.7 percent in 1995 to 5
percent his year. Despite a wave of strikes, Ouyahia defended ``the
necessity to liberalize the country's economy'' and to do away with
``the aid-dependent mentality.''
	   He said his government has refused an offer by the International
Monetary Fund to again reschedule the country's 30 billion foreign
debt.
	   Ouyahia has been plagued by strikes in recent weeks that have
protested the military-backed government's efforts to cut subsidies
and bailouts of a mostly state-owned economy, allowing some
companies to fail.
	   The restructuring _ forced by falling world petroleum prices and
foreign debt payments _ has thrown thousands more out of work,
compounding unemployment that officially is 30 percent. Independent
estimates put the figure much higher.
	   ``The unemployment and misery that drive people to violence, to
prostitution and suicide are for Mr. Ouyahia but a state of mind,''
said Salah Makhlouf, a restaurant manager watching Ouyahia's speech
on TV.
	   The insurgency broke out in the former French colony after the
government canceled January 1992 elections the Islamic Salvation
Front was expected to win.

Angry fans burn television converters

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ Soccer fans of PAOK Salonica, protesting
their team's punishment, set fire to television converter boxes
Sunday outside the offices of a sports subscription channel.
	   The unusual protest in this northern port city was the latest
staged by angry PAOK supporters.
	   Last month, the first division club was stripped of three league
points and ordered to play five home games away after its fans
stormed the pitch during a Nov. 1 game against Olympiakos Piraeus.
The match was interrupted when a referee's assistant was injured
and awarded to Olympiakos.
	   On Saturday, PAOK supporters blocked Greece's main highway for
an hour, while over 10,000 fans demonstrated in downtown Salonica
last month.
	   The subscription channel Supersport has the live broadcast
rights for Greek league soccer games.
	   PAOK has implied that league organizers are biased in favor of
Athens clubs. And for many sports fans in northern Greece, the
team's punishment has offended their regional pride.
	   Defense Minister Akis Tsochadzopoulos, who represents a Salonica
constituency as a member of parliament, has said that protests by
PAOK fans' protests are largely justified.

Annan fails to reach agreement with Libya leader on Lockerbie

<TEXT>
	   JERBA, Tunisia (AP) _ After meeting Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi in a desert tent, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he
thinks an arrangement for bringing two suspects to trial in the
bombing of a Pan Am airliner can be secured in the ``not too
distant future.''
	   Annan's comments came Saturday after he and Gadhafi failed to
agree on handing over Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah, who are suspected in the 1988 bombing that killed 270
people.
	   The 60-year-old Annan is trying to get Libya to go along with a
U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects before a panel of
Scottish judges in the Netherlands for the 1988 bombing over
Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   On Sunday, state-run Libyan Radio quoted an unnamed official in
the Foreign Liaison Secretariat, which is the equivalent of a
foreign ministry, as saying that ``a solution to this crisis is
within reach.''
	   He credited Annan's talks with Omar al-Muntasser, Libya's
foreign minister, who met with Annan in Sirte before Annan went on
to talks with Gadhafi. Sirte is 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of
the Libyan capital Tripoli.
	   The official spoke of ``fruitful talks'' but gave no details.
The broadcast was monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp.
	   Also Sunday, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in an
interview with the BBC that he had spoken with Annan on Sunday and
was ``very encouraged by what he tells me.''
	   He added: ``I think you could sum up our mood as one of
qualified optimism.''
	   Britain would like to see the two suspects in custody by Dec.
21, the 10th anniversary of the Pan Am bombing.
	   But Cook said Britain will not budge on the demand by Washington
and London that the suspects serve any sentence in a Scottish jail.
Libya has asked that any prison terms be served in the Netherlands
or Libya.
	   Annan spoke to reporters in Tripoli after the meeting with
Gadhafi and later when he arrived back at this Tunisian island,
where he had begun his 15-hour trip to Libya.
	   ``The talks have been fruitful and positive,'' Annan said in
Tripoli. ``Libya has confirmed its seriousness and readiness to
find a solution to the Lockerbie problem.
	   ``Libya has also agreed to a trial in a third country and
believes that it ought to be possible to find answers to all other
outstanding issues,'' he said.
	   ``So I hope that in the not too distant future we will be able
to give the families good news,'' he added, referring to the
relatives of victims who have lobbied extensively for a trial.
	   Annan left Jerba on Sunday for the United Arab Emirates, where
he will attend a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a
federation of six Arab Gulf states.
	   In Washington, James Foley, a State Department spokesman, said
the United States is awaiting a briefing from Annan but is
``disappointed'' that Libya has not complied with U.N. Security
Council resolutions.
	   ``Compliance means turnover of the two suspects for trial,''
Foley said. ``It's been almost 10 years since the Pan Am 103
tragedy, this has gone on for far too long.''
	   The meeting with Gadhafi took place after Libya's official news
agency, JANA, reported that Annan might not be able to meet with
the Libyan leader because Gadhafi was ``in the desert.''
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Annan was taken on an hour's
trip into the desert in a four-wheel drive vehicle to meet with
Gadhafi in a tent with a roaring fire outside.
	   Earlier, Libyan media suggested that Gadhafi had no authority to
hand over the suspects _ an indication he was giving himself room
in case he decides against giving up the two men wanted by the
United States and Britain.
	   JANA indicated a decision on handing over the two suspects would
have to be approved by some 500 grassroots national committees
before being considered by the Parliament.
	   Libyan radio reported that the Parliament had been called to
meet Tuesday in Sirte but did not say whether the Lockerbie issue
would be discussed.
	   Annan flew into Libya aboard a special plane from Jerba after
receiving clearance from the U.N. Sanctions Committee. Libya has
been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its refusal to hand over
the two suspects.
	   The U.N. sanctions ban air travel in and out of the country but
do not cover oil exports, Libya's economic lifeblood.

KLA accuses Serbs of ambushes, seeks more withdrawals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Russian delegation visit; ADDS detail
about areas from which the KLA wants Serbs to vacate. no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo Albanian rebels accused Serb
forces Sunday of launching unprovoked attacks in the shooting
deaths of more than a dozen ethnic Albanians in the past few days.
	   They said more Serb forces must pull back in order to avoid more
violence in the tense standoff between the two sides, which have
clashed sporadically since an October peace agreement.
	   To add muscle to that agreement, the advance party of a NATO
European military force arrived Sunday in neighboring Macedonia to
be on standby to rescue if necessary the international civilians
trying to verify compliance with the October accord.
	   But the recent killings in Kosovo have heightened fears
full-scale combat may resume soon after halting two months ago when
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to a withdrawal of
many forces from the separatist Serbian province.
	   In a statement published in the ethnic Albanian newspaper Koha
Ditore, the Kosovo Liberation Army blamed the Serbs for the
escalation of violence, saying they had attacked both villages and
KLA positions despite the cease-fire.
	   The two deadliest recent shootings _ the killings of three
ethnic Albanians by unidentified assailants in Pristina and eight
KLA fighters by border guards on the Albanian border _ were Serb
ambushes, the rebels said.
	   They disputed the position of international officials that both
sides are to blame for the rising violence in Kosovo.
	   ``It is unacceptable for the international community to equate
the KLA with Serb forces'' and hold both responsible, the statement
said.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is coordinating an international monitoring mission in Kosovo,
condemned Kosovo violence last week but declined to single out
either side in the recent shootings.
	   Some 500 unarmed verifiers now patrol Kosovo daily _ a total
that is rising almost daily as the OSCE tries to put about 2,000 on
duty in the province.
	   Driving through tense villages in bright orange trucks, the
verifiers have brought a sense of added security for ethnic
Albanians even though they have no weapons.
	   ``Hopefully, the deployment of the OSCE verification mission
will create a new environment, a new atmosphere,'' ethnic Albanian
political Ibrahim Rugova said Friday.
	   In the Macedonian capital Skopje, four huge French Hercules
military planes with about 30 military officers and 40 tons of
equipment landed Sunday in driving wind and snow to set up the NATO
force to protect the civilian verifiers.
	   Over the next two weeks, the force will grow up to a 1,700-man
NATO mission, led by France. The force will include about 700
French, 350 British and 200 soldiers each from Italy, Germany and
the Netherlands.
	   If the Kosovo peace verifiers run into trouble, the NATO
soldiers will swiftly engage in a cross-border action from
Macedonia to extract them and bring to safety.
	   ``We are glad to be here, but I hope we have no job to do in
Kosovo,'' Lt. Col. Charles de Kersabiec told reporters.
	   In its statement Sunday, the KLA said it has urged international
officials to push for Serb withdrawals from several more positions,
including the town of Malisevo which had been a rebel stronghold.
	   The guerrillas also said the Serbs should stop patrolling some
roads for reasons of the population's security.
	   A precise deployment of allowed Serb deployments was not
specified in the October agreement brokered by U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke.
	   The embattled southern province in Serbia, which is the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia, has a population of 2 million which
consists mostly of ethnic Albanians.
	   Serbia used force this year to try to crush separatist rebels
and keep Kosovo from seceding. Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic
Albanian civilians, were killed and as many as 300,000 were
displaced from their homes.
	   Dozens have been killed since the October agreement. In the
latest violence, the ethnic Albanians' Council for the Defense of
Human Rights said a Serb sniper killed an Albanian Saturday in
Klina, 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of Pristina.
	   In the Yugoslav capital Belgrade, a delegation of the Russian
parliament, or Duma, met Sunday with Serbian officials in a gesture
of support for the government. The delegation is headed by Sergei
Glotov, leader of the anti-NATO faction.
	   ``The (Russian) delegation confirmed its stand... supporting
peaceful solution of Kosovo (crisis) and for preserving territorial
integrity and sovereignty of Serbia and Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia'' the government's Tanjug news agency reported.

Ahonen win ends Schmitt winning streak and own runner-up streak
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHAMONIX, France (AP) _ Reigning world champion Janne Ahonen of
Finland ended Martin Schmitt's winning streak Sunday, clinching the
season's fourth World Cup ski jumping event.
	   The victory also ended Ahonen's own string of runner-up finishes
behind Schmitt in the three other World Cup events this season.
	   It was consistency which earned Ahonen the win on the 95-meter
hill, the Finn jumping 98 meters and 97.5 meters for a total of 248
points, beating out double Olympic champion Kazuyoshi Funaki of
Japan by a solid 4.5 points.
	   For Funaki it was another frustrating day, the Japanese
finishing a disappointing third in Saturday's competition despite
breaking the hill record in his initial jump.
	   Once more it was Funaki's second jump which cost him the
victory.
	   The Japanese again executed a stellar opening effort, soaring
100.5 meters, earning him near-perfect style marks of 20 from two
judges and 19.5 from three others to take the lead.
	   But a weaker jump of 94.5 meters in the second round left Funaki
with a total of 243.5, and a 12th career win out of reach.
	   Schmitt, who won both K120 events in Lillehammer, Norway last
week and Saturday's K95, settled for third with jumps of 99.5 and
95 and 240.5 points.
	   Second after the first round, Olympic bronze medallist Masahiko
Harada slipped to fourth with 240 points after a feeble second
jump.
	   A solid performance in the second leg boosted Finland's Mika
Laitinen from seventh to fifth with 225.5.
	   Noriaki Kasai of Japan and Norway's Morten Aagheim tied for
sixth with 225.
	   Schmitt remains atop the standings table with 360, with Ahonan
closing the gap, just 20 points behind.
	   Funaki, the normal hill Olympic silver medalist in Nagano, sits
in third with 250, followed by world jumior champion Wolfgang
Loitzl of Austria, fourth with 137.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ In presidential elections Sunday,
Venezuelans chose between an ex-army paratrooper who once staged a
bloody coup attempt and a Yale-educated former governor promising
peace and prosperity.
	   The ex-coup leader was the favorite to win.
	   Because of former Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez's meteoric rise in the
polls, the vote turned into a confrontation between rich and poor _
and a flashing red warning sign for the rest of Latin America. For
the first time in 40 years of democracy, neither of Venezuela's two
traditional parties fielded candidates.
	   ``These are historic elections. Nothing like these elections has
happened in Venezuela's political history,'' said U.S. Ambassador
John Maisto.
	   In an effort to head off a Chavez victory, both the center-left
Democratic Action Party and the center-right COPEI Party dumped
their respective candidates during the past week and threw their
support to independent candidate Henrique Salas Romer, who is
running second in the polls.
	   In 1992, Chavez tried and failed to overthrow Venezuela's
democratically elected government. His candidacy has blown a hole
through the conventional wisdom that said democracy and free
markets were inescapable in Latin America.
	   ``Today a new Venezuela is being born,'' Chavez told reporters
after casting his ballot amid some 1,000 supporters roaring,
``Chavez! Chavez!'' and ``Viva Venezuela!'' As he drove away,
throngs of teenagers chased after his white van.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Less than a week before U.S. President Bill
Clinton is to arrive for a visit meant to bolster the new peace
accord, Israel and the Palestinians exchanged angry accusations
Sunday over Jewish settlements and street clashes.
	   Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian parliament, warned of
possible violence if Israel continues to expand settlements in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the Palestinians hope to establish
a state.
	   ``If settlement activity continues, then all means of resistance
are open,'' Qureia, who is also known as Abu Ala, told reporters in
the West Bank town of Ramallah.
	   Since the signing of a land-for-security accord, Jewish settlers
have accelerated the establishment of makeshift communities on West
Bank hilltops, in an explicit bid to keep the land from being
turned over to the Palestinians.
	   Meanwhile, at a meeting of the Israeli Cabinet, ministers
expressed dismay over an outbreak of street clashes between
Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli troops in the West Bank.
	   ``The Palestinians have been asked to immediately stop the
violence and incitement to violence,'' the Cabinet said in a
statement.
	   At least two Palestinians were injured Sunday in a confrontation
outside the Jewish settlement of Ariel in the northern West Bank.
Demonstrators threw stones at Israeli troops, who responded with
rubber bullets and tear gas.
	   A day earlier, 27 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers were
injured in similar clashes throughout the West Bank. And three days
before that, Israelis were horrified by television footage of an
Israeli soldier being dragged from a car and beaten with chunks of
concrete by a Palestinian mob.
	   Israel says Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority is
orchestrating the street fighting. The Palestinians deny that.
	   The past week's protests grew out of an increasingly bitter
dispute over Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
	   Israel last month freed 250 of 750 prisoners it is to release
under the Wye accords, but most were criminals. The Palestinians
are demanding that so-called security prisoners _ those being held
for anti-Israel activity _ be released instead.
	   Also Sunday, another quarrel was brewing over the scheduled
meeting of the the Palestinian National Council, the Palestinian
parliament-in-exile, in the Gaza Strip during Clinton's visit.
	   At the gathering, the PNC and other Palestinians in attendance
are to reaffirm the nullification of clauses in their national
charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   Israel has demanded that the Palestinians hold an actual vote at
the meeting rather than simply proclaiming the charter changed, but
the Palestinians on Sunday repeated their objections to that.
	   ``They haven't the right to give us instructions,'' Arafat said
Sunday as he returned to Gaza following a trip to Europe.
	   Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian lands, which is to
begin Saturday, is meant to provide impetus to the U.S.-brokered
peace accords and encourage both sides to stick to a timetable for
compliance. But some commentators suggested the visit was proving a
polarizing force instead.
	   ``He is coming to promote the peace process... but his visit's
only actual result is a sharpening of the differences,'' Yosef
Lapid wrote in Sunday's editions of the Maariv newspaper.
	   In Israel, increasing concern is being voiced over Clinton's
planned visit to Gaza, the first ever by a sitting U.S. president.
At Sunday's Israeli Cabinet meeting, a shouting match broke out
over the issue, according to Israel radio.
	   ``Who invited President Clinton to the Gaza Strip?'' Silvan
Shalom, the science minister, reportedly yelled at Netanyahu.
Netanyahu said it had been Clinton's idea, not his.
	   The United States has repeatedly said the visit is not intended
as an endorsement of Palestinian statehood, but the Palestinians
see it as a powerful boost to their sovereignty hopes.
	   Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi said on Israeli television that the
invitation for a Clinton visit came from Israel and was ``warmly
welcomed'' by the Palestinians.

Sweden completes 4-1 rout of Italy in Davis Cup final

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Sweden finished off its second straight
Davis Cup victory Sunday by splitting the last two singles matches
with Italy for a 4-1 triumph.
	   Magnus Gustafsson needed just 68 minutes to defeat Italy's
Gianluca Pozzi 6-4, 6-2, before Diego Nargiso salvaged some pride
for the hosts by beating Magnus Norman 6-2, 6-3 to avoid a sweep.
	   Sweden had clinched its third trophy since 1994 and seventh
overall on Saturday by adding a straight-set doubles win to
Friday's two singles triumphs.
	   With the outcome clear, Italy sent Nargiso on as a substitute
for Davide Sanguinetti on Sunday.
	   Pozzi played in place of Andrea Gaudenzi, the country's top
player, who retired with a strained right shoulder in the fifth set
of his opening singles match against Norman.
	   The Scandinavians were bidding to become the first country to
register back-to-back finals sweeps since the United States did it
against Romania and Germany in 1969-70.
	   Sweden beat the United States 5-0 in last year's final.
	   Italy, which upset a second-string U.S. squad in the September
semifinals, won its lone Davis Cup in 1976 and has now lost in its
six other finals appearances.
	   Gustafsson, rated No. 31 by the ATP, was the highest ranking
singles player here.
	   It was the first final in the 99-year history of the Davis Cup
without anyone from the top 30.

U.S. health secretary tours Roman ruins in eastern Lebanon

	   BAALBEK, Lebanon (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of Health and Human
Services Donna Shalala took time off politics Sunday to attend Mass
and tour the Roman ruins in eastern Lebanon, an area that was off
limits to Americans during the civil war.
	   The Lebanese-American official, accompanied by her 91-year-old
mother Edna, received an abaya, a traditional Arab robe, as a
souvenir from Baalbek Mayor Ghaleb Yaghi.
	   ``Today is not a day of politics. It is a day of rest to see the
beautiful ruins of Baalbek,'' Shalala told reporters during a tour
of the Roman temples of Jupiter and Bacchus.
	   Baalbek, 85 kilometers (53 miles) northeast of the capital,
Beirut was a stronghold of anti-Western Muslim militants during the
1975-90 conflict.
	   Some of the scores of Western hostages, including Americans,
were held in Baalbek, a city once accustomed to marches in which
gunmen trampled the U.S. flag.
	   ``Baalbek is one of the most beautiful places in the world. I am
very happy to return here after 25 years,'' said Shalala, who is on
her second visit to Lebanon.
	   ``I hope to return one day to see the festival,'' Shalala said,
referring to the world-renowned annual Baalbek International
Festival of music and arts that resumed last year after a 22-year
break caused by war.
	   Shalala is the first senior U.S. official to visit eastern
Lebanon since the 1980s. Beirut-based U.S. diplomats visited the
ruins for the first time last month.
	   Security, provided by U.S. agents and Lebanese policemen, was
tight during the one-hour tour. Lebanese police sealed off the
town's square to allow her motorcade to pass through.
	   Earlier, Shalala attended Mass at a Maronite Catholic church in
the Christian city of Zahle, capital of the Bekaa and halfway
between Beirut and Baalbek.
	   On Saturday, she inspected projects funded by U.S. aid in
northern Lebanon and visited her grandfather's village, Beit
Shalala, in the North.
	   Shalala arrived in Lebanon on Friday aboard a U.S. military
helicopter that flew from the neighboring island of Cyprus to the
fortified U.S. Embassy compound outside Beirut.
	   Beirut airport remains off-limits to American officials. But a
ban on travel to Lebanon _ declared during a series of kidnapings
in the 1980s _ was replaced last year with an advisory warning that
Lebanon remains dangerous.
	   Asked about her assessment of security condition in Lebanon,
Shalala said: ``I think that there has been much improvement.''

<TEXT>
	   SUN CITY, South Africa (AP) _ Nick Price held off a charge by
Tiger Woods to win his third Million Dollar Challenge in a
thrilling five-hole playoff Sunday.
	   The 41-year-old Price birdied on the 374-meter (409-yard) par-4
17th for his third win at the tournament after Woods, whose ball
was just off the edge, had to two-putt the hole.
	   Price called Woods, who at 22 is old enough to be his son, a
``phenomenal player.''
	   ``To go 77 holes of a championship and it comes down to one putt
is about as good as it gets. I don't know what we're going to do
next year for an encore,'' Price said.
	   Woods, plagued during the tournament by bad breaks on his
putting, fought his way back after an opening round par-72. He
started the day four strokes back but charged hard on the back
nine, with an 18-foot putt to birdie on 17 and another birdie on
the 422-meter (462-yard) 18th hole.
	   At the final hole, Price, leading the field at 15 under, was up
a stroke. He two-putted for par. But then Woods, his ball about 20
feet away on the fringe, used a sand wedge to sink another
18-footer. He pumped his trademark uppercut into the air, and went
into the sudden-death playoff.
	   ``I had no choice. I had to make that shot,'' Woods said. ``I
knew I hit it on the line. I wasn't sure I had the pace or not. ...
As it kept rolling, kept rolling, about 3 feet from the hole, it
looked like it had a really good chance and then it went right in
center,'' Woods said of the shot.
	   ``The two birdies he made on 17 and 18 speak volumes for the
guy,'' Price said. ``Obviously to have beaten something like Tiger,
it makes it a little special. He's a phenomenon,'' he said. ``I've
got a great future behind me. He's going to win plenty.''
	   It was the first appearance by Woods in the tournament, and in
Africa for that matter. He was greeted as a hero by South Africa's
majority black population and mobbed at each of the holes.
	   Disappointed at losing, Woods -- who earned dlrs 250,000 -- the
birdies on 17 and 18 gave him a sense of achievement.
	   Woods missed something else in the playoff -- his plane for
Australia, where he will play in the President's Cup this week with
Jack Nicklaus as captain.
	   ``Jack won't be very happy,'' Woods joked.
	   Price, the defending champion and course record-holder with a
24-under in 1993, started the round four strokes back, after
leading for the first-two rounds. But the Zimbabwean, who treats
this course like home, surged back Sunday with eight birdies,
including six in a row from holes 8-14.
	   Only David Frost has won the Million Dollar Challenge three
times.
	   Justin Leonard finished third, a stroke behind, with a 3-under
69 at the 7,597-yard (6,947-meter) Gary Player Country Club course.
	   European sensation Lee Westwood, who had grabbed the lead
Saturday from Price, shot his worst round of the tournament, a 73,
and finished with a combined 276, even with two-time major winner
Mark O'Meara, whose final round was a 68.
	   Jim Furyk tied the course record of 64 set four years ago by
Nick Faldo, but finished in the bottom half along with Tom Watson,
Colin Montgomerie, David Duval and Jesper Parnevik -- who still
picked up checks for dlrs 100,000.

Kurdish leader Ocalan says international trial would help his
</HEADLINE>
cause &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan
told a German news program Sunday he wants to stand trial on terror
and murder charges before an international court.
	   Such a court could determine ``if we or the Turkish government
are responsible for the war against each other, in which many
thousand people have died on both sides,'' he explained in an
interview with station ZDF.
	   Ocalan, the leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party, or
PKK, was arrested Nov. 15 in Rome, where he remains under police
guard as Italy weighs his request for asylum and European leaders
work toward setting up an international court.
	   Italy and Germany agreed last month to push for a neutral
tribunal for Ocalan's controversial case.
	   The PKK has fought a 14-year war for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey,
in which about 37,000 people have been killed. Ocalan faces murder
and terror charges in his native Turkey as well as in Germany, but
his fate remains uncertain.
	   Italy by law cannot extradite him to Turkey because he faces the
death penalty there. Germany has no death penalty, but Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder ruled out seeking his extradition for fear of
stirring unrest among the nation's Turkish population of 2 million,
one-fifth of which are Kurds.
	   Thousands of Kurds have protested in Germany in support of
Ocalan since his arrest, and thousands of Turks have protested
urging his extradition to Turkey.
	   Even as Ocalan gave his interview, 5,000 angry Turks were
demonstrating Sunday in Frankfurt and Hamburg urging that the
Kurdish leader been sent home for trial.
	   Police said both protests were peaceful, although witnesses said
some demonstrators showed their rage at Italy by storming a
Frankfurt pizzeria and chanting ``No more pizza.'' Other
demonstrators in Frankfurt laid a black wreath in front of the
Italian consulate.
	   Ocalan faces charges in Germany in connection with bombings and
other attacks on Turkish and Germany targets. Germany banned the
PKK in 1993 after a string of arson attacks.

KLA accuses Serbs of ambushes, seeks more withdrawals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Russian delegation visit; ADDS detail
about areas from which the KLA wants Serbs to vacate. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo Albanian rebels accused Serb
forces Sunday of launching unprovoked attacks in the shooting
deaths of more than a dozen ethnic Albanians in the past few days.
	   They said more Serb forces must pull back in order to avoid more
violence in the tense standoff between the two sides, which have
clashed sporadically since an October peace agreement.
	   To add muscle to that agreement, the advance party of a NATO
European military force arrived Sunday in neighboring Macedonia to
be on standby to rescue, if necessary, the international civilians
trying to verify compliance with the October accord.
	   But the recent killings in Kosovo have heightened fears
full-scale combat may resume soon after halting two months ago when
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to a withdrawal of
many forces from the separatist Serbian province.
	   In a statement published in the ethnic Albanian newspaper Koha
Ditore, the Kosovo Liberation Army blamed the Serbs for the
escalation of violence, saying they had attacked both villages and
KLA positions despite the cease-fire.
	   The two deadliest recent shootings _ the killings of three
ethnic Albanians by unidentified assailants in Pristina and of
eight KLA fighters by border guards on the Albanian border _ were
Serb ambushes, the rebels said.
	   They disputed the position of international officials that both
sides are to blame for the rising violence in Kosovo.
	   ``It is unacceptable for the international community to equate
the KLA with Serb forces'' and hold both responsible, the statement
said.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is coordinating an international monitoring mission in Kosovo,
condemned Kosovo violence last week but declined to single out
either side in the recent shootings.
	   Some 500 unarmed verifiers now patrol Kosovo daily _ a total
that is rising almost daily as the OSCE tries to put about 2,000 on
duty in the province.
	   Driving through tense villages in bright orange trucks, the
verifiers have brought a sense of added security for ethnic
Albanians even though they have no weapons.
	   ``Hopefully, the deployment of the OSCE verification mission
will create a new environment, a new atmosphere,'' ethnic Albanian
political Ibrahim Rugova said Friday.
	   In the Macedonian capital Skopje, four huge French Hercules
military planes with about 30 military officers and 40 tons of
equipment landed Sunday in driving wind and snow to set up the NATO
force to protect the civilian verifiers.
	   Over the next two weeks, the force will grow up to a 1,700-man
NATO mission, led by France. The force will include about 700
French, 350 British and 200 soldiers each from Italy, Germany and
the Netherlands.
	   If the Kosovo peace verifiers run into trouble, the NATO
soldiers will swiftly engage in a cross-border action from
Macedonia to extract them and bring to safety.
	   ``We are glad to be here, but I hope we have no job to do in
Kosovo,'' Lt. Col. Charles de Kersabiec told reporters.
	   In its statement Sunday, the KLA said it has urged international
officials to push for Serb withdrawals from several more positions,
including the town of Malisevo which had been a rebel stronghold.
	   The guerrillas also said the Serbs should stop patrolling some
roads so that the population feels more secure.
	   Precise details of allowed Serb deployments in Kosovo were not
specified in the October agreement brokered by U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke.
	   The embattled southern province has a population of 2 million,
consisting mainly of ethnic Albanians.
	   Serbia, which is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, used force
this year to try to crush separatist rebels and keep Kosovo from
seceding. Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic Albanian civilians,
were killed and as many as 300,000 were displaced from their homes.
	   Dozens have been killed since the October agreement. In the
latest violence, the ethnic Albanians' Council for the Defense of
Human Rights said a Serb sniper killed an Albanian Saturday in
Klina, 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of Pristina.
	   In the Yugoslav capital Belgrade, a delegation of the Russian
parliament, or Duma, met Sunday with Serbian officials in a gesture
of support for the government. The delegation is headed by Sergei
Glotov, leader of the anti-NATO faction.
	   ``The (Russian) delegation confirmed its stand... supporting
peaceful solution of Kosovo (crisis) and for preserving territorial
integrity and sovereignty of Serbia and Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia'' the government's Tanjug news agency reported.

McEnroe wins fifth title in a row
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ John McEnroe won his fifth tournament in a row
with a masterful 7-5, 6-3 victory over Yannick Noah in the ATP
Seniors Sunday.
	   Hitting winners from all parts of the court, the 39-year-old
three-time Wimbledon titlist won his eighth championship of the
year on the Seniors tour having already won the series.
	   ``Once I got going, things really picked up. I felt good,'' the
lefthander said. ``It's coming back.
	   ``My goal is to be the George Foreman of tennis. He won the
world title at 45. that gives me five years to get ready for
Wimbledon.''
	   McEnroe said his commitments to TV coverage would probably
prevent him playing again in the doubles at Wimbledon although
there had been suggestions that he might team up with Steffi Graf
in the mixed competition.
	   On this form, however, he would stand a great chance of gaining
another title and has offered his services as a doubles player on
the United States Davis Cup team.
	   After serving two break points at 3-2 down, McEnroe broke to
lead 6-5 and served out to take the set. He then broke Noah twice
for a 4-0 lead in the second, his vision and variety of shots
getting the Frenchman running around the court.
	   Noah broke back and then held to come back for 4-3. But McEnroe
held and then won his third match point to take the title.
	   ``He's really tough,'' the Frenchman said. ``He doesn't give you
any easy shots or any easy points. He's very competitive.
	   ``John's really pushing us. For us to be on the same court as
him we really have to work hard.''

Ahead of European summit, EU nations remain split on key expansion
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Only days from a European summit, the
15 European Union governments remained divided Sunday on issues
that all agree must be resolved before a dozen newcomers can join
the EU.
	   The EU foreign ministers began a two-day session to lift an
impasse over how to finance a near-doubling of the EU. That, plus
the issue of how fast to expand the EU, will dominate the two-day
summit opening in Vienna Friday.
	   The EU has not set no entry dates to the chagrin of Poland, the
Czech Republic and Hungary that are seen having the best chances in
the EU expansion sweepstakes and want to join four or five years.
	   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said a ``concrete
(entry) date can only be fixed when we see we can conclude the
expansion talks'' and after the EU has reformed its own finances.
	   On the latter, Austria _ which concludes its six-month EU
presidency Dec. 31 _ has made no progress because September
elections in Germany brought EU business to a standstill.
	   ``What we can expect from the Vienna summit is a lot of
positive, but vague language about EU expansion,'' said a European
Commission official.
	   That would leave it to Germany, which assumes the EU presidency
Jan. 1, to clinch a deal at a March summit. Fischer predicted final
agreement will come in ``last-minute negotiations.'' The main
problems are:
	   _ Money:
	   Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland fear they will lose money to
finance the entry of Cyprus and 10 East European nations and
recommend raising membership fees. But Germany, Austria, the
Netherlands and Sweden say they pay too much already and want to
freeze the EU budget, which totals 85 billion European currency
units (dlrs 100 billion) in 1998.
	   Britain negotiated an annual refund in 1984 _ when it was poorer
than today _ to offset its net payments. It refuses to give up its
rebate which totals 2.6 billion pounds (dlrs 4 billion) this year.
	   The European Commission has proposed to link EU spending to
economic growth which would add 20 billion ecu (dlrs 23.6 billion)
to the budget by 2006.
	   The budget is now funded by sales taxes and membership dues from
15 member nations. They can be asked to pay up to 1.27 percent of
their annual gross national product.
	   _ Agricultural Reform:
	   Subsidies guaranteeing the EU's 10 million farmers minimum
prices eat up half of the budget. The European Commission has
proposed cuts of up to 30 percent in subsidies, which just about
every government opposes. Equally unpopular is the suggestion to
pay farmers more from national coffers.
	   _ The speed of expansion:
	   The EU is negotiating with Cyprus, Poland, Hungary, the Czech
Republic, Slovenia and Estonia but refuses to set an entry date.
	   The Netherlands, Germany, France and Italy don't want a divided
Cyprus in at all.
	   Preliminary talks have begun with Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia,
Romania and Bulgaria. The European Commission says Latvia,
Lithuania and Slovakia do so well they should join the fast-track
talks. Germany and France oppose that.
	   _ Decision-making reforms and defense:
	   Britain, for one, long rejected an EU defense machinery,
majority voting in foreign policy and ending national vetoes to
accelerate decision-making. Last week, it endorsed an EU defense
dimension but there is no deal on a slew of institutional reforms.

Israel, Palestinians trade barbs in advance of Clinton visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Netanyahu &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Less than a week before U.S. President Bill
Clinton is to arrive for a visit meant to bolster a new
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, the two sides exchanged angry
accusations Sunday over Jewish settlements and street clashes.
	   Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian parliament, warned of
possible violence if Israel continues to expand settlements in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the Palestinians hope to establish
a state.
	   ``If settlement activity continues, then all means of resistance
are open,'' Qureia, who is also known as Abu Ala, told reporters in
the West Bank town of Ramallah.
	   Since the signing of a land-for-security accord, Jewish settlers
have accelerated the establishment of makeshift communities on West
Bank hilltops, in an explicit bid to keep the land from being
turned over to the Palestinians.
	   Meanwhile, at a meeting of the Israeli Cabinet, ministers
expressed dismay over an outbreak of street clashes between
Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli troops in the West Bank.
	   ``The Palestinians have been asked to immediately stop the
violence and incitement to violence,'' the Cabinet said in a
statement.
	   At least two Palestinians were injured Sunday in a confrontation
outside the Jewish settlement of Ariel in the northern West Bank.
Demonstrators threw stones at Israeli troops, who responded with
rubber bullets and tear gas.
	   A day earlier, 27 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers were
injured in similar clashes throughout the West Bank. And three days
before that, Israelis were horrified by television footage of an
Israeli soldier being dragged from a car and beaten with chunks of
concrete by a Palestinian mob.
	   Israel says Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority is
orchestrating the street fighting. The Palestinians deny that.
	   The past week's protests grew out of an increasingly bitter
dispute over Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
	   Israel last month freed 250 of 750 prisoners it is to release
under the Wye accords, but most were criminals. The Palestinians
are demanding that so-called security prisoners _ those being held
for anti-Israel activity _ be released instead.
	   Also Sunday, another quarrel was brewing over the scheduled
meeting of the Palestinian National Council, the Palestinian
parliament-in-exile, in the Gaza Strip during Clinton's visit.
	   At the gathering, the PNC and other Palestinians in attendance
are to reaffirm the nullification of clauses in their national
charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   Israel has demanded that the Palestinians hold an actual vote at
the meeting rather than simply proclaiming the charter changed, but
the Palestinians on Sunday repeated their objections to that.
	   ``They haven't the right to give us instructions,'' Arafat said
Sunday as he returned to Gaza following a trip to Europe.
	   Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian lands, which is to
begin Saturday, is meant to provide impetus to the U.S.-brokered
peace accords and encourage both sides to stick to a timetable for
compliance. But some commentators suggested the visit was proving a
polarizing force instead.
	   ``He is coming to promote the peace process... but his visit's
only actual result is a sharpening of the differences,'' Yosef
Lapid wrote in Sunday's editions of the Maariv newspaper.
	   In Israel, increasing concern is being voiced over Clinton's
planned visit to Gaza, the first ever by a sitting U.S. president.
At Sunday's Israeli Cabinet meeting, a shouting match broke out
over the issue, according to Israel radio.
	   ``Who invited President Clinton to the Gaza Strip?'' Silvan
Shalom, the science minister, reportedly yelled at Netanyahu.
Netanyahu said it had been Clinton's idea, not his.
	   The United States has repeatedly said the visit is not intended
as an endorsement of Palestinian statehood, but the Palestinians
see it as a powerful boost to their sovereignty hopes.
	   Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi said on Israeli television that the
invitation for a Clinton visit came from Israel and was ``warmly
welcomed'' by the Palestinians.

Netanyahu accuses Arafat of `making a farce' of Wye accords

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday
accused Yasser Arafat of ``making a farce'' of the Wye River
accords and said he would not agree to further troop withdrawals
until a halt to anti-Israel violence.
	   Netanyahu, in an interview with The Associated Press, said the
Palestinians were emboldened to foment street riots and threaten to
declare statehood because they believed they had the Clinton
administration ``in their back pocket.''
	   ``The Palestinians are making a farce out of the Wye River
accord. They think they have the United States in their back
pocket,'' said the Israeli leader. ``As long as that is the case,
they will not change their behavior.''
	   Netanyahu said he did not believe the United States was siding
with the Palestinians, but his sharply worded remarks sent a strong
signal that he would like President Bill Clinton to intervene and
lower Palestinian expectations prior to his Dec. 12-15 trip.
	   Palestinians claim it is Israel that has violated the summit
agreement reached in October by not freeing jailed political
activists, by confiscating West Bank land for roads and allowing
Jewish settlers to seize hilltops for expansion.
	   Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council and
the head of the peace team that negotiated the Oslo accords, told
reporters Sunday ``all means of resistance'' was justified in
opposing settler activity.
	   Netanyahu, who rejected claims of settlement expansion as
``bunk,'' was interviewed in the Cabinet room after a meeting of
his unruly coalition government, which rallied behind Netanyahu on
his tough stance.
	   But officials said Science Minister Silvan Shalom attacked him
for being too generous to the Palestinians by agreeing to the
Clinton visit next week to Gaza and the West Bank.
	   ``We are not going to give up territory when there are
violations of the agreement and attempts to get things that weren't
achieved at Wye using violence,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Israel has threatened to scrap the next Israeli troop pullback,
which is scheduled for Dec. 18, three days after Clinton's
departure. The United States has said it should go ahead as
scheduled.
	   Palestinians see the Clinton trip as implicit recognition of
their struggle for statehood, even though Clinton has specifically
said in an interview aired on Israel's Channel 2 television that it
should not be read that way.
	   Netanyahu made clear that he would be annoyed if Air Force One
landed at the newly opened Palestinian airport in Gaza, which aides
said would be viewed as a strong symbol of support for Palestinian
demands for sovereignty.
	   ``We will be very disappointed if that is the case. We've said
to the United States that we don't think that is necessary,''
Netanyahu said of reports that Clinton's plane would land in Gaza.
	   He said traveling by motorcade would be quicker and more
politically considerate. ``Unless somebody wants to put a thumb in
our eye, I think there are better ways to travel,'' Netanyahu said.
	   In the interview, Netanyahu stressed that he opposed Palestinian
statehood and demanded that Arafat stop threatening to declare
independence on May 4, 1999, when the Palestinians maintain the
Oslo accords expire.
	   ``What must be is that Yasser Arafat retracts this open and
incipient violation of the Oslo and Wye River accords and recommits
himself to negotiating until we get white smoke, until we get a
solution. That's the only way we'll get a real peace between Israel
and the Palestinians,'' Netanyahu said.
	   In a conciliatory speech in Sweden over the weekend, Arafat
stressed that he sought a negotiated settlement and did not mention
May 4 as a deadline. He also said any Palestinian state would not
make alliances with states hostile to Israel _ one of Netanyahu's
key concerns.
	   The Israeli leader is also demanding that Arafat drop claims
that Netanyahu promised at Wye to release 750 Palestinians jailed
for anti-Israel attacks that resulted in bloodshed, rather than
freeing car thieves and petty criminals.
	   Each side has a different interpretation of the understanding
regarding the prisoners. Netanyahu maintains he never agreed to
free those with ``blood on their hands.''
	   ``It's high time that Yasser Arafat admits this was agreed upon
and that he's not going to make demands on Israel, including the
incitement of violence,...on a trumped-up charge, '' he said.
``Israel never promised to release murders at Wye, and it won't
release them.''
	   The issue has been the focal point for a new wave of violent
protests and demonstrations in the West Bank and a hunger strike
that began Saturday by the 1,700 Palestinian inmates.
	   Israel is also upset by statements that the nearly 600-member
Palestinian National Council will not reaffirm in a vote that
anti-Israel clauses in the Palestinian charter have been deleted.
Netanyahu maintained that only 25 members out of hundreds who live
abroad had been invited so far.
	   Netanyahu quoted Clinton as telling him that the purpose of his
visit was to ``personally make sure that they actually rescind this
charter that calls for Israel's destruction.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday
accused Yasser Arafat of ``making a farce'' of the Wye River
accords and said he would not agree to further troop withdrawals
until anti-Israel violence is halted.
	   Netanyahu, in an interview with The Associated Press, said the
Palestinians were emboldened to foment street riots and threaten to
declare statehood because they believed they had the administration
of U.S. President Bill Clinton ``in their back pocket.''

Investigation says prize-winning drugs documentary a fake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A prize-winning British television documentary
about drug running from Colombia which was shown around the world,
was a fake, an investigation has concluded.
	   Makers of ``The Connection,'' parts of which were aired on the
CBS program ``60 Minutes,'' paid actors to portray drugs dealers,
faked locations, and falsely claimed there was a new heroin route
from Colombia to Britain, the investigation found, London's
Guardian newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The documentary, made by a British production company, Carlton
Communications, for the British network Independent Television, was
investigated after The Guardian challenged its authenticity in a
series of articles in May.
	   The report by a panel of lawyers and independent TV producers
was released at the weekend.
	   The Independent Television Commission, the regulatory body for
ITV, said the report was ``thorough.''
	   In a statement, the commission said the report ``points clearly
to the fact that the program was, in important respects, in breach
of the ITC's Program Code.''
	   The Guardian said Carlton Communications broadcasting director
Nigel Walmsley is sending back eight national and international
awards won by the documentary.
	   ``We are refunding overseas broadcasters who bought ``The
Connection'','' The Guardian quoted Walmsley as saying.
	   The film showed a drug ``mule'' purportedly carrying millions of
dollars worth of heroin to London for Colombia's Cali drug cartel.
	   The inquiry panel said there was no evidence the ``mule'' was
carrying heroin ``rather than sugar, flour or mints.''
	   A man interviewed with his face covered and described as the
financial controller of the Cali Cartel was an actor _ as were the
``mule'' and another key character, the drug loader, the panel
said.
	   One interview which purported to take place in a jungle hideout
with a drugs baron actually took place in the hotel room of
producer Marc de Beaufort, said the panel.
	   The panel concluded that only de Beaufort, a cameraman and a
researcher could have known of most of the fakery.
	   But the panel said it could not determine whether de Beaufort
knew of all the false elements in the program.
	   ``The inquiry is obviously entitled to its own conclusions, yet
I find it hard to believe the characters in the film were acting
their parts,'' de Beaufort said in a statement.
	   He called the conclusion about the actors ``untenable,'' and
blamed his researcher, Adriana Quintana, for the ``alleged
fakery.''

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The military leader who has launched
Nigeria on an ambitious path toward civilian rule proclaimed on
Sunday that ``democracy is here to stay,'' following local
elections that drew a large and enthusiastic voter turnout.
	   The elections, seen as the first step in Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar's plan to hand over power by May next year, were praised
by U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley, the most senior American
official to visit this sprawling West African country since the
rule of the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   Abubakar met Daley and a delegation of senior U.S. executives at
his state residence in the capital, Abuja.
	   ``Democracy is here to stay and it will stay,'' Abubakar said in
a soft voice that drew smiles and nods of approval from the
American audience.
	   ``This is the first step in our democratization program and I'm
happy to say that quite a lot of people turned out,'' he said.
	   Daley praised the elections as a sign that Nigerians are willing
to bring about serious reforms and ``join the international
community every day of the year.''
	   Saturday's vote was seen as a trial run before state and
presidential elections between now and February. Inauguration
ceremonies for the new civilian president are planned for May 29.
	   Daley said the United States was contemplating sending more
senior delegations to expand ties with Africa's most populous
country, which for years has been plagued by corruption, ethnic
divisions and military meddling. Early next year the United States
is expected to review aid sanctions imposed on Nigeria because of
its poor record in fighting drug trafficking, a member of Daley's
team said.
	   The U.S. delegation, which visited three other African countries
over the past week, spent less than six hours in Nigeria before
flying back to Washington.
	   A U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that
President Bill Clinton may attend Nigeria's presidential
inauguration ceremonies.
	   Saturday's local government elections drew a huge turnout. More
than 50 million people were registered for the vote, and voting was
monitored by foreign observers and local human rights groups.
	   The mood was mainly positive although logistical difficulties
hampered voting in a number of areas and at least six people were
reportedly killed in a clash between supporters of two parties at a
voting station near Warri, about 200 kilometers (125 miles)
southeast of the commercial capital of Lagos.
	   A leaderless coalition of former opponents of Abacha, who died
suddenly in June, was leading early results gathered overnight,
officials said Sunday.
	   The Peoples' Democratic Party, a grouping of 34 traditional
chiefs, academics, businessmen and ex-generals, was the top
vote-getter in most of Nigeria's 36 states, several National
Electoral Commission officials said on condition of anonymity.
	   The party has a murky platform and no leader, although former
military ruler Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo has donated dlrs 2.5 million
to the party and is campaigning for the party's presidential
nomination.
	   Obasanjo and the PDP appeared to be a compromise choice offering
military stability with increased civilian participation.
	   Obasanjo had assumed control in 1976 after military leader Gen.
Murtala Muhammed died in a failed coup attempt. Obasanjo became the
only military ruler to relinquish power and retired in 1979.
	   He has strong support in the predominantly Muslim north, the
power base for the Nigerian military, which has ruled for all but
10 years since independence from Britain in 1960.
	   Preliminary election results showed strong results for two other
new political entities _ the All Peoples' Party and the Alliance
for Democracy, which includes some members of political parties
formerly allied to Abacha, electoral officials said.
	   Only parties that obtain at least 5 percent of Saturday's vote
in 24 of Nigeria's 36 states will be allowed to participate in
February's presidential poll.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Older people who weathered
apartheid's storms were more likely to register than younger people
as the first push to create a multiracial voters roll ended on
Sunday, preliminary figures showed.
	   About 23 percent of South Africa's voters _ or 5.8 million _
have been entered into the central computers of the Independent
Electoral Commission over the past week and a half.
	   The tally was expected to reach 9 to 10 million _ or 36 to 40
percent _ after information from outlying areas is gathered, said
Lydia Young of the IEC.
	   The massive registration effort is seen as a test of South
Africa's ability to hold free and fair elections next year _ only
the second since the end of white rule.
	   About 10 percent in the 18 to 20 year bracket signed up, a trend
that IEC chairman Johann Kriegler called alarming. Even fewer _
about 2 percent _ signed up in the 16 to 18 year catogory, where
only those who turn 18 by the elections may vote.

Lazio stuns Juventus on the road on a late goal by Salas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds; UPDATES with detail &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Chilean striker Marcelo Salas revived
Lazio's title hopes and pushed two-time defending league champion
Juventus on the brink of a severe crisis as he scored a late game
winner for the Roman team in Sunday's big match of the Italian
Serie A.
	   Salas' goal, with nine minutes left at Turin's Delle Alpi arena,
gave Lazio a 1-0 victory and 17 points overall, eight behind leader
Fiorentina which downed Bologna on a goal by its Argentine striker
Gabriel Batistuta in one of the three first division matches played
Saturday.
	   It was Lazio's second victory on the road this season while
injury-crippled Juventus suffered its third defeat in the last four
league matches, extending its winless streak to one month.
	   Juventus, missing its stellar forward Alessandro Del Piero and
forced to start a teen-age keeper from the junior teams, slipped to
fifth place with 18 points, in a tie with another struggling great
Internazionale of Milan.
	   Inter, with new coach Mircea Lucescu on the bench and its
Brazilian star Ronaldo fielded only in the last 15 minutes, was
lucky to escape defeat at Vicenza.
	   Young French defender Mickael Silvestre kicked in the 1-1
equalizer in second-half injury time to even a first-half penalty
kick by Pasquale Luiso.
	   At San Siro stadium AC Milan, coming from a 0-4 rout by Parma in
the previous round, downed Udinese 3-0 and moved to fourth place
with 21 points, one behind AS Roma and Parma which were tied for
the second spot.
	   Roma trounced Perugia 5-1 at the Olympic stadium and Parma
downed Sampdoria 2-0 at Genoa on Saturday.
	   Goals for AC Milan were tallied by its international strikers
George Weah, Leonardo and Oliver Bierhoff.
	   In other matches Sunday, last-place Venezia upset Cagliari 1-0
on the road; Piacenza and Empoli played to a goalless draw; Bari
scored an injury time equalizer for a 2-2 draw at Salernitana.
 &UR; Juventus-Lazio 0-1 &QC; 
	   Salas scored his fourth and perhaps most important season goal
as he outdribbled Juventus defender Mark Iuliano and kicked the
ball past teenage keeper Morgan De Sanctis from a few meters.
	   De Sanctis made his Serie A debut in a crucial match as Juventus
regular goalies Angelo Peruzzi and Michelangelo Rampulla were both
injured in last Wednesday's Champions League match against
Galatasaray in Istanbul.
	   Salas' goal, which improved Lazio's record to 4-5-3, came as
Juventus steadily pressed on the attack to capture its first
victory since Nov. 1.
	   The fourth loss of the season came on the eve of Juventus'
crucial Champions League game against Rosenborg. The Turin team
must defeat the Norwegians on Wednesday and hope of a defeat of
Galatasaray by Athletic Bibao to qualify for the quarterfinals.
	   In injury time, Juventus' French star Zinedine Zidane missed the
equalizer by a few inches with a powerful drive. Minutes before
Salas' goal a header by the French midfielder had been saved by
Lazio's goalie Luca Marchegiani with a miracle dive.
 &UR; Vicenza-Inter 1-1
	   An overly nervous and unimpressive Inter earned an undeserved
draw against Vicenza, after losing to Lazio 2-1 an Italian Cup
match last Thursday.
	   Vicenza wasted several scoring chances during the first half and
was overly punished in the 92nd by Silvestre who was quick to kick
in a rebound on a free kick by Ronaldo.
	   The Brazilian star, who's nursing a knee tendinitis, was fielded
in the final minutes for his first appearance in four weeks.
	   Silvestre was a second half substitute for Nigerian defender
Taribo West, who tossed his jersey at Lucescu as he left the field
angered.
	   Lucescu debuted on Inter's bench in the Italian Cup Thursday as
substitute for dismissed Italian veteran coach Gigi Simoni. The new
coach did not immediately change for the better Inter's
questionable play and results.
	   Inter's Chilean striker Ivan Zamorano was sent off the field for
kicking an opponent as both teams were one player down for most of
the second half.
	   Vicenza was reduced to nine players, and also had coach Franco
Colomba expelled, in the four tumultuous injury time minutes.
 &UR; AC Milan-Udinese 3-0
	   Brazilian star Leonardo, used by AC Milan part-time so far
because of a sore groin, was the hero of the day as he scored one
goal and set up another at San Siro stadium. He received a standing
ovation when he was substututed with ten minutes left.
	   Liberian striker Weah opened the scoring with a diagonal shot in
the 22nd minute, following a personal action. Leonardo made it two
in the 40th with a powerful drive from the penalty area edge. He
then fed Bierhoff for Milan's third goal, which ended a seven-week
scoring drought of the German forward.
 &UR; Salernitana-Bari 2-2
	   An injury time goal by Danish forward Peter Knudsen extended
Bari's unbeaten streak. Bari, which clinched its ninth season draw
at Salernitana, is the only Serie A team to have lost a single
match so far this season.
 &UR; Saturday's games &QC; 
 &UR;  &UR; Fiorentina-Bologna 1-0
	   Batistuta tallied the game winner on a second half free kick. It
was Batistuta's 16th season goal, his 12th in league matches.
	   Fiorentina has a three-point lead over runner-ups Roma and
Parma, at 25 points, with a record of 8-1-3.
 &UR; AS Roma-Perugia 5-1
	   Roma rallied from a first-half 0-1 deifict on goals by its young
forwards Francesco Totti, Marco Delvecchio, Daniele Conti and
Carmine Gautieri.
	   It was Roma's sixth home victory at the Olympic stadium.
 &UR; Sampdoria-Parma 0-2
	   Parma captured its first season victory on the road on two goals
by Italian striker Enrico Chiesa, a former player of La Samp.

Despite loss, Springboks still the best
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ South Africa's attempt to set a world record 18
wins in a row ended in a 13-7 defeat to England. Amid the gloom of
that loss at the end of a demanding year, the Springboks still have
something to cheer.
	   They are still the best rugby union team in the world.
	   After victories over Wales, Scotland and Ireland, Nick Mallett's
team went into Saturday's match at Twickenham aiming for a Grand
Slam of victories over the British Isles nations and a world record
streak but came up short.
	   Perhaps jaded after 10 months of almost continuous rugby, they
were outplayed by the English and had no arguments about losing.
	   But the Springboks still return home as heroes.
	   ``Our record speaks for itself,'' said team captain Gary
Teichmann. We won 17 games before today and the team still has to
reach its full potential.
	   ``There is no doubt in my mind that the best is yet to come.
We've got a six-month break and we will be back stronger than
ever.''
	   Those words will alert the Australians and New Zealand All
Blacks as they look ahead to next year's World Cup in October.
France, who lost at home to Australia last month, also should be
aware that the South Africans will be strongly favored to hold on
to their world title.
	   England, at least, knows it is capable of beating them.
	   After dire performances against Italy (a narrow 23-15 win) and
Australia (a 12-11 loss), Lawrence Dallaglio's team produced its
best rugby since tying 26-26 with the All Blacks a year ago.
	   The forwards outshoved the Springbok pack and the backs, despite
having to make five changes during the match, survived a second
half battering from the South Africans and didn't concede a try for
71 minutes after Pieter Roussow's opening score.
	   From 7-0 down, England hit back with Jeremy Guscott's try,
converted by Matt Dawson, and the scrum half recovered from an
earlier miss to kick two long-range penalties in the last quarter
of the match to clinch a hard-earned victory which may make England
favorite to win the Five Nations next February and March.
	   ``We are not getting carried away with this one result, because
we always believed we could do it,'' Dallaglio said.
	   ``Sure, we needed to prove that the self-belief was justified,
but there is enormous need for improvement. We are trying to become
a team that sustains quality and goes for the jugular instead of
sitting back on a lead.
	   ``We must make sure that we score more tries, and I rank England
as a side who are capable of rising to the occasion _ but not
consistently. We hope to change that.
	   ``If you are going to be a great side you have to perform better
than we did. Just because we beat the Springboks we don't inherit
their crown after their 17 Test wins.''

Opposition marks human rights anniversary in Belarus

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Several hundred opponents of President
Alexander Lukashenko gathered near his official residence Sunday to
commemorate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
	   Although police had ordered the rally moved to another square in
the center of the city, the demonstrators went ahead with the rally
at Oktyabryskaya Square, about 200 meters (yards) from Lukashenko's
residence.
	   Five people were arrested by plainclothes officers, opposition
officials said. It was not clear what the charges were against
them. Organizers of the rally also complained that they were
summoned to police headquarters before the rally.
	   ``The attitude of the authorities to this rally shows that in
this country there is no power of law, but the power of force. The
human rights of life, information and law are violated in
Belarus,'' said Youri Khadyka, deputy chairman of the Popular
Front, the main opposition organization.
	   In speeches at the rally, opposition leaders complained that
Lukashenko, an authoritarian president who would like to revive the
Soviet Union, has consistently violated human rights.
	   Oleg Belyavsky, the main organizer of the protest, charged that
500 people had been unjustly arrested or beaten by authorities this
year, and that thousands of people have been politically repressed
over the past four years of Lukashenko's rule.
	   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the
U.N. General Assembly on Dec. 10, 1948.

Stephen Hawking joins the cast of `The Simpsons'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Physicist Stephen Hawking, author of ``A Brief
History of Time,'' flew to Hollywood for a role in ``The Simpsons''
television series and managed to wow Bart, Homer and Lisa, a
British newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Hawking, who holds the Cambridge University post once held by
Sir Isaac Newton, plays himself, complete with ``supercharged
wheelchair'' and his distinctive electronic voice, reported The
Independent on Sunday.
	   Bart _ ``an underachiever and proud of it'' _ his father Homer
and sister Lisa were ``overawed'' by Hawking, the newspaper
reported.
	   ``He comes in to make a commentary on the universe as a whole
and intellectuals,'' producer Bonnie Patila, was quoted as saying.
``He plays himself _ it's a show that has to do with intellectuals
and we don't know anyone more intellectual than him.''
	   ``Everyone wanted to meet him,'' said Ms. Patila. ``We are all
huge fans _ he was great fun.''
	   Friends said the academic ``greatly enjoyed'' his Hollywood
experience and would like to get more acting parts, the newspaper
said.
	   Hawking flew to Hollywood last week to film the single episode,
which is to be broadcast in the spring.
	   The professor suffers from Lou Gehrig's Disease, which affects
the motor skills and he uses an electronic synthesizer to speak.

Police detain some 100 pro-Kurdish supporters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Police on Sunday rounded up some 200
members of a pro-Kurdish party who began a three-day hunger strike
to protest a police crackdown on their party.
	   The strikers were taking part in a nationwide protest by the
People's Democracy Party, HADEP, to denounce police raids on party
buildings and the arrest of their leader, Murat Bozlak, said party
official Mehmet Nuri Gunes.
	   The protestors were taken away during hunger strikes in
Istanbul, in northwestern Tekirdag and in three southeastern
cities, Gunes said.
	   Police has been tough on the party since the detention in Rome
last month of rebel Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan.
	   Thousands of HADEP members protesting Turkish demands for his
extradition were taken into custody over the past weeks. Most were
later released, but some 300 of them, including Bozlak, have been
formally arrested on charges of separatist propaganda.
	   Ocalan's group has been fighting for autonomy in the southeast
since 1984 in a war that has claimed 37,000 lives.

Animals rights hunger striker reportedly near death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An imprisoned animal rights activist is near death
on the 60th day of a hunger strike to demand a government-appointed
inquiry into experiments using animals, The Observer newspaper
reported Sunday.
	   The newspaper, which said it smuggled a tape into the hospital,
described Nigel Horne, 46, as almost blind, deaf in one ear, and
with his internal organs disintegrating.
	   Horne's militant group, the Animal Liberation Front, said he
would be Britain's first martyr of animal rights.
	   His claim to martyrdom, however, provoked sharp criticism from
owners of stores attacked by Horne in a series of bombing campaigns
to highlight garments or cosmetics in which animal skins or animal
testing was used.
	   Horne, a former garbage collector, was jailed for 18 years in
1997 for a bombing stores in south England and causing millions of
pounds (dollars) worth of damage. Stores hit included Boots, a
nationwide drug chain, and a charity shop in aid of cancer
research.
	   ``I want to die. This is the end. In death you win,'' The
Observer quoted Horne as saying from his bed in a hospital in York,
180 miles (300 kms) north of London.
	   Sports shop owner Nigel Young, whose store on the Isle of Wight
off the English south coast was destroyed by fire, said Horne's
attack was attempted murder.
	   Horne has been on two previous hunger strikes _ one lasting 35
days and one 46 days.
	   He is demanding that the 19-month-old Labor Party government
implement a pledge in its election manifesto to appoint an inquiry
into animal testing.
	   The government recently banned the use of animals in the testing

Lazio stuns Juventus on the road on a late goal by Salas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds; UPDATES throughout wwith detail &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Chilean striker Marcelo Salas revived
Lazio's title hopes and pushed two-time defending league champion
Juventus on the brink of a severe crisis as he scored a late game
winner for the Roman team in Sunday's big match of the Italian
Serie A.
	   Salas' goal, with nine minutes left at Turin's Delle Alpi arena,
gave Lazio a 1-0 victory and 17 points overall, eight behind leader
Fiorentina which downed Bologna on a goal by its Argentine striker
Gabriel Batistuta in one of the three first division matches played
Saturday.
	   It was Lazio's second victory on the road this season while
injury-crippled Juventus suffered its third defeat in the last four
league matches, extending its winless streak to one month.
	   Juventus, missing its stellar forward Alessandro Del Piero and
forced to start a teen-age keeper from the junior teams, slipped to
fifth place with 18 points, in a tie with another struggling great
Internazionale of Milan.
	   Inter, with new coach Mircea Lucescu on the bench and its
Brazilian star Ronaldo fielded only in the last 15 minutes, was
lucky to escape defeat at Vicenza.
	   Young French defender Mickael Silvestre kicked in the 1-1
equalizer in second-half injury time to even a first-half penalty
kick by Pasquale Luiso.
	   At San Siro stadium AC Milan, coming from a 0-4 rout by Parma in
the previous round, downed Udinese 3-0 and moved to fourth place
with 21 points, one behind AS Roma and Parma which were tied for
the second spot.
	   Roma trounced Perugia 5-1 at the Olympic stadium and Parma
downed Sampdoria 2-0 at Genoa on Saturday.
	   Goals for AC Milan were tallied by its international strikers
George Weah, Leonardo and Oliver Bierhoff.
	   In other matches Sunday, last-place Venezia upset Cagliari 1-0
on the road; Piacenza and Empoli played to a goalless draw; Bari
scored an injury time equalizer for a 2-2 draw at Salernitana.
 &UR; Juventus-Lazio 0-1 &QC; 
	   Salas scored his fourth and perhaps most important season goal
as he outdribbled Juventus defender Mark Iuliano and kicked the
ball past teenage keeper Morgan De Sanctis from a few meters.
	   De Sanctis made his Serie A debut in a crucial match as Juventus
regular goalies Angelo Peruzzi and Michelangelo Rampulla were both
injured in last Wednesday's Champions League match against
Galatasaray in Istanbul.
	   Salas' goal, which improved Lazio's record to 4-5-3, came as
Juventus steadily pressed on the attack to capture its first
victory since Nov. 1.
	   The fourth loss of the season came on the eve of Juventus'
crucial Champions League game against Rosenborg. The Turin team
must defeat the Norwegians on Wednesday and hope of a defeat of
Galatasaray by Athletic Bibao to qualify for the quarterfinals.
	   In injury time, Juventus' French star Zinedine Zidane missed the
equalizer by a few inches with a powerful drive. Minutes before
Salas' goal a header by the French midfielder had been saved by
Lazio's goalie Luca Marchegiani with a miracle dive.
 &UR; Vicenza-Inter 1-1 &QC; 
	   An overly nervous and unimpressive Inter earned an undeserved
draw against Vicenza, after losing to Lazio 2-1 an Italian Cup
match last Thursday.
	   Vicenza wasted several scoring chances during the first half and
was overly punished in the 92nd by Silvestre who was quick to kick
in a rebound on a free kick by Ronaldo.
	   The Brazilian star, who's nursing a knee tendinitis, was fielded
in the final minutes for his first appearance in four weeks.
	   Silvestre was a second half substitute for Nigerian defender
Taribo West, who tossed his jersey at Lucescu as he left the field
in anger.
	   Lucescu debuted on Inter's bench in the Italian Cup on Thursday
as substitute for dismissed Italian veteran coach Gigi Simoni. The
new coach did not immediately change Inter's questionable play.
	   Inter's Chilean striker Ivan Zamorano was sent off the field for
kicking an opponent as both teams were one player down for most of
the second half.
	   Vicenza was reduced to nine players, and also had coach Franco
Colomba expelled, in the four tumultuous injury time minutes.
 &UR; AC Milan-Udinese 3-0 &QC; 
	   Brazilian star Leonardo, used by AC Milan part-time so far
because of a sore groin, was the hero of the day as he scored one
goal and set up another at San Siro stadium. He received a standing
ovation when he was substituted with ten minutes left.
	   Liberian striker Weah opened the scoring with a diagonal shot in
the 22nd minute, following a personal action. Leonardo made it two
in the 40th with a powerful drive from the penalty area edge. He
then fed Bierhoff for Milan's third goal, which ended a seven-week
scoring drought of the German forward.
 &UR; Salernitana-Bari 2-2 &QC; 
	   An injury time goal by Danish forward Peter Knudsen extended
Bari's unbeaten streak. Bari, which clinched its ninth season draw
at Salernitana, is the only Serie A team to have lost a single
match so far this season.
 &UR; Saturday's games &QC; 
 &UR; Fiorentina-Bologna 1-0
	   Batistuta tallied the game winner on a second half free kick. It
was Batistuta's 16th season goal, his 12th in league matches.
	   Fiorentina has a three-point lead over runner-ups Roma and
Parma, at 25 points, with a record of 8-1-3.
 &UR; AS Roma-Perugia 5-1 &QC; 
	   Roma rallied from a first-half 0-1 deficit on goals by its young
forwards Francesco Totti, Marco Delvecchio, Daniele Conti and
Carmine Gautieri.
	   It was Roma's sixth home victory at the Olympic stadium.
 &UR; Sampdoria-Parma 0-2 &QC; 
	   Parma captured its first season victory on the road on two goals
by Italian striker Enrico Chiesa, a former player of La Samp.

AEK loses to Kavala, Olympiakos takes lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Giorgos Nassiopoulos scored one goal and
Leszek Pisz added another as provincial Kavala beat AEK Athens 2-1
Sunday in a game for the Greek first division soccer league.
	   The loss, AEK's second of the season, sent defending champion
Olympiakos Piraeus to the top of the standings with 28 points from
12 games.
	   AEK dropped to second place with 26 points, one ahead crosstown
Panathinaikos.
	   On Saturday, Olympiakos beat Panathinaikos 4-2 in a game marred
by crowd violence.
	   Hooligans stoned policemen before the start of the match while
Panathinaikos supporters ripped up plastic seats at Athens' Olympic
stadium and threw them at Olympiakos fans at the end of the game.
	   At least 10 people were injured in the incidents.
	   Nassiopoulos stunned some 2,500 AEK supporters at the stadium
when his header off a center from Lucas Karadimos gave Kavala the
lead in the 9th minute.
	   It was Kavala's first attack in the game played in the northern
town of the same name.
	   One minute later, AEK came close to level but goalminder
Panagiotis Logaras made a key save to a shot by Demis Nikolaidis.
	   Five minutes into the second half, Logaras rushed outside his
area to stop a solo attack by Nikolaidis.
	   Polish midfielder Pisz made the score 2-0 for the hosts with a
left-footed free-kick from 25 meters (yards) in the 53rd.
	   AEK reacted, but only managed to narrow the difference with Toni
Savevski in the 69th minute
	   Vassilis Karapialis scored two second half goals as Olympiakos
made a comeback to beat Panathinaikos 4-2.
	   Playing before 40,000 spectators, Panathinaikos dominated the
first period and Olympiakos the second.
	   The Athens club pushed from the opening kickoff and came close
to open the scoring on three occasions, all denied by Olympiakos
goalie Dimitris Eleftheropoulos.
	   The hosts took the lead in the 29th with a powerful shot by
Costas Constantinidis from inside the area.
	   Three minutes later, Polish striker Krzysztof Warzycha made it
2-0 off a cross from Blendar Kola.
	   Olympiakos hit back with a goal from Sinisa Gogic in the 40th.
His weak shot deflected off defender Giorgos Alexopoulos before
entering the goalmouth.
	   The visitors became more aggressive in the second half and
levelled with a shot from the edge of the box by Karapialis in the
51st.
	   In the 64th, Angelos Bassinas saw his second yellow card,
forcing Panathinaikos to play the rest of the game with 10 men.
	   Taking advantage, Olympiakos besieged Panathinaikos' area and
took the lead with a header by Giorgos Anatolakis off a free-kick
by Serbian midfielder Predrag Djordjevic in the 71st.
	   Karapialis sealed the victory with a lob from outside the area
in injury time.

Eighth electric worker dies during Hurricane Georges repairs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ An electric worker died while
handling a line in the southern Puerto Rican town of Yauco,
bringing to eight the number of linemen killed while repairing
hurricane-damaged lines.
	   Alexander Sinigaglia Gonzalez, 36, died Saturday while trying to
lift a downed 110-volt line, police said.
	   His colleague, Javier Huerta Vega, 27, tried to help Sinigaglia
and suffered severe burns. Huerta remained in a Yauco hospital in
critical condition Sunday. Three other workers were unhurt.
	   Yauco and other southern communities were worst hit by Hurricane
Georges on Sept. 21, and many pockets are still without
electricity. Last week, the city of Ponce said it was dedicating
its city festival this year to electric workers who have died while
repairing lines.

Gibraltar police arrest Spanish far-right leader for removing flag
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGECIRAS, Spain (AP) _ Police in Gibraltar arrested a far-right
leader and six other rightists after they replaced a British flag
with a Spanish one to press their claims that Spain should be
sovereign over its former colony, authorities said Sunday.
	   Ricardo Saenz de Ynestrillas, 33, who leads the far-right
Alliance for National Unity, was held at the police station in the
British colony of Gibraltar. The rest of the detained were not
identified.
	   ``The flag that waves there is not the right one,'' AUN
spokeswoman Marisa Alonso said. ``It should be ours.''
	   Gibraltar, situated on Spain's southern tip, has bedeviled
relations between Spain and Britain since the land was ceded to
Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713.

<TEXT>
	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ A Russian-flagged Italian survey ship
rescued 52 clandestine African immigrants from rough waters south
of Malta, but navy officials said Sunday there was little hope of
finding five missing people.
	   Authorities in Valletta, where the immigrants arrived Sunday,
said the immigrants had been aboard a rickety wooden boat for two
days without food or water.
	   Survivors told police and military officials that their voyage
of hope had begun in various African ports where they were picked
up a ship. But after some days, the crew put them in the wooden
craft and abandoned them, the officials said.
	   When crew aboard the ship that came to their aid told them they
would be taken aboard, the immigrants, too anxious to wait, jumped
into the waters about 90 miles south of Malta and started swimming
toward the Akademia Nicolas Starakov, which then plucked them up.
	   The would-be immigrants were apparently hoping originally to
reach Sicily, reports indicated.
	   Thousands of people try to slip into Italy illegally to seek
work or families in Western Europe. Italy's long, largely
unpatrolled coasts attract smugglers, who pull up to beaches during
the night and drop off the immigrants who have paid thousands of
dollars for the voyage.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUN CITY, South Africa (AP) _ Nick Price held off a charge by
Tiger Woods to win his third Million Dollar Challenge in a
thrilling five-hole playoff Sunday.
	   The 41-year-old Price birdied on the 374-meter (409-yard) par-4
17th for his third win at the tournament after Woods, whose ball
was just off the edge, had to two-putt the hole.
	   Price called Woods, who at 22 is old enough to be his son, a
``phenomenal player.''
	   ``To go 77 holes of a championship and it comes down to one putt
is about as good as it gets. I don't know what we're going to do
next year for an encore,'' Price said.
	   Woods, plagued during the tournament by bad breaks on his
putting, fought his way back after an opening round par-72. He
started the day four strokes back but charged hard on the back
nine, with an 18-foot putt to birdie on 17 and another birdie on
the 422-meter (462-yard) 18th hole.
	   At the final hole, Price, leading the field at 15 under, was up
a stroke. He two-putted for par. But then Woods, his ball about 20
feet (6 meters) away on the fringe, used a sand wedge to sink
another 18-footer. (5 meters) He pumped his trademark uppercut into
the air, and went into the sudden-death playoff.
	   ``I had no choice. I had to make that shot,'' Woods said. ``I
knew I hit it on the line. I wasn't sure I had the pace or not. ...
As it kept rolling, kept rolling, about 3 feet from the hole, it
looked like it had a really good chance and then it went right in
center,'' Woods said of the shot.
	   ``The two birdies he made on 17 and 18 speak volumes for the
guy,'' Price said. ``Obviously to have beaten something like Tiger,
it makes it a little special. He's a phenomenon,'' he said. ``I've
got a great future behind me. He's going to win plenty.''
	   It was the first appearance by Woods in the tournament, and in
Africa for that matter. He was greeted as a hero by South Africa's
majority black population and mobbed at each of the holes.
	   Disappointed at losing, Woods _ who earned dlrs 250,000 _ the
birdies on 17 and 18 gave him a sense of achievement.
	   Woods missed something else in the playoff _ his plane for
Australia, where he will play in the President's Cup this week with
Jack Nicklaus as captain.
	   ``Jack won't be very happy,'' Woods joked.
	   Price, the defending champion and course record-holder with a
24-under in 1993, started the round four strokes back, after
leading for the first-two rounds. But the Zimbabwean, who treats
this course like home, surged back Sunday with eight birdies,
including six in a row from holes 9-14.
	   Only David Frost has won the Million Dollar Challenge three
times.
	   Justin Leonard finished third, a stroke behind, with a 3-under
69 at the 7,597-yard (6,947-meter) Gary Player Country Club course.
	   European sensation Lee Westwood, who had grabbed the lead
Saturday from Price, shot his worst round of the tournament, a 73,
and finished with a combined 276, even with two-time major winner
Mark O'Meara, whose final round was a 68.
	   Jim Furyk tied the course record of 64 set four years ago by
Nick Faldo, but finished in the bottom half along with Tom Watson,
Colin Montgomerie, David Duval and Jesper Parnevik _ who still
picked up checks for dlrs 100,000.

Former Italian premier opposes asylum for Ocalan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Silvio Berlusconi, the former
conservative Italian premier, declared his opposition to possible
Italian political asylum to rebel Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan,
the Anatolia news agency has reported.
	   In a letter sent to Serdar Denktash, the deputy premier of the
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state, Berlusconi said the Italian
government should give up ``protecting Ocalan,'' Anatolia said
Saturday.
	   ``The leftist government in power is putting the traditional
friendship and a history of cooperation between Turkey and Italy at
risk by protecting a terrorist and forgetting how Italy suffered
from terrorism in the past,'' Anatolia quoted from the letter.

New massacre as prime minister prepares exit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to move up total death toll, ADDS background, TRIMS
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Muslim militants slashed the throats of
seven people in a mountain town overnight, authorities said Sunday,
raising to 52 the death toll from the latest wave of violence.
	   But Algeria's embattled prime minister, in a televised
state-of-the-nation address before Parliament, insisted the nearly
7-year-old insurgency was under control and that his painful
economic reforms were making progress.
	   The victims were killed ``with savagery'' Saturday night in the
town of Merad, near Tipaza, 100 kms (60 miles) west of the capital,
a brief government statement said.
	   Hospital officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
militants slashed the seven to death, and they shot and wounded
five people who tried to flee.
	   The deaths were part of the latest round of attacks by militants
that began last Wednesday, in a nearly 7-year-old insurgency
against the military-backed government. More than 75,000 people
have died.
	   Barely two weeks before the holy month of Ramadan _ a
characteristically bloody period during the insurgency _ the
violence also preceded the speech Sunday afternoon by Prime
Minister Ahmed Ouyahia.
	   In his two-hour talk, Ouyahia argued the country's security
situation ``is constantly improving.'' He has drawn derision for
insisting the insurgency was only ``residual terrorism.''
	   But Ouyahia also told the lawmakers of the need for ``vigilance
and mobilization.''
	   Ouyahia, in power since January 1996, did not mention his
expected departure from office ahead of an early presidential
election slated for April.
	   But an official source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the prime minister was likely to announce his resignation Thursday.
Ouyahia is seen as a potential candidate for the election President
Liamine Zeroual announced Sept. 11. Zeroual is not running.
	   Sen. Smail Hamdani, a former ambassador to France considered a
technocrat without strong party links, was expected to be appointed
caretaker prime minister as early as next Saturday.
	   Ouyahia pledged government help for terror victims and for
families demanding information on their missing loved ones arrested
by security forces.
	   On the economic front, Ouyahia said that through an austerity
plan the government cut inflation from 29.7 percent in 1995 to 5
percent his year. Despite a wave of strikes, Ouyahia defended ``the
necessity to liberalize the country's economy'' and to do away with
``the aid-dependent mentality.''
	   He said his government has refused an offer by the International
Monetary Fund to again reschedule the country's 30 billion foreign
debt.
	   Ouyahia has been plagued by strikes protesting the
military-backed government's efforts to cut subsidies and bailouts
of a mostly state-owned economy, allowing some companies to fail.
	   The restructuring _ forced by falling world petroleum prices and
foreign debt payments _ has thrown thousands more out of work,
compounding unemployment that officially is 30 percent. Independent
estimates put the figure much higher.
	   ``The unemployment and misery that drive people to violence, to
prostitution and suicide are for Mr. Ouyahia but a state of mind,''
said Salah Makhlouf, a restaurant manager watching Ouyahia's speech
on TV.
	   The insurgency broke out in the former French colony after the
government canceled January 1992 elections the Islamic Salvation
Front was expected to win.

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Militants hurled hand grenades at a
police station and traded gunfire with Pakistani security forces in
the southern port city of Karachi on Sunday, killing at least one
civilian and wounding eight others, including four policemen.
	   Police believe the attackers belonged to the ethnic Muttahida
Qami Movement (MQM).
	   The militants also set fire to more than a dozen shops in
central Liquatabad area to protest a crackdown on the militants by
government security forces, police said.
	   The violent protest spun out of control as militants hurled
grenades at a police station and fired a rocket at a police armored
personnel carrier in the nearby Gharibabad area. The militants then
set stores on fire and took over control of the entire neighborhood
while police tried to quell the violence, officials said.
	   The residents of the area ran for cover while the gunbattle
between militants and security forces raged for hours. The fighting
killed one civilian and left four policemen and four civilians
wounded, the APP and police said.
	   The area is a stronghold of the largest MQM faction led by
exiled leader Altaf Hussein. The MQM, which claims to represent
Urdu speaking immigrants to Pakistan after 1947, is fighting for
political and economic concessions from the government.
	   Its members are heavily armed.
	   In an attempt to end the relentless violence in Karachi, Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif last month dismissed the government there,
imposed federal rule, suspended civil rights and brought in the
army to arrest and try suspected terrorists.
	   The government also brought in disarmament experts from Colombia
to help collect an estimated 11,000 illegal weapons in the city.
	   The ethnic violence in Karachi has left more than 1,000 people
dead so far this year.
	   Sharif imposed federal rule after a former governor, Hakim Said,
was gunned down. Sharif blamed members of Hussein's MQM group.
	   The MQM denies the charge and accuses the government of
``state-sponsored terrorism'' against its ethnic group.
	   Formerly known as the Mohajir Qami Movement, MQM is locked in a
bloody conflict with a splinter group known as the Haqiqi faction.

Russia's second city holds legislative elections

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ More than 500 candidates competed
Sunday in a down-and-dirty city election that was overshadowed by
the shooting death of a leading liberal politician.
	   Voter turnout was high by Russian standards, with 28 percent of
the voters casting ballots by early evening. But despite the strong
interest, nobody was expected to win outright. With so many
candidates vying for seats in the municipal legislature, runoffs
were considered certain in most or all races.
	   The election captured nationwide interest, mainly because of the
Nov. 20 killing of Galina Starovoitova, a member of the Russian
parliament who was pushing a liberal bloc of candidates in the St.
Petersburg elections.
	   Some of Starovoitova's supporters have suggested she was killed
to prevent her faction, Northern Capital, from doing well in the
election. It seemed possible, however, that it would have the
opposite effect of rallying her followers.
	   The election was considered important because the municipal
legislature in St. Petersburg has been given enhanced powers under
a new city charter, and will have a much stronger voice in city
affairs than similar bodies elsewhere in Russia.
	   Perhaps because of those stakes, the campaign was marred by
dirty tricks, violence and threats of violence.
	   Alexander Yakovlev, the city's mayor, strongly opposed the new
charter, which curtails his clout. He was not on the ballot, but
critics said his supporters contributed to the mean-spirited
atmosphere surrounding the election.
	   Yakovlev's opponents found that people with names identical to
theirs mysteriously wound up on the ballot in an apparent attempt
to confuse voters and take away votes from liberals.
	   In addition, anti-Semitic leaflets were handed out asking
citizens not to vote for Jewish candidates, and one candidate's
posters were defaced with slurs against Jews.
	   There were multiple reports of attempts to bribe voters.
	   On election day, three polling stations were briefly closed
after someone telephoned bomb threats to local authorities. No
bombs were found.
	   St. Petersburg, Russia's second largest city, was at the
forefront of the country's democracy movement a decade ago, but
much of its sense of itself as a progressive, Western-oriented city
has faded, at least in terms of city politics.
	   As it headed into the elections, St. Petersburg appeared at
least as dirty and deadly as anywhere in Russia.
	   Last year, the city's deputy governor was gunned down in the
city center. In the past two months, hitmen have claimed the lives
of a legislative aide, a high-ranking city official and a prominent
banker.
	   Last month's killing of Starovoitova, the country's most
prominent female politician, drew international condemnation and
focused attention on St. Petersburg's crime problems.
	   On Sunday, authorities said a businessman from the nearby city
of Novgorod was shot and killed in a St. Petersburg apartment
building by someone using a small-caliber pistol equipped with a
silencer _ the typical weapon of the city's contract hitmen.
	   Local prosecutors said the crime was unrelated to the election,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Boris Nemtsov, the former first deputy premier, recently visited
St. Petersburg and called it ``the crime capital of Russia.''
	   St. Petersburg's 3.7 million voters seem fed up with the city's
crime and corruption, and its poor economic performance. But it
wasn't clear how that would play itself out in terms of voting.
	   Preliminary election results were not expected until sometime
Monday.

Boro, Newcastle in 2-2 tie
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIDDLESBROUGH, England (AP) _ Substitute Nikos Dabizas headed an
equalizer seven minutes from the end a minute after leaving the
bench as Newcastle twice hit back to earn a 2-2 tie with
Middlesbrough Sunday.
	   The Greek forward sent a long-range looping header over Boro's
Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer from Laurent Charvet's
rightwing cross to earn Ruud Gullit's team a point.
	   Neither team climbed as a result of the tie, Boro remaining
seventh and Newcastle 13th. It was Middlesbrough's sixth tie in
seven Premier League matches and ninth in all.
	   England striker Alan Shearer failed a late fitness test on a
hamstring injury so that he still has to make his first appearance
alongside Duncan Ferguson in the Newcastle attack.
	   Paul Gascoigne, who started his career with Newcastle, set up
the first Middlesbrough goal with a clever corner kick to the
unmarked Andy Townsend, who lofted his shot over the head of
debutant 'keeper Steve Harper from 15 meters.
	   That gave Boro a 13th minute lead but Newcastle leveled in the
38th with a powerful 20-meter drive from Laurent Charvet.
	   Harper made two stunning saves from Brian Deane and Townsend
before Middlesbrough regained the lead with Colin Cooper's
deflected shot in the 59th minute.
	   But Newcastle hit back again and substitute Dabizas netted the
leveller in the 83rd minute.

New coach does not bring wins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Newly-signed Romanian coach Mircea Lucescu
did not immediately bring wins to struggling Milan soccer
powerhouse Internazionale.
	   And some critics noted he did not help to improve quality of
play, a major requirement for club president and oil industrialist
Massimo Moratti.
	   Italian veteran coach Gigi Simoni had been blamed for Inter's
lackluster play when he was unexpectedly fired last week, following
a win in the Champions Cup game and a draw in a league match which
kept Inter in the running in both competitions.
	   Lucescu, a former coach of Romania's national team who took over
Inter's helm last Tuesday, was off to a 2-1 loss against Lazio in
an Italian Cup match Thursday. On Sunday his team barely escaped
defeat against low-ranked Vicenza in league action.
	   Young French defender Mickael Silvestre scored Inter's 1-1
equalizer in injury time, at the end of a tense match which saw
several Inter players overreacting.
	   Nigerian international defender Taribo West irately tossed his
jersey at Lucescu as he left the field during the second half, when
the coach decided to replace him with Silvestre - a decisive move
indeed.
	   And Chilean veteran striker Ivan Zamorano was expelled in the
second half for kicking an opponent.
	   Inter, which had started the season as a top league contender,
trails leader Fiorentina by seven points after 12 rounds.
	   The Milan team has been also suffering from injuries which had
repeatedly sidelined its best stars, Brazilian striker Ronaldo and
Italian imaginative forward Roberto Baggio.
	   Ronaldo was fielded in the final minutes at Vicenza Sunday for
his first brief appearance in four weeks. Baggio did not play.
	   Lucescu, who said he will need several weeks for giving Inter
new tactics and determination, will seek better results and
performances in the next few games to avoid the same criticism
which cost Simoni his job.
	   On Wednesday Inter plays a deciding Champions League qualifying
match against Sturm Graz. On Sunday it takes on tough Udinese on
the road.

AEK loses to Kavala, Olympiakos takes lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Giorgos Nassiopoulos scored one goal and
Leszek Pisz added another as provincial Kavala beat AEK Athens 2-1
Sunday in the Greek first division soccer league.
	   The loss, AEK's second of the season, sent defending champion
Olympiakos Piraeus to the top of the standings with 28 points from
12 games.
	   AEK dropped to second place with 26 points, one ahead crosstown
Panathinaikos.
	   On Saturday, Olympiakos beat Panathinaikos 4-2 in a game marred
by crowd violence.
	   Hooligans stoned policemen before the start of the match while
Panathinaikos supporters ripped up plastic seats at Athens' Olympic
stadium and threw them at Olympiakos fans at the end of the game.
	   At least 10 people were injured in the incidents.
	   Nassiopoulos stunned some 2,500 AEK supporters at the stadium
when his header off a center from Lucas Karadimos gave Kavala the
lead in the 9th minute.
	   It was Kavala's first attack in the game played in the northern
town of the same name.
	   One minute later, AEK came close to level but goalminder
Panagiotis Logaras made a key save to a shot by Demis Nikolaidis.
	   Five minutes into the second half, Logaras rushed outside his
area to stop a solo attack by Nikolaidis.
	   Polish midfielder Pisz made the score 2-0 for the hosts with a
left-footed free-kick from 25 meters (yards) in the 53rd.
	   AEK reacted, but only managed to narrow the difference with Toni
Savevski in the 69th minute
	   Vassilis Karapialis scored two second half goals as Olympiakos
made a comeback to beat Panathinaikos 4-2.
	   Playing before 40,000 spectators, Panathinaikos dominated the
first period and Olympiakos the second.
	   The Athens club pushed from the opening kickoff and came close
to open the scoring on three occasions, all denied by Olympiakos
goalie Dimitris Eleftheropoulos.
	   The hosts took the lead in the 29th with a powerful shot by
Costas Constantinidis from inside the area.
	   Three minutes later, Polish striker Krzysztof Warzycha made it
2-0 off a cross from Blendar Kola.
	   Olympiakos hit back with a goal from Sinisa Gogic in the 40th.
His weak shot deflected off defender Giorgos Alexopoulos before
entering the goalmouth.
	   The visitors became more aggressive in the second half and
leveled with a shot from the edge of the box by Karapialis in the
51st.
	   In the 64th, Angelos Bassinas saw his second yellow card,
forcing Panathinaikos to play the rest of the game with 10 men.
	   Taking advantage, Olympiakos besieged Panathinaikos' area and
took the lead with a header by Giorgos Anatolakis off a free-kick
by Serbian midfielder Predrag Djordjevic in the 71st.
	   Karapialis sealed the victory with a lob from outside the area
in injury time.

Dominican capital to play host to Pan American Games in 2003
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ The capital of the Dominican Republic, Santo
Domingo, beat out cities in Mexico and Colombia on Sunday to be
chosen as the host city for the 2003 Pan American Games.
	   Members of the general assembly of the Pan American Sports
Organization selected Santo Domingo in a second round of voting in
Panama. The first round of voting eliminated Medellin, Colombia.
	   Santo Domingo beat out the western Mexico city of Guadalajara in
the final tally.
	   The chief of Colombia's police, Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano, had
visited the assembly meeting on Saturday to allay concerns over
public security in Medellin, which was torn by drug violence in the
1980s and early 1990s.
	   In trying to win support for Guadalajara, Mexican delegates had
offered to give about dlrs 51,000 to each of the hemisphere's 41
Olympic committees to boost training programs for athletes.
	   The Colombian delegation accused Mexico of attempted
vote-buying.
	   The Pan American Games are held every four years. The 1999 games
will be held in Winnipeg, Canada.

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Several hundred opponents of President
Alexander Lukashenko gathered near his official residence Sunday to
commemorate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
	   Although police had ordered the rally moved to another square in
the center of the city, the demonstrators went ahead with the rally
at Oktyabryskaya Square, about 200 meters (yards) from Lukashenko's
residence.
	   Ten people were arrested by plainclothes officers, according to
officials with Charter '97, the human rights organization
sponsoring the rally. Police would not confirm the report.
	   Organizers of the rally complained that they were summoned to
police headquarters before the rally.
	   ``The attitude of the authorities to this rally shows that in
this country there is no power of law, but the power of force. The
human rights of life, information and law are violated in
Belarus,'' said Youri Khadyka, deputy chairman of the Popular
Front, the main opposition organization.
	   In speeches at the rally, opposition leaders complained that
Lukashenko, an authoritarian president who would like to revive the
Soviet Union, has consistently violated human rights.
	   Oleg Belyavsky, the main organizer of the protest, charged that
500 people had been unjustly arrested or beaten by authorities this
year, and that thousands of people have been politically repressed
over the past four years of Lukashenko's rule.
	   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the
U.N. General Assembly on Dec. 10, 1948.

Sweden looking for more after completing 4-1 win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS. UPDATES with ITF proposals to change Davis Cup
format, quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Sweden's depth and determination have it
thinking about a Davis Cup dynasty.
	   Italy, again a loser in a final, is simply in disarray.
	   The countries split Sunday's closing singles matches, which had
been rendered academic when Sweden took a 3-0 lead in the best-of-5
final the day before to clinch its second consecutive Davis Cup
title and third since 1994.
	   ``We're looking forward to repeating this win again and making
it three straight,'' said doubles player Jonas Bjorkman. ``If we
can do that it would be a great effort. But we have proven that
right now Sweden is No. 1.''
	   Magnus Gustafsson needed just 68 minutes to defeat Italy's
Gianluca Pozzi 6-4, 6-2 Sunday, before Diego Nargiso salvaged some
pride for the hosts by beating Magnus Norman 6-2, 6-3 to avoid a
clean sweep on the red clay.
	   ``We have eight players who competed for Sweden this year,''
captain Carl-Axel Hageskog said. ``That depth, and a unique junior
system, is the secret to our success.''
	   Sweden handled Italy without using its two best clay-courters.
Thomas Johansson, ranked 17th by the ATP, and No. 22 Thomas Enqvist
are both injured.
	   In fact, No. 31 Gustafsson was the highest ranking singles
player here, making it the first final in the 99-year history of
the Davis Cup without anyone from the top 30.
	   International Tennis Federation president Brian Tobin said
Sunday changes could be in store for the competition, though not
before 2001. Proposals include cutting matches in early rounds to
best-of-3 sets, giving the returning finalist nations first-round
byes, and trying to convince the ATP to award rankings points for
Davis Cup matches.
	   ``Does that get (Pete) Sampras or whoever to play? Believe me,
we are looking at the options,'' Tobin said.
	   No. 1 Sampras and No. 6 Andre Agassi both skipped the
semifinals, when the United States was ousted by Italy.
	   Sweden's rich tennis tradition includes former top-ranked stars
Bjorn Borg, Mats Wilander and Stefan Edberg. While it has no one of
that caliber there these days _ Edberg's 1992 U.S. Open title was
the last Grand Slam victory by a Swede _ the country does
consistently produce competitive players who turn out for the Davis
Cup.
	   ``Sweden really cares about the Davis Cup,'' said Italy captain
Paolo Bertolucci. ``That is certainly a strength.''
	   His underdogs put up little fight this weekend after a strained
right shoulder tendon forced their top player, Andrea Gaudenzi, to
retire at 6-6 in the fifth set against Norman in the final's
opening match Friday.
	   Sweden then took the second singles match and Saturday's doubles
in straight sets to send Italy to its sixth defeat in seven finals
appearances.
	   While Sweden picked up a record sixth title since the World
Group format was introduced in 1981, Italy was left to pick up the
pieces amid a bitter feud between the national federation and the
players.
	   Bertolucci's contract is up and Nargiso said the players will
boycott Davis Cup if the captain is not retained.
	   There was also a public battle with the federation over money
before the final.
	   Gaudenzi, a former world junior No. 1, is expected to undergo
surgery Monday and be sidelined six months.
	   ``I don't expect any form of thanks from the federation, because
you can't expect anything from those people,'' he said. ``I didn't
see anyone from the federation there clapping their hands during my
match. Every 15 minutes they got up to go get something to eat.''

Moderate Sikhs keep control of Vancouver temple
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ Moderate Sikhs have retained
control of a Vancouver temple, taking all 15 seats in Saturday's
election.
	   Voter turnout was lower than expected, with slightly more than
36,000 ballots cast out of a possible 56,000.
	   Temple members have been bitterly divided over an edict from
Sikh leaders in India that bans tables and chairs from temples.
	   Saturday's executive board election was hotly contested because
it will decide which faction has control of the lucrative temple.
	   The issue has sparked violence in the past, but no trouble was
reported during the voting.
	   Vancouver's Ross Street temple, which opened in 1908, is the
largest Sikh temple in North America, with more than 57,000
members.
	   The temple has been the site of violence between traditional and
moderate Sikhs in the Vancouver area since an edict outlawing
tables and chairs in temple dining halls was issued by the
religion's high priest in India earlier this year.
	   The family of slain Sikh publisher Tara Singh Hayer say his
death is linked to the struggle for control of the temple.
	   His children and friends have repeatedly said that Hayer, who
was gunned down in the garage outside his home on Nov. 18, was
killed because of his support of moderate candidates.
	   He was also among eight British Columbian Sikhs excommunicated
last summer by high priest Ranjit Singh over his opposition to the
tables and chairs edict.

New coach does not bring wins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Newly-signed Romanian coach Mircea Lucescu
did not immediately bring victory to struggling soccer powerhouse
Internazionale.
	   And some critics noted he did not help to improve quality of
play, a major requirement for club president and oil industrialist
Massimo Moratti.
	   Italian veteran coach Gigi Simoni had been blamed for Inter's
lackluster play when he was unexpectedly fired last week, following
a win in the Champions Cup game and a draw in a league match which
kept Inter in the running in both competitions.
	   Lucescu, a former coach of Romania's national team who took over
Inter's helm last Tuesday, was off to a 2-1 loss against Lazio in
an Italian Cup match Thursday. On Sunday his team barely escaped
defeat against low-ranked Vicenza in league action.
	   Young French defender Mickael Silvestre scored Inter's 1-1
equalizer in injury time, at the end of a tense match which saw
several Inter players overreacting.
	   Nigerian international defender Taribo West irately tossed his
jersey at Lucescu as he left the field during the second half, when
the coach decided to replace him with Silvestre.
	   And Chilean veteran striker Ivan Zamorano was expelled in the
second half for kicking an opponent.
	   Inter, which had started the season as a top league contender,
trails leader Fiorentina by seven points after 12 rounds.
	   The Milan team has been also suffering from injuries which had
repeatedly sidelined its best stars, Brazilian striker Ronaldo and
Italian forward Roberto Baggio.
	   Ronaldo was fielded in the final minutes at Vicenza Sunday for
his first brief appearance in four weeks. Baggio did not play.
	   Lucescu, who said he will need several weeks for giving Inter
new tactics and determination, will seek better results and
performances in the next few games to avoid the same criticism
which cost Simoni his job.
	   On Wednesday Inter plays a deciding Champions League qualifying
match against Sturm Graz. On Sunday it takes on tough Udinese on
the road.

With BC-German-Kurdish Leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Turkish Kurdish rebel leader detained in Rome
says he is ready to tell what he knows about the 1981 shooting of
Pope John Paul II and the 1986 assassination of Swedish Prime
Minister Olof Palme, although he said that he doesn't have details
about either attack.
	   Earlier this year, Sweden's national police chief was quoted as
saying police hoped to question Ocalan about the Palme killing.
According to reports in Turkey, a top rebel Kurd said after his
capture this year that the rebels were behind the killing but later
retracted his statement.
	   ``I don't know details nor do I have specific evidence on the
two bloody attacks,'' Abdullah Ocalan told the Italian news agency
ANSA in an interview which was transmitted Sunday. Ocalan, who was
detained in Italy last month after he arrived on a flight from
Moscow, told ANSA he wanted to describe to prosecutors the
political context in Turkey.
	   Mehmet Ali Agca, a Turk who was a member of Turkey's right-wing
Gray Wolves terrorist group, is serving a life sentence in Italy
for the wounding of the pope in St. Peter's Square. ANSA quoted
Ocalan as saying Agca ``never told the truth about the attack on
the pope.''
	   Agca claimed a year after his arrest that Russia and Bulgaria
hired him. He later recanted, saying he acted alone, and Italian
courts have ruled there was no evidence of Soviet-bloc involvement.
	   As for the attack in Sweden, Ocalan was quoted as saying:
``Nobody still knows anything'' and he described as an attempt at
instrumentalization accusations that his guerrilla movement was
involved in the killing.
	   Ocalan said he traveled to Rome last month because of Italian
political sympathy for the Kurdish cause.
	   Rome has refused to extradite Ocalan to Turkey, which wants to
try him as a terrorist, because Turkey has the death penalty.

British runner urges West to help Africa's poor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ British runner Nicholas Bourne, who
completed his 11-month run across Africa, urged Western nations
Sunday to donate money to charities working for the impoverished
African people.
	   ``We in the West are lucky enough to live in an easy and stable
environment, while people in Africa have very little and must work
very hard for what they have,'' said Bourne, 28, from Britain.
	   Bourne reached Egypt on Saturday, completing his 10,951.7
kilometer (6,790 miles), eight-nation run of Africa that began Jan.
21.
	   His aim was to raise dlrs 1.65 million for the charity group
Save the Children fund and the Born Free Foundation, an
environmental protection group.
	   Bourne, a former art dealer, decided on the run after a trip to
several African countries. He was struck by the poverty and the
beautiful landscape that he said was being destroyed by industrial
projects.
	   Bourne began his run in Cape Town, South Africa and trekked
through Botswana, Zambia, Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan and
Egypt, running an average of about 60 kilometers (37.2 miles) a
day.
	   He went through 30 pairs of running shoes and braved thigh-high
floods and extreme heat.
	   He was bedridden for two months in Zambia and his family said he
may have suffered from malaria.
	   In Sudan, where he says the people were ``incredibly
hospitable,'' he endured temperatures that reached 65 degrees
Celsius (149 Fahrenheit).
	   ``With perseverance and patience you can do anything,'' Bourne
said.

Turin anti-doping prosecutor looking into suspect deaths
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Italy's top anti-doping prosecutor is
looking into the deaths of 45 soccer players which may be related
to the use of performance-enhancing drugs, according to Italian
news reports.
	   Raffaele Guariniello, who has been questioning dozens of soccer
figures during his four-month-old investigation, was looking into
the alleged use of drugs by a number of players who died of rare
diseases.
	   The Rome daily La Repubblica wrote Sunday that Guariniello was
investigating suspect, premature deaths of at least 45 Italian
first and second division players over the last 10 years.
	   The Rome daily wrote that the Turin prosecutor was studying
documents seized by police in the headquarters of several clubs and
and in doctors' offices.
	   Guariniello could not be reached for comment on Sunday.
	   Several Italian prosecutors have been investigating illegal drug
use in Italian soccer since July, when AS Roma coach Zdenek Zeman
suggested in interviews that too many ``pharmaceutical substances''
were circulating in professional soccer.
	   The so-called ``doping scandal'' has toppled Italy's Olympic
Committee and led to the closure of the Acqua Acetosa anti-doping
laboratory in Rome, deemed as unsatisfactory by the International
Olympic Committe (IOC).
	   However IOC's president Juan Antonio Samaranch said in Milan
over the weekend that the Italian facility may be reopened in
March.
	   Samaranch, in Milan for the Italy-Sweden Davis Cup final, said
``all conditions exist for the reopening of the Acqua Acetosa
laboratory in March.''
	   He also expressed the hope a common-anti doping policy would be
accepted by all federations when the top sports officials meet in
Lausanne next February.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Aston Villa, top of the Premier League, will host
the team bottom of division three, Hull City, in the third round of
the FA Cup while Manchester United has a tough matchup at Old
Trafford with Middlesbrough.
	   Defending titlist Arsenal must go to in-form division two
Preston, Tottenham hosts Graham Taylor's high-flying division one
team Watford and Chelsea will go to either Oldham of division two
or third division Brentford, who have to replay after a tie.
	   The Premier League and division one clubs enter the draw in the
third round and, with no seeding, there was the chance of big clubs
meeting each other or minnows taking on the giants in Sunday's
draw.
	   Rushden and Diamonds and Doncaster Rovers, neither of them in
the pro leagues, must face each other in a replay to decide who
hosts mighty Leeds United.
	   Yeovil Town, which ousted division two Northampton on Saturday,
travels to division three leader Cardiff.
	   Kingstonian, which tied 0-0 with division three Leyton Orient on
Sunday, will meet another semi-pro team, Southport, if it wins the
replay.
	   There are just two all Premier League clashes. Apart from
Manchester United-Middlesbrough, Blackburn hosts Charlton.
	   Kevin Keegan's Fulham, which is third in division two, hopes to
produce an upset at the Premier League's last place team,
Southampton, one of his old clubs.
	   Newcastle hosts Terry Venables' Crystal Palace in one of several
meetings of clubs from the Premier League and division one.
	   Liverpool must go to struggling Port Vale and Everton travels to
Bristol City, which is next to last in the first division.
Leicester hosts seventh place Birmingham, Sheffield Wednesday
receives fourth place Norwich and struggling Nottingham Forest
welcomes lowly Portsmouth.
	   The matches are to be played Jan. 2-3.

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The military leader who has launched
Nigeria on an ambitious path toward civilian rule proclaimed Sunday
that ``democracy is here to stay,'' following local elections that
drew a large and enthusiastic voter turnout.
	   Saturday's elections were the first since Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar outlined his plan earlier this year to cede power to
civilians in May, and the polling drew praise Sunday from visiting
U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley. Abubakar took power after
the June death of dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, who detained, tortured
and occasionally killed his opponents.
	   A leaderless coalition of former Abacha opponents led early
results of the local elections, officials said Sunday morning.
	   The Peoples' Democratic Party, a group of 34 traditional chiefs,
academics, businessmen and ex-military generals, was the top
vote-getter in most of Nigeria's 36 states, several National
Electoral Commission officials said on condition of anonymity.
	   The officials declined to say when official results would be
available, adding that votes in some remote rural communities were
being collected by donkeys and camels and that major cities had to
deal with a higher-than-expected turnout.
	   The PDP party has a murky platform and no leader, although
former military ruler Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo has donated dlrs 2.5
million and is campaigning for the party's presidential nomination
expected later this month or in January.
	   Daley, the most senior American official to visit this sprawling
West African country since Abacha's rule, praised the elections as
a sign that Nigerians are willing to bring about serious reforms.
	   Abubakar met Daley and a delegation of senior U.S. executives at
the general's state residence in the capital, Abuja.
	   ``Democracy is here to stay and it will stay,'' Abubakar said in
a soft voice that drew smiles and nods of approval from the
American audience.
	   ``This is the first step in our democratization program and I'm
happy to say that quite a lot of people turned out,'' he said.
	   Daley praised the elections as a sign that Nigerians are willing
to ``join the international community every day of the year.''
	   Saturday's vote was seen as a trial run before state and
presidential elections to be held by Feb. 15. Inauguration
ceremonies for the new civilian president are planned for May 29.
	   Daley said the United States was considering sending more senior
delegations to expand ties with Africa's most populous country,
which for years has been plagued by corruption, ethnic divisions
and military meddling. Early next year, the United States is
expected to review aid sanctions imposed on Nigeria because of its
poor record in fighting drug trafficking, a member of Daley's team
said.
	   The U.S. delegation, which visited three other African countries
over the past week, spent less than six hours in Nigeria before
flying back to Washington.
	   A U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that
President Bill Clinton may attend Nigeria's presidential
inauguration ceremonies.
	   Saturday's local government elections drew a huge turnout. More
than 50 million people were registered for the vote, and voting was
monitored by foreign observers and local human rights groups.
	   The mood was mainly positive although at least six people were
reportedly killed in a clash between supporters of two parties at a
voting station near Warri, about 200 kilometers (125 miles)
southeast of the commercial capital of Lagos.
	   Obasanjo, who helped finance the PDP, appeared to represent a
compromise choice offering military stability with increased
civilian participation.
	   Obasanjo had assumed control in 1976 after military leader Gen.
Murtala Muhammed died in a failed coup attempt. Obasanjo became the
only military ruler to relinquish power, and he retired in 1979.
	   He has strong support in the predominantly Muslim north, the
power base for the Nigerian military, which has ruled for all but
10 years since independence from Britain in 1960.
	   Preliminary election results also showed a strong showing for
two other new political entities _ the All Peoples' Party and the
Alliance for Democracy, which includes some members of political
parties formerly allied to Abacha, the electoral officials said.
	   Only parties that obtain at least 5 percent of Saturday's vote
in 24 of Nigeria's 36 states will be allowed to participate in
February's presidential poll.

Munich clinches victory over Dortmund
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Markus Schroth scored both goals as
1860 Munich climbed one place to third with a 2-0 Bundesliga
victory over Borussia Dortmund in a snow-bound Olympic stadium
Sunday.
	   Schroth, rarely used in the starting lineup, got the first in
the 31st minute and added the second on a header in the 82nd. Both
goals were set up by Moroccan international Abderrahim Ouakili.
	   Munich's victory stopped Dortmund's rise to the top. Dortmund
had lost only once in 10 games coming to Munich. But the 1997
European champion is still without a victory on the road this
season.

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ Soccer fans of PAOK Salonica, protesting
their team's punishment, set fire to television converter boxes
Sunday outside the offices of a sports subscription channel.
	   The unusual protest in this northern port city was the latest
staged by angry PAOK supporters.
	   Last month, the first division club was stripped of three league
points and ordered to play five home games away after its fans
stormed the pitch during a Nov. 1 game against Olympiakos Piraeus.
The match was interrupted when a referee's assistant was injured
and awarded to Olympiakos.
	   On Saturday, PAOK supporters blocked Greece's main highway for
an hour, while over 10,000 fans demonstrated in downtown Salonica
last month.
	   The subscription channel Supersport has the live broadcast
rights for Greek league soccer games.
	   PAOK has implied that league organizers are biased in favor of
Athens clubs. And for many sports fans in northern Greece, the
team's punishment has offended their regional pride. They believe
the subscription channel is also aligned with the Athens teams.
	   Defense Minister Akis Tsochadzopoulos, who represents a Salonica
constituency as a member of parliament, has said that protests by
PAOK fans' protests are largely justified.

Feyenoord fluke opens up six-point lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ An own goal three minutes from
time Sunday by NEC Nijmegen defender Luuk Maes gave Feyenoord
Rotterdam a very fortunate 1-0 win on a day Ajax could only draw.
	   Feyenoord (12-2-1) now leads Ajax (9-5-3) and Vitesse (10-2-4)
by six clear points, having played two games fewer than Vitesse and
three fewer than Ajax.
	   NEC had created just as many chances as Feyenoord and looked
good value for a point when Maes toe-poked Jean-Paul van Gastel's
harmless-looking free-kick past his own keeper.
	   Ajax's recent injury malaise continued after the news this week
that key offensive players Jari Litmanen and Shota Arveladze will
be out of the running until the new year.
	   With Wednesday's crucial Champions League trip to FC Porto
looming, Ajax needed an 83rd-minute Sunday Oliseh equalizer to
salvage a 1-1 draw against struggling MVV Maastricht.
	   The league should have reached its 17-game half-way point but
has an uneven look due to the Dutch KNVB football association's
irregular fixture list and a string of weather-caused
postponements.
	   Cambuur Leeuwarden's 2-1 win at Sparta Rotterdam was its 18th
game, compared to NAC Breda, which has only played 14.
	   Four points from six meant a good week for Bobby Robson's PSV,
adding a 4-3 win at NAC in the Brabant derby Sunday to its 3-3 draw
at fourth-placed SC Heerenveen Tuesday.
	   PSV's league top-scorer Ruud van Nistelrooy found the net in the
NAC game to take his total to 14, two ahead of Greek Nikos Machlas
who opened the scoring in Vitesse's unlikely win Friday.
	   The Arnhem side jumped to second place after staging a
spectacular comeback to down Willem II 5-3 in Tilburg, its first
away victory in three months.
	   With 17 minutes to go Vitesse was 3-1 down but then as injured
Willem II defender Delano Hill was being escorted off the field
Ghanean striker Mamadou Zongo pounced to bring the game to life.
	   The Tilburg defense degenerated into panic-stricken chaos and
Martijn Reuser, Louis Laros and Zongo again all found the net.

Russian nuclear fuel to be shipped to Armenia soon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will deliver nuclear fuel for an Armenian
power plant on Friday, Nuclear Minister Yevgeny Adamov told a news
agency.
	   Adamov had previously said that Russia would supply the fuel,
even though Armenia had not paid for previous deliveries and is
unlikely to do so soon. He said Russia had agreed to help for
political reasons.
	   Adamov told ITAR-Tass on Sunday that the fuel would be flown to
Armenia on Friday. He spoke in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, where
he had gone to observe the 10th anniversary of Armenia's
devastating earthquake.
	   The fuel will be used by the Medzamor nuclear power plant, which
produces 40 percent of the Armenia's power.

Gabon decides whether longtime autocrat will serve seven more

<TEXT>
	   LIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) _ More than 30 years after President Omar
Bongo came to power, Gabonese voters turned out Sunday to decide
whether the long-serving autocrat should be elected to another
seven years.
	   Despite reports of scattered rock-throwing incidents overnight
in Libreville, Sunday's voting appeared to have come off without
serious violence.
	   Many polling stations opened late _ some as many as six hours
late _ and officials said four ballot boxes were destroyed by mobs
angry over incomplete voter lists in northern Gabon, but no
injuries were reported. A shortage of electoral material was also
reported by a number of voters. Some polling stations remained open
beyond the 6 p.m. closing time.
	   Bongo, who came to power in 1967 and whose alleged vote-rigging
in the 1993 presidential vote sparked days of rioting in
Libreville, is widely expected to be re-elected in this oil-rich
Central African nation. Even if he doesn't reach the 51 percent
support he needs Sunday to win outright in the first round, the
opposition appears too divided to win a second round later this
month.
	   Bongo's vast financial resources, dominance of the broadcast
media and widespread patronage system give him an enormous
advantage over his seven opponents.
	   The opposition has charged the government is also behind a
string of electoral irregularities, including weakening the
National Electoral Commission, which is supposed to oversee the
election, and rigging voter lists.
	   ``They want to transform Gabon into a kingdom,'' said Pierre
Mamboundou, a former postal executive who is one of Bongo's two
main opponents. Another is Roman Catholic priest Paul Mba Abessole.
	   The government denies such accusations, but observers say the
election has been marred _ at the very least _ by serious
organizational problems.
	   Turnout results were not immediately released, and it was not
clear when results would be available.
	   Despite widespread allegations of corruption and a history of
authoritarianism, Bongo does retain a national following, in part
because of Gabon's stability and relatively high standard of
living. Bongo relaxed his stranglehold on politics after
pro-democracy protests forced him to allow opposition parties in
1990.
	   Some of his support also extends from his enormous patronage
system: The government doles out money and jobs.
	   Even though nearly all the country's wealth remains in the bank
accounts of Gabon's elite, many of the country's poor have long
felt that they have at least a chance to succeed.
	   ``Since I was born, there have been few problems in Gabon,''
said Antoine Bouanga, explaining why he cast his vote Sunday for
the 63-year-old president. ``There is work, there is money.''
	   But the price of oil is dropping dramatically and fears are
growing that Gabon's supplies are drying up. And a weaker U.S.
dollar and the Asian financial crisis have hit the country's timber
and mining industries.

Italian world champion likely to join Honda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ World 250-cc motorcycle racing champion Loris
Capirossi flew to Tokyo Sunday to possibly negotiate a contract
with the Japanese team Honda for the 1999 championship.
	   The Italian rider said he was definitely leaving Aprilia
following differences with Italian team officials over his
controversial title victory.
	   ``Honda is pressing to have me on its team, with the No.1 on the
bike. I have not taken any final decision. I'm going there to
negotiate,'' Capirossi said.
	   Capirossi clinched the world title finishing second to Italian
teammate Valentino Rossi in the closing championship race following
a last-corner collision with another Aprilia teammate, Japan's
Tetsuya Harada.
	   Harada, who was also in the running for the world title and was
leading Capirossi, fell after the collision and was forced to
withdraw.
	   Aprilia officials had bitterly criticized Capirossi's behavior.
	   Honda is expected to be Aprilia's top contender in the 250-cc
class next year.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Washington may claim the
violence-plagued rule of Slobodan Milosevic is weakening, but the
Yugoslav president's supporters and even some critics at home say
he is as strong as ever.
	   Ignoring U.S. pressure on his government, he is purging the
police and military in apparent preparation for another major
crackdown: this time on pro-independence elements in Montenegro,
the small republic that with Serbia forms present-day Yugoslavia.
	   The purge prompted State Department spokesman James P. Rubin to
declare last Monday that ``President Milosevic's grip on power is
weakening.''
	   Rubin accused Milosevic of being ``at the center of every
crisis'' during and since the breakup of the old Yugoslav
federation. ``He is not simply part of the problem; Milosevic is
the problem,'' the spokesman added.
	   Washington has always blamed Milosevic for the ethnic conflicts
in the Balkans, and it imposed diplomatic and economic sanctions on
his government. But the Clinton administration has worked closely
with him since 1995 trying to ensure a lasting peace in Bosnia,
formerly a Yugoslav republic.
	   Rubin's remarks led to news media speculation that Washington
has concluded there can't be a secure peace with Milosevic in power
and now is encouraging his ouster.
	   Yet many of Milosevic's domestic allies and opponents alike
agree that the Yugoslav president's rule is as strong as ever and
that the recent sacking of his army chief, Gen. Momcilo Perisic,
and secret police head, Jovica Stanisic, herald more trouble for
the Balkans.
	   Both Stanisic and Perisic were replaced by officers loyal to
Milosevic's neo-communist wife, Mirjana Markovic. Her hard-line
loyalists have recently assumed most top posts in Yugoslavia,
further strengthening Milosevic.
	   Milosevic has also moved against independent news media _ the
only real source of information for most Yugoslavs _ by introducing
harsh press laws and banning and closing newspapers and radio
stations. He recently purged Belgrade University, the traditional
center of rebellion, by sacking professors and replacing them with
his supporters.
	   Despite the new crackdown _ and unhappiness over Yugoslavia's
deep economic problems _ there have been no street protests like
those two years ago when Milosevic's rule was seriously shaken by
three months of demonstrations. Those protests ended in a major
disappointment for his opponents when their leaders split up over
personal differences.
	   Military and police purges have been common for Milosevic ahead
of major actions against his opponents, and the latest ousters were
a clear sign of his strength rather than weakness, his opponents
say.
	   The purges ``seem to me like a reorganization of his ranks
before a new offensive against Montenegro,'' said Montenegro's
pro-Western president, Milo Djukanovic, a strong critic of
Milosevic.
	    &UR; Milosevic ``has ... PICKUP 13th graf pvs.

Television station sues over campaign ad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A Puerto Rican television station
is suing Gov. Pedro Rossello's party over footage of a news
reporter in an advertisement advocating U.S. statehood for the
island.
	   WAPA-TV Televicentro, San Juan's Channel 4, claims the ad
implies that reporter Luis Guardiola endorses U.S. statehood in an
upcoming vote on Puerto Rico's relationship with the United States.
	   It filed suit against Rossello's New Progressive Party on Friday
in San Juan Superior Court, the San Juan Star newspaper reported.
Lawyers are asking a judge for an order to stop running the ad.
	   The Dec. 13 vote asks Puerto Ricans to choose between statehood,
independence, independence with treaty ties to the United States,
continued commonwealth or ``none of the above,'' a protest vote.
	   The ad shows an interview with San Juan mayor Sila Calderon in
which she calls it ``absurd'' for opponents of statehood to vote
for ``none of the above.'' Calderon has since changed her mind.
	   Guardiola is shown interviewing her, then summarizing her
comments during a newscast.
	   WAPA claims the ad used its footage, logo and trademark without
permission. It claims its newscast's commercial value depends on
not being affiliated with any political party, and that the ad
implies Guardiola supports the statehood position.
	   Rossello has refused to withdraw the advertisement.

British driver looking forward to runnerup place
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) _ Eddie Irvine is looking forward to a usual
role in next year's world Formula One championship - being Michael
Schumacher's No.2 at Ferrari.
	   The British driver, who placed fourth in this year's World
Championship won by McLaren's Mika Hakkinen ahead of Schumacher,
said he hoped to improve by two places in the next season.
	   ``I can't place first (in the Championship) because I must work
for Schumacher, and help him to win. Thus I'll be satisfied with
finishing second to Michael next year,'' Irvine said at Bologna
Motor Show, a major motor exhibition, Sunday.
	   ``I refused to be the No.1 driver with another team because
Ferrari is the best car available,'' he added.
	   Joking about risks of Formula One racing, Irivine told some
young fans ``better you play golf or tennis. It's less dangerous
and you make more money.''

Libya's Gadhafi meets son of Jordan's kin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Jordan's King Hussein offered Libya its
support to confront ``unjust measures'' imposed against it, Libyan
radio reported Sunday.
	   Hussein's message came in a letter delivered Sunday by his
eldest son Prince Abdullah to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, said
the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation.
	   It quoted Hussein's letter as saying that Jordan would continue
to ``exert its efforts until these unjust measures are lifted.''
	   The radio broadcast did not say what the measures were, but it
was apparently referring to a U.N. embargo that was imposed on
Libya in 1992 for its refusal to hand over for trial two suspects
in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner.
	   The U.N. sanctions ban air travel in and out of the country but
do not cover oil exports, Libya's economic lifeblood.
	   Also, the radio did not say how Jordan would help Libya to fight
the ``measures.''
	   It said Abdullah congratulated Gadhafi on his recovery from hip
surgery and wished him good health, the radio said, without giving
further details.
	   Gadhafi underwent surgery in July after injuring his hip,
reportedly while exercising.
	   King Hussein is receiving cancer treatment in the United States.
	   Abdullah, widely seen as a special envoy to the king, delivers
verbal and written messages from Hussein to foreign leaders.

Sicilian police arrest five in art trafficking, one escapes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CATANIA, Sicily (AP) _ Police here Sunday arrested two
professors and three businessmen for presumed illegal trafficking
in artifacts, but a sixth suspect escaped through a tunnel under
his villa, which was crammed with thousands of ancient vases and
bowls, even in the bathrooms.
	   Police were searching for Vincenzo Cammarata, a wealthy coin
dealer who lives near Piazza Amerina, an ancient Roman hunting
lodge in eastern Sicily.
	   Investigators allege that Cammarata is the brains behind a
suspected ring involving the Mafia in international trafficking of
illegally obtained ancient objects, the Italian news agency ANSA
reported.
	   Officers found Cammarata at home, but while they looked,
stunned, at the shelves full of artifacts all over his home, he ran
into one of several tunnels under the villa, ANSA said.
	   Last year, a U.S. federal judge ruled that an antique gold
platter sold at one point to Cammarata must be returned to Italy
because it was unlawfully imported into the United States.
	   The platter originally was discovered in a state-protected
archaeological area om Sicily. Under Italian law, any ancient
object that is dug up must be turned over to the state.
	   Arrested in the raids Sunday, ANSA reported, were a professor of
ancient history at the University of Catania, Giacomo Manganaro; a
geopolitics professor, Salvo Di Bella, and three Italians, Morando
Moretti, Alfio Attanasio and Gianfranco Casolari.
	   An expert from the Catania cultural wealth superintendency,
Maria Grazia Branciforte, who is serving as a consultant to the
prosecutors, said the artifacts appeared to have been dug up by
grave-robbers and other thieves who search at night through ancient
sites. The thieves apparently had the backing of the Mafia in
central Italy Italy and especially in Sicily, she was quoted as
saying.
	   The ring allegedly sold the ancient coins, dishes, urns, plates
and other objects to collectors around the world, investigators
said.

Texaco chairman meets with Saudi crown prince on oil proposals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Texaco on Sunday became the first
American oil company to take advantage of Saudi Arabia's invitation
to submit plans for development of its energy resources.
	   Peter Bijur, Texaco's chairman and chief executive, put forward
his ideas in a meeting here with Crown Prince Abdullah, an oil
official said.
	   He said the Texaco chief showed Abdullah proposals for joint
ventures for both the oil and gas sectors. The official, who spoke
on condition anonymity, did not give any details.
	   Bijur, who arrived here Saturday on a four-day visit, also met
with Oil Minister Ali Naimi and head of the state-owned Saudi
ARAMCO, Abdullah Jumaa, the official said.
	   Abdullah met with senior executives from seven U.S. oil
companies during a visit to Washington in September and asked for
``recommendations and suggestions'' on ways the Americans could
contribute to the development of the kingdom's energy resources.
	   Abdullah's overture marked the first time the Saudis sought
outside participation since the kingdom nationalized its oil
industry in 1973. Since then, no foreign companies have been
involved in exploration or production in Saudi Arabia.
	   The Saudis are looking for outside investments because of
financial problems stemming from low world oil prices and growing
competition from other producers, such as Venezuela and Mexico.
	   Abdullah has been overseeing day-to-day running of the
government since 1995, when his half-brother, King Fahd, had a
stroke. Abdullah is next in line for the throne.
	   Those attending the September meeting with Abdullah included
senior executives from Mobil Corp., Exxon Corp., Texaco Inc. and
Chevron Corp. _ all partners in the Arabian American Oil Co. in the
1930s. Also present were executives from Atlantic Richfield Co.,
Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co.
	   Saudi Arabia has the world's largest known oil reserves _ more
than 260 billion barrels _ and the lowest extraction costs. Its oil
production at about 8 million barrels a day is second only to the
United States.

London-based dissident's sister detained in Saudi Arabia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ The sister of exiled Saudi dissident
Mohammad al-Massari has been detained in Saudi Arabia, an Islamic
human rights group said in a statement Sunday.
	   Suha al-Massari, 33, was taken into custody in the Red Sea port
city of Jiddah upon arrival from London last Monday, the Islamic
Observation Center said in a statement.
	   She was taken on the same day to Al-Hayer prison in the Saudi
capital Riyadh, the statement said.
	   A Saudi official confirmed the detention and said authorities
were questioning Suha al-Massari about her brother's activities in
London. The official, who spoke on customary condition of
anonymity, did not give any other details.
	   Mohammad Al-Massari heads the Committee for the Defense of
Legitimate Rights. The opposition group seeks far-reaching reforms
in conservative Saudi Arabia and sharply criticizes what it views
as widespread corruption and mismanagement by members of the ruling
Al Saud family.
	   Al-Massari said his sister was not involved in any political
activity and was in London for the past 18 months caring for his
children.
	   ``The Saudi authorities acted without thinking,'' he told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview from London. ``If they
arrested her to extract information they will be disappointed,
because she is not involved in my work.''
	   She had decided to return to Saudi Arabia to be with her family
during the holy month of Ramadan, which starts around Dec. 20, said
an official of the Islamic Observation Center. He asked that his
name not be used.
	   The center, an advocacy group for human rights for Moslems
around the world, said it had sent a letter to Saudi Arabia's Crown
Prince Abdullah saying that Suha al-Massari's arrest without charge
violated Islamic principles. The center urged Abdullah to intervene
on her behalf.
	   The group will hold a sit-in in front of the Saudi embassy in
London next Friday to protest her arrest, the official said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A widow who is accused of killing her husband, a
prominent Russian lawmaker, has been examined by psychiatrists and
found sane, her daughter and son-in-law said Sunday.
	   Tamara Rokhlin confessed last summer to shooting and killing her
husband, retired Gen. Lev Rokhlin, a fierce critic of President
Boris Yeltsin. She has been charged with murder.
	   Her daughter and son-in-law, who were interviewed on television
Sunday, reiterated previous statements that Tamara Rokhlin had only
confessed because of a threat against her children, according to
the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Her children maintain that the killing was politically motivated
and that their mother had nothing to do with it.

ITF head says changes could come for Davis Cup

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The International Tennis Federation is
studying ways to create more interest in the Davis Cup among
players and fans, the governing body's head said Sunday.
	   Proposals include cutting matches in early rounds from best-of-5
sets to best-of-3, giving the returning finalist nations
first-round byes, and trying to convince the ATP to award rankings
points for Davis Cup matches.
	   ``Does that get (Pete) Sampras or whoever to play? Believe me,
we are looking at the options,'' said ITF president Brian Tobin, in
Milan for the Davis Cup final, which Sweden won 4-1 over Italy.
	   Neither No. 1 Sampras or No. 6 Andre Agassi played in the
semifinals, when Italy ousted the United States.
	   Citing personal goals, primarily his pursuit of Roy Emerson's
record 12 Grand Slam tournament titles, Sampras has played Davis
Cup just once since leading the United States to the 1995 title.
	   ``We absolutely congratulate (Sampras) on being No. 1 in the
world for the sixth time,'' Tobin said, ``but there's also talk
about him trying to match Roy Emerson's record as a tennis player
and a tennis champion.
	   ``I'm not knocking Pete, but just sit back for a minute and have
a look at the two records. Pete has 11 Grand Slams and two Davis
Cups. Emerson has 12 Grand Slams and eight Davis Cup final wins on
his record. So how would you compare the two?''
	   Tobin said he is concerned that matches may be taking too much
time, and noted that Swedish television cut off its broadcast of
the five-hour opening singles match here Friday with the score 5-5
in the fifth set.
	   He added, though, that it is unlikely changes will be made
before 2001.

Feyenoord fluke opens up six-point lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS number of games played by Feyenoord in second graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ An own goal three minutes from
time Sunday by NEC Nijmegen defender Luuk Maes gave Feyenoord
Rotterdam a very fortunate 1-0 win on a day Ajax could only draw.
	   Feyenoord (12-2-1) now leads Ajax (9-5-3) and Vitesse (10-2-4)
by six clear points, having played a game fewer than Vitesse and
two fewer than Ajax.
	   NEC had created just as many chances as Feyenoord and looked
good value for a point when Maes toe-poked Jean-Paul van Gastel's
harmless-looking free-kick past his own keeper.
	   Ajax's recent injury malaise continued after the news this week
that key offensive players Jari Litmanen and Shota Arveladze will
be out of the running until the new year.
	   With Wednesday's crucial Champions League trip to FC Porto
looming, Ajax needed an 83rd-minute Sunday Oliseh equalizer to
salvage a 1-1 draw against struggling MVV Maastricht.
	   The league should have reached its 17-game half-way point but
has an uneven look due to the Dutch KNVB football association's
irregular fixture list and a string of weather-caused
postponements.
	   Cambuur Leeuwarden's 2-1 win at Sparta Rotterdam was its 18th
game, compared to NAC Breda, which has only played 14.
	   Four points from six meant a good week for Bobby Robson's PSV,
adding a 4-3 win at NAC in the Brabant derby Sunday to its 3-3 draw
at fourth-placed SC Heerenveen Tuesday.
	   PSV's league top-scorer Ruud van Nistelrooy found the net in the
NAC game to take his total to 14, two ahead of Greek Nikos Machlas
who opened the scoring in Vitesse's unlikely win Friday.
	   The Arnhem side jumped to second place after staging a
spectacular comeback to down Willem II 5-3 in Tilburg, its first
away victory in three months.
	   With 17 minutes to go Vitesse was 3-1 down but then as injured
Willem II defender Delano Hill was being escorted off the field
Ghanean striker Mamadou Zongo pounced to bring the game to life.
	   The Tilburg defense degenerated into panic-stricken chaos and
Martijn Reuser, Louis Laros and Zongo again all found the net.

	   MWANZA, Tanzania (AP) _ Oscar Niyiragira would love more than
anything for his family to be able to go home to Burundi, but
returning to his ethnically segregated homeland would mean almost
certain death.
	   Instead, Niyiragira, his wife and their four children will be
among 228 mixed-marriage refugees from Burundi and Rwanda who are
leaving refugee camps in Tanzania and heading Sunday for a new life
in the United States.
	   Niyiragira is a Burundian Hutu. His wife Regine Katabarwa is a
Tutsi. For their four children, no place in Burundi, split by
ethnic civil war, would be safe.
	   ``You know, this one is neither Hutu nor Tutsi,'' Niyiragira
said of the three-year-old son sitting on his lap. ``He's mixed. So
there is nowhere he can find peace. If he goes on the side of the
Tutsis, he'll be killed. If he goes into Hutuland, he'll be
killed.''
	   In both Rwanda and Burundi, Tutsis are minorities with Hutus
making up more than 80 percent of the population.
	   The families, which represent only a handful of the more than
250,000 Burundian and 6,000 Rwandan refugees in Tanzania, were
recommended for repatriation in the United States by the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.
	   The United States, which has agreed to take in 12,000 African
refugees for its 1998-99 fiscal year, opened its doors.
	   ``Their options for Tanzania were very limited: they can't go
home and in Tanzania they would remain under refugee status,'' said
Kevin Richardson, U.S. Refugee Coordinator for East Africa.
	   To be accepted, the refugees at the Mkugwa camp in northwestern
Tanzania underwent screening by a U.S. immigration officer, and
medical tests to see if they were free of contagious diseases.
	   Two tested positive for AIDS and were excluded, according to the
International Organization for Migration, a multi-state agency
contracted by the U.S. government to handle the move.
	   The agency then gave them a brief cultural orientation course
about what to expect in America, ranging from the need for a
driver's license to racism against blacks.
	   On Wednesday, seven buses carrying the refugees left Mkugwa for
Mwanza in northern Tanzania, where they received medication,
clothing and shoes.
	   On Sunday evening, the first planeload of 57 refugees were to
fly to Nairobi, Kenya and then to John F. Kennedy airport in New
York. From there, they would head to final destinations across the
United States.
	   ``If I can get to a country where there is peace, I think I can
stay there and continue my life,'' said Burundian-born Emmanuel
Sibomana in halting English. ``It is an extraordinary
opportunity.''
	   Sibomana, 33, is a wood carver. His Hutu family fled Burundi's
civil war in 1972 and settled in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, where
he met his Tutsi wife and had a son.
	   But the 1994 Hutu government-sponsored Rwandan genocide of more
than half a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus sent the young family
into exile, first to the former Zaire, and finally, Tanzania. He is
going to Washington, D.C.
	   Niyiragira fled Burundi in 1993, after Tutsi paratroopers killed
the country's first democratically elected president. Bloodletting
between the Tutsi military and Hutu rebels has since killed more
than 200,000 Burundians.
	   They fled to the former Zaire, but had to leave when war broke
out there in 1996.
	   ``I was hated by both sides. I had nowhere to go, no one to talk
to, so I decided to leave,'' said Niyiragira.
	   Thrilled to be going to Louisville, Kentucky, he regrets leaving
his native home.
	   ``It makes me a bit sick because my children are going to lose
all my culture,'' he said. ``But I am happy because they are going
far away from that stupid war, that hatred.''

Investigation says prize-winning drugs documentary a fake
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; UPDATES with reaction from U.S. program ``60 Minutes.'' Graf 2 adds
CBS broadcast in June 1997 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A prize-winning British television documentary
about drug running from Colombia which was shown around the world,
was a fake, an investigation has concluded.
	   Makers of ``The Connection,'' parts of which were aired in June
1997 on the CBS program ``60 Minutes,'' paid actors to portray
drugs dealers, faked locations, and falsely claimed there was a new
heroin route from Colombia to Britain, the investigation found,
London's Guardian newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The documentary, made by a British production company, Carlton
Communications, for the British network Independent Television, was
investigated after The Guardian challenged its authenticity in a
series of articles in May.
	   The report by a panel of lawyers and independent TV producers
was released at the weekend.
	   The Independent Television Commission, the regulatory body for
ITV, said the report was ``thorough.''
	   In a statement, the commission said the report ``points clearly
to the fact that the program was, in important respects, in breach
of the ITC's Program Code.''
	   The Guardian said Carlton Communications broadcasting director
Nigel Walmsley is sending back eight national and international
awards won by the documentary.
	   ``We are refunding overseas broadcasters who bought ``The
Connection'','' The Guardian quoted Walmsley as saying.
	   In New York, ``60 Minutes'' spokesman Kevin Tedesco said the
program had made viewers aware of the initial allegations in May.
He said the program was analyzing the latest claims, and would
likely report on them during the Dec. 13 show.

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ They held flowers, chanted and walked
in a solemn procession.
	   It wasn't a saint they were paying homage to, but Hugo Chavez,
the leader of a bloody 1992 coup attempt who was the favorite to
win Sunday's presidential election.
	   The faithful started lining up hours before El Comandante
arrived to vote at a church-run pre-school in eastern Caracas. They
hoped to get a glimpse of the man they think will punish the
corrupt and reward the oppressed.
	   ``Chavez is the salvation of the country,'' said Jose Vincente
Acosta, a retired musician.
	   For millions of poor people fed up with decades of corruption,
the 44-year-old cashiered lieutenant colonel is a savior.
	   ``Corruption has become a career in this country,'' said
university student Humberto Oropeza.
	   The crowd broke into delirious cheers when Chavez's jeep
appeared.
	   National Guardsmen carrying machine guns were barely able to
open a path for the vehicle. Chavez finally emerged, wearing a suit
and tie and without his trademark red parachutist's beret, and
muscled his way to the school's door.
	   Crushed by the roaring throng, his wife, Maria Isabel, made it,
too, but she clutched her neck in pain and cried.
	   Inside, the candidate cast his vote and spoke to reporters. At
one point, about 50 people burst through a side door from the
adjacent church to try to see him.
	   Outside, people climbed up trees and light poles and stood atop
telephone booths and trucks to get a view.
	   Chavez finally came out, fought his way through the swarm again
and escaped into the vehicle. The crowd screamed and the candidate
sped off, heading to an undisclosed location to await the election
results.

Report: Netanyahu froze peace process to keep hard-liners in
</HEADLINE>
coalition

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Under pressure from hard-liners who threatened
to bolt his government, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu secretly
agreed to freeze the peace process and use Palestinian violations
of agreements as an excuse, according to a report on Israeli TV.
	   The report said that Nissim Smolianski, a member of the National
Religious Party, told Netanyahu that if he went ahead with further
West Bank troop withdrawals as agreed upon in the latest Mideast
peace accord, the NRP would topple the government.
	   Smolianski refused to comment directly on the report.
	   Israel has carried out a first of three staged withdrawals from
the West Bank. The next withdrawal is scheduled for Dec. 18.
	   Israel's Channel 2 TV said Netanyahu and Smolianski agreed about
ten days ago that the premier would freeze movement in the
U.S.-brokered agreement. Netanyahu then ordered his staff to begin
collecting lists of Palestinian violations of the deal signed in
Washington in October, Channel 2 said.
	   On Nov. 29, Netanyahu sent a letter to U.S. President Bill
Clinton complaining about a list of Palestinian violations.
	   Four days later, Israel announced a suspension of further troop
withdrawals and implementation of the Mideast accord after an
Israeli soldier was attacked by a Palestinian mob in the West Bank.
Netanyahu said at the time that his decision was based on
Palestinian violations and in part on the attack and that he would
not go forward with the agreement until the Palestinians had met a
list of demands.
	   After the announcement, NRP reversed earlier calls to bring down
Netanyahu and said they would now vote against a bill before
parliament calling for early elections. Their parliamentary support
is crucial for Netanyahu to remain in power.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser David Bar-Illan would not comment
directly on the television report. He said that Israel would live
up to its part of the deal once the Palestinians had lived up to
their commitments.
	   ``The government insists on reciprocity and will continue to
insist on reciprocity and compliance by the Palestinian Authority.
We are not looking for violations, unfortunately they are only too
obvious.''
	   Netanyahu has been under intense pressure from powerful
right-wing members of his shaky coalition who support the Jewish
settler movement and oppose ceding war-captured land to Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat's control.
	   Senior officials in the Palestinian Authority have repeatedly
charged that Netanyahu has sought excuses to end the peace
agreements in order to save his government.

Feyenoord fluke opens up six-point lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ NEC Nijmegen defender Luuk Maes'
handed Feyenoord Rotterdam a 1-0 win Sunday, when he tapped a free
kick past his own keeper.
	   Maes' own goal three minutes from time came when he poked
Jean-Paul van Gastel's harmless-looking free-kick into Feyenoord's
goal.
	   Feyenoord (12-2-1) now leads Ajax (9-5-3) and Vitesse (10-2-4)
by six points, having played two games fewer than Vitesse and three
fewer than Ajax.
	   Ajax's recent injury malaise continued after the news this week
that key offensive players Jari Litmanen and Shota Arveladze will
be out of the running until the new year.
	   With Wednesday's crucial Champions League trip to FC Porto
looming, Ajax needed an 83rd-minute Sunday Oliseh equalizer to
salvage a 1-1 draw against struggling MVV Maastricht.
	   The league should have reached its 17-game half-way point but
has an uneven look due to the Dutch KNVB football association's
irregular fixture list and a string of weather-caused
postponements.
	   Cambuur Leeuwarden's 2-1 win at Sparta Rotterdam was its 18th
game, compared to NAC Breda, which has only played 14.
	   Four points from six meant a good week for Bobby Robson's PSV,
adding a 4-3 win at NAC in the Brabant derby Sunday to its 3-3 draw
at fourth-placed SC Heerenveen Tuesday.
	   PSV's league top-scorer Ruud van Nistelrooy found the net in the
NAC game to take his total to 14, two ahead of Greek Nikos Machlas
who opened the scoring in Vitesse's unlikely win Friday.
	   The Arnhem side jumped to second place after staging a
spectacular comeback to down Willem II 5-3 in Tilburg, its first
away victory in three months.
	   With 17 minutes to go Vitesse was 3-1 down but then as injured
Willem II defender Delano Hill was being escorted off the field,
Ghanian striker Mamadou Zongo pounced to bring the game to life.
	   The Tilburg defense degenerated into chaos and Martijn Reuser,
Louis Laros and Zongo again all found the net.

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ More than 500 candidates competed
Sunday in a down-and-dirty city election that was overshadowed by
the shooting death of a leading liberal politician.
	   Voter turnout was high by Russian standards, with 38 percent of
voters casting ballots. But despite the strong interest, nobody was
expected to win outright. With so many candidates vying for seats
in the municipal legislature, runoffs were considered certain in
most or all races.
	   The election captured nationwide interest, mainly because of the
Nov. 20 killing of Galina Starovoitova, a member of the Russian
parliament who was pushing a liberal bloc of candidates in the St.
Petersburg elections.
	   Some of Starovoitova's supporters have suggested she was killed
to prevent her faction, Northern Capital, from doing well in the
election. It seemed possible, however, that it would have the
opposite effect of rallying her followers.
	   The election was also considered important because the municipal
legislature in St. Petersburg has been given enhanced powers under
a new city charter, and will have a much stronger voice in city
affairs than similar bodies elsewhere in Russia.
	   Perhaps because of those stakes, the campaign was marred by
dirty tricks, violence and threats of violence.
	   Alexander Yakovlev, the city's mayor, strongly opposed the new
charter, which curtails his clout. He was not on the ballot, but
critics said his supporters contributed to the mean-spirited
atmosphere surrounding the election.
	   Yakovlev's opponents found that people with names identical to
theirs mysteriously wound up on the ballot in an apparent attempt
to confuse voters and take away votes from liberals.
	   In addition, anti-Semitic leaflets were handed out asking
citizens not to vote for Jewish candidates, and one candidate's
posters were defaced with slurs against Jews.
	   There were multiple reports of attempts to bribe voters. Police
said they arrested three people who were offering bribes ranging
from 25 to 50 rubles (dlrs 1.25 to 2.50) in exchange for votes for
specified candidates, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Three polling stations were briefly closed after someone
telephoned bomb threats to local authorities. No bombs were found.
	   St. Petersburg, Russia's second largest city, was at the
forefront of the country's democracy movement a decade ago, but
much of its sense of itself as a progressive, Western-oriented city
has faded, at least in terms of city politics.
	   In these elections, St. Petersburg appeared at least as dirty
and deadly as anywhere in Russia.
	   Last year, the city's deputy governor was gunned down in the
city center. In the past two months, hitmen have claimed the lives
of a legislative aide, a high-ranking city official and a prominent
banker.
	   Last month's killing of Starovoitova, the country's most
prominent female politician, drew international condemnation and
focused attention on St. Petersburg's crime problems.
	   On Sunday, authorities said a businessman from the nearby city
of Novgorod was shot and killed in a St. Petersburg apartment
building by someone using a small-caliber pistol equipped with a
silencer _ the typical weapon of the city's contract hitmen.
	   Local prosecutors said the crime was unrelated to the election,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Boris Nemtsov, the former first deputy premier, recently visited
St. Petersburg and called it ``the crime capital of Russia.''
	   St. Petersburg's 3.7 million voters seem fed up with the city's
crime and corruption, and its poor economic performance. But it
wasn't clear how that would play itself out in terms of voting.
	   Preliminary election results were not expected until sometime
Monday.

	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ The capital of the Dominican Republic, Santo
Domingo, beat out cities in Mexico and Colombia on Sunday to be
chosen as the host city for the 2003 Pan American Games.
	   Members of the general assembly of the Pan American Sports
Organization selected Santo Domingo in a second round of voting in
Panama. The first round of voting eliminated Medellin, Colombia.
	   Santo Domingo, home to 3 million people, beat out the western
Mexico city of Guadalajara in the final tally. The vote count was
not released.
	   Delegates from the Dominican Republican, which was beat out by
Winnipeg, Canada, to play host to the 1999 games, wept with joy.
	   ``This is a stimulus for Dominican sports,'' said the president
of the Dominican Olympic committee, Jose Puello Herrera, who leapt
from his seat and threw his arms in the air when his capital city
was announced the winner.
	   A group of children dressed in the country's colors, red and
blue, broke out in a merengue dance to celebrate.
	   Puello Herrera said the Dominican Republic, which suffered heavy
damage from Hurricane Georges in September, will be ready for 2003.
It already has repaired nearly 86 percent of the infrastructure
needed for the games, which will cost nearly $100 million to
organize.
	   The Colombian team could not hide its sadness.
	   ``We had not expected this given the enormous amount of
promotional work that was done,'' said Julio Ceballos, president of
league sports in Antioquia.
	   The chief of Colombia's police, Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano, had
visited the assembly meeting on Saturday to allay concerns over
public security in Medellin, which was torn by drug violence in the
1980s and early 1990s.
	   The Mexicans also expressed disappointment, but accepted the
decision.
	   ``Four years ago the Dominican Republic lost, but today it
won,'' said Mario Vasquez Rana, head of the Mexican Olympic
committee. ``Now they have they big commitment of putting on good
games. They can count on our support.''
	   In trying to win backing for Guadalajara, Mexican delegates had
offered to give about $51,000 to each of the hemisphere's 42
Olympic committees to boost training programs for athletes. The
Colombian delegation accused Mexico of attempted vote-buying.
	   Puello Herrera attributed Sunday's victory to a strong
promotional campaign among the region's Olympic committees.
	   ``We knocked on every door. They saw us as credible and secure.
Today they voted with us, with their hearts,'' he said.
	   The 2003 games will mark the third time that a Caribbean nation
has been the host country. Previous hosts were Puerto Rico and
Cuba.

Annan arrives in Abu Dhabi to attend Gulf summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan arrived here Sunday to attend a summit of the Gulf
Cooperation Council, a federation of six Arab Gulf states.
	   Annan, who flew in from the Tunisian island of Jerba met
Saturday with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in the Libyan desert to
try to arrange the trial of two suspects in the bombing of a Pan Am
airliner. But they failed to reach an agreement.
	   The 60-year-old Annan is trying to get Libya to go along with a
U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects before a panel of
Scottish judges in the Netherlands for the 1988 bombing over
Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   Annan and South Africa's President Nelson Mandela are in Abu
Dhabi to attend the GCC summit. The GCC groups Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.
	   Mandela and Annan are the first leaders outside the grouping to
attend the annual three-day summit, which opens Monday. They were
apparently invited to add luster to the meeting.
	   GCC officials said Annan was not expected to bring up his
discussions in Libya in Monday's opening address.

Fog foils downhill race again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WHISTLER, British Columbia (AP) _ Heavy fog forced cancellation
of the men's World Cup downhill race here on Sunday for the third
straight day.
	   Attempts to hold the race Friday and Saturday were foiled by a
thick layer of fog which reduced visibility on sections of the
3,185-meter (10,449 feet) Dave Murray course.
	   Canadian ski officials have reacted angrily to comments from an
International Ski Federation official who said three years of
weather problems leaves the Whistler race in jeopardy of being left
off next year's calendar.
	   ``It will be really tough for me to come up with a proposal
again to put Whistler on the calendar,'' Gunter Hujara, FIS's chief
race director, said Saturday. ``I cannot propose it once more.''
	   Patrick LaForge, Alpine Canada's president, said he was
``surprised and interested'' by Hujara's comments.
	   ``It's early in the season for the FIS men's World Cup downhill
circuit, but who knows,'' LaForge said. ``All races could be
canceled due to bad weather, in which case the situation at
Whistler would be only no more than average.''
	   Hujara had said that even holding a race Sunday wouldn't
necessarily mean a return of the World Cup to Whistler next year.
	   A super-giant slalom race scheduled for this weekend has been
canceled and will be added onto the season in Europe.
	   Poor weather has wiped out the race the last two years.
	   ``We have to follow reasonable facts,'' Hujara said. ``We tried
it three years in a row now, really tried it.''

Rio slum dwellers fed up with abusive police
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY JACK EPSTEIN
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Tired of police beating down their
doors, slum dwellers are showing they are wise to the law by
posting the Brazilian constitution on their doors guaranteeing
every citizen the ``inviolability of the home.''
	   Many residents of Dona Marta, one of Rio's most miserable slums,
are taking a novel approach to halting police abuse by reminding
law enforcement officers that the constitution requires a search
warrant before entering a citizen's home to look for lawbreakers.
	   ``Unfortunately, most poor people in Brazil are unaware of their
rights,'' said James Cavallaro, Brazil director of Human Rights
Watch. ``In Dona Marta, residents hope that telling the police they
know the law will make it more difficult for them to traipse over
their rights like they usually do.''
	   Dona Marta is one of 608 slums, known here as favelas, where
one-fifth of Rio's 6 million residents live. It is a rat-infested
shantytown with maze-like alleys that twist up through muddy hovels
and open sewage along a hilltop with a million dollar view of Rio's
spectacular Guanabara Bay. Even though it doesn't exist on official
city maps, more than 12,000 residents call it home.
	   In most favelas, drug gangs rule, often engaging in turf wars or
shoot-outs with police in which residents are caught in the middle.
Dona Marta is one of the most violent slums with constant gun
battles between police and traffickers led by a drug lord named
Marcinho VP.
	   In 1996, Marcinho VP rose to national prominence after
reportedly receiving protection money from pop star Michael
Jackson's production crew. Jackson allegedly paid Marcinho for
permission to film a music video in Dona Marta called ``They Don't
Care About Us.''
	   In most cases, Rio's poorly trained and unprofessional police
don't rely on systematic investigations to arrest suspects. Nor do
they take the time to ask a judge for a search warrant when seeking
out suspects. They typically use beatings to extract confessions
and the boot to kick down doors, human rights groups say.
	   ``Is it right to mistreat an entire community for the sins of 30
criminals?''asked Andre Fernandes, who heads a non-governmental
organization called Citizenship House.
	   For the past six months, Citizenship House has offered residents
legal workshops and distributed copies of both the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and the Brazilian Constitution.
	   As a result, residents have not only posted the penal code
regarding the inviolability of the home, but have also painted a
mural at the slum's entrance highlighting Article 5 of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights: ``No one shall be subjected
to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
punishment.''
	   In response, Second Precinct Police Col. Francisco D'Ambrosio
says the entire campaign has been orchestrated by the drug gangs.
	   ``There are 20 bandits that are manipulating (residents) to make
our work more difficult,'' he told the newspaper O Globo on Sunday.
``They are angry because they are being weakened by police
intelligence.''
	   In the meantime, residents say they will continue to exert their
rights.
	   ``We don't want the police to leave Dona Marta and we certaintly
want them to arrest criminals,'' said Fernandes. ``But the
mistreatment must stop.''

	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican
Republic, beat out Guadalajara, Mexico and Medellin, Colombia on
Sunday to be chosen as the host city for the 2003 Pan American
Games.
	   Members of the general assembly of the Pan American Sports
Organization selected Santo Domingo in a second round of voting
after eliminating Medellin in the first round and Guadalajara in
the second. The vote count was not released.
	   Delegates from the Dominican Republican, which lost the 1999
games to Winnipeg, Canada, wept with joy.
	   ``This is a stimulus for Dominican sports,'' said the president
of the Dominican Olympic committee, Jose Puello Herrera, who jumped
from his seat and threw his arms in the air when his capital city
was announced the winner.
	   A group of children dressed in the country's colors, red and
blue, broke out in a merengue dance to celebrate.
	   Puello Herrera said the Dominican Republic, which suffered heavy
damage from Hurricane Georges in September, will be ready for 2003.
It already has repaired nearly 86 percent of the infrastructure
needed for the games, which will cost nearly dlrs 100 million to
organize.
	   Colombian representatives could not hide their disappointment.
	   ``We had not expected this given the enormous amount of
promotional work that was done,'' said Julio Ceballos, president of
league sports in Antioquia.
	   The chief of Colombia's police, Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano, had
visited the assembly meeting on Saturday to allay concerns over
public security in Medellin, which was torn by drug violence in the
1980s and early 1990s.
	   The Mexicans also expressed disappointment, but accepted the
decision.
	   ``Four years ago the Dominican Republic lost, but today it
won,'' said Mario Vasquez Rana, head of the Mexican Olympic
committee. ``Now they have the big commitment of putting on good
games. They can count on our support.''
	   In trying to win backing for Guadalajara, Mexican delegates had
offered to give about dlrs 51,000 to each of the hemisphere's 42
Olympic committees to boost training programs for athletes. The
Colombian delegation accused Mexico of attempted vote-buying.
	   Puello Herrera attributed Sunday's victory to a strong
promotional campaign among the region's Olympic committees.
	   ``We knocked on every door. They saw us as credible and secure.
Today they voted with us, with their hearts,'' he said.
	   The 2003 games will mark the third time that a Caribbean nation
has been the host country. Previous hosts were Puerto Rico and
Cuba.

Judge to receive Tyson's probation report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVE HERMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ In a step that could result in Mike Tyson
returning to prison, a probation officer plans to submit a report
Monday to the judge who sentenced the former heavyweight champion
on rape charges more than six years ago.
	   Tyson pleaded no contest to misdemeanor assault charges in
Maryland last week, and that could be used as evidence of a
possible parole violation.
	   The paperwork was expected to be filed with Judge Patricia
Gifford in Superior Court by probation officer George Walker.
County officials have said no action toward a possible revocation
of probation will be taken until Tyson is sentenced in Maryland
early next year.
	   The Montgomery County (Maryland) District Court said no exact
sentencing date has been set.
	   Tyson was released from prison in 1995 after serving half his
six-year sentence for raping a beauty pageant contestant in an
Indianapolis hotel room in 1991.
	   Gifford added four years of probation, however, meaning Tyson
could be sent back to jail for any further violation. His probation
is scheduled to expire in March.
	   Tyson's no-contest plea stemmed from a minor traffic accident in
August in which two motorists claimed the boxer kicked and punched
them.
	   Indiana authorities also reviewed the probation _ but took no
action _ after Tyson bit Evander Holyfield's ears during a title
bout in June 1997. The Nevada Athletic Commission stripped Tyson of
his boxing license but reinstated him in October.
	   Tyson plans to fight Francois Botha on Jan. 16 in Las Vegas. A
news conference is expected to be held Tuesday in Los Angeles to
announce the bout.
	   Walker said last week that Gifford will have great latitude in
responding to his report.
	   ``The judge can do everything from nothing, all the way to
imposing the originally suspended sentence, and anything in
between,'' he said.
	   However, the man who prosecuted Tyson told a New York newspaper
he didn't expect the no-contest plea to affect the boxer's
probation.
	   ``Most NFL players do more than that before lunchtime,'' Greg
Garrison told the Daily News. ``I'm no fan of his, but I don't see
this being too important at all.
	   ``She sees so many things worse than this. I can't imagine she
would care too much,'' Garrison said of Gifford.
	   The no-contest plea was not an admission of guilt. However,
Tyson could face up to 20 years in prison _ 10 years on each count
_ and be fined up to dlrs 5,000. The two men he scuffled with
already have agreed to a settlement to avoid a civil suit.
	   Tyson is training in the Phoenix area and intends to live there.
He already has registered as a sex offender in Arizona as part of
his planned move.
	   To clear the way for his move, Tyson is selling his 62-acre (25
hectare) estate in Ohio along with homes in Las Vegas and
Connecticut, The Plain Dealer of Cleveland reports. The total
asking price is dlrs 21 million.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ With the latest Mideast peace accord on hold,
Israel and the Palestinians exchanged angry accusations Sunday over
Jewish settlements and street clashes.
	   Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian parliament, warned of
possible violence if Israel continues to expand settlements in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the Palestinians hope to establish
a state.
	   ``If settlement activity continues, then all means of resistance
are open,'' Qureia, who is also known as Abu Ala, told reporters in
the West Bank town of Ramallah.
	   Since the signing of a land-for-security accord, Jewish settlers
have accelerated the establishment of makeshift communities on West
Bank hilltops, in an explicit bid to keep the land from being
turned over to the Palestinians.
	   After an attack on an Israeli soldier by a Palestinian mob in
the West Bank last week, Israel announced it was suspending the
accord until the Palestinians stopped violating the agreement.
	   Israel's Channel 2 TV reported Sunday that Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, under pressure from hard-liners who threatened
to bolt his government over the accord, had secretly agreed to
freeze the deal days before the attack took place and use
Palestinian violations as an excuse.
	   The report said that Nissim Smolianski, a member of the National
Religious Party, told Netanyahu that if he went ahead with further
West Bank troop withdrawals as agreed upon in the latest Mideast
peace accord, the NRP would topple the government.
	   Smolianski refused to comment directly on the report.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser David Bar-Illan would not comment
directly on the television report. He said that Israel would live
up to its part of the deal once the Palestinians had lived up to
their commitments.
	   ``The government insists on reciprocity and will continue to
insist on reciprocity and compliance by the Palestinian Authority.
We are not looking for violations, unfortunately they are only too
obvious.''

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ In presidential elections Sunday,
Venezuelans chose between an ex-army paratrooper who once staged a
bloody coup attempt and a Yale-educated former governor promising
peace and prosperity.
	   The ex-coup leader was the favorite to win.
	   Because of former Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez's meteoric rise in the
polls, the vote turned into a confrontation between rich and poor _
and a flashing red warning sign for the rest of Latin America.
	   ``These are historic elections. Nothing like these elections has
happened in Venezuela's political history,'' said U.S. Ambassador
John Maisto.
	   For the first time in 40 years of democracy, neither of
Venezuela's two traditional parties fielded candidates.
	   In an effort to head off a Chavez victory, both the center-left
Democratic Action Party and the center-right COPEI Party dumped
their respective candidates during the past week and threw their
support to independent candidate Henrique Salas Romer, who is
running second in the polls.
	   In 1992, Chavez tried and failed to overthrow Venezuela's
democratically elected government. His candidacy has blown a hole
through the conventional wisdom that said democracy and free
markets were inescapable in Latin America.
	   ``Today a new Venezuela is born,'' Chavez told reporters after
casting his ballot amid some 1,000 supporters roaring, ``Chavez!
Chavez!'' and ``Viva Venezuela!'' As he drove away, throngs of
teenagers chased after his white van.
	   The voting Sunday was described as orderly, and it appeared
turnout would be high.
	   Reports that Chavez supporters would stage violent protests if
their candidate loses prompted a call to peace from President
Rafael Caldera.
	   ``The government and armed forces have promised to respect the
electoral results. That respect will be sacrosanct,'' Caldera
vowed, adding that ``we demand that the results be accepted in
peace.''
	   Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition, which calls for a
slowing of privatizations and free-market economic reforms, already
won a plurality of Congress in Nov. 8 regional elections, breaking
the two traditional parties' 40-year political stranglehold.
	   Chavez's call for a new constitution and the dissolving of
Congress has scared investors and exacerbated an economic crisis.
Foreign oil companies, including Exxon, Mobile, Shell and British
Petroleum, have put investment plans on hold.
	   Venezuela is the number one exporter of oil to the United
States.
	   The eleventh-hour attempt by COPEI and Democratic Action to
close ranks around Salas appeared to have failed. A poll taken
earlier this week by the private Datanalisis firm showed Chavez
with a comfortable 16-point lead - he had 53 percent support
compared to Salas's 37 percent. The survey of 1,000 likely voters
had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent.
	   Yet Salas supporters pointed out that the well-greased political
machinery of the old-style parties could enable their candidate to
stage an upset victory.
	   ``I am absolutely convinced that together we are going to return
happiness to Venezuela,'' Salas told reporters after casting his
ballot in his home city of Valencia, 95 miles (150 kms) west of
Caracas.
	   Until this week, Salas had taken great pains to distance himself
from Democratic Action and COPEI _ aware that most Venezuelans
blame them for squandering the world's largest oil reserves outside
the Middle East.
	   The campaign took on overtones of class warfare. Those who
oppose Salas, a former governor of industrial Carabobo state, said
he would defend the interests of the oligarchy if elected.
	   And Chavez's opponents said he is a dictator-in-waiting.
	   ``To those who call us coup leaders or tyrants, we have to
respond to them as Jesus of Nazareth: Forgive them, Lord, for they
know not what they do,'' Chavez bellowed to hundreds of thousands
of supporters at his closing rally in Caracas Wednesday night.
	   Yet Chavez's militaristic rhetoric and his trademark red
parachutist's beret, worn by his supporters at campaign rallies,
terrify middle and upper class Venezuelans, many of whom have
already fled to Miami.
	   ``He's a crazy man on the loose, a communist,'' said Elena
Alamos, an elderly woman casting her vote in Caracas's upper class
Altamira district.
	   An economic crisis caused by a 12-year low in oil prices has
made making ends meet all but impossible for most Venezuelans,
whose standard of living has been steadily declining for more than
15 years.
	   ``We want a change. If Chavez doesn't make this change, what is
going to happen is a social explosion, a revolution,'' said Gabriel
Jimenez, a 45-year-old telecommunications technician.
	   On Sunday, 11 million of the country's 23 million inhabitants
were eligible to vote.
	   Among the trailing candidates was former Miss Universe Irene
Saez, who had led the polls until earlier this year.

Tennessee's No. 1 in AP poll, by a landslide
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICHARD ROSENBLATT &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Tennessee's on top _ and it's unanimous.
	   The Volunteers, the only unbeaten team to survive a wild weekend
of upsets, finished the regular-season ranked No. 1 in The
Associated Press' Top 25 college football poll.
	   And now it's on to the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4 and a chance for
the Vols to win their first national championship since 1951.
	   Tennessee (12-0) capped off a perfect regular season Saturday
night with a 24-14 victory over Mississippi State in the
Southeastern Conference title game. The Vols received all 70
first-place votes and 1,750 points from the sports writers and
broadcasters on the AP panel.
	   It was the first time this season that one team collected every
first-place vote.
	   Florida State (11-1) was the biggest winner after losses by
Kansas State and UCLA, ranked 2-3 last week, even though the
Seminoles didn't play. Florida State moved up two spots to No. 2 in
the AP's final regular-season poll _ the same place they were
ranked in the preseason poll.
	   The Seminoles will play the Vols in the Fiesta Bowl, where a win
could propel Florida State to its second national title.
	   Ohio State (10-1) didn't play, either, but moved up to No. 3
after the balloting, while Kansas State (11-1) fell to No. 4,
Arizona (11-1) moved up to No. 5 and UCLA (10-1) dropped to No. 6.
	   In the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll, the top five Tennessee
moved up to No. 1, followed by Florida State, Ohio State, Kansas
State and Arizona.
	   Kansas State was beaten 36-33 in double overtime by Texas
A-and-M in the Big 12 Conference title game and UCLA was stunned by
Miami 49-45 at the Orange Bowl.
	   Since 1965, when The AP began a poll after the bowl games, every
No. 1 team winning a postseason game has won the national title.
	   Top-ranked teams are 15-15 in bowl games since '65. In 1964,
Oklahoma did not play in a bowl game, and in 1966 and '67, The AP
did not have a poll after the bowls.
	   Florida (9-2) remained No. 7, followed by No. 8 Texas A-and-M
(11-2), No. 9 Wisconsin (10-1) and No. 10 Tulane, at 11-0 the only
other major college unbeaten team.
	   Tennessee, ranked 10th in the preseason poll, took over the No.
1 spot from Ohio State on Nov. 8, a day after the Buckeyes lost to
Michigan State 28-24.
	   Arkansas (9-2), was No. 11, followed by No. 12 Georgia Tech
(9-2), No. 13 Virginia (9--2), No. 14 Nebraska (9-3), No. 15
Michigan (9-3), No. 16 Air Force (11-1), No. 17 Notre Dame (9-2),
No. 18 Syracuse (8-3), No. 19 Georgia (8-3) and No. 20 Texas (8-3).
	   Air Force beat Brigham Young 20-13 on Saturday in the Western
Athletic Conference title game.
	   Oregon (8-3) was No. 21, followed by No. 22 Penn State (8-3),
No. 23 Missouri (7-4), No. 24 Miami (8-3) and No. 25 Mississippi
State (8-4).
	   The AP will announce its national champion on Tuesday, Jan. 5,
the day after the Fiesta Bowl. The Fiesta Bowl winner automatically
becomes the national champion in the coaches' poll.

Boro, Newcastle in 2-2 tie
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hearts beating Celtic

<TEXT>
	   MIDDLESBROUGH, England (AP) _ Substitute Nikos Dabizas headed an
equalizer seven minutes from the end a minute after leaving the
bench as Newcastle twice hit back to earn a 2-2 tie with
Middlesbrough Sunday.
	   The Greek forward sent a long-range looping header over Boro's
Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer from Laurent Charvet's
rightwing cross to earn Ruud Gullit's team a point.
	   Neither team climbed as a result of the tie, Boro remaining
seventh and Newcastle 13th. It was Middlesbrough's sixth tie in
seven Premier League matches and ninth in all.
	   England striker Alan Shearer failed a late fitness test on a
hamstring injury so that he still has to make his first appearance
alongside Duncan Ferguson in the Newcastle attack.
	   Paul Gascoigne, who started his career with Newcastle, set up
the first Middlesbrough goal with a clever corner kick to the
unmarked Andy Townsend, who lofted his shot over the head of
debutant 'keeper Steve Harper from 15 meters.
	   That gave Boro a 13th minute lead but Newcastle leveled in the
38th with a powerful 20-meter drive from Laurent Charvet.
	   Harper made two stunning saves from Brian Deane and Townsend
before Middlesbrough regained the lead with Colin Cooper's
deflected shot in the 59th minute.
	   But Newcastle hit back again and substitute Dabizas netted the
leveller in the 83rd minute. More grim news for Boro came later
when it was drawn to visit Manchester United in the third round of
the FA Cup.
	   Two goals by French striker Stephane Adam fired Hearts to a 2-1
victory over defending titlist Celtic in the Scottish Premier
League and left the loser five point behind Rangers having played a
game more.

Mallorca extends lead in the 13th round of the Spanish League
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAR ROMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Argentine striker Claudio 'Piojo' Lopez's
penalty in the 64th was all Valencia needed for a win Sunday
against lowly Alaves that lifts it to No. 4 in the Spanish soccer
first division while Mallorca extended its lead atop after the 13th
round games.
	   Valencia moved to fourth place with 22 points while Alaves lies
at No. 18 with 12 points.
	   The goal was Piojo Lopez's seventh of the season
	   On Saturday, the lone goal by Daniel Garcia 'Dani'' against
Betis improved Mallorca to 7-4-2 and 25 points, doubling its lead
to three points.
	   Deportivo La Coruna beat FC Barcelona 2-1 to give it sole
possession of second place past Celta, which was held to a 1-1 draw
at Salamanca.
	   Two goals, one by Mustapha Hadji and another by Francisco Javier
Gonzalez 'Fran' hiked Deportivo's record to 6-5-2 and 23 points.
	   Barcelona's loss in the last minute of the game intensied calls
for the removal of Dutch coach Louis Van Gaal.
	   ``Barca down the drain'' read a front page of Madrid's main
sports daily Marca. The Barcelona-based national daily, El
Periodico de Barcelona, ran a story headlined ``Another defeat
leaves Van Gaal discredited''.
	   The state news EFE reported on Sunday that Van Gaal has been
given until the next game against Danish Brondby dans in the
Champion's League to solve the club's performance problems.
	   In other 13th round games Sunday it was: Villareal 2, Valladolid
1; Oviedo 1, Racing de Santander 0; Alaves 0, Valencia 1 and
Tenerife 1, Zaragoza 1
	   In the eastern city of Castellon, the Spanish striker Moises's
pair of goals in the 36th and 58th led humble Villareal to a 2-1
victory over Valladolid.
	   Valladolid lit up with less than 30 minutes left in the game
with a goal from Yugoslav Alen Peternac.
	   Villareal rises to 13th place with 16 points, while Valladolid
is No. 15 with 15.
	   In Oviedo, Panamanian forward Dely Valdes's smashing drive in
the early minutes of the game gave Oviedo its fifth victory of the
season and moved it past Athletic de Bilbao into 10th place.
	   In Tenerife, Dutch forward Roy Macaay's goal put the locals
ahead of Zaragoza in the 80th minute. Jorge Gonzalez's equalizer
six minutes later kept Zaragoza at No. 6, with 20 points from a
6-2-5 record.
	   In other games Saturday, Atletico Madrid and Atheltic Bilbao
drew 0-0, Espanyol held Real Madrid to a 0-0 draw and Real Sociedad
beat Extremadura 2-0.

	   MIAMI (AP) _ College football has the national title matchup
fans want to see every season _ No. 1 vs. No. 2. And this time it
will be Tennessee vs. Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl.
	   It took a wild Saturday of upsets, but when the results were in,
there was really no need for computers, quartiles and
strength-of-schedules after all.
	   In the final Bowl Championship Series standings, which uses a
complicated formula of polls, computers and strength-of-schedule,
the Volunteers and Seminoles came out a clear 1-2 on Sunday and
were invited to play in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4, where the
national title will be on the line.
	   In the other matchups, it's No. 6 UCLA (10-1) vs. No. 9
Wisconsin (10-1) in the Rose Bowl, No. 7 Florida (9-2) vs. No. 18
Syracuse (8-3) in the Orange Bowl and No. 3 Ohio State (10-1) vs.
No. 8 Texas A&AMP;M (11-2) in the Sugar Bowl.

	   JERBA, Tunisia (AP) _ After meeting Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi in a desert tent, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he
thinks an arrangement for bringing two suspects to trial in the
bombing of a Pan Am airliner could be secured in the ``not too
distant future.''
	   Annan's comments came Saturday after he and Gadhafi failed to
agree on handing over Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah, who are suspected in the 1988 bombing that killed 270
people.
	   Annan later spoke on the telephone with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright as he flew from Jerba to the United Arab
Emirates to attend a Gulf summit.
	   ``We are well on the way to resolving the problem,'' Annan told
Albright, according to a U.N. statement faxed to The Associated
Press.
	   On Sunday, state-run Libyan Radio quoted an unnamed official in
the Foreign Liaison Secretariat, which is the equivalent of a
foreign ministry, as saying that ``a solution to this crisis is
within reach.''
	   He credited Annan's talks with Omar al-Muntasser, Libya's
foreign minister, who met with Annan in Sirte before Annan went on
to talks with Gadhafi. Sirte is 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of
the Libyan capital Tripoli.
	   The official spoke of ``fruitful talks'' but gave no details.
The broadcast was monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp.
	   Also Sunday, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in an
interview with the BBC that he had spoken with Annan on Sunday and
was ``very encouraged by what he tells me.''
	   He added: ``I think you could sum up our mood as one of
qualified optimism.''
	   Britain would like to see the two suspects in custody by Dec.
21, the 10th anniversary of the Pan Am bombing.
	   But Cook said Britain will not budge on the demand by Washington
and London that the suspects serve any sentence in a Scottish jail.
Libya has asked that any prison terms be served in the Netherlands
or Libya.
	   Annan spoke to reporters in Tripoli after the meeting with
Gadhafi and later when he arrived back at this Tunisian island,
where he had begun the day of diplomacy that lasted nearly 15
hours.
	   The 60-year-old Annan is trying to get Libya to go along with a
U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects before a panel of
Scottish judges in the Netherlands for the 1988 bombing over
Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   ``The talks have been fruitful and positive,'' Annan said in
Tripoli. ``Libya has confirmed its seriousness and readiness to
find a solution to the Lockerbie problem.
	   ``Libya has also agreed to a trial in a third country and
believes that it ought to be possible to find answers to all other
outstanding issues,'' he said.
	   ``So I hope that in the not too distant future we will be able
to give the families good news,'' he added, referring to the
relatives of victims who have lobbied extensively for a trial.
	   Annan later arrived in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates,
where he will attend a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a
federation of six Arab Gulf states.

Poland, Slovakia agree to share Winter Olympics bid for 2006
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Hoping to calm ecologists who fear damage
to Poland's national mountain reserve, Polish and Slovak Olympic
committees agreed Sunday to put in a joint bid for the 2006 Winter
Games.
	   Ecologists' protests against plans to cut thousands of fir trees
in the southern Tatra National Park in order to build slopes for
the Olympics were among the main concerns of the IOC evaluation
commission that visited Poland last month.
	   Poland's favorite skiing resort, Zakopane, near the country's
southern border with Slovakia, is bidding to host the 2006 Winter
Olympics. As part of Sunday's agreement, Slovakia's Chopok
mountain, also in the Tatra range, would be the site of the
downhill, according to the evening news program Wiadomosci.
	   Outraged by the prospect of damage to Zakopane's environment,
ecologists have been vehemently protesting Poland's bid. Wiadomosci
said Zakopane is ready to share some other events with Slovakia.
	   Much of the Zakopane area is in the Tatra National Park,
established in 1954 to protect plants and wildlife. It was
designated a natural reserve by the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization in 1992.
	   Tatra National Park includes Kasprowy Wierch, Poland's tallest
mountain for skiers at 6,557 feet. (1,998 meters) It has two
slopes, and park management has resisted calls to build more lifts,
saying it would damage the environment.
	   Park directors argue that expanding the skiing area for the
Olympics would require cutting 10,000 trees, in violation of an
environmental protection law.

Egyptian human rights activist released on bail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A human rights activist accused of receiving
foreign money to harm Egypt's reputation was released on bail
Sunday, police said.
	   Hafez Abu Saada, secretary-general of the Egyptian Organization
for Human Rights, was jailed for 15 days on Dec. 1 pending
investigation into dlrs 25,703 donation received by the EOHR from a
British Parliament committee.
	   Abu Saada is being investigated for accepting donations without
prior government consent and for publishing false reports that
damage the nation's image. The charges carry a penalty of 15 years
hard labor.
	   An Egyptian weekly, Al-Osboa, alleged last month that the
donation was a ``payment'' for an EOHR report that accused police
of arresting and torturing hundreds of Coptic Christians in a
criminal investigation in a southern Egyptian village in August.
The magazine has close ties to the Interior Ministry, which is
responsible for security in Egypt.
	   Police have started the procedure to also arrest Mustafa Zeidan,
author of the EOHR's report on the Christians, said the police
official, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The government has denied the torture allegations but
transferred four policeman from the village, pending an
investigation.
	   The aim of arresting Abu Saada was ``not only to weaken the
EOHR, but also to weaken the movement of human rights in Egypt,''
said the Egyptian Land Center for Human Rights in a statement faxed
to The Associated Press Sunday.
	   It called on Prosecutor General Ragaa el-Araby to ``freeze the
case and to close the file in order to preserve the reputation of
(Egypt) and to assure the democratic values in the country.''

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ With the latest Mideast peace accord on hold,
Israel and the Palestinians exchanged angry accusations Sunday over
Jewish settlements and street clashes.
	   Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian parliament, warned of
possible violence if Israel continues to expand settlements in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the Palestinians hope to establish
a state.
	   ``If settlement activity continues, then all means of resistance
are open,'' Qureia, who is also known as Abu Ala, told reporters in
the West Bank town of Ramallah.
	   Since the signing of a land-for-security accord, Jewish settlers
have accelerated the establishment of makeshift communities on West
Bank hilltops, to keep the land from being turned over to the
Palestinians.
	   After an attack on an Israeli soldier by a Palestinian mob in
the West Bank last week, Israel announced it was suspending the
accord until the Palestinians stopped violating the agreement.
	   Israel's Channel 2 TV reported Sunday that Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, under pressure from hard-liners who threatened
to bolt his government over the accord, had secretly agreed to
freeze the deal days before the attack took place and use
Palestinian violations as an excuse.
	   The report said that Nissim Smolianski, a member of the National
Religious Party, told Netanyahu that if he went ahead with further
West Bank troop withdrawals as agreed upon in the latest Mideast
peace accord, the NRP would topple the government.
	   Smolianski refused to comment directly on the report.
	   Protests and street clashes last week grew out of an
increasingly bitter dispute over Palestinian prisoners held by
Israel.
	   Israel last month freed 250 of 750 prisoners it is to release
under the Wye accords, but most were criminals. The Palestinians
are demanding that so-called security prisoners _ those being held
for anti-Israel activity _ be released instead.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Israel and the
Palestinian lands, which is to begin Saturday, is meant to provide
impetus to the U.S.-brokered peace accords and encourage both sides
to stick to a timetable for compliance. But some commentators
suggested the visit was proving a polarizing force instead.
	   ``He is coming to promote the peace process... but his visit's
only actual result is a sharpening of the differences,'' Yosef
Lapid wrote in Sunday's editions of the Maariv newspaper.
	   In Israel, increasing concern is being voiced over Clinton's
planned visit to Gaza, the first ever by a sitting U.S. president.
At Sunday's Israeli Cabinet meeting, a shouting match broke out
over the issue, according to Israel radio.
	   ``Who invited President Clinton to the Gaza Strip?'' Silvan
Shalom, the science minister, reportedly yelled at Netanyahu.
Netanyahu said it had been Clinton's idea, not his.
	   The United States has repeatedly said the visit is not intended
as an endorsement of Palestinian statehood, but the Palestinians
see it as a powerful boost to their sovereignty hopes.

U.S. competitors take first and second in women's bobsled event
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ In a performance she hopes to duplicate
in 2002, USA I driver Jean Racine won gold Sunday in a women's
World Cup bobsled race.
	   The United States also took second, with Britain third.
	   Racine and brakeman Jennifer Davidson not only stopped the
four-race winning streak by Switzerland's Francoise Burdet, but
they did so in record-setting fashion.
	   Their first run down the 4,405-foot (1,342 meter) Bear Hollow
track took just 50.45 seconds, or 42-hundredths better than the
mark they established in October.
	   ``Our goal was to go 1-2 today. We did it, I'm really pleased,''
said Racine, who edged teammate Jill Bakken by 61-hundredths of a
second with a two-run time of 1:41.56. ``I can't wait for the
Olympics, because we'll do the same thing there. I can't wait for
2002.''
	   But first the International Olympic Committee must grant women's
bobsled a medal slot in the 2002 Winter Games at Salt Lake City.
	   There has been intense lobbying for women's bobsled, as well as
men's and women's skeleton events to be included in the Games, and
an announcement is anticipated this month. Skeleton racing is
similar to luge racing, but with participants facing forward on
their sleds.
	   Racine and Davidson, who won the silver behind Burdet and
Katarina Sutter in Saturday's season-opening race on the same
course, started second Sunday, set the track record and were never
challenged.

	   LIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) _ More than 30 years after President Omar
Bongo came to power, Gabonese voters turned out Sunday to decide
whether the long-serving autocrat should be elected to another
seven years.
	   Turnout appeared low in Libreville, Gabon's capital. Despite
reports of scattered rock-throwing incidents overnight in
Libreville, Sunday's voting appeared to have passed without serious
violence.
	   Many polling stations opened late _ some as many as six hours
late _ and officials said four ballot boxes had been destroyed by
mobs angry over incomplete voter lists in northern Gabon. No
injuries were reported. Some polling stations remained open late
into the evening because of the delays.
	   Military presence remained heavy in the capital after the polls
had closed, with armored vehicles and heavily armed soldiers
visible on some street corners.
	   Gabon's opposition was quick to charge election fraud, with
witnesses telling opposition Radio Soleil that there had been
police intimidation and people voting with false identity papers.
Those charges could not immediately be confirmed.

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with ruling party ahead in preliminary results. Note
final results expected on Monday.

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Dervis Eroglu, prime minister in the
breakaway Turkish Cypriot, looked set to win elections after
preliminary results Sunday showed him getting more than half of the
50 parliamentary seats.
	   Eroglu's National Unity Party, managed to gain 26 seats after
more than half of the votes were counted, the Turkish Cypriot news
agency TAK reported.
	   Eroglu has been heading a coalition government since 1996. But
the preliminary results indicated that he was likely to be able to
govern alone this time.
	   The elections were mared by a row between President Rauf
Denktash and an opposition center-left party who accused him of
favoring center-right parties, and a disagreement over the island's
membership in the European Union.
	   On Saturday, Denktash called on voters to support center-right
parties, which have opposed Turkish Cypriots joining in
negotiations for the island's membership in the European Union. One
of the parties is run by his son, Serdar Denktash.
	   Some 121,000 voters were eligible to elect 50 lawmakers from
among 352 candidates fielded by seven political parties in the
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was declared by Turkish
Cypriots in 1983 and is recognized only by Turkey.
	   The final, official results were expected on Monday.
	   Denktash contends Cyprus' membership in the EU would amount to
the island's integration with EU-member Greece.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkey sent in troops
after a coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
	   	   Turkish Cypriot opposition parties complain the election will be
dominated by the large number of settlers from the Turkish mainland
who have been given voting rights.
	   A recent report by the European Union Commission put the number
of recent settlers at 111,000 out of a total population of 200,000.
Opposition parties claim that about half the candidates are
settlers.

Fiesta is set: Tennessee vs. Florida State
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with detail; RAISES reference to Kansas
State &QL; 
 &UR; By RICHARD ROSENBLATT &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ College football has the national title matchup
fans want to see every season _ No. 1 vs. No. 2. And this time it
will be Tennessee vs. Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl.
	   It took a wild Saturday of upsets, but when the results were in
there was really no need for computers, quartiles and
strength-of-schedules after all.
	   The biggest loser in the maneuvering was No. 4 Kansas State
(11-1). The Wildcats lost to Texas A-and-M 36-33 in double overtime
in the Big 12 title game and lost out on a dlrs 12 million payday
by not being included in the Bowl Championship Series mix.
	   The biggest winner turned out to be No. 7 Florida, which despite
losses to Tennessee and Florida State was selected because it will
help fill the Orange Bowl by bringing tens of thousands of fans.
	   In the final BCS standings, which uses a complicated formula of
polls, computers and strength-of-schedule, the Volunteers and
Seminoles came out a clear 1-2 on Sunday and were invited to play
in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4, where the national title will be on
the line.
	   In the other matchups, it's No. 5 UCLA (10-1) vs. No. 9
Wisconsin (10-1) in the Rose Bowl, No. 7 Florida (9-2) vs. No. 18
Syracuse (8-3) in the Orange Bowl and No. 3 Ohio State (10-1) vs.
No. 8 Texas A-and-M (11-2) in the Sugar Bowl.
	   Ohio State (10-1) might have been left out of the BCS picture if
either UCLA or Kansas State had won on Saturday. But the Bruins
lost, too, beaten 49-45 by Miami and knocked out of the national
title picture. UCLA, though, still gets the trip to Pasadena as the
Pac-10 champion.
	   In The Associated Press' final regular-season poll, Tennessee
was the unanimous No. 1 choice with Florida State a solid No. 2; in
the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll, the Vols were a near-unanimous
No. 1 pick and the Seminoles a strong No. 2.
	   The BCS standings were created this season to set up a No. 1 vs.
No. 2 matchup and incorporated The Associated Press' media poll,
the coaches' poll, three computer ratings, strength-of-schedule and
the number of losses into the process of picking the top two teams.
	   The Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Arizona, was the site of the last 1-2
matchup in a postseason game. In the '96 Fiesta, a No. 1 Nebraska
won the national title with a 62-24 rout of a No. 2 Florida.
	   ``We have been a resilient team all season and we've found a way
to get it done,'' Vols coach Phillip Fulmer said after he watched
UCLA and Kansas State lose before his team had all it could handle
before beating Mississippi State. ``We've been on the edge of
playing in a national championship game, and now we have a chance
to do it.''
	   In another bowl matchup announced Sunday, Arkansas (9-2) will
play Michigan (9-3) in the Citrus Bowl on Jan. 1.
	   Other bowl matchups that are set include:
	   _Gator: Georgia Tech (9-2) vs. Notre Dame (9-2), Jan. 1
	   _Liberty: Tulane (11-0) vs. Brigham Young (9-4), Dec. 31
	   _Humanitarian _ Idaho (8-3) vs. Southern Mississippi (7-4), Dec.
30
	   _Micron PC _ North Carolina State (7-4) vs. Miami (8-3), Dec. 29
	   _Motor City _ Louisville (7-4) vs. Marshall (11-1), Dec. 23
	   _Las Vegas _ North Carolina (6-5) vs. San Diego State (7-4),
Dec. 19
	   The remaining pairings are expected to be made later Sunday.

Britain hopeful after talks on Pan Am bombing suspects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Libya-Annan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain said Sunday that following U.N. talks with
Libya, two Libyans suspected in the bombing of a Pan Am jet over
Lockerbie, Scotland may be in custody by Dec. 21, the 10th
anniversary of the disaster.
	   ``I think you could sum up our mood as one of qualified
optimism,'' Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a British
Broadcasting Corp. television interview.
	   But Cook said Britain will not budge on the demand by Washington
and London that the suspects must serve in a Scottish jail any
sentence passed by Scottish judges sitting at the special court in
the Netherlands.
	   In talks in a desert tent in Libya on Saturday, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi
failed to make a deal on handing over the suspects. But Annan said
he believed an agreement could be reached soon.
	   Cook said he spoke with Annan on Sunday and was ``very
encouraged by what he tells me.''
	   Libya, the United States and Britain have agreed in principle to
the Netherlands court arrangement. But Libya wants the suspects
jailed in the Netherlands or Libya if convicted.
	   Cook said it would be a great comfort to the relatives of the
270 victims of Pan Am Flight 103 if the suspects, Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, are brought to trial by the
anniversary.
	   Annan, Cook added, succeeded in getting across to Gadhafi ``the
message that we are serious about this trial _ there is no hidden
agenda.''
	   Jim Swire, spokesman for most families of the British victims,
said Annan's meeting was important because Gadhafi has expressed
fears of a trick and complained of being left out of the
negotiations about the trial.
	   ``What he needs, I think, is reassurance that this really is an
offer of a fair trial and I can't think of anybody better than Kofi
Annan to give that reassurance,'' said Swire.

Threatened Burundian refugees heading to new life in America

	   MWANZA, Tanzania (AP) _ Oscar Niyiragira would love more than
anything for his family to be able to go home to Burundi, but
returning to his ethnically segregated homeland would mean almost
certain death.
	   Instead, Niyiragira, his wife and their four children are among
228 mixed-marriage refugees from Burundi and Rwanda who headed
Sunday for a new life in the United States.
	   Niyiragira is a Burundian Hutu. His wife Regine Katabarwa is a
Tutsi. For their four children, no place in Burundi, split by
ethnic civil war, would be safe.
	   ``You know, this one is neither Hutu nor Tutsi,'' Niyiragira
said of the three-year-old son sitting on his lap. ``He's mixed. So
there is nowhere he can find peace. If he goes on the side of the
Tutsis, he'll be killed. If he goes into Hutuland, he'll be
killed.''
	   In both Rwanda and Burundi, Tutsis are minorities with Hutus
making up more than 80 percent of the population.
	   The families, which represent only a handful of the more than
250,000 Burundian and 6,000 Rwandan refugees in Tanzania, were
recommended for repatriation in the United States by the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.
	   The United States, which has agreed to take in 12,000 African
refugees for its 1998-99 fiscal year, opened its doors.
	   ``Their options for Tanzania were very limited: they can't go
home and in Tanzania they would remain under refugee status,'' said
Kevin Richardson, U.S. Refugee Coordinator for East Africa.
	   To be accepted, the refugees at the Mkugwa camp in northwestern
Tanzania underwent screening by a U.S. immigration officer, and
medical tests to see if they were free of contagious diseases.
	   Two tested positive for AIDS and were excluded, according to the
International Organization for Migration, a multi-state agency
contracted by the U.S. government to handle the move.
	   The agency then gave them a brief cultural orientation course
about what to expect in America, ranging from the need for a
driver's license to racism against blacks.
	   On Wednesday, seven buses carrying the refugees left Mkugwa for
Mwanza in northern Tanzania, where they received medication,
clothing and shoes.
	   On Sunday evening, the first planeload of 57 refugees flew to
Nairobi, Kenya and then to John F. Kennedy airport in New York.
From there, they would head to final destinations across the United
States.
	   ``If I can get to a country where there is peace, I think I can
stay there and continue my life,'' said Burundian-born Emmanuel
Sibomana in halting English. ``It is an extraordinary
opportunity.''
	   Sibomana, 33, is a wood carver. His Hutu family fled Burundi's
civil war in 1972 and settled in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, where
he met his Tutsi wife and had a son.
	   But the 1994 Hutu government-sponsored Rwandan genocide of more
than half a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus sent the young family
into exile, first to the former Zaire, and finally, Tanzania. He is
going to Washington, D.C.
	   Niyiragira fled Burundi in 1993, after Tutsi paratroopers killed
the country's first democratically elected president. Bloodletting
between the Tutsi military and Hutu rebels has since killed more
than 200,000 Burundians.
	   They fled to the former Zaire, but had to leave when war broke
out there in 1996.
	   ``I was hated by both sides. I had nowhere to go, no one to talk
to, so I decided to leave,'' said Niyiragira.
	   Thrilled to be going to Louisville, Kentucky, he regrets leaving
his native home.
	   ``It makes me a bit sick because my children are going to lose
all my culture,'' he said. ``But I am happy because they are going
far away from that stupid war, that hatred.''

Few turn out for make-up vote in Chiapas state
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEJANDRO RUIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN PEDRO CHENALHO, Mexico (AP) _ Corn was more important than
votes in Chiapas on Sunday in elections to make up for voting
canceled in October after heavy flood damage.
	   The rural towns where the vote was being held Sunday were
largely empty since most people had gone into the countryside to
harvest their corn crops, elections officials in San Pedro Chenalho
said.
	   Voters along the Pacific Coast and in mountain communities were
electing nine county mayors and four representatives for the state
Congress.
	   Between 40 and 50 supporters of the leftist Zapatista rebels
blocked a road in Aldama, 90 miles (145 kms) northeast of San
Cristobal de las Casas, to discourage people from voting, local
election officials reported. The protesters dispersed when police
arrived.
	   Polling stations opened at 8 a.m. (1400 GMT) and were to close
at 6 p.m. (0000 GMT) Authorities in San Pedro Chenalho said however
that they could close booths as early as 3 p.m. (2100 GMT) if
turnout was low.
	   Results were expected later Sunday.
	   Chiapas suffered severe flooding in September, wiping out some
elections records and forcing residents to focus attention on
clearing roads and rebuilding their homes.
	   The ruling party, known by its Spanish initials PRI, did well in
the Oct. 4 vote, winning in most of Chiapas' 111 counties and
recovering some seats that it had lost three years earlier.
However, the conservative National Action Party retained control of
the state capital, Tuxtla Gutierrez.
	   Because flooding prevented the vote in eight counties _ and
residents in San Juan Chamula county boycotted the election _
voters could not elect enough representatives to form a quorum on
the state's 40-seat legislature.

Animal rights group plans protest at German embassy in Pretoria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Animal rights activists plan
to picket the German embassy in Pretoria on Monday to protest plans
to export seven allegedly mistreated elephants to zoos in Erfurt
and Dresden.
	   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) said in a
statement Sunday that it would also demonstrate at other German
embassies if the shipment is carried out.
	   ``Germany had better prepare for riots outside its embassies
worldwide if even one elephant is put on a transport to Germany,''
said Jane Garrison of PETA. ``These are Africa's treasures.''
	   The California-based Garrison has been monitoring a court battle
in the small town of Brits near Pretoria, where a judge last week
ruled that 30 young elephants were being cruelly treated.
	   Judge Herman Glas upheld his earlier ruling and awarded
temporary custody to the National Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals.
	   Despite the court's ruling, the elephants' owner, animal
exporter Riccardo Ghiazza, is expected to ask Glas Monday morning
for permission to ship seven of the elephants to Germany, according
to NSPCA executive director Marcelle French.
	   Ghiazza is also expected to appeal the custody ruling at the
High Court in Pretoria on Monday.
	   The fate of the 30 baby elephants snatched from their families
in Botswana in August has sparked worldwide interest. Last week,
French actress Brigitte Bardot, an animal rights activist, joined
Britain's Spice Girls pop group and rocker Chrissie Hynde in
appeals to President Nelson Mandela to protect the elephants.
	   ``This has become of public interest and is not private interest
anymore,'' Glas said last week.
	   The judge cited particular concern about seven baby elephants
who had abscesses on their heads from being prodded by sharp
instruments as part of training to prepare them for captivity.
	   The trainers hobbled them and deprived them of water, NSPCA
officials testified during the hearings.
	   Impatient with the legal maneuverings, French called Ghiazza's
moves ``ridiculous.''
	   ``This was an urgent application in October,'' French said.
``They are just stalling.''
	   There is some question about where the NSPCA can take the
elephants. Two of three game ranches have withdrawn previous
agreement to receive some of the elephants, according to the Rhino
and Elephant Foundation, a conservation group that has backed
Ghiazza.
	   French also said that two of the provinces where the game
ranches were located have refused to issue permits to allow the
elephants into their territory.

Annan arrives in Abu Dhabi to attend Gulf summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan arrived here Sunday to attend a summit of the Gulf
Cooperation Council, a federation of six Arab Gulf states.
	   Annan, who flew in from the Tunisian island of Jerba met
Saturday with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in the Libyan desert to
try to arrange the trial of two suspects in the bombing of a Pan Am
airliner. But they failed to reach an agreement.
	   The 60-year-old Annan is trying to get Libya to go along with a
U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects before a panel of
Scottish judges in the Netherlands for the 1988 bombing over
Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   Annan and South Africa's President Nelson Mandela are in Abu
Dhabi to attend the GCC summit. The GCC groups Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.

Falcons rally to win their sixth straight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Chris Chandler, sidelined last week with a
sprained right ankle, ran for one touchdown and threw for two more
as the Falcons rallied from 14 points down to win their sixth
straight game, 28-21 over the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday.
	   Chandler shook off five sacks to complete 20-of-28 for 297
yards, his best game in two years with Atlanta. The National
Football Conference West-leading Falcons (11-2), who trailed 14-0
and 21-7, went ahead by scoring three touchdowns in just over a
three-minute span at the end of the first half and beginning the
second.
	   Atlanta's Jamal Anderson rushed for 122 yards on 30 carries and
Tony Martin caught seven passes for 140 yards, including a 40-yard
touchdown in the first half. Peyton Manning was 19-of-27 for 159
yards and a touchdown for the Colts (2-11).
	   In Landover, Maryland, Trent Green found Leslie Shepherd wide
open in the right corner of the end zone for the winning 20-yard
touchdown with 1:54 left.
	   The catch was set up by an 18-yard pass to Chris Thomas and a
17-yard punt return by Brian Mitchell, who also ran back a kickoff
101 yards for a touchdown in the first half.
	   The Redskins (4-9), winning back-to-back games for the first
time this season, are 4-2 since starting 0-7 and have never lost to
the Chargers (5-8) in six meetings. Terrell Fletcher ran for a
career-high 122 yards, and threw an awkward touchdown pass on a
halfback option for the Chargers.
	   In Cincinnati, Doug Flutie and Eric Moulds hooked up on a
70-yard touchdown that changed momentum late in the first half,
then put Buffalo in control with a 30-yard TD connection early in
the fourth quarter.
	   The Bills (8-5) got their eighth win in 10 games and remained in
the thick of the American Football Conference East race by picking
apart the NFL's lowest-rated defense in front of thousands of
disgruntled fans.
	   The Bengals (2-11) lost their eighth in a row, their longest
losing streak since 1994. Flutie completed 18-of-30 for 319 yards _
his second straight 300-yard game _ but was intercepted a
season-high three times.
	   In New Orleans, Kerry Collins threw touchdown passes of 4 and 89
yards, and the Saints held Dallas to 182 yards.
	   The victory kept the Saints (6-7), who lost seven of their
previous nine games, alive in the NFC playoff race. The loss
prevented the Cowboys (8-5) from clinching a playoff berth.
	   Troy Aikman passed for only 192 yards and was sacked twice by
the Saints. Emmitt Smith was held to six yards on 15 carries.
	   In Jacksonville, Florida, Jamie Martin, who entered the game
after Mark Brunell was injured on the second play, threw a 67-yard
touchdown pass on his second attempt and finished with 228 yards to
lead Jacksonville over Detroit.
	   Fred Taylor ran for a team-record 183 yards to surpass the
1,000-yard mark as the Jaguars (10-3) all but clinched a playoff
spot and moved three games ahead of the Pittsburgh Steelers in the
AFC Central.
	   Barry Sanders gained 102 yards for the Lions (5-8), but Detroit
had its three-game winning streak halted along with almost any hope
of a sneaking into the playoffs.
	   In Pittsburgh, Drew Bledsoe, playing in pain, threw an 86-yard
TD pass to Terry Glenn, who finished with a team-record 193
receiving yards for New England.
	   Bledsoe, who led the Patriots to last-second victories the
previous two weeks despite a broken index finger on his throwing
hand, was 21-of-34 for 327 yards and overcame three interceptions
that had backup Scott Zolak warming up late in the third quarter.
	   Bledsoe shook his finger in pain after nearly every pass, but
still managed to lead the Patriots (8-5) to their first win in
Pittsburgh since 1986. The Steelers (7-6) are in danger of missing
the playoffs for the first time in Bill Cowher's seven seasons as
coach.
	   In Charlotte, North Carolina, six days after losing tackle
Bryant Young for the season with a broken leg, San Francisco blew a
21-point lead in the final 16 minutes of regulation before
defeating Carolina in overtime.
	   A Carolina fumble set up Wade Richey's 23-yard field goal on San
Francisco's first possession of the extra period, securing a
victory that assures the 49ers of at least a wild-card berth in the
playoffs.
	   The 49ers (10-3) finished with 236 yards rushing, the most
allowed by Carolina (2-11) in its nearly four-year history. Steve
Young threw for 213 yards and two touchdowns and Garrison Hearst
rushed for 139 yards and a score as the 49ers extended their NFL
record of consecutive 10-victory seasons to 16.

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The military leader who has launched
Nigeria on an ambitious path toward civilian rule proclaimed Sunday
that ``democracy is here to stay,'' following local elections that
drew a large and enthusiastic voter turnout.
	   Saturday's elections were the first since Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar outlined his plan earlier this year to cede power to
civilians in May, and the polling drew praise Sunday from visiting
U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley. Abubakar took power after
the June death of dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, who detained, tortured
and occasionally killed his opponents.
	   A leaderless coalition of former Abacha opponents led early
results of the local elections, officials said Sunday morning.
	   The Peoples' Democratic Party, a group of 34 traditional chiefs,
academics, businessmen and ex-military generals, was the top
vote-getter in most of Nigeria's 36 states, several National
Electoral Commission officials said on condition of anonymity.
	   The officials declined to say when official results would be
available, adding that votes in some remote rural communities were
being collected by donkeys and camels and that major cities had to
deal with a higher-than-expected turnout.
	   The PDP party has a murky platform and no leader, although
former military ruler Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo has donated dlrs 2.5
million and is campaigning for the party's presidential nomination
expected later this month or in January.
	   Despite its strong early showing, the PDP lost all seats in
Lagos and Obasanjo's hometown of Abeokuta, about 60 kilometers (35
miles) to the north of Nigeria's largest city, officials said later
in the day. The winners in those areas included the PDP's rivals,
the Alliance for Democracy among other parties.
	   Obasanjo was unfazed by the news. ``The final outcome will prove
that the PDP is the platform preferred by most Nigerians,'' he told
reporters.

	   ``These are historic elections. Nothing like these elections has
happened in Venezuela's political history,'' said U.S. Ambassador
John Maisto.
	   For the first time in 40 years of democracy, neither of
Venezuela's two traditional parties fielded candidates.
	   In an effort to head off a Chavez victory, both the center-left
Democratic Action Party and the center-right COPEI Party dumped
their respective candidates during the past week and threw their
support to Salas, who had been running second in the polls.
	   In 1992, Chavez tried and failed to overthrow Venezuela's
democratically elected government. His candidacy has blown a hole
through the conventional wisdom that said democracy and free
markets were inescapable in Latin America.
	   Chavez on Sunday cast his vote amid some 1,000 supporters
roaring, ``Chavez! Chavez!'' and ``Viva Venezuela!'' As he drove
away, throngs of teenagers chased after his white van.
	   The voting Sunday was described as orderly, and it appeared
turnout was high. Street celebrations broke out throughout the
country Sunday evening; people donned Chavez's trademark red
parachutist's beret and hung Venezuelan flags from balconies.
	   ``Down with the oligarchy!'' shouted one woman standing outside
Chavez's Caracas headquarters.
	   Reports that Chavez supporters would stage violent protests if
their candidate loses prompted a call to peace from President
Rafael Caldera.
	   ``The government and armed forces have promised to respect the
electoral results. That respect will be sacrosanct,'' Caldera
vowed, adding that ``we demand that the results be accepted in
peace.''
	   Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition wants a slowing of
privatizations and a slowing of some free-market economic reforms,
part of his search for a middle road between socialism and
capitalism. His opponents worry that his past as a coup leader may
indicate he is a democrat in name only and they fear he may roll
back reforms introduced by Caldera.
	   Chavez's call for a new constitution and the dissolving of
Congress has scared investors and exacerbated an economic crisis.
Foreign oil companies, including Exxon, Mobil, Shell and British
Petroleum, have put some of their investment plans on hold.
	   Venezuela is the number one exporter of oil to the United
States.
	   The eleventh-hour attempt by COPEI and Democratic Action to
close ranks around Salas failed, even though Salas supporters had
hoped the well-greased political machinery of the old-style parties
would enable their candidate to stage an upset victory.
	   ``I am absolutely convinced that together we are going to return
happiness to Venezuela,'' Salas told reporters after casting his
ballot in his home city of Valencia, 95 miles (150 kms) west of
Caracas.
	   Until this week, Salas had taken great pains to distance himself
from Democratic Action and COPEI _ aware that most Venezuelans
blame them for squandering the world's largest oil reserves outside
the Middle East.
	   The campaign took on overtones of class warfare. Those who
oppose Salas, a former governor of industrial Carabobo state, said
he would defend the interests of the oligarchy if elected.
	   And Chavez's opponents said he is a dictator-in-waiting.
	   ``To those who call us coup leaders or tyrants, we have to
respond to them as Jesus of Nazareth: Forgive them, Lord, for they
know not what they do,'' Chavez bellowed to hundreds of thousands
of supporters at his closing rally in Caracas Wednesday night.
	   Yet Chavez's militaristic rhetoric terrifies middle and upper
class Venezuelans, many of whom have already fled to Miami.
	   ``He's a crazy man on the loose, a communist,'' said Elena
Alamos, an elderly woman casting her vote in Caracas's upper class
Altamira district.
	   An economic crisis caused by a 12-year low in oil prices has
made making ends meet all but impossible for most Venezuelans,
whose standard of living has been steadily declining for more than
15 years.
	   On Sunday, 11 million of the country's 23 million inhabitants
were eligible to vote.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Former Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez, who
staged a bloody coup attempt against the government six years ago,
was elected president of Venezuela Sunday _ a stunning blow to the
political and economic establishment that has ruled during 40 years
of democracy.
	   With 65 percent of the vote counted, Chavez had 56 percent
compared to 39 percent for Yale-educated businessman Henrique Salas
Romer, according to official results from the National Electoral
Council.
	   People danced in the streets, set off fireworks and honked their
horns in celebration.
	   ``Venezuela is being born again,'' Chavez declared when results
were announced. He appealed for calm and said he would pursue
prudent economic policies.
	   ``Once again the people of Simon Bolivar have shown themselves
to be a grand people,'' he told the Venevision television network.
Chavez often invokes South American liberation hero Bolivar in his
speeches.
	   Because of Chavez's meteoric rise in the polls, the vote had
turned into a confrontation between rich and poor _ and a warning
sign for the rest of Latin America.
	   ``These are historic elections. Nothing like these elections has

vowed, adding that ``we demand that the results be accepted in

	   Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition, which calls for fewer
privatizations and a slowing of free-market economic reforms,
already won a plurality of Congress in Nov. 8 regional elections,
breaking the two traditional parties' 40-year political
stranglehold.

	   Yet Chavez's militaristic rhetoric terrifies middle and upper
class Venezuelans, many of whom have already fled to Miami.
	   ``He's a crazy man on the loose, a communist,'' said Elena
Alamos, an elderly woman casting her vote in Caracas's upper class
Altamira district.
	   An economic crisis caused by a 12-year low in oil prices has
made making ends meet all but impossible for most Venezuelans,
whose standard of living has been steadily declining for more than
15 years.
	   On Sunday, 11 million of the country's 23 million inhabitants
were eligible to vote.
	   Among the trailing candidates was former Miss Universe Irene
Saez, who had led the polls until earlier this year.

Honduran military says it holds arms belonging to Iran-Contra

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ The Honduran army has acknowledged
that it has held military arms belonging to a Cuban-American arms
dealer, who was a figure in U.S. efforts to arm Contra fighters, in
its warehouses for the past 13 years.
	   Col. Jorge Andino Almendarez told reporters Saturday that
ammunition belonging to Mario Dellamico has been kept in a military
warehouse to keep it from falling into criminal hands.
	   An opposition political leader, Alfredo Landaverde, criticized
the military on Tuesday for holding arms belonging to an
``international weapons smuggler,'' and denounced Dellamico for
trying to sell the arms to Honduras.
	   ``There is no logical explanation why the armed forces are
guarding the arms of a smuggler,'' said Landaverde, a Christian
Democrat who Congress named in 1995 to oversee the transfer of
police from military to civilian control.
	   The U.S. Iran-Contra investigation into the clandestine
operation to arm Nicaraguan Contra fighters found that Dellamico, a
U.S. national based in Honduras, was an intermediary between arms
dealers and the Honduran military.
	   Because the Contras were based in Honduras, arms dealers shipped
their wares into Honduras, where the Honduran government then took
possession. The Contras then could purchase weapons from this
supply to be used in their move to unseat the leftist Sandinista
government in neighboring Nicaragua, according to the 1993
independent counsel report on Iran-Contra matters.
	   Andino Almendarez said the military had committed no crime by
holding the weapons. He said every Honduran president since 1985
has been aware of the storage.
	   Landaverde has charged that Dellamico, whose name is spelled Del
Amico in some records, participated in an attack against former
President Carlos Roberto Reina.
	   The 1997 grenade attack destroyed much of Reina's home in
Tegucigalpa but no one was injured.
	   Authorities also charge that Dellamico is linked to
Cuban-American Luis Posada Carriles, who participated in a 1976
attack on a Cubana de Aviacion flight, killing 73 people, most of
them Cuban athletes.
	   The military ruled Honduras for nearly 20 years, unseating three
presidents in 1956, 1963 and 1972. It abandoned power in 1981.

Water and sewer utility workers to strike in Puerto Rico
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ About 5,000 water and sewer workers
in Puerto Rico say they will stage a 24-hour strike Monday to
protest a breakdown in negotiations for a new labor contract.
	   The workers are demanding a new contract before a private
company, Professional Services Group, takes over most management of
the government's Aqueduct and Sewer Authority in January. The
company already handles the the utility's customer service
department.
	   The agency said most disruptions would be in requests for
service and repair of water lines.
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello has called the strike an attempt to disrupt
campaigns just before a Dec. 13 vote on Puerto Rico's future
relationship with the United States.

Former coup leader Hugo Chavez elected president of Venezuela

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Former Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez, who
staged a bloody coup attempt against the government six years ago,
was elected president of Venezuela Sunday _ a stunning blow to the
political and economic establishment that has ruled during 40 years
of democracy.
	   With 78 percent of the vote counted, Chavez had 56 percent
compared to 40 percent for Yale-educated businessman Henrique Salas
Romer, according to official results from the National Electoral
Council.
	   People poured into the streets, dancing, setting off fireworks
and honking their horns in celebration.
	   ``Venezuela is being born again,'' Chavez declared as soon as
the election results were revealed. He made an appeal for national
``reconciliation'' and said he would pursue prudent economic
policies.
	   ``Once again the people of Simon Bolivar have shown themselves
to be a grand people,'' he told the Venevision television network.
Chavez often invokes South American liberation hero Bolivar in his
speeches.
	   Because of Chavez's meteoric rise in the polls, the vote had
turned into a confrontation between rich and poor _ and a warning
sign for the rest of Latin America.
	   ``These are historic elections. Nothing like these elections has
happened in Venezuela's political history,'' said U.S. Ambassador
John Maisto.
	   After victory was announced, Chavez sought to assure investors
that he would not impose exchange controls or other radical
economic measures, as his opponents had charged.
	   ``We are going to instill confidence and that's my first message
to investors,'' Chavez said. ``You the investor, if you have
capital abroad, bring it here.''
	   For the first time ever, neither of Venezuela's two traditional
parties fielded candidates in these elections.
	   In an effort to head off a Chavez victory, both the center-left
Democratic Action Party and the center-right COPEI Party dumped
their respective candidates during the past week and threw their
support to Salas, who had been running second in the polls.
	   In 1992, Chavez tried and failed to overthrow Venezuela's
democratically elected government. His critics asserted he would
impose a leftist dictatorship and roll back free market economic
reforms.
	   Chavez on Sunday cast his vote amid some 1,000 supporters
roaring, ``Chavez! Chavez!'' and ``Viva Venezuela!'' As he drove
away, throngs of teenagers chased after his white van.
	   The voting Sunday was orderly, and turnout was high at 65
percent. Street celebrations broke out nationwide on Sunday
evening; people donned Chavez's trademark red parachutist's beret
and hung Venezuelan flags from balconies.
	   ``Down with the oligarchy!'' shouted one woman standing outside
Chavez's Caracas headquarters.
	   Reports that Chavez supporters would stage violent protests if
their candidate lost prompted appeals for calm from President
Caldera, who said the army would respect results.
	   Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition, which calls for fewer
privatizations and a slowing of free-market reforms, already won a
plurality of Congress in Nov. 8 regional elections, breaking the
two traditional parties' 40-year political stranglehold.
	   Chavez's call for a new constitution and the dissolving of
Congress has scared investors and exacerbated an economic crisis.
Foreign oil companies, including Exxon, Mobil, Shell and British
Petroleum, have frozen some of their investment plans.
	   Venezuela is the number one exporter of oil to the United
States.
	   The eleventh-hour attempt by COPEI and Democratic Action to
close ranks around Salas failed, even though Salas supporters had
hoped the well-greased political machinery of the old-style parties
would help him win.
	   The campaign took on overtones of class warfare. Chavez's
militaristic rhetoric terrified middle and upper class Venezuelans,
many of whom have already fled to Miami.
	   ``He's a crazy man on the loose, a communist,'' said Elena
Alamos, an elderly woman casting her vote in Caracas's upper class
Altamira district.
	   An economic crisis caused by a 12-year low in oil prices has
made life difficult for most Venezuelans, whose standard of living
has been steadily for more than 15 years.
	   On Sunday, 11 million of the country's 23 million inhabitants
were eligible to vote.
	   Among the trailing candidates was former Miss Universe Irene
Saez, who had led the polls until earlier this year. On Sunday, she
won 3 percent of the vote, according to the partial results.

Falcons rally to win their sixth straight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with detail &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Chris Chandler, sidelined last week with a
sprained right ankle, ran for one touchdown and threw for two more
as the Falcons rallied from 14 points down to win their sixth
straight game, 28-21 over the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday.
	   Chandler shook off five sacks to complete 20-of-28 for 297
yards, his best game in two years with Atlanta. The NFC
West-leading Falcons (11-2), who trailed 14-0 and 21-7, went ahead
by scoring three touchdowns in just over a three-minute span at the
end of the first half and beginning the second.
	   Atlanta's Jamal Anderson rushed for 122 yards on 30 carries and
Tony Martin caught seven passes for 140 yards, including a 40-yard
touchdown in the first half. Peyton Manning was 19-of-27 for 159
yards and a touchdown for the Colts (2-11).
	   In Landover Maryland, Trent Green found Leslie Shepherd wide
open in the right corner of the end zone for the winning 20-yard
touchdown with 1:54 left to carry the Redskins over the Chargers,
24-20.
	   The catch was set up by an 18-yard pass to Chris Thomas and a
17-yard punt return by Brian Mitchell, who also ran back a kickoff
101 yards for a touchdown in the first half.
	   The Redskins (4-9), winning back-to-back games for the first
time this season, are 4-2 since starting 0-7 and have never lost to
the Chargers (5-8) in six meetings. Terrell Fletcher ran for a
career-high 122 yards, and threw an awkward touchdown pass on a
halfback option for the Chargers.
	   In Cincinnati, Doug Flutie and Eric Moulds hooked up on a
70-yard touchdown that changed momentum late in the first half,
then put Buffalo in control with a 30-yard TD connection early in
the fourth quarter to beat the Bengals, 33-20.
	   The Bills (8-5) got their eighth win in 10 games and remained in
the thick of the American Football Conference East race by picking
apart the NFL's lowest-rated defense in front of thousands of
disgruntled fans.
	   The Bengals (2-11) lost their eighth in a row, their longest
losing streak since 1994. Flutie completed 18-of-30 for 319 yards _
his second straight 300-yard game _ but was intercepted a
season-high three times.
	   In New Orleans, Kerry Collins threw touchdown passes of 4 and 89
yards, and the Saints held Dallas to 182 yards, winning 22-3.
	   The victory kept the Saints (6-7), who lost seven of their
previous nine game, alive in the National Footbalk Conference
playoff race. The loss prevented the Cowboys (8-5) from clinching a
playoff berth.
	   Troy Aikman passed for only 192 yards and was sacked twice by
the Saints. Emmitt Smith was held to six yards on 15 carries.
	   In Jacksonville, Florida, Jamie Martin, who entered the game
after Mark Brunell was injured on the second play, threw a 67-yard
touchdown pass on his second attempt and finished with 228 yards to
lead Jacksonville over Detroit, 37-22.
	   Fred Taylor ran for a team-record 183 yards to surpass the
1,000-yard mark as the Jaguars (10-3) all but clinched a playoff
spot and moved three games ahead of the Pittsburgh Steelers in the
AFC Central.
	   Barry Sanders gained 102 yards for the Lions (5-8), but Detroit
had its three-game winning streak halted along with almost any hope
of a sneaking into the playoffs.
	   In Pittsburgh, Drew Bledsoe, playing in pain, threw an 86-yard
TD pass to Terry Glenn, who finished with a team-record 193
receiving yards for New England as the Patriots beat the Steelers,
23-9.
	   Bledsoe, who led the Patriots to last-second victories the
previous two weeks despite a broken index finger on his throwing
hand, was 21-of-34 for 327 yards and overcame three interceptions
that had backup Scott Zolak warming up late in the third quarter.
	   Bledsoe shook his finger in pain after nearly every pass, but
still managed to lead the Patriots (8-5) to their first win in
Pittsburgh since 1986. The Steelers (7-6) are in danger of missing
the playoffs for the first time in Bill Cowher's seven seasons as
coach.
	   In Charlotte, North Carolina, six days after losing tackle
Bryant Young for the season with a broken leg, San Francisco blew a
21-point lead in the final 16 minutes of regulation before
defeating Carolina in overtime, 31-28.
	   A Carolina fumble set up Wade Richey's 23-yard field goal on San
Francisco's first possession of the extra period, securing a
victory that assures the 49ers of at least a wild-card berth in the
playoffs.
	   The 49ers (10-3) finished with 236 yards rushing, the most
allowed by Carolina (2-11) in its nearly four-year history. Steve
Young threw for 213 yards and two touchdowns and Garrison Hearst
rushed for 139 yards and a score as the 49ers extended their NFL
record of consecutive 10-victory seasons to 16.
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Vinny Testaverde passed for 418
yards and two TDs and ran for the winning score on a disputed
fourth-down play with 20 seconds left as the Jets beat the
Seahawks, 32-31.
	   Although replays showed Testaverde didn't reach the end zone, a
touchdown was signaled after a long delay, giving the Jets (9-4)
their sixth straight home victory and keeping them atop the AFC
East.
	   Testaverde passed a career-high 63 times and completed 42. The
AFC's top-rated passer found Keyshawn Johnson nine times for 114
yards and the touchdown that closed the Jets to 31-26. The loss all
but eliminated Seattle (6-7) from playoff contention.

Russian complaints underscore tension at Christian assembly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICHARD N. OSTLING &QC; 
 &UR; AP Religion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A Russian Orthodox Church delegate
complained on Sunday that a council representing hundreds of
millions of non-Catholic Christians is dominated by liberal Western
policies, and said members of his church were being isolated.
	   The Rev. Hilarion Alfeyev, who is leading a five-person Russian
delegation at the World Council of Churches assembly in Zimbabwe's
capital, said the possibility of Orthodox Church delegates walking
out was not a threat, but ``an outcry of pain.''
	   ``We do no want to leave, but we want the WCC radically
transformed,'' he said.
	   The Orthodox churches of Bulgaria and the Georgian republic have
already quit the council, and senior Russian Orthodox Church
officials are not attending the assembly.
	   The council has a total constituency of 350 to 450 million
non-Catholic Christians. The assembly, with 960 delegates from 112
countries, is the WCC's highest deliberative body.
	   Alfeyev said his church is the largest in the WCC, putting its
membership at more than 100 million.
	   ``Many Protestant churches have adopted the tendencies of
liberal western society,'' Alfeyev said. ``The WCC agenda is
dominated by a western Protestant ethos....We are becoming more and
more isolated.''
	   Orthodox leaders have said many in the council take too liberal
a stance on key issues including homosexuality and the inclusion of
women clergy.
	   Dozens of Orthodox delegates agreed Sunday night that leaders of
their national delegations would jointly draft a petition stating
demands to help restore full Orthodox participation.
	   Another top Eastern Orthodox leader, Albania's Archbishop
Anastasios, said Orthodox enthusiasm for the council and relations
with Protestants had deteriorated notably during his 35 years of
interchuch involvement.
	   The Orthodox pleas drew a testy response from several
Protestants at the assembly, including a bishop from Germany who
expressed irritation that the Russian had cited his church's size.
	   In remarks that drew the day's warmest applause, one of the
first generation of women priests in the Church of England, Rev.
Rose Hudson-Wilkin, also complained about the threatened walk-outs.
	   ``You say I'm bigger than you are, or we have this great
tradition. This is all about power,'' she said. ``Let's not wrap it
up in theological language.''

Gunman takes hostage at member of Parliament's office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HASTINGS, New Zealand (AP) _ Police SWAT team members surrounded
a downtown office of the local member of Parliament on Monday after
a man believed armed with a machine gun took a hostage.
	   Police evacuated people working in surrounding buildings office
and roads were cordoned off in Hastings, a town on the east coast
of New Zealand's north island.
	   Member of Parliament Rick Barker was not at his office at the
time, but it was believed his secretary was in the building.
	   Barker arrived at the scene soon after and said the armed man
was known to him as a frequent letter writer with a number of
grievances. He was reluctant to say what those were.
	   About seven police cars were surrounding the area and an
ambulance and dog handlers were called in.
	   Police have not been able to talk to the man, said Senior Sgt.
Mike Wilkinson: ``We have not made contact with the guy in there
who is not answering our appeals.''
	   Half a dozen blocks in the city had been sealed off, a worker
from a local business across the road from Barker's office said.

 &UR; CUBA: Cuba says Castro `criticisms' of Mexico were misinterpreted &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Cuba moved to quell a diplomatic row with
Mexico on Saturday, saying reporters misinterpreted Fidel Castro
when they quoted him as saying Mexicans traded in their historic
heroes for Mickey Mouse.
	   The Mexican Foreign Relations Ministry had demanded Friday that
Cuba explain criticism of Mexico's relationship with the United
States, which Mexico City newspapers had attributed to Castro.
	   The daily El Universal reported that the Cuban president had
said Mexico was turning its back on poor Latin American nations and
that many Mexicans would sooner be able to say who Mickey Mouse was
than name the father of their country.
	   A statement from the Cuban Embassy in Mexico said Castro's
comments, made Wednesday ``in a discreet and familiar environment''
during a gathering of Latin American economic leaders in Cuba, had
been taken out of context and ``absolutely misinterpreted.''
	   The statement said Castro's comment about Mickey Mouse, a
popular cartoon character, was not a criticism of Mexicans but a
remark on the overwhelming cultural dominance of the U.S.
entertainment industry.
	   If many Mexican children were asked to name their country's
founders ``it is possible that many of them would not know, but
they would instead know who is Mickey Mouse, who are all of the
principal characters of the animated cartoons coming from the
United States; and the same thing occurs in the rest of Latin
America,'' Castro said.
 &UR; HAITI: Haitian-American killed on trip
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A Haitian-American from Boston who
returned to his home island for a vacation was shot and killed by
robbers who took his shoes, the victim's sister said Saturday.
	   Rulx ``JJ'' Damas, 33, of Boston's Dorchester section, was
killed in the attack while driving with his father and girlfriend
in the Santos area near the capital of Port-au-Prince on Thursday,
according to his sister Melissa Damas.
	   A Haitian security official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, confirmed that the killing occurred, but provided few
details.
	   Rulx Damas' girlfriend, Esther Gaugette, and his father,
Francois Damas, survived by lying on the ground and playing dead,
Ms. Damas said.
	   Gaugette described the attack in a phone call to a Boston
television station: ``I just heard somebody tap on the window. They
started breaking windows. They were shooting at the car,'' she
said. ``I thought JJ was pretending he was dead. I didn't realize
he was shot.''
	   Ms. Damas said the robbers then looted the car.
	   ``They took everything,'' she said. ``My father has diabetes.
They took his insulin, I mean, what can you do with insulin? They
took the shoes off my brother's feet.''
	   Frico Damas, the victim's brother, said that it took an
ambulance more than an hour to arrive. His father and girlfriend
have been put up in a hotel by officials with the U.S. Embassy
while they try to leave the country, she said.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Eighth electric worker dies
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ An electric worker died while
handling a line in the southern Puerto Rican town of Yauco,
bringing to eight the number of linemen killed while repairing
hurricane-damaged lines.
	   Alexander Sinigaglia Gonzalez, 36, died Saturday while trying to
lift a downed 110-volt line, police said.
	   His colleague, Javier Huerta Vega, 27, tried to help Sinigaglia
and suffered severe burns. Huerta remained in a Yauco hospital in
critical condition Sunday. Three other workers were unhurt.
	   Yauco and other southern communities were worst hit by Hurricane
Georges on Sept. 21, and many pockets are still without
electricity. Last week, the city of Ponce said it was dedicating
its city festival this year to electric workers who have died while
repairing lines.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Water and sewer utility workers to strike in Puerto
Rico
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ About 5,000 water and sewer workers
in Puerto Rico say they will stage a 24-hour strike Monday to
protest a breakdown in negotiations for a new labor contract.
	   The workers are demanding a new contract before a private
company, Professional Services Group, takes over most management of
the government's Aqueduct and Sewer Authority in January. The
company already handles the the utility's customer service
department.
	   The agency said most disruptions would be in requests for
service and repair of water lines.
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello has called the strike an attempt to disrupt
campaigns just before a Dec. 13 vote on Puerto Rico's future
relationship with the United States.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Television station sues over campaign ad
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A Puerto Rican television station
is suing Gov. Pedro Rossello's party over footage of a news
reporter in an advertisement advocating U.S. statehood for the
island.
	   WAPA-TV Televicentro, San Juan's Channel 4, claims the ad
implies that reporter Luis Guardiola endorses U.S. statehood in an
upcoming vote on Puerto Rico's relationship with the United States.
	   It filed suit against Rossello's New Progressive Party on Friday
in San Juan Superior Court, the San Juan Star newspaper reported.
Lawyers are asking a judge for an order to stop running the ad.
	   The Dec. 13 vote asks Puerto Ricans to choose between statehood,
independence, independence with treaty ties to the United States,
continued commonwealth or ``none of the above,'' a protest vote.
	   The ad shows an interview with San Juan mayor Sila Calderon in
which she calls it ``absurd'' for opponents of statehood to vote
for ``none of the above.'' Calderon has since changed her mind.
	   Guardiola is shown interviewing her, then summarizing her
comments during a newscast.
	   WAPA claims the ad used its footage, logo and trademark without
permission. It claims its newscast's commercial value depends on
not being affiliated with any political party, and that the ad
implies Guardiola supports the statehood position.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Dominican immigrant among 32 Rhodes scholars
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Thirty-two American students were selected
Saturday as Rhodes scholars including a cancer survivor, a
Dominican emigrant who developed expertise in science while
learning to speak English and a student body president who led an
effort to discourage the waving of the Confederate flag at school
sports events.
	   Winner Jose D. Vargas of Gaithersburg, Maryland is a senior at
Loyola College of Maryland who emigrated to this country from the
Dominican Republic with his family before he entered high school.
Vargas developed his deep interest in science while learning
English;
	   Rhodes scholarships provide two or three years study at the
University of Oxford in England. The Rhodes scholarships, oldest of
the international study awards available to American students, were
created in 1902 by the will of Cecil Rhodes, British philanthropist
and colonial pioneer.
	   With the selections announced late Saturday, 2,854 American
students have won Rhodes scholarships since the first selection in
1903. The 32 recipients were chosen from 909 applicants endorsed by
310 colleges and universities. Ninety-six applicants from 67
colleges and universities reached the final stage of the
competition.

Meg Mallon and Steve Pate win JCPenney tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PALM HARBOR, Florida (AP) _ Meg Mallon and Steve Pate shot a
final-round 9-under-par 62 Sunday in the modified, alternate-shot
format to win the JCPenney Classic with a tournament-record
29-under 255.
	   Their bogeyless 62 also marked the lowest final-round score in a
tournament that pairs LPGA and PGA Tour players in team
competition.
	   Six years before this weekend's event, Pate and Malon decided
they would make a good team because ``we got each other's jokes.''
	   Now, they are laughing all the way to the bank.
	   The four-stroke victory was good for dlrs 218,750 each to the
winning twosome, who bettered by two the tournament record of
27-under set by Beth Daniel and Davis Love III in 1995.
	   ``I thought (62) was possible, yes. Likely, no,'' Pate said.
``It's a tough format to get on a roll. But she got to putt a lot
in stretches and that helped. I got to putt a few from three feet.
(one meter) And I made them.''
	   Third-round leaders Rachel Hetherington and Rocco Mediate shot a
2-under 69 to finish second, at 25-under-par, while Catrin Nilsmark
and Chris Perry finished at 22-under after a 68.
	   ``We just played very solid,'' Mallon said. ``We didn't make
mistakes. Steve hit it great, and _ fortunately _ I had the putter
working. You want to reward the good shots your partner makes.''
	   Hetherington and Mediate began the day with a three-shot
advantage over Mallon-Pate and led by two strokes at the turn. But
Hetherington-Mediate got their only bogey of the week at the par-4
10th hole at about the same time Mallon-Pate were making a birdie
on No. 11 to move into a tie for the lead.
	   Mallon-Pate went on to record four more birdies _ five in their
last eight holes _ while Hetherington-Mediate parred in.
	   It was the sixth JCPenney appearance together by Mallon and
Pate, whose best previous finish was seventh last season.
	   ``We thought (victory) would eventually be inevitable,'' Mallon
said. ``Whether or not it would actually happen, we weren't sure.
But this is the best I've played for four rounds with him. I
usually have time off before this event, but I played right up to
it this year.''

	   HASTINGS, New Zealand (AP) _ Police SWAT team members surrounded
a downtown office of the local member of Parliament on Monday after
a man believed armed with a machine gun took a hostage.
	   Police evacuated people working in surrounding buildings office
and roads were cordoned off in Hastings, a town on the east coast
of New Zealand's north island.
	   Member of Parliament Rick Barker was not at his office at the
time, but it was believed his secretary was in the building.
	   Barker arrived at the scene soon after and said the armed man
was known to him as a frequent letter writer with a number of
grievances. He was reluctant to say what those were.
	   About seven police cars were surrounding the area and an
ambulance and dog handlers were called in.
	   Police have not been able to talk to the man, said Senior Sgt.
Mike Wilkinson: ``We have not made contact with the guy in there
who is not answering our appeals.''
	   Half a dozen blocks in the city had been sealed off, a worker
from a local business across the road from Barker's office said.
	   Hastings is about 160 miles (260 km) northeast of Wellington,
the capital, and 220 miles (355 km) southeast of Auckland.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Former Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez, who staged a
bloody coup attempt against the government six years ago, was
elected president of Venezuela Sunday _ a stunning blow to the
political and economic establishment that has ruled during 40 years
of democracy. With 65 percent of the vote counted, Chavez had 56
percent compared to 39 percent for Yale-educated businessman
Henrique Salas Romer, according to official results from the
National Electoral Council. People danced in the streets, set off
fireworks and honked their horns in celebration. ``Venezuela is
being born again,'' Chavez declared when results were announced. He
appealed for calm and said he would pursue prudent economic
policies. (VENEZUELA-ELECTIONS)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Two Libyans long wanted in the bombing of a Pan Am
jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, may be in custody by Dec. 21, the
10th anniversary of the disaster, Britain's foreign secretary said
Sunday. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan spent Saturday in Libya,
discussing with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and his foreign
secretary a handover of the two men suspected by Britain and the
United States in the 1988 explosion that killed 270 people. British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said it would be a great comfort to
relatives of the victims of Pan Am Flight 103 if Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah are brought to trial by the
anniversary. Libya, the United States and Britain have agreed in
principle that Scottish judges will hear the case at a special
court in the Netherlands. But if convicted, Libya wants the
suspects jailed in the Netherlands or in Libya. (BRITAIN-LOCKERBIE)
	   ALGIERS, Algeria _ Muslim militants slashed the throats of seven
people in a mountain town overnight, authorities said Sunday,
raising to 52 the death toll from the latest wave of violence. But
Algeria's embattled prime minister, in a televised
state-of-the-nation address before Parliament, insisted the nearly
7-year-old insurgency was under control and that his painful
economic reforms were making progress. The victims were killed
``with savagery'' Saturday night in the town of Merad, near Tipaza,
100 kms (60 miles) west of the capital, a brief government
statement said. Hospital officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the militants slashed the seven to death, and they
shot and wounded five people who tried to flee. (ALGERIA)
	   LIBREVILLE, Gabon _ More than 30 years after President Omar
Bongo came to power, Gabonese voters turned out Sunday to decide
whether the long-serving autocrat should be elected to another
seven years. Turnout appeared low in Libreville, Gabon's capital.
Despite reports of scattered rock-throwing incidents overnight in
Libreville, Sunday's voting appeared to have passed without serious
violence. Many polling stations opened late _ some as many as six
hours late _ and officials said four ballot boxes had been
destroyed by mobs angry over incomplete voter lists in northern
Gabon. No injuries were reported. Some polling stations remained
open late into the evening because of the delays. (GABON-ELECTIONS)
	   ABUJA, Nigeria _ The military leader who has launched Nigeria on
an ambitious path toward civilian rule proclaimed Sunday that
``democracy is here to stay,'' following local elections that drew
a large and enthusiastic voter turnout. Saturday's elections were
the first since Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar outlined his plan earlier
this year to cede power to civilians in May, and the polling drew
praise Sunday from visiting U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley.
Abubakar took power after the June death of dictator Gen. Sani
Abacha, who detained, tortured and occasionally killed his
opponents. A leaderless coalition of former Abacha opponents led
early results of the local elections, officials said Sunday
morning. The Peoples' Democratic Party, a group of 34 traditional
chiefs, academics, businessmen and ex-military generals, was the
top vote-getter in most of Nigeria's 36 states, several National
Electoral Commission officials said on condition of anonymity.

	   HASTINGS, New Zealand (AP) _ Police SWAT team members surrounded
a downtown office of the local member of Parliament on Monday after
a man armed with a shotgun took a hostage.
	   Police evacuated people working in surrounding buildings office
and roads were cordoned off in Hastings, a town on the east coast
of New Zealand's north island.
	   Member of Parliament Rick Barker was not at his office at the
time, but he confirmed the woman being held is his electorate
secretary Jan Woodhall.
	   Barker arrived at the scene soon after and said the armed man
was known to him as a frequent letter writer with a number of
grievances. He was reluctant to say what those were.
	   About seven police cars were surrounding the area and an
ambulance and dog handlers were called in.
	   The gunman was originally believed to be armed with a submachine
gun, but police later said they now believe he has a shotgun. About
40 officers are on the scene.
	   Police have not been able to talk to the man, said Senior Sgt.
Mike Wilkinson: ``We have not made contact with the guy in there
who is not answering our appeals.''
	   Half a dozen blocks in the city had been sealed off, a worker
from a local business across the road from Barker's office said.
	   Hastings is about 160 miles (260 km) northeast of Wellington,
the capital, and 220 miles (355 km) southeast of Auckland.

ITF pondering Davis Cup changes

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The Davis Cup may be a priority for Sweden,
but it isn't for everyone, notably Pete Sampras.
	   The Scandinavians had little trouble wrapping up their second
straight title by beating Italy 4-1 on indoor clay this weekend,
making it three triumphs since 1994 and seven overall.
	   ``Normally, tennis is an individual sport. It's not often you
get to play for a team. Davis Cup is really the only chance,''
doubles player Nicklas Kulti said. ``It's just an unbelievable
feeling to win it for your country.''
	   But with interest in the event static and an increasingly
crowded calendar, the International Tennis Federation is studying
ways to bring more stars such as top-ranked Sampras into the fold.
	   ITF president Brian Tobin said Sunday changes could be in store
for the competition, though not before 2001.
	   Proposals include cutting matches in early rounds to best-of-3
sets, giving the returning finalist nations first-round byes, and
trying to convince the ATP to award rankings points for Davis Cup
matches.
	   ``Does that get (Pete) Sampras or whoever to play? Believe me,
we are looking at the options,'' Tobin said.
	   Neither Sampras or No. 6 Andre Agassi played in the semifinals,
when the United States was ousted by Italy.
	   Citing personal goals, primarily his pursuit of Roy Emerson's
record 12 Grand Slam tournament titles, Sampras has played Davis
Cup just once since leading the United States to the 1995 title.
	   ``We absolutely congratulate (Sampras) on being No. 1 in the
world for the sixth time,'' Tobin said, ``but there's also talk
about him trying to match Roy Emerson's record as a tennis player
and a tennis champion.
	   ``I'm not knocking Pete, but just sit back for a minute and have
a look at the two records. Pete has 11 Grand Slams and two Davis
Cups. Emerson has 12 Grand Slams and eight Davis Cup final wins on
his record. So how would you compare the two?''
	   Sweden handled Italy without using its two best clay-courters.
Thomas Johansson, ranked 17th by the ATP, and No. 22 Thomas Enqvist
are both injured.
	   In fact, No. 31 Gustafsson was the highest ranking singles
player here, making it the first final in the 99-year history of
the Davis Cup without anyone from the top 30.
	   Sweden, which swept the United States in last year's final, now
has a record six Davis Cup trophies since the World Group format
was established in 1981.
	   ``Sweden really cares about the Davis Cup,'' said Italy captain
Paolo Bertolucci. ``That is certainly a strength.''

Cesar, crushed car sculptor, dies at 77
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Cesar Baldaccini, the sculptor best-known for
compressing cars into huge blocks of twisted steel, has died of
cancer at his Paris home, French media reported early Monday. He
was 77.
	   Cesar, as the artist is known, died at his home on Sunday,
French radio and television said.
	   The sculptor ``was a man who didn't see any difference between
life and creativity itself,'' Pierre Restany told French television
LCI.
	   Born Jan. 1, 1921 in Marseille, Cesar studied at the Beaux-Arts
schools in his native city as well as in Paris. He quickly sought
to differentiate himself from his instructors by using auto bodies
and scrap metal.
	   A member of the New Realism movement, Cesar created ``compressed
automobiles,'' and he ``sculpted'' other objects by striking them
with a sledgehammer.
	   Cesar also created the statuette used as France's Oscar to award
the country's cinema greats. The award, first given in 1976, is
called the Cesar.
	   Funeral arrangements were pending.

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Canadians held memorial services to mark the
ninth anniversary of the nation's worst mass shooting, an assault
that galvanized support for a gun-control law that finally took
effect last week.
	   One of the ceremonies took place Sunday at a Montreal park, not
far from the engineering school where 14 young women were shot dead
on Dec. 6, 1989. The gunman, Marc Lepine, killed himself after a
rampage punctuated by his shouts that women had ruined his life.
	   A monument to the victims will be erected in the park, which is
being renamed the Square of the Sixth of December.
	   Prime Minister Jean Chretien, in a statement, said Dec. 6 has
become a reminder that violence blights the lives of too many
Canadians, especially women.
	   ``Only by refusing to tolerate violence can we truly honor the
memories of the 14 young women,'' Chretien said.
	   The massacre was the catalyst for a determined lobbying campaign
that led to the adoption of Canada's sweeping gun-registration law.
It went into effect Dec. 1 despite strenuous opposition from many
rural gun owners and several provincial governments.
	   The law requires Canada's estimated 3.4 million gun owners to
register their 7 million firearms, including rifles and shotguns,
by Jan. 1, 2003. Every gun owner must get a license by Jan. 1,
2001.
	   Alberta's government, backed by Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan
and Canada's two territories, has filed an appeal with the Supreme
Court of Canada contending the law is an unconstitutional intrusion
on provincial jurisdiction.
	   ``It's an offensive waste of money that's not going to
accomplish one thing in terms of stopping crime,'' said an Ontario
Cabinet minister, Bob Runciman. The court isn't expected to hear
the case for months.
	   The opposition to the bill has failed to dampen the satisfaction
of those who worked to get it passed.
	   ``It has been a huge victory,'' said Suzanne LaPlante Edward,
who became a gun-control crusader after her 21-year-old daughter,
Anne-Marie, was killed in the Montreal massacre.
	   ``We need to know who has guns, how many they have, why they
have them and how they store them,'' she said in a speech Thursday
in New Brunswick. ``I know we can save some lives this way.''

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Former Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez, who
staged a bloody coup attempt six years ago, was elected president
of Venezuela _ a stunning blow to the political and economic
establishment that has ruled the country during 40 years of
democracy.
	   People poured into the streets late Sunday, dancing, setting off
fireworks and honking horns in celebration of what many viewed a
victory of the poor over a political elite that has failed to ease
poverty and control rampant corruption.
	   ``Venezuela is being born again,'' Chavez declared as results
were revealed. ``Once again, the people of Simon Bolivar have shown
themselves to be a grand people,'' he told the Venevision
television network. Chavez often invokes South American liberation
hero Bolivar in his speeches.
	   With 78 percent of the vote counted, Chavez had 56 percent
compared to 40 percent for Yale-educated businessman Henrique Salas
Romer, according to official results from the National Electoral
Council.
	   ``I want to say to all Venezuelans that not only do I accept my
adversary's victory, I also wish him much luck because his luck is
Venezuela's luck,'' Salas said at his campaign headquarters in
Caracas.
	   Chavez immediately appealed for national ``reconciliation'' and
sought to assure investors that he would pursue prudent economic
policies. He said he would not impose exchange controls or other
radical economic measures as his opponents have claimed.
	   ``We are going to instill confidence, and that's my first
message to investors,'' Chavez said. ``You the investor, if you
have capital abroad, bring it here.''
	   For the first time, neither of Venezuela's two traditional
parties fielded candidates. In an effort to head off a Chavez
victory, the center-left Democratic Action Party and the
center-right COPEI Party dumped their respective candidates during
the past week and threw their support to Salas, who had been
running second to Chavez in the polls.
	   Until this week, Salas, a former state governor, had taken great
pains to distance himself from Democratic Action and COPEI _ aware
that most Venezuelans blame them for squandering the world's
largest oil reserves outside the Middle East.
	   ``Nothing like these elections has happened in Venezuela's
political history,'' U.S. Ambassador John Maisto said.
	   In 1992, Chavez tried and failed to overthrow Venezuela's
democratically elected government. His critics asserted he would
impose a leftist dictatorship and roll back free-market economic
reforms. Because of this, his candidacy was seen as a warning by
much of Latin America.
	   Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition, which calls for fewer
privatizations and a slowing of free-market economic reforms,
already won a plurality of Congress in Nov. 8 regional elections,
breaking the two traditional parties' 40-year political
stranglehold.
	   Chavez's call for a new constitution and the dissolving of
Congress has scared investors and exacerbated an economic crisis.
Foreign oil companies, including Exxon, Mobil, Shell and British
Petroleum, have put some of their investment plans on hold.
	   Venezuela is the number one exporter of oil to the United
States.
	   An economic crisis caused by a 12-year low in oil prices has
made making ends meet all but impossible for most Venezuelans,
whose standard of living has been steadily declining for more than
15 years.
	   The campaign took on overtones of class warfare. Chavez's
militaristic rhetoric terrified middle and upper class Venezuelans,
many of whom have already fled to Miami.
	   ``He's a crazy man on the loose, a communist,'' said Elena
Alamos, an elderly woman casting her vote in Caracas's upper class
Altamira district.
	   Chavez voted Sunday amid some 1,000 supporters roaring,
``Chavez! Chavez!'' and ``Viva Venezuela!'' As he drove away,
throngs of teenagers chased after his white van.
	   Street celebrations broke out throughout the country Sunday
evening; people donned Chavez's trademark red parachutist's beret
and hung Venezuelan flags from balconies.
	   ``Down with the oligarchy!'' shouted one woman standing outside
Chavez's Caracas headquarters.
	   The voting Sunday was orderly, and turnout was high for
Venezuela at 65 percent.
	   Among the trailing candidates was former Miss Universe Irene
Saez, who had led the polls until earlier this year. On Sunday, she
won 3 percent of the vote, according to the partial results.

	   ASUNCION, Paraguay, (AP) _ The ruling Colorado Party announced
Saturday night the expulsion from its ranks of former Army chief of
staff Gen. Lino Cesar Oviedo, after the Suprme Court ruled that he
must return to prison to serve a 10-year sentence for rebellion.
	   Party chairman Bader Rachid Lichi announced that ``we have
resolved to exclude Lino Cesar Oviedo from the party lists''.
Another party official, Juan Ernesto Villamayor, said that ``Oviedo
can again become a member after he serves his sentence''.
	   The Colorado party, in power since 1947, issued a communique
accusing President Raul Cubas of ``defying the Constitution'' for
his decision on Friday to ignore the Supreme Court ruling and his
denial to send his friend Oviedo back to jail. Oviedo had announced
through his lawyers that he will also ignore the Supreme Court
order.
	   Oviedo was sentenced early this year for his attempt to topple
former President Juan Carlos Wasmosy in April 1996. Cubas freed him
by decree after his inauguration in August. The Supreme Court has
now declared that decree ``contrary to the Constitution''. ___ &QC; 
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ After three days of emergency smog
restrictions, Mexico City authorities said Sunday they would return
to normal pollution-control measures.
	   The city's Environment Ministry said it would not require
emergency restrictions for Monday. Instead, the standard policy of
banning cars with license plates ending in 5 and 6 would be in
effect.
	   Nevertheless, a thick haze of pollution hung over the Valley of
Mexico on Sunday.
	   Levels of ozone _ a colorless, odorless pollutant formed by a
chemical reaction between exhaust fumes and sunlight _ stood at 176
points on a scale in which 100 points is considered the maximum
acceptable limit.
	   Ozone levels had soared to 262 points on Thursday, requiring
Mexico City's environmental agency to order emission restrictions
for Friday. Further restrictions were ordered when ozone levels
lingered at 185 on Friday and 180 on Saturday.

Dollar higher against yen, Tokyo stocks rebound in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen early
Monday, while Japanese stock prices rebounded moderately following
Friday's rise on Wall Street.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 76.85 points,
or 0.52 percent, to 14,716.82 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Friday, the average closed down 57.11 points, or 0.39
percent.
	   The dollar bought 118.38 yen in early trading, up 0.06 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 118.95
yen on Friday.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar remained in a narrow range in
the absence of major market-moving news.
	   During Friday trading in New York, the dollar moved around the
mid-119.00 yen following the release of strong U.S. economic data,
but the currency slipped back later on some worries about sluggish
South American economies.
	   The Labor Department said Friday the nation's jobless rate fell
to 4.4 percent in November, the lowest rate since April and May,
when the unemployment rate to a 28-year low of 4.3 percent.
	   On the stock market, internationally known blue chips led early
gainers in Tokyo after investors were cheered by Friday's gain of
136.46 points, or 1.5 percent, in the Dow Jones industrial average.
	   The Dow advanced on the strong employment report, which provided
fresh evidence of resiliency in the U.S. economy.
	   Traders said, however, that activity was light as investors
continued to monitor developments in the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party's efforts to solidify a coalition with the opposition Liberal
Party.
	   A coalition is expected to lead to new economic stimulus
measures, as the Liberal Party favors tax reforms to boost the
economy.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 4.69 points or 0.42 percent, to 1,125.41. The TOPIX
closed down 8.17 points, or 0.72 percent, on Friday.
	   The benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond rose to
1.055 percent from Friday's finish of 1.045 percent, driving its
price down to 106.44 yen from 106.58 yen.

Nick Price edges Tiger Woods to win Million Dollar Challenge

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUN CITY, South Africa (AP) _ Nick Price's third win in the
Million Dollar Challenge meant a lot more than the first two.
That's because he beat Tiger Woods, and did it in a five-hole
playoff.
	   ``Obviously to have beaten someone like Tiger, it makes it a
little special. He's a phenomenon,'' Price said. ``I've got a great
future behind me. He's going to win plenty.
	   Price won Sunday when he birdied the 409-yard, par-4 17th.
Woods, whose ball was just off the edge, two-putted the hole.
	   Price called Woods, who at 22 is old enough to be his son, a
``phenomenal player.''
	   ``To go 77 holes of a championship and it comes down to one putt
is about as good as it gets,'' Price said. ``I don't know what
we're going to do next year for an encore.''
	   Woods, plagued by bad breaks on his putts throughout the
tournament, fought his way back after an opening round par-72. He
started the day four strokes back but charged hard on the back
nine, with an 18-foot putt to birdie on 17 and another birdie on
the 462-yard 18th hole.
	   Price, leading the field at 15 under, was up a stroke at the
final hole but he two-putted for par.
	   Woods, his ball about 20 feet away on the fringe, then used a
sand wedge to sink another 18-footer. He pumped his trademark
uppercut into the air, and went into the sudden-death playoff.
	   ``I had no choice. I had to make that shot,'' Woods said. ``I
knew I hit it on the line. I wasn't sure I had the pace or not. ...
As it kept rolling, kept rolling, about 3 feet from the hole, it
looked like it had a really good chance and then it went right in
center.''
	   ``The two birdies he made on 17 and 18 speak volumes for the
guy,'' Price said. ``Obviously to have beaten something like Tiger,
it makes it a little special. He's a phenomenon,'' he said. ``I've
got a great future behind me. He's going to win plenty.''
	   It was the first appearance by Woods in the tournament, and in
Africa for that matter. He was greeted as a hero by South Africa's
majority black population and mobbed at each of the holes.
	   Woods, who earned dlrs 250,000, was disappointed with the loss
but had a sense of the achievement for the birdies on 17 and 18.
	   Woods missed something else because of the playoff _ his plane
for Australia, where he will play in the President's Cup this week
with Jack Nicklaus as captain.
	   ``Jack won't be very happy,'' Woods joked.
	   Price, the defending champion and course record-holder with a
24-under in 1993, started the round four strokes back, after
leading for the first two rounds. But the Zimbabwean, who treats
this course like home, surged back Sunday with eight birdies,
including six straight, to win the dlrs 1 million first prize.
	   Only David Frost has won the Million Dollar Challenge three
times.
	   Justin Leonard finished third, a stroke behind, with a 3-under
69 at the 7,597-yard Gary Player Country Club course and won dlrs
200,000.
	   European sensation Lee Westwood, who had grabbed the lead
Saturday from Price, shot his worst round of the tournament, a 73,
and finished with a combined 276, even with two-time major winner
Mark O'Meara, whose final round was a 68.
	   Jim Furyk tied the course record of 64 set four years ago by
Nick Faldo, but finished in the bottom half along with Tom Watson,
Colin Montgomerie, David Duval and Jesper Parnevik _ who still
picked up checks for dlrs 100,000.

French bank expansion boosts Sydney's financial status
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney has reinforced its position as
the finance capital of Australia with France's largest bank
deciding to expand its headquarters in the city, New South Wales
state Premier Bob Carr said Monday.
	   Banque Nationale du Paris last week leased 107,600 square feet
(10,000 square meters) in the Castlereagh Street office tower as
the site for its expanded Australian headquarters, Carr said.
	   ``Sydney is indisputably the finance and business capital of
Australia and New South Wales controls more financial assets than
the rest of Australia put together,'' Carr said.
	   Carr said the New South Wales economy had continued to attract
international investment despite the Asian economic crisis.
	   BNP is the longest established foreign bank in Sydney, operating
in Australia since 1881.
	   Since January 1997, the bank had increased its Australian work
force from 360 to 560, with almost 450 of those jobs in New South
Wales, Carr said.

Britain hopeful after talks on Pan Am bombing suspects.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs, tightens. INCORPORATES Libya-Annan, Gulf-Annan.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Two Libyans long wanted in the bombing of a Pan Am
jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, may be in custody by Dec. 21, the
10th anniversary of the disaster, Britain's foreign secretary said.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan spent Saturday in Libya,
discussing with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and his foreign
secretary a handover of the two men suspected by Britain and the
United States in the 1988 explosion that killed 270 people.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Sunday it would be a
great comfort to relatives of the victims of Pan Am Flight 103 if
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah are brought to
trial by the anniversary.
	   ``I think you could sum up our mood as one of qualified
optimism,'' Cook said in an interview with British Broadcasting
Corp. television.
	   Libya, the United States and Britain have agreed in principle
that Scottish judges will hear the case at a special court in the
Netherlands. But if convicted, Libya wants the suspects jailed in
the Netherlands or in Libya. Cook told BBC television that Britain
will not budge on the demand by Washington and London that any
sentences be served in a Scottish jail.
	   Annan and Gadhafi, who met in a desert tent in Libya, failed to
reach a deal on handing over the suspects. Annan, however, said he
believed an agreement could be concluded soon.
	   Cook said he spoke with Annan on Sunday and was ``encouraged by
what he tells me.'' Annan, he said, succeeded in getting across to
Gadhafi ``the message that we are serious about this trial _ there
is no hidden agenda.''
	   Annan also spoke with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright by
telephone, according to a U.N. statement faxed to The Associated
Press. ``We are well on the way to resolving the problem,'' the
statement quoted him as telling Albright.
	   State-run Libyan Radio, meanwhile, quoted an unidentified
official in the Foreign Liaison Secretariat, Libya's equivalent of
a foreign ministry, as saying that ``a solution to this crisis is
within reach.''
	   He credited Annan's talks with Omar al-Muntasser, Libya's
foreign minister, who met Saturday with Annan before the
secretary-general went on to the talks with Gadhafi. The broadcast
was monitored by the BBC.
	   State Department spokesman James Foley said Saturday in
Washington that the United States is ``disappointed'' that Libya
has not complied with U.N. Security Council resolutions.
``Compliance means turnover of the two suspects for trial,'' Foley
said. ``...This has gone on for far too long.''
	   Jim Swire, spokesman for most families of the British victims,
said Annan's meeting was important because Gadhafi has expressed
fears of a trick and complained of being left out of negotiations
about the trial.
	   ``What he needs, I think, is reassurance that this really is an
offer of a fair trial and I can't think of anybody better than Kofi
Annan to give that reassurance,'' Swire said.
	   Annan arrived in Abu Dhabi on Sunday to attend a summit of the
Gulf Cooperation Council, a federation of six Arab Gulf states.

Lawyer for cult guru arrested on suspicion of hiding income
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ One of the lawyers defending the doomsday cult guru
accused in the 1995 gassing of the Tokyo subway has been arrested
on charges of obstructing the seizure of income, police said
Monday.
	   Yoshihiro Yasuda, 51, was arrested Sunday on suspicion of
conspiring to hide building rental income of 200 million yen (dlrs
1.7 million) by instructing the tenants of two Tokyo buildings to
pay their rent into bank accounts in 1993, said a spokesman for the
Tokyo Police Department, on condition of anonymity.
	   If convicted of the charges, Yasuda faces a maximum penalty of
two years in prison or a fine of 500,000 yen (dlrs 4,000).
	   Yasuda is an attorney for Shoko Asahara, 43, on trial for murder
and other charges, including masterminding the March 1995 nerve gas
attack on the Tokyo subway that killed 12 people and injured
thousands. Other lawyers for Asahara said Yasuda's arrest would
hurt their work.
	   ``We cannot condone the acts of the police and prosecutors,''
Osamu Watanabe, one of the lawyers, was quoted as saying by Kyodo
News service. ``Mr. Yasuda is the heart of our work. It's really
tough without a skipper.''
	   Japanese trials generally take a long time to reach a verdict,
and a trial as complex and serious as Asahara's is expected to take
years.
	   Police say Yasuda told the tenants to hide the income because it
was being seized by a debt-collecting agency as collateral for
borrowings by two other people, arrested in October, from housing
loan companies called ``jusen.''
	   Masses of soured jusen loans have been a major part of the bad
debt problem plaguing the Japanese economy, now in its worst
recession in decades.

U.S. apple industry to look to government for help on foreign juice
</HEADLINE>
imports &QL; 
 &UR; By LINDA ASHTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   YAKIMA, Washington (AP) _ In Asia, people can't afford his
apples. In the United States, companies aren't willing to pay him
enough to make it worth his while to pick them.
	   So, apple grower Dick Clements will let 1,000 tons (907 metric
tons) of apples _ about 10 percent of his crop _ rot this year.
	   But the apple industry, like others being squeezed by the
ongoing Asian financial crisis, is not just going to sit around and
take a beating. Apple growers are going to ask the federal
government for help in stopping what they say is a flood of
unfairly priced foreign apple juice concentrate to U.S. juice
makers.
	   ``A few years ago, 2,000 bins (about 1,000 tons) would have
returned to the orchard about dlrs 120,000. This year, the same
2,000 bins would have returned dlrs 16,000, and it costs us dlrs
24,000 to pick them,'' said Clements, who is general manager of
Rowe Farms in Naches.
	   ``It doesn't take a Rhodes scholar to figure out the math
there.''
	   The U.S. Apple Association, a trade organization based in
McLean, Virginia, has given notice it will file an anti-dumping
case with the U.S. Department of Commerce, which ultimately could
impose penalty tariffs on the low-priced foreign juice concentrate.
	   Some 50 percent of apple juice consumed in this country comes
from world market concentrate. ``The reason is the price,'' said
Pat Moss, a spokeswoman for Tree Top Inc. of Selah, Washington, a
processing cooperative which makes its own juice.
	   The American steel industry already has enlisted the
government's aid, asking in its anti-dumping complaint that the
United States impose penalty tariffs of 30 percent to 200 percent
on certain low-cost foreign steel from such countries as Japan,
Russia and Brazil.
	   Global turmoil may eventually force other U.S. industries, such
as computer chip makers, machine tool companies and automakers _
``virtually any industry that has competition from Asia or Russia''
_ to seek protective duties for their products, said Greg Mastel,
an economist at the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington. D.C.
	   Other agricultural commodities could start lining up as well.
	   In the World Trade Organization, the anti-dumping avenue is
probably the most attractive option for relief, he said.
	   ``For the most part, anti-dumping laws are seen as a
level-playing-field tool,'' Mastel said.
	   But they may not be the answer. It is costly to file an
anti-dumping case, and only about 45 percent of the cases are
successful, Mastel said.
	   The fees, perhaps dlrs 1 million, can be a disincentive,
especially when the industry has a tough year, said Chris Schlect
of the Northwest Horticultural Council in Yakima, which represents
the Pacific Northwest tree fruit industry in trade issues.
	   ``Even if you go through the process, if you prevail and the
duty is imposed, you don't want to hold that out as the salvation
for all that ails this industry,'' Schlect said.
	   With that in mind, growers are assessing themselves an extra 15
cents a box to pay for a special advertising campaign aimed at
increasing domestic consumption of apples.
	   While imports are being scrutinized, exports are just as much a
concern.
	   Central Washington, where the irrigated orchard country has been
dubbed the nation's fruit bowl, has been particularly hard hit by
the shock waves rolling in from Asia.
	   ``Indonesia _ that's been a complete meltdown,'' said Jim Thomas
of the Washington Apple Commission in Wenatchee.
	   Two years ago, it was one of the top markets for Washington
apples, taking 4.1 million boxes. This year, it imported only
600,000, he said.
	   Overall, exports of Washington apples are down 34 percent this
year compared to a year earlier, and exports to Asia are down
almost 43 percent, Thomas said.

Report: Nissan, Hitachi Ltd. to tie up in advanced car technology
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nissan Motor Co. and electronics giant Hitachi Ltd.
have agreed to jointly develop advanced car technology and auto
components, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   The cooperation will include developing technology to create the
next generation of environment-friendly cars and car safety
systems, the Nihon Keizai, Japan's leading business daily,
reported.
	   The companies refused to confirm the report, saying only that
they were still working out details before making a formal
announcement later in the afternoon.
	   The daily also reported that Nissan and Hitachi plan to team up
to develop intelligent transport systems.
	   The two also hope to gain a competitive edge in advanced car
technologies through the partnership, the paper said.
	   Through the deal, financially-strapped Nissan hopes to reduce
costs, while Hitachi, Japan's largest electric machinery maker,
plans to bolster its presence in the auto components field, it
said.
	   Many Japanese automakers have been forming strategic alliances
with domestic rivals and overseas car makers as Japan's recession
and economic woes in Asia push down profits.

Abubakar hails `permanent democracy' in Nigeria; elections praised

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The military leader who has launched
Nigeria on an ambitious path toward civilian rule said ``democracy
is here to stay,'' following local elections that drew many
enthusiastic voters.
	   Saturday's elections were the first since Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar outlined his plan earlier this year to cede power to
civilians in May, and the polling drew praise on Sunday from
visiting U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley.
	   Abubakar took power after the June death of dictator Gen. Sani
Abacha, who detained, tortured and occasionally killed his
opponents.
	   A leaderless coalition of former Abacha opponents led early
results of the local elections, officials said Sunday morning.
	   The Peoples' Democratic Party, a group of 34 traditional chiefs,
academics, businessmen and ex-military generals, was the top
vote-getter in most of Nigeria's 36 states, several National
Electoral Commission officials said on condition of anonymity.
	   They declined to say when official results would be available,
adding that votes in some rural communities were being collected by
donkeys and camels and that major cities had to deal with a
higher-than-expected turnout.
	   The PDP party has a murky platform and no leader, although
former military ruler Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo has donated dlrs 2.5
million and is campaigning for the party's presidential nomination
expected later this month or in January.
	   Despite its strong early showing, the PDP lost all seats in
Lagos and Obasanjo's hometown of Abeokuta, about 60 kilometers (35
miles) to the north of Nigeria's largest city, officials said later
in the day.
	   The winners in those areas included the PDP's rivals, the
Alliance for Democracy among other parties.
	   Obasanjo was unfazed by the news. ``The final outcome will prove
that the PDP is the platform preferred by most Nigerians,'' he told
reporters.
	   Daley, the most senior American official to visit this sprawling
West African country since Abacha's rule, praised the elections as
a sign that Nigerians are willing to bring about serious reforms.
	   Abubakar met Daley and a delegation of senior U.S. executives at
the general's state residence in the capital, Abuja.
	   ``Democracy is here to stay and it will stay,'' Abubakar said in
a soft voice that drew smiles and nods of approval from the
American audience.
	   ``This is the first step in our democratization program and I'm
happy to say that quite a lot of people turned out,'' he said.
	   Daley praised the elections as a sign that Nigerians are willing
to ``join the international community every day of the year.''
	   Saturday's vote was seen as a trial run before state and
presidential elections to be held by Feb. 15. Inauguration
ceremonies for the new civilian president are planned for May 29.
	   Daley said the United States was considering sending more senior
delegations to expand ties with Africa's most populous country,
which for years has been plagued by corruption, ethnic divisions
and military meddling.
	   Saturday's local government elections drew a huge turnout. More
than 50 million people were registered for the vote, which was
monitored by foreign observers and local human rights groups.
	   The mood was mainly positive although at least six people were
reportedly killed in a clash between supporters of two parties at a
voting station near Warri, about 200 kilometers (125 miles)
southeast of the commercial capital of Lagos.
	   Obasanjo, who helped finance the PDP, appeared to represent a
compromise choice offering military stability with increased
civilian participation.
	   Obasanjo had assumed control in 1976 after military leader Gen.
Murtala Muhammed died in a failed coup attempt. Obasanjo became the
only military ruler to relinquish power, and he retired in 1979.
	   He has strong support in the predominantly Muslim north, the
power base for the Nigerian military, which has ruled for all but
10 years since independence from Britain in 1960.
	   Preliminary election results also showed a strong showing for
two other new political entities _ the All Peoples' Party and the
Alliance for Democracy, which includes some members of political
parties formerly allied to Abacha, the electoral officials said.
	   Only parties that obtain at least 5 percent of Saturday's vote
in 24 of Nigeria's 36 states will be allowed to participate in
February's presidential poll.

Spacecraft images show north pole of Mars has thick icecap
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ New satellite images providing the first
close-up views of Mars' north pole show it is a thick ice cap wider
than France but much smaller than previously thought.
	   Planetary scientists said Sunday that the ice cap revealed by
the Mars Global Surveyor is made of water ice. But even with Mars'
very cold climate, it is only half the size of the ice cap covering
Greenland and only 4 percent of the Antarctica's combined ice
sheets.
	   The amount of water trapped in the ice cap is not sufficient to
have carved the deep gullies that scar the surface of the planet,
and is about 10 times less than the minimum volume that researchers
believe would have been necessary to fill an ancient ocean.
	   The new three-dimensional images were discussed at the American
Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco. The data will be
published Friday in the journal Science.
	   Researchers said the ice cap is unlike any feature they have
seen on Earth, or any other orbiting body in the solar system.
	   It rests in a deep basin at the top of the planet that might
have been created by an asteroid impact similar to craters on the
Moon. The ice cap measures 750 miles (1,207 kilometers) and is 1.8
miles (2.9 kilometers) thick.
	   Like any large feature, it is not uniform.
	   Parts of its surface are very smooth with elevations varying
only a few feet (meters) over many miles (kilometers). But in some
areas, the surface is riddled with canyons _ one trough is deeper
than the Grand Canyon _ or marked by mounds of ice that extend for
miles (kilometers).
	   If humans were to explore the ice cap, they probably would be
able to cross-country ski across it's gentler grades, and might
even schuss down its steeper slopes on downhill skis.
	   ``It looks like a hockey puck in a shallow depression,'' said
David Smith of NASA-Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,
Maryland.
	   Mars Global Surveyor is gradually descending into the Martian
atmosphere using its own aerodynamic drag to slow down. Since last
summer it has made over 180 looping orbits around the planet's
poles, passing as close as 80 miles (130 kilometers) above the ice
cap.
	   Researchers said the new images raise more questions about past
conditions on Mars than they answer.
	   For example, how did the ice cap form? Because the ice cap rests
in a basin, it is likely that liquid water on the planet's surface
flowed north from the equator to the pole, they said.
	   Features apparent in other images of Mars' northern hemisphere
show evidence of ancient springs. These springs may have supplied
the additional water required to carve surface features, they said.
	   ``The springs apparently were fed by groundwater,'' said Michael
Carr of the U.S. Geological Survey. ``The amount of ice in the cap
cannot possible explain the features that we see. I think the water
is there now.''
	   Nor do researchers know how old the ice cap is, since they can
only calculate the age indirectly through measuring its gravity and
the ice's rate of settling and compression. ``It's at least 100,000
years old, and it may be millions of years old,'' Smith said.
	   NASA plans to launch its next unmanned satellite to study the
Martian climate on Thursday. In January, the space agency plans to
launch another spacecraft to study the south pole of Mars.

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Dervis Eroglu, prime minister in the
breakaway Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus looked set to win
elections after preliminary results show him getting more than half
the 50 parliamentary seats.
	   Eroglu's National Unity Party, managed to gain 26 seats after
more than half of the votes were counted, the Turkish Cypriot news
agency TAK reported on Sunday.
	   Eroglu has been heading a coalition government since 1996. But
the preliminary results indicated he was likely to be able to
govern alone this time.
	   The elections were mared by a row between President Rauf
Denktash and an opposition center-left party who accused him of
favoring center-right parties. A disagreement over the island's
membership in the European Union also increased tension.
	   On Saturday, Denktash called on voters to support center-right
parties, which have opposed Turkish Cypriots joining in
negotiations for the island's membership in the European Union. One
of the parties is run by his son, Serdar Denktash.
	   Some 121,000 voters were eligible to elect 50 lawmakers from
among 352 candidates fielded by seven political parties in the
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was declared by Turkish
Cypriots in 1983 and is recognized only by Turkey.
	   The final, official results were expected on Monday.
	   Denktash contends Cyprus' membership in the EU would amount to
the island's integration with EU-member Greece.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkey sent in troops
after a coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
	   Turkish Cypriot opposition parties complain the election will be
dominated by the large number of settlers from the Turkish mainland
who have been given voting rights.
	   A recent report by the European Union Commission put the number
of recent settlers at 111,000 out of a population of 200,000.
Opposition parties say about half the candidates are settlers.

Viduka may quit soccer, management group says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Top Australian striker Mark Viduka
could quit soccer after walking out on Glasgow Celtic only days
after arriving in Scotland, his management group said Monday.
	   International Management Group (IMG), which manages the
Australian striker, confirmed that Viduka was now in Croatia and
would be heading back to Australia.
	   IMG football operations manager Bernie Mandich said there was a
distinct possibility that the forward could quit the game
altogether.
	   ``At this point he has no desire to play on,'' Mandich said,
	   Viduka, who moved to Parkhead from Croatia Zagreb in a prolonged
transfer, stunned the Scottish champions when he said he needed a
rest and skipped training.
	   Celtic is considering legal action against the 23-year-old
striker following the walkout and Mandich confirmed there was a
cloud over Viduka's future.
	   ``It also depends on Celtic now, they have the final say, it
depends on how understanding they are,'' Mandich said.
	   The footballer was warned that if he did return to Australia he
would be in breach of his contract with Celtic.
	   ``We are advising him not to come back to Australia,'' Mandich
said.
	   Viduka said he had been under pressure to perform at Zagreb and
last month said he was keen to move to Glasgow.
	   However 36 hours after his arrival, he had changed his mind and
issued a statement asking for his supporters to be patient.
	   ``It was only after I arrived in Glasgow last week that I
started to realize how much I had been affected by events in Zagreb
over the last few months where I had been under enormous personal
pressure,'' he said.
	   ``I arrived ready and wanting to play but it finally became
apparent that having thought a change would be as good as a rest, I
realized I actually badly needed a rest.
	   ``It would have been relatively easy for me to cover this up for
a few weeks, but that would not have been fair on the club, the
fans or my family. I just hope everyone realizes this is not easy
for me and appreciates my honesty.''
	   Celtic managing director Fergus McCann added to the mystery
saying there were concerns about the terms of the transfer.
	   ``We will be seeking clarification over the next few days from
various parties, including Croatia Zagreb, in particular in
relation to the disposition of the transfer fee agreed some time
ago,'' said McCann. (djp)

Sutton out of Presidents Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Hal Sutton has been forced to drop
out of the American team for golf's Presidents Cup this week due to
the sudden death of his father-in-law, Brant Powell, from a heart
attack.
	   Presidents Cup officials said Monday at Royal Melbourne Golf
Club that Sutton will be replaced by reigning U.S. Open champion
Lee Janzen.
	   Janzen was competing in a Skins game in Taipei when he was told
he was needed for the U.S. team to play the Internationals and is
due to arrive in Melbourne on Monday.
	   Sutton, 40, was to have made his debut as a member of the U.S.
team this week.
	   Sutton won seven tournaments from 1987 to 1995 and has
consistently been among the top money winners on the U.S. PGA Order
Of Merit.
	   Janzen, who won his second U.S. Open crown this year, is also a
first-time player in the U.S. team.
	   Under regulations for the Presidents Cup, a player in either
team can be replaced before noon Tuesday.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Former Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez, who
staged a bloody coup attempt six years ago, was elected president
of Venezuela _ a stunning blow to the political and economic
establishment that has ruled for 40 years.
	   People poured into the streets late Sunday, dancing, setting off
fireworks and honking horns in celebration of what many viewed a
victory of the poor over a political elite that has failed to ease
poverty and control rampant corruption.
	   ``Venezuela is being born again,'' Chavez declared as results
were revealed. ``Once again, the people of Simon Bolivar have shown
themselves to be a grand people,'' he told the Venevision
television network. Chavez often invokes South American liberation
hero Bolivar in his speeches.
	   With 78 percent of the vote counted, Chavez had 56 percent
compared to 40 percent for Yale-educated businessman Henrique Salas
Romer, according to official results from the National Electoral
Council.
	   ``I want to say to all Venezuelans that not only do I accept my
adversary's victory, I also wish him much luck because his luck is
Venezuela's luck,'' Salas said at his campaign headquarters in
Caracas.
	   Chavez, who will be sworn in on Feb 2, appealed for national
``reconciliation'' and sought to assure investors that he would
pursue prudent economic policies. He said he would not impose
exchange controls or other radical economic measures as his
opponents have claimed.

Kosovo Albanian leader Rugova lauded abroad, criticized as helpless

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ For a Kosovo schoolteacher, faith in
ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and his pacifist policies
died the day Serb police burned down his house.
	   Today, Agim Cervadiku believes only in the power of guns to
wrench the province free of Serbia's stern rule. Holed up with
other guerrillas in a half-destroyed farmhouse in rural Kosovo, he
chuckles at the mention of a man he once revered.
	   ``He is an admirable person, but he is without results in nearly
10 years,'' says the 38-year-old Cervadiku, local president of
Rugova's party until the Serbs' crackdown on separatists engulfed
his village of Poklek last May.
	   ``With his politics only, Serbia will win.''
	   Admired in the West for an unswerving adherence to pacifism in
the Balkans cauldron of hatred, Rugova is praised by world leaders
and has twice been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. This month
he will be presented the Sakharov human rights prize in France from
the European Parliament.
	   But at home, the soft spoken political leader seems increasingly
adrift, virtually helpless to influence the cause of war or peace
in a province where ethnic Albanians make up most of the population
of 2 million.
	   While many still support him, Kosovo newspaper cartoons now
lampoon Rugova as an intellectual wearing his trademark silk neck
scarf and a frightened look.
	   The guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army, no longer
outcasts, have assumed a bigger role in U.S.-led shuttle diplomacy
since an October truce and threaten to eclipse Rugova's influence
and once-soaring popularity among ethnic Albanians.
	   Nonetheless, Rugova, while relegated virtually to the sidelines,
is outwardly unshaken in the belief his policies are correct. He
says a majority of Kosovo Albanians still side with him.
	   After stubbornly refusing to acknowledge the KLA's existence
until last summer, he insisted in a rare interview last week that
the rebels are still only ``small groups of people, quite
isolated.''
	   Despite increased criticism, he told The Associated Press, ``I
remain a strong advocate of nonviolence and peaceful activism _
peaceful activism that has managed to create some institutions in
Kosovo and a civic society in spite of Serb domination.''
	   A president who has never held power, the 54-year-old Rugova may
be a more accomplished academic and author than a politician.
	   Born Dec. 2, 1944, in the western Kosovo village of Crnce, he
was raised by an uncle after his father was killed in World War II.
Neighbors recall him as a shy boy who never played soccer and was
always reading books.
	   After studying in Pristina and France and earning his Ph.D. in
literature, he worked as a magazine editor, critic and researcher
in Kosovo's capital, and has written 10 books of literary
criticism.
	   As Kosovo's long-simmering Serb-Albanian tensions were coming to
a boil a decade ago, Rugova burst into prominence by promising
something bold and unorthodox: independence through peaceful means.
	   His ideas won him election as head of the biggest Albanian
party, the pro-independence League of Democratic Kosovo, in 1989
when Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic revoked Kosovo's nearly
two decades of autonomy.
	   After Rugova's LDK proclaimed the self-styled Republic of
Kosovo, he was overwhelmingly elected its president in 1992 and
again last March. But Serbian authorities outlawed the new state.
	   Instead of ruling, Rugova poured his efforts into organizing an
unusual parallel state with separate schools, medical and civic
institutions.
	   It's an achievement he clings to in this dark year of bloodshed,
when hundreds have been killed and over a quarter-million displaced
in months of fighting that began when Serb forces launched an
offensive to try to crush the KLA.
	   ``We have proved that we are able to make it, to keep house, to
keep a society,'' Rugova says. ``This is to the credit of the
people of Kosovo.''
	   His role now has been reduced largely to that of a symbol who
speaks out about the ethnic Albanians' plight while rarely
venturing out of Pristina, the war-intact capital where support for
his pacifism remains high.
	   Critics call him a figurehead, propped up by international
officials who meet with him in lieu of other elected Albanian
leaders.
	   ``As a politician he is incompetent,'' snorts Adem Demaci, a
respected former dissident who says he speaks for the KLA.
	   Despite the defections and lost support, there is little doubt
Rugova would be re-elected if a political settlement is reached and
new elections are held next year. No other charismatic leader has
emerged, and Rugova's warm reception by world leaders stands him in
good stead _ if the fighting can be stopped.
	   ``Rugova has achieved strong ties with America and the West, and
ethnic Albanians know international assistance represents our best
hope for the future,'' says Gjergj Dedaj, vice chairman of Kosovo
Albanians' parliament.
	   ``There is no good alternative'' to Rugova, he adds.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Syedul Haque Mazumdar embraced his
17-year-old son and muttered words of comfort in their native
Bengali language.
	   And then they walked away.
	   Minutes earlier, Mazumdar's son, Syed Mohammad Sajjad, had lost
to Kuwait's Walid Alhatem 5-4 in the Asian Games' newest sport _
snooker.
	   Mazumdar, 43, is the leader of Bangladesh's three-member snooker
team in the games that opened in Thailand's capital Sunday.
	   He paid dlrs 2,500 for their air fares from the capital, Dhaka,
to Bangkok and for their stay in the Asian Games Village after
Bangladesh's government declined to pay, saying that if they wanted
to participate they should pay themselves.
	   Bangladesh is a poor, overcrowded country of 122 million people
with an economy that is often devastated by natural calamities. The
delta nation of 144,000 square kilometers (55,600 square miles) is
one-third under water even during the dry season and up to 80
percent during a normal monsoon. Eighty percent of all development
activities in the country are financed by foreign aid.
	   Mazumdar is Bangladesh's No. 3 player. The No. 1 could not
afford the trip. The No. 2, Mohammed Hussein, got a sponsor.
	   ``I think I took the right decision to bring my son along,''
Mazumdar said after recovering from the pain of his child's defeat.
	   ``For his age he gave a good fight,'' said Mazumdar. ``Even in
defeat I am happy because he got international exposure.''
	   For Mazumdar, who will play his first game Tuesday, cricket was
his first love. But that changed in 1982 when his father died and,
being the eldest son, Mazumdar had to look after the family
business of garments and jute.
	   ``I got attracted to snooker because it is very relaxing,''
Mazumdar said. He picked up the game after lunch in clubs.
	   When Sajjad was born, Mazumdar and his wife, Dillara, dreamed
that one day he would shape up as an internationally famed snooker
player.
	   ``He is doing well. Let him grow a bit more and you will see a
very good player in him.''
	   The Mazumdars also have a 14-year-old daughter, Sabrina, and an
8-year-old son, Sakib.
	   ``Sakib is too small to play, but he is already trying his hand
by using a stool,'' Mazumdar said.
	   Seeing the interest both his sons have in the game, Mazumdar has
bought a snooker table at home.
	   ``I hope I get a few victories in Bangkok if not a medal,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Physicist Stephen Hawking, author of ``A Brief
History of Time,'' flew to Hollywood for a role in ``The Simpsons''
television series and managed to wow Bart, Homer and Lisa,
according to a British newspaper.
	   Hawking, who holds the Cambridge University post once held by
Sir Isaac Newton, plays himself, complete with ``supercharged
wheelchair'' and his distinctive electronic voice, The Independent
reported Sunday.
	   ``He comes in to make a commentary on the universe as a whole
and intellectuals,'' producer Bonnie Patila, was quoted as saying.
``He plays himself _ it's a show that has to do with intellectuals
and we don't know anyone more intellectual than him.''
	   Friends said the academic ``greatly enjoyed'' his Hollywood
experience and would like to get more acting parts, according to
the report.
	   The episode is to be broadcast in the spring.
	   The professor suffers from Lou Gehrig's disease, which affects
the motor skills. He uses an electronic synthesizer to speak.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ British runner Nicholas Bourne, who
completed his 11-month run across Africa, has urged Western nations
to donate money to charities working for the impoverished African
people.
	   ``We in the West are lucky enough to live in an easy and stable
environment, while people in Africa have very little and must work
very hard for what they have,'' Bourne, 28, said Sunday from
Britain.
	   Bourne reached Egypt on Saturday, completing his 10,951.7
kilometer (6,790-mile), eight-nation run of Africa that began Jan.
21.
	   His aim was to raise dlrs 1.65 million for the charity group
Save the Children fund and the Born Free Foundation, an
environmental protection group.
	   Bourne, a former art dealer, decided on the run after a trip to
several African countries. He was struck by the poverty and the
beautiful landscape that he said was being destroyed by industrial
projects.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Animate a story that's sacred to three major
religions, pick a voice to sound like God, and mass-market the
result around the world _ all without offending anybody.
	   That was the delicate task before Jeffrey Katzenberg, co-founder
of DreamWorks, as he shepherded the forthcoming film ``The Prince
of Egypt'' _ which tells the story of Moses _ from concept to
reality.
	   ``It is so much more complicated, so much more challenging than
simply making a movie,'' Katzenberg told Time magazine in its Dec.
14 issue.
	   Katzenberg met with 700 clerics and scholars, journeyed to the
Vatican, studied the Bible and spoke to professors at Harvard's
divinity school, all in an effort to get things right _ without
stepping on anyone's toes. And instead of Moses action figures, the
promotional tie-in will consist of a package containing a book,
compact disc and tickets to the movie.

	   ROME (AP) _ Christmas makes old people feel like children, says
Pope John Paul II, who on Sunday told youngsters how he stays fresh
in spirit.
	   Speaking to more than 100 cheering school-age children at a
parish in an upper class Rome neighborhood, John Paul said: ``I
know why you're happy. It's because Christmas is coming.''
	   Later, to a group of adults, the 78-year-old pontiff referred to
the encounter and said that Christmas is joyful for old people,
too, because they feel ``like children again.''
	   And to the children he added: ``Stay young. If you can't with
physical strength, then with the spirit. This I feel even in my own
experience.''
	   The ailing pope, who has trouble walking and often tires during
public appearances, frequently seems invigorated by meetings with
young people. He spoke with a strong clear voice and seemed
relaxed.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Rocky has a new home.
	   Sylvester Stallone has bought a new Italian villa-style estate
in the Beverly Hills area for about dlrs 10 million, the Los
Angeles Times reported Sunday.
	   The 16,000-square-foot (1,485 square meter) house has six
bedrooms and nine baths while the gated estate boasts a pool,
formal gardens and a 500-foot (150 meter) driveway.
	   Stallone and his wife, model Jennifer Flavin, have been living
part-time at their 11.7-acre (5 hectare) Miami estate, which is on
the market for dlrs 24.7 million.

Dollar higher against yen, Tokyo stocks rebound in morning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar gained against the yen Monday
morning as traders scrambled to cover short, or oversold,
positions. Japanese stock prices rose moderately.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 83.52 points,
or 0.57 percent, to 14,723.49 points to close the morning session.
On Friday, the average closed down 57.11 points, or 0.39 percent.
	   The dollar bought 118.86 yen at midday, up 0.54 yen from late
Friday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 118.95 yen on
Friday.
	   The U.S. currency had dipped early in the morning on reports
that U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin had expressed a desire to
resign. But the dollar later recovered as traders covered short
positions.
	   Concerns about a new bout of financial troubles in Brazil were
capping the dollar's rise, however, analysts said.
	   During Friday trading in New York, the dollar moved around the
mid-119.00 yen following the release of strong U.S. economic data,
but the currency slipped back later on some worries about sluggish
South American economies.
	   The Labor Department said Friday the nation's jobless rate fell
to 4.4 percent in November, the lowest rate since April and May,
when the unemployment rate dipped to a 28-year low of 4.3 percent.
	   On the stock market, internationally known blue chips led early
gainers in Tokyo after investors were cheered by Friday's gain of
136.46 points, or 1.5 percent, in the Dow Jones industrial average.
	   The Dow advanced on the strong employment report, which provided
fresh evidence of resiliency in the U.S. economy.
	   Traders said, however, that activity was light as investors
continued to monitor developments in the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party's efforts to solidify a coalition with the opposition Liberal
Party.
	   A coalition is expected to lead to new economic stimulus
measures, as the Liberal Party favors tax reforms to boost the
economy.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 4.96 points or 0.44 percent, to 1,125.68. The TOPIX
closed down 8.17 points, or 0.72 percent, on Friday.
	   The benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond rose to
1.055 percent from Friday's finish of 1.045 percent, driving its
price down to 106.44 yen from 106.58 yen.

World's tallest tower gets go-ahead in Melbourne
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The world's tallest tower is to be
built in Melbourne, nudging out Toronto's CN tower by just over 19
1/2 feet (six meters).
	   Victorian state Premier Jeff Kennett announced Monday that the
Grollo tower concept had won the bid for the Docklands site on
Melbourne's western fringe.

Injury toll up to 84 in earthquake in southwest China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Five children seriously injured in school
collapses were among the 84 people hurt in an earthquake in
southwest China last week, an official newspaper reported Monday.
	   The magnitude 5.1 quake on Dec. 1 in Xuanwei, a county with 1.3
million people in Yunnan province, damaged 472 schools and 21,400
houses and caused 187 million yuan (dlrs 22.5 million) in damage,
the China Daily reported.
	   Local officials previously had said there were few injuries from
the quake.
	   China Daily said Liu Shunhua, a city official, reported the
higher number of injuries and noted that 21 aftershocks could be
felt throughout the area. More than 550 students whose schools were
severely damaged were attending classes in tents, Liu said.
	   For Yunnan, Xuanwei was the second disaster in two weeks. A pair
of powerful quakes on Nov. 20 left 4,000 injured and 25,000 people
homeless in the Ninglang region, 300 kilometers (180 miles) west of
Xuanwei.

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Despite the strong interest in
legislative elections that were overshadowed by the shooting death
of a leading liberal politician, nobody was expected to win
outright and runoffs were considered certain in most races.
	   More than 500 candidates competed Sunday in St. Petersburg's
city election.
	   Turnout was high by Russian standards, with 38 percent of
eligible voters casting ballots. But with so many candidates vying
for seats in the municipal legislature, runoffs were expected in
most if not all races.
	   The election captured nationwide interest, mainly because of the
Nov. 20 killing of Galina Starovoitova, the country's most
prominent female politician and a member of the Russian parliament
who was pushing a liberal bloc of candidates in the St. Petersburg
elections.
	   Some of Starovoitova's supporters have suggested she was killed
to prevent her faction, Northern Capital, from doing well in the
election, although it could have the opposite effect of rallying
her followers.
	   Preliminary election results were expected later Monday.
	   The election was considered important because the municipal
legislature in St. Petersburg has been given enhanced powers under
a new city charter, and will have a much stronger voice in city
affairs than similar bodies elsewhere in Russia.
	   Perhaps because of those stakes, the campaign was marred by
dirty tricks, violence and threats of violence.
	   Alexander Yakovlev, the city's mayor, strongly opposed the new
charter, which curtails his clout. He was not on the ballot, but
critics said his supporters contributed to the mean-spirited
atmosphere surrounding the election.
	   Yakovlev's opponents found that people with names identical to
theirs mysteriously wound up on the ballot in an apparent attempt
to confuse voters and take away votes from liberals.
	   In addition, anti-Semitic leaflets were handed out asking
citizens not to vote for Jewish candidates, and one candidate's
posters were defaced with slurs against Jews.
	   There were several reports of attempts to bribe voters. Police
said they arrested three people who were offering 25 rubles to 50
rubles (dlrs 1.25 to dlrs 2.50) in exchange for votes for specified
candidates, ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   On election day, three polling stations briefly were closed
after someone telephoned bomb threats to local authorities. No
bombs were found.
	   St. Petersburg, Russia's second largest city, was at the
forefront of the country's democracy movement a decade ago, but
much of its sense of itself as a progressive, Western-oriented city
has faded, at least in terms of city politics.
	   As it headed into the elections, St. Petersburg appeared at
least as dirty and deadly as anywhere in Russia.
	   Last year, the city's deputy governor was gunned down in the
city center. In the past two months, hitmen have claimed the lives
of a legislative aide, a high-ranking city official and a prominent
banker.
	   St. Petersburg's 3.7 million voters seem fed up with the city's
crime and corruption, and its poor economic performance. But it
wasn't clear how that would play itself out in terms of voting.

Tough row to hoe for Japan's troubled farmers

<TEXT>
	   OTOYOCHO, Japan (AP) _ In spring, Mitsuyoshi Oori's neighbors
crowd his mountainside fields and plant rice seedlings into the wet
earth. At harvest time, they're ready with scythes and combines.
	   The group isn't just being friendly. It's part of a corporation
formed a few years ago to keep the area's aging farmers in business
_ and keep this rural hamlet in southwestern Japan alive.
	   ``When I'm sick I can ask them to plant and harvest _ it's very
convenient,'' said Oori, 70. ``We used to have workers around to
pay for help, but those people are gone now.''
	   All over Japan, farmers are giving up the plow and the hoe. Rice
fields are being swallowed by urban sprawl or abandoned by the
elderly. Rural areas are emptying out. Japan now produces only 42
percent of the calories it consumes _ down from 79 percent in 1960.
	   Behind the decline is a confluence of trends in modern Japan:
the rapid aging of the population, the concentration of people and
jobs in cities, the shift away from traditional staples like rice.
	   The changes have spawned visions of a future Japan with a
deserted countryside and a precarious food supply, vulnerable to
bad weather, war or blockage of trade lines that could cut off
shipments.
	   ``We must face the possibility of a serious food shortage in the
21st century,'' the agricultural newspaper Nihon Nogyo warned in a
recent editorial.
	   In Tokyo, bureaucrats worried about rural decline and dependency
on foreign food are busy rewriting national agriculture guidelines
in place since 1961. Draft legislation is due next year.
	   A government advisory panel has recommended forming more
corporations like the one in Otoyocho, letting the market play a
greater role in the highly regulated sector and establishing a
minimum income for farmers in mountainous regions.
	   ``We need to take bold reforms,'' Agriculture Minister Shoichi
Nakagawa said in a speech announcing the release of the report in
September.
	   While the government talks reform, Japanese agriculture is
undergoing dramatic changes.
	   The number of Japanese whose main business is farming declined
nearly 25 percent from 1985 to 1995, the government reported last
year, and the percentage of elderly among them _ many without
successors to take over their farms _ doubled to 42 percent.
	   The amount of farmland under cultivation is dropping as well,
propelled by the government's policy of trimming rice production to
cut huge surpluses and by abandonment of land by owners too old or
sickly to farm.
	   Meanwhile, a more affluent Japan is shunning longtime staples
like homegrown rice and opting for pizza, burgers and bread _ made
with foreign ingredients like wheat and beef. Japan is the world's
largest importer of foodstuffs.
	   At the center of the food security debate is Japan's heavily
regulated and subsidized agricultural sector.
	   Despite some deregulation and changing tastes, the system is
still geared toward planting rice _ lots of it. Rice consumption is
on a long decline, but that hasn't stopped producers encouraged by
laws and subsidies from growing too much nearly every year.
	   Japan's long-protected farmers are also having a hard time
competing against cheaper imports coming into the country as
markets slowly liberalize. Crucial inputs like machinery and
fertilizer are much more expensive in Japan.
	   Japan also faces another major hurdle: geography.
	   More than half the country is mountainous, and the whole nation
is prone to typhoons, landslides, volcanic eruptions and
earthquakes. People barely have room for large houses, never mind
horizon-cutting wheat fields or cow pastures.
	   History has also played a part. Land reform instituted by the
U.S. occupation after World War II created a country of
smallholders _ really small. The average size of Japanese farms is
a tiny 1.4 hectares (3 1-2 acres), meaning they don't enjoy the
efficiencies of larger operations.
	   Officials acknowledge the system in place today is outdated.
	   ``Things have changed a lot since 1961,'' said Masaki Takamoto,
spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.
	   Despite the grim landscape, gains are being made. As older
farmers give up on their fields, new cooperatives are forming to
consolidate smaller plots into more profitable businesses.
	   Agricultural associations are trying to develop new technologies
and boost productivity. And disillusioned urban dwellers and
retirees are increasingly returning to rural areas for a simpler
life on the farm.
	   Those changes are slowly filtering through the mountains
surrounding Otoyocho, 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) southwest of
Tokyo on remote Shikoku island. Officials there talk of combining
fields and developing new crops.
	   But the district is more a picture of Japanese agriculture's
past than its future.
	   Farmers bend over postage-stamp rice paddies terraced into the
sides of mountains. More than 60 percent of farmers in the area are
older than 65. Many young people have fled for the bright lights of
Osaka or Tokyo.
	   ``Gradually, things are getting harder,'' said Oori, who makes
ends meet with a pension and odd jobs in the off season. ``We can't
live from just farming anymore, so people are heading for the
cities.''
	   One bright spot in Otoyocho is the corporation that helps Oori,
the Otoyo Yutori Farm. The group started as a cooperative of about
40 farmers a few years ago and incorporated in 1996. It gets
funding from the government and agricultural organizations.

<TEXT>
	   Otoyo Yutori lends a hand in planting and harvest seasons for a
fee and provides machinery that smallholders can't afford to buy
themselves. It also has a shop to sell produce in nearby Kochi city
and helps distribute the area's produce to more distant markets.
	   The corporation is operating in the black and has drawn national
attention as a way to invigorate rural areas. But its role in
Otoyocho is more a form of life-support for a fading community than
a profit-making enterprise.
	   ``If the amount of farming land continues to decrease, we're
afraid nobody will be able to live here,'' said Takahiro Mitani,
Otoyocho town's agriculture section chief. ``We have to ... inject
some sort of support, even if there's no economic advantage.''
	   Cutting-edge agriculture is not a priority for the district's
elderly farmers. Instead, many cling to hopes that middle-aged sons
and daughters in the city will retire and come home to carry on the
family tradition.
	   Oori's son has shown some interest in settling down on his
father's 0.9-hectare (2 1-4 -acre) farm. But that won't be for
another 10 years.
	   Oori said he's up for the challenge.
	   ``I'll just have to hang in there till I'm 80,'' he said.

	   Some facts on Japanese agriculture:
	   ___
	   FARMLAND: 4.9 million hectares (12.1 million acres) in 1997,
down 27 percent from 6.7 million hectares (16.5 million acres) in
1960s.

	   AGING FARMERS: 1.17 million farm households headed by someone 60
or older in 1995, up 8 percent from 1.08 million in 1990.
Percentage of professional farmers 65 or older rose to 42 percent
in 1995 from 21 percent in 1985.
	   ___
	   CHANGING DIET, MORE IMPORTS: Japanese tastes shifting from
homegrown staples such as rice to foods made with imported
ingredients like wheat, corn, beef. Value of food imports was dlrs
44 billion in 1996, up from dlrs 15 billion in 1980.
	   ___
	   OUTDATED SYSTEM: Highly regulated food production and
distribution system set up in 1961 to keep Japan stocked with rice
and boost rural incomes. Now blamed for rice overproduction and
other inefficiencies.
	   ___
	   BRIGHT SPOTS: Sprouting cooperatives buying abandoned farmland
and combining members' holdings to form larger, more efficient
farms. Competition from cheaper imports prompting farmers to turn
to technology to boost productivity.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Giggling nervously as she dabs on
lipstick, 15-year-old Nong Nim Sitkosin isn't primping for a date.
	   She's getting ready to box.
	   Broad shouldered and baby faced, Nong Nim is one of about 50
women who are professional Muay Thai fighters, or kickboxers, in
Thailand.
	   Don't' let the pink satin rose on her tank top fool you: She's
undefeated after 20 bouts, all won by knockout.
	   ``I like fighting. My father was a boxer,'' Nong Nim says as her
mother tapes her fists for her first fight in Bangkok.
	   Her tender age is not unusual for a Muay Thai fighter. Most
start as young as 10, and there is no public outcry about children
boxing in this country of poor farmers, even against adults.
	   A few feet (meters) away, 30-year-old Khamnang Por Thipmaturot,
a mother of three, puts powder on her pockmarked face while her
husband inspects the gloves she will use against Nong Nim.
	   Making up before a fight has nothing to do with vanity.
	   The World Muay Thai Council, the Thai generals who form the
sport's governing body, has ordered that all female fighters wear
lipstick and powder during matches.
	   Nonetheless, they are forbidden from fighting in the same ring
as men. Muay Thai has a mystical component and male fighters
believe the presence of women inside their ring would anger the
spirits.
	   Most arenas, including the sport's top stadiums, Lumpini and
Rajadamnern in Bangkok, don't have two rings, so there are few
venues where the women can face off.
	   ``I want to fight at Lumpini,'' Khamnang says. ``I hope someday
I can.''
	   Although that isn't likely soon, Muay Thai officials are
supportive of women taking up the sport.
	   ``I think it's not wrong at all, because men and women are
equal,'' says Nachakorn Ketbamrung, an official with the Muay Thai
Institute, a school run by the sport's leadership.
	   Around midnight, about 500 fans gather around the women's ring
at the institute's arena. The fight is being nationally televised.
	   Khamnang's husband is in the crowd, making wagers on his wife.
	   Although she says she loves to fight, money is a major
motivation. The purse for winning the bout is only 5,000 baht (dlrs
125), but Khamnang hopes to win 50,000 baht (dlrs 1,250) from bets,
nearly double her family's annual income from rice farming.
	   Khamnang and Nong Nim quickly impress the fans by fighting with
determination and enthusiasm.
	   ``I'm all for it because it's a martial art,'' says Adual
Pongvichit, watching the women throw left hooks and dig knees into
each other's groins. ``If they're ever in any trouble, maybe it can
help them.''
	   The women's skills fall far short of the average male fighter.
They flail instead of punch, and their slow, tentative kicks rarely
land solidly.
	   Nong Nim is slightly faster and stronger. The junior high school
student throws the older farmer to the canvas and lands the hardest
kick of the evening. At the end of the regulation five rounds, she
is the winner by decision.
	   Nong Nim is ecstatic. She poses for pictures with her mother,
gloves raised in triumph, her winning wagers of 100,000 baht (dlrs
2,500) clenched between her teeth.

Redneck refuge or populist pathfinder? Alberta stands apart
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) _ It was only a tongue-in-cheek letter to
a newspaper. But the suggestion to trade Alberta to the United
States _ perhaps for Minnesota _ got a lot of Canadians thinking
about this idiosyncratic, occasionally un-Canadian province.
	   Alberta is Canada's oilfield, its cowboy country, headquarters
for its anti-gun-control lobby, stronghold of its right-wing
political movement. In the American West, it might fit in
comfortably; in Canada _ well, Alberta is different.
	   ``Albertans feel good about Alberta,'' said Thomas Flanagan,
political science professor at the University of Calgary. ``If we
can just be left alone to run our own affairs, and be taxed as
little as possible, we'll be fine.''
	   The Toronto-based Globe and Mail, which circulates across
Canada, recently published a letter from Toronto reader John Firth,
who bemoaned the Alberta government's opposition to gun control and
its reluctance to embrace gay rights.
	   ``Clearly the time has come to expel this right-wing cuckoo from
the Canadian nest,'' wrote Firth, who proposed trading the province
to the United States for ``one of the more civilized border
states'' _ preferably Minnesota or Vermont.
	   Dozens of letters have flowed to the Globe and Mail in response,
some accusing it of disseminating hate literature, and almost all
of it defending Alberta.
	   Rather than expel Alberta, why not send Ottawa-based federal
politicians and bureaucrats to Alberta, reader Jack Tate suggested.
``Both the country and they would benefit from their exposure to
clear mountain air and clear thinking.''
	   But Melanie Anderson, part of Alberta's left-of-center minority
and head of its Planned Parenthood chapter in Calgary, says critics
of the province are on target.
	   ``Other Canadians do look at Alberta as being very redneck, and
unfortunately I'd have to agree with them,'' she said. ``To tell
the truth, it's very embarrassing to be from Alberta when you go to
a national conference.''
	   At the moment, Alberta ranks as Canada's most conservative
province and its most prosperous. Many Albertans would link those
two achievements.
	   Among Alberta's distinctions:
	   _It is the only province with no sales tax.
	   _It is the bastion of the right-wing Reform Party, now the
largest opposition faction in Parliament. The governing Liberal
Party can claim reasonable support almost everywhere else in
Canada; in Alberta, it won one seat in last year's national
election while Reform won the other 25.
	   _Alberta initiated a legal challenge to federal gun control
legislation that will require registration of all 7 million
firearms in Canada. Three other provinces joined the suit, which is
likely to reach Canada's Supreme Court.
	   _Alberta has been a pioneer in providing public funds to private
schools, several of them run by conservative Christian churches.
	   _It implemented a no-frills policy at its jails _ rationing
toilet paper, removing pool tables, eliminating bacon from
breakfast menus _ that prompted one offender to request a 24-month
term in a federal prison rather than 15 months in an Alberta jail.
	   _It is crusading for radical reform of Canada's largely impotent
Senate, saying members should be elected rather than appointed by
the prime minister. In October, the province elected two
``senators-in-waiting'' to fill Alberta seats in the chamber
whenever the rest of the country wises up.
	   _Alone among the provinces, Alberta waged a long legal battle
against offering specific protection to homosexuals in its human
rights code. The Supreme Court ruled against the province in April,
rejecting its claim that the issue should be decided by
politicians, not judges.
	   Murray Billett, an Alberta activist involved in the campaign to
bolster gay rights, said the provincial government has complied
with the high court ruling only grudgingly and is studying ways to
limit homosexual rights in other areas.
	   ``This is a province that was 20 years behind the times, guilty
of state-sanctioned discrimination,'' he said. ``It's a time to be
mending fences, not building them. But look what they continue to
do.''
	   Flanagan, the University of Calgary professor, says Alberta's
unique political character dates back more than a century, when
early settlers included ranchers and Mormons from the United
States.
	   While most of English-speaking Canada was entrenching British
parliamentary traditions, Alberta was influenced by American
populist ideas, Flanagan said. More so than the rest of Canada, it
believes in voter-initiated ballot proposals and seeks politicians
who are more loyal to their constituents than their parties, he
said.
	   Those traditions have been strengthened by the boom in Alberta's
energy industry. Oil and gas companies are constantly moving
personnel and ideas across the U.S.-Canadian border, while seeking
a low-tax, low-regulation political climate that might not mesh
with the interests of eastern Canada.
	   Alberta's popular premier, Ralph Klein, was the first major
political leader in Canada to mobilize public support for slashing
budget deficits. His efforts starting in 1993 have led to a huge
budget surplus for Alberta, while prompting copycat budget-cutting
by the federal government and most other provinces.
	   Now, says Flanagan, Albertans see themselves as economic
victims, sacrificing part of their prosperity so federal
authorities can finance welfare and social programs in less
affluent provinces.
	   ``The frustration leads to occasional spasms of separatism,''
Flanagan said. ``But actually, we have been making considerable
progress. ... Through the Reform Party, we've been having an effect
on what happens in Ottawa.''
	   Billett, the liberal political activist, who has lived and
worked in most of Canada's other provinces, finds Alberta a
stimulating challenge.
	   ``Alberta is slowly coming along,'' he said. ``I take great
pride in being part of the process of making them understand the
realities of the diversity that is here.''

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Former Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez, who
staged a bloody coup attempt six years ago, was elected president
of Venezuela _ a stunning blow to the political and economic
establishment that has ruled for 40 years.
	   People poured into the streets late Sunday, dancing, setting off
fireworks and honking horns in celebration of what many viewed a
victory of the poor over a political elite that has failed to ease
poverty and control rampant corruption.
	   ``Venezuela is being born again,'' Chavez declared as results
were revealed. ``Once again, the people of Simon Bolivar have shown
themselves to be a grand people,'' he told the Venevision
television network. Chavez often invokes South American liberation
hero Bolivar in his speeches.
	   With 78 percent of the vote counted, Chavez had 56 percent
compared to 40 percent for Yale-educated businessman Henrique Salas
Romer, according to official results from the National Electoral
Council.
	   ``I want to say to all Venezuelans that not only do I accept my
adversary's victory, I also wish him much luck because his luck is
Venezuela's luck,'' Salas said at his campaign headquarters in
Caracas.
	   Chavez, who will be sworn in on Feb 2, appealed for national
``reconciliation'' and sought to assure investors that he would
pursue prudent economic policies. He said he would not impose
exchange controls or other radical economic measures as his
opponents have claimed.
	   ``We are going to instill confidence, and that's my first
message to investors,'' Chavez said. ``You the investor, if you
have capital abroad, bring it here.''
	   For the first time, neither of Venezuela's two traditional
parties fielded candidates. In an effort to head off a Chavez
victory, the center-left Democratic Action Party and the
center-right COPEI Party dumped their respective candidates during
the past week and threw their support to Salas, who had been
running second to Chavez in the polls.
	   Until this week, Salas, a former state governor, had taken great
pains to distance himself from Democratic Action and COPEI _ aware
that most Venezuelans blame them for squandering the world's
largest oil reserves outside the Middle East.
	   ``Nothing like these elections has happened in Venezuela's
political history,'' U.S. Ambassador John Maisto said.
	   In 1992, Chavez led 15,000 rebel soldiers who tried and failed
to overthrow Venezuela's democratically elected government. Dozens
of people were believed to have died in the attempt, though the
actual number was never clear. His critics asserted he would impose
a leftist dictatorship and roll back free-market economic reforms.
Because of this, his candidacy was seen as a warning by much of
Latin America.
	   Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition, which calls for fewer
privatizations and a slowing of free-market economic reforms,
already won a plurality of Congress in Nov. 8 regional elections,
breaking the two traditional parties' 40-year political
stranglehold.
	   Chavez's call for a new constitution and the dissolving of
Congress has scared investors and exacerbated an economic crisis.
Foreign oil companies, including Exxon, Mobil, Shell and British
Petroleum, have put some of their investment plans on hold.
	   Venezuela is the number one exporter of oil to the United
States.
	   An economic crisis caused by a 12-year low in oil prices has
made making ends meet all but impossible for most Venezuelans,
whose standard of living has been steadily declining for more than
15 years.
	   The campaign took on overtones of class warfare. Chavez's
militaristic rhetoric terrified middle and upper class Venezuelans,
many of whom have already fled to Miami.
	   ``He's a crazy man on the loose, a communist,'' said Elena
Alamos, an elderly woman casting her vote in Caracas's upper class
Altamira district.
	   Chavez voted Sunday amid some 1,000 supporters roaring,
``Chavez! Chavez!'' and ``Viva Venezuela!'' As he drove away,
throngs of teenagers chased after his white van.
	   Street celebrations broke out throughout the country Sunday
evening; people donned Chavez's trademark red parachutist's beret
and hung Venezuelan flags from balconies.
	   ``Down with the oligarchy!'' shouted one woman standing outside
Chavez's Caracas headquarters.
	   The voting Sunday was orderly, and turnout was high for
Venezuela at 65 percent.
	   Among the trailing candidates was former Miss Universe Irene
Saez, who had led the polls until earlier this year. On Sunday, she
won 3 percent of the vote, according to the partial results.

Japanese icebreaker goes to aid of stranded Australian Antarctic

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ A Japanese icebreaker is going to the
aid of the Australian Antarctic research ship Aurora Australis,
which has been stranded in ice with a broken propeller for a week.
	   Australian Antarctic Division director Tony Press said Monday
the Shirase should reach the Aurora, which is about 85 miles (135
km) from Australia's Davis Antarctic base, in about a week.
	   However, with engineers still working on the propeller, it was
not known how much help would be needed.
	   Press said this would depend on what repairs could be made on
the spot and the state of the ice.
	   But at the least, the Shirase would probably help the ship break
through the ice into open water.
	   If the Aurora needed towing or escorting back to Hobart, another
ship would have to be found.
	   P and O, the Aurora's owner, was looking for a suitable ship for
this job, should it be necessary.
	   Press said the weather was fair and the Aurora was in no danger.
	   The Japanese government uses the Shirase for its Antarctic
program.
	   Press said the Japanese help was in the spirit of the Antarctic
Treaty, which was based on international cooperation.

Birds and bugs bedeviling games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ First it was bugs, now it's the birds.
Assorted beasties seem bent on harassing athletes at the Asian
Games.
	   The Chinese team has lodged a formal complaint that its
weightlifters were being showered by insulation foam. The culprits:
sparrows trying to build nests in the rooftop of the indoor
weightlifting arena.
	   Small pieces of foam have been falling on the exact spot where
the lifters are to compete.
	   ``The heaviest downpour is right at the center of the
competition area and we have to sweep it up every 30 minutes,'' the
Bangkok Post quoted a Thai weightlifting official as saying.
	   Col. Jakrit Intharatat, secretary-general of the Weightlifting
Association of Thailand, said the falling foam could cause serious
problems for competitors, and the International Weightlifting
Confederation might not approve the venue.
	   As officials scurried to find a solution before the start of
competition later Monday, anti-bug patrols fanned out to several
other venues to control mosquitoes and other insects.
	   The first alarm was raised when an usual number of insects were
discovered in the Asian Games swimming pool last week. Since then
there have been complaints that mosquitoes infiltrate some indoor
arenas as the sun sets.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TAIWAN'S TENPINS: With one world champion and three gold
medalists from the last games, Taiwan's bowling team is expected to
roll to victory at the 13th Asian Games.
	   The team includes Tseng Su-fen, the former women's world
champion and gold winner at the Hiroshima Asian Games four years
ago, as well as Hiroshima gold medalists Lin Han-cheng and Chou
Miao-lin.
	   Ten gold medals are at stake in the bowling competition, which
begins Wednesday. South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and
Thailand are also fielding strong squads.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CAN'T MISS BRONZE: Win some, lose some, say the Thais.
	   The hosts of the Asian Games got a guaranteed bronze medal after
Siwaporn Mayer received a first-round bye in the taekwondo
competition.
	   But her three teammates will be facing tough competitors from
South Korea, China and Taiwan when the Asian martial art event
begins Monday.
	   Meanwhile, Thailand was guaranteed not to get any medals in the
men's 4-kilometer pursuit because most of the cyclists were
declared unfit.
	   Only Panupong Maneepong and Thongchai Wankerdjai-ngarm were able
to complete the 12-lap race in training while the rest of the team
could not keep up after the halfway point, ruining the team
combination.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ECONOMY ROUTE TO GOLD: By trying to save some yen, the parents
of Naoko Takahashi set the Japanese marathon runner on the road to
a near-world record performance at the Asian Games.
	   With her parents cheering ``Gambare, gambare! (Fight hard, fight
hard!),'' Takahashi grabbed the games' first gold Sunday by winning
the women's marathon in the fifth best time ever.
	   In her early teens, when she asked her parents which school club
to join in her hometown of Gifu, they strongly suggested athletics.
	   ``They said to join the least expensive one, which was the
athletics club,'' the 26-year-old said. ``They were right.''
	   Their advice paid off as Takahashi glided into the games' main
stadium in a time of 2 hours, 21 minutes, 47 seconds _ less than a
minute off the world mark.
	   ``I could see my parents and I heard them crying out, `Gambare,
gambare.' It was wonderful,'' the petite runner said.
	   Takahashi, who runs and works for a chemical company in Nagoya,
is regarded as a top contender for the marathon crown at the 2000
Olympics.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TICKET BONANZA: Thailand, which badly needs to revive its
economy, expects to reap 200 million baht (dlrs 5.6 million) from
ticket sales at the Asian Games, the organizers said Monday.
	   It got off to a good start by collecting 63 million baht (dlrs
1.7 million) from tickets sold at the games' opening ceremony
Sunday. The 60,000-seat stadium appeared filled to capacity.
	   An official release said only a few more tickets were left for
the closing ceremony Dec. 20.

Hong Kong hopeful of breaking 12-year Asian gold medal drought
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Armed with an Olympic windsurfer and a
rising snooker star, tiny Hong Kong has its best chance in years of
breaking a 12-year drought in Asian Games gold medals.
	   The former British colony of 6.6 million people, which was
reintegrated into China last year, has won only one Asian Games
gold ever _ in bowling in 1986. At these Asian Games in Bangkok, it
could be on track for as many as five golds, Hong Kong delegation
chief Pang Chung said Monday.
	   Among Hong Kong's leading medal contenders are windsurfer Lee
Lai-shan and snooker player Marco Fu. Lee, known affectionately in
Hong Kong as ``San San,'' won in Atlanta in 1996, clinching Hong
Kong's first gold medal in 44 years of Olympic competition.
	   Fu, the 1997 ISBF World Snooker Champion, reached the final of
his first professional tournament in October. On Sunday, he beat
Taiwan's Hsia Hui-kai 5-4 to advance to the last 16 of the snooker
tournament.
	   Pang, the delegation head, said Hong Kong also has chances in
women's rowing, in the Chinese martial art of wushu and in cycling,
although he conceded that Kazakstan was also ``very strong'' in
that event.
	   He said Hong Kong's 297-member delegation was ``the biggest and
also the strongest'' the territory has ever sent to an Asian Games.
``We are a force,'' Pang said.
	   Hong Kong won 12 medals _ all silver and bronze _ at the last
Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994.
	   Despite its July 1, 1997, handover to Chinese rule, Hong Kong
still competes separately from the mainland, under the title ``Hong
Kong, China.''

Key witness raises doubts about testimony in Anwar trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By R. MAGESWARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In a startling turnaround, a key
witness whose allegations form the bulk of sex charges against
jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim, denied Monday that he was ever
sodomized by the former deputy prime minister.
	   Azizan Abu Bakar, the former driver of Anwar's wife, has for the
last week testified Anwar repeatedly forced him into sodomy, a
crime in this predominantly Muslim nation.
	   But when the trial resumed after the weekend recess, he told his
cross-examiner that he had not been sodomized.
	   Anwar is currently on trial on four counts of abuse of power. He
will be tried later on another charge of corruption and five
charges of committing illegal sex acts.
	   He has denied any wrongdoing, calling the charges part of a
high-level conspiracy to ruin his political career.
	   If the defense punches out holes in Azizan's testimony, it could
be a crushing blow for prosecutors who have based the most serious
charge of illegal sex acts mostly on Azizan's accusations.
	   Taken aback at Azizan's retraction, defense attorney Christopher
Fernando repeated his question as a hushed silence fell on the
courtroom and everyone strained to hear the answer.
	   ``I put it to you that Anwar Ibrahim did not sodomize you and
that is why you visited him between 1992 and 1997.''
	   Azizan: ``Yes.''
	   Fernando then asked the court interpreter to repeat the query in
Malay so that there was no doubt that Azizan understood and that
Judge Augustine Paul recorded the response.
	   The answer remained the same.
	   Surprisingly, Christopher did not press him with more questions
and prosecutors did not react.
	   Azizan's accusations have related to events in 1992 when he was
employed by Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail. He told the court last
week that shame and guilt kept him from making Anwar's repeated
homosexual acts public.
	   He did so when prompted in 1997 by Ummi Hafilda Ali, who herself
has separately accused Anwar of sleeping with her brother's wife.
Her brother was a former secretary of Anwar.
	   Azizan and Ummi retracted their accusations earlier, but at the
trial they said they were arrested and coerced by police, allegedly
at Anwar's behest, to sign retractions.
	   During cross-examination last week, Azizan wavered on his
testimony, prompting the defense lawyer's accusations that his
story was inconsistent and contradictory.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar on Sept. 2, saying
he had determined Anwar was morally unfit for office. The sacking
led to demands for political reforms and massive anti-government
protests in the normally placid Southeast Asian capital.

 &UR; Sutton out of Presidents Cup &QL;  Eds: UPDATES with quotes from team
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Hal Sutton has been forced to drop
out of the American team for golf's Presidents Cup this week by the
sudden death of his father-in-law, Brant Powell, from a heart
attack.
	   Presidents Cup officials said Monday at Royal Melbourne Golf
Club that Sutton will be replaced by reigning U.S. Open champion
Lee Janzen.
	   Janzen was competing in a Skins game in Taipei when he was told
he was needed for the U.S. team to play the Internationals and
arrived in Melbourne on Monday, captain Jack Nicklaus said.
	   Sutton, 40, was to have made his debut as a member of the U.S.
team this week.
	   ``All of us on the U.S. team are saddened by Hal and his
family's loss and extend our deepest sympathies,'' said Nicklaus.
	   Under the Cup's Captains Agreement, a team member may be
replaced before noon Tuesday in the event of illness or other
emergency.
	   The captain can select any eligible player to replace a player
who has withdrawn, regardless of his standing on the point or money
list, officials said.
	   Janzen finished 13th in the final U.S. team standings, making
him the next eligible player.
	   At the time that Nicklaus chose the team's captain's picks _
John Huston and Fred Couples _ there was a suggestion that he
should have taken Janzen.
	   International team captain Peter Thompson said Sutton's absence
would not weaken the U.S. team.
	   ``I don't think it will make any difference at all to the depth
of the team,'' the five-time British Open winner said. ``They have
got 20 guys they could have chosen from.''
	   Janzen, who won his second U.S. Open crown this year, is also a
first-time player in the U.S. team.
	   Sutton won seven tournaments from 1987 to 1995 and has
consistently been among the top money winners on the U.S. PGA Order
Of Merit.
	   Tim Finchem, PGA Tour Commissioner, said players on both teams
extended their sympathies to Janzen and his family.
	   ``All of us at the President's Cup will keep Hal and his family
in our thoughts throughout the week,'' he said.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Officials said Monday they were
investigating why a Philippine Airlines jet suddenly plunged 1,000
feet (300 meters) while enroute to the Philippines from Singapore,
injuring at least 11 passengers.
	   The PAL Airbus 330-300, carrying 259 passengers, was cruising at
37,000 feet (11,212 meters) Saturday when it hit turbulence two
hours after departing from Singapore, the airline said.
	   Air Transport Office chief Jacinto Ortega said he would send the
plane's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder to
Australia so experts there could study its contents.
	   Commonly known as ``black boxes,'' the gadgets record data like
aircraft altitude and speed as well as conversations between pilots
and ground air traffic controllers. The data can help indicate if
something was wrong with the plane.
	   Ortega said many of the passengers hadn't strapped their
seatbelts on when the plane apparently hit an air pocket.
	   Passengers said snacks were being served when the plane suddenly
lost altitude, tossing food trolleys, utensils, and even some
passengers into the air. Many passengers sustained cuts after being
hit by objects while others were scalded by hot coffee or tea.
	   At least one of those injured remained in a Manila hospital with
a fractured neck, Ortega said.

World's tallest telecommunications tower gets go-ahead in

other detail. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The world's tallest tower -- if you
count the communications antenna on top -- is to be built in
Melbourne, nudging out Toronto's CN Tower by just over 19 1/2 feet
(six meters).
	   The CN Tower in Toronto, Canada has laid claim to the world's
tallest structure since it was built in 1976 and stands at 1,815
feet (553.3 meters), including its communications antenna.
	   But under international rules measuring buildings, antennas do
not count toward the height of the building.
	   Purists who spurn antennae on their skyscrapers consider the
1,483-foot (452-meter) Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, completed
in 1996, the world's tallest building.
	   Chicago's Sears Tower, at 1,450 feet (442 meters), held the
title from 1973 until 1996.
	   Victorian state Premier Jeff Kennett announced Monday that the
Grollo tower concept had won the bid for the Docklands site on
Melbourne's western fringe.
	   He said the Grollo Group had four months to prove its financial
capacity and to satisfy conditions set by the Docklands Authority.
	   The 1,837-foot (560-meter) obelisk, estimated to cost up to 1.5
billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 93 million), will include 120
floors of apartments, a luxury hotel and offices.
	   Even though its main structure -- solar power collectors and
mechanical rooms -- would stop at the 1,640-foot (500-meter) level,
that would be higher than the Petronas Towers.
	   As tall as it may be, Grollo's obelisk will not be the most
imaginative edifice ever considered for Melbourne.
	   A developer once proposed a huge kangaroo-shaped building, which
would have included a helicopter landing pad in the pouch area of
the 'roo.

Falcons rally to win their sixth straight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs and UPDATES with late games &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Chris Chandler, sidelined last week with a
sprained right ankle, ran for one touchdown and threw for two more
as the Falcons rallied from 14 points down to win their sixth
straight game, 28-21 over the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday.
	   Chandler shook off five sacks to complete 20-of-28 for 297
yards, his best game in two years with Atlanta. The NFC
West-leading Falcons (11-2), who trailed 14-0 and 21-7, went ahead
by scoring three touchdowns in just over a three-minute span at the
end of the first half and beginning the second.
	   Atlanta's Jamal Anderson rushed for 122 yards on 30 carries and
Tony Martin caught seven passes for 140 yards, including a 40-yard
touchdown in the first half. Peyton Manning was 19-of-27 for 159
yards and a touchdown for the Colts (2-11).
	   In Landover Maryland, Trent Green found Leslie Shepherd wide
open in the right corner of the end zone for the winning 20-yard
touchdown with 1:54 left to carry the Redskins over the Chargers,
24-20.
	   The catch was set up by an 18-yard pass to Chris Thomas and a
17-yard punt return by Brian Mitchell, who also ran back a kickoff
101 yards for a touchdown in the first half.
	   The Redskins (4-9), winning back-to-back games for the first
time this season, are 4-2 since starting 0-7 and have never lost to
the Chargers (5-8) in six meetings. Terrell Fletcher ran for a
career-high 122 yards, and threw an awkward touchdown pass on a
halfback option for the Chargers.
	   In Cincinnati, Doug Flutie and Eric Moulds hooked up on a
70-yard touchdown that changed momentum late in the first half,
then put Buffalo in control with a 30-yard TD connection early in
the fourth quarter to beat the Bengals, 33-20.
	   The Bills (8-5) got their eighth win in 10 games and remained in
the thick of the American Football Conference East race by picking
apart the NFL's lowest-rated defense in front of thousands of
disgruntled fans.
	   The Bengals (2-11) lost their eighth in a row, their longest
losing streak since 1994. Flutie completed 18-of-30 for 319 yards _
his second straight 300-yard game _ but was intercepted a
season-high three times.
	   In New Orleans, Kerry Collins threw touchdown passes of 4 and 89
yards, and the Saints held Dallas to 182 yards, winning 22-3.
	   The victory kept the Saints (6-7), who lost seven of their
previous nine game, alive in the National Footbalk Conference
playoff race. The loss prevented the Cowboys (8-5) from clinching a
playoff berth.
	   Troy Aikman passed for only 192 yards and was sacked twice by
the Saints. Emmitt Smith was held to six yards on 15 carries.
	   In Jacksonville, Florida, Jamie Martin, who entered the game
after Mark Brunell was injured on the second play, threw a 67-yard
touchdown pass on his second attempt and finished with 228 yards to
lead Jacksonville over Detroit, 37-22.
	   Fred Taylor ran for a team-record 183 yards to surpass the
1,000-yard mark as the Jaguars (10-3) all but clinched a playoff
spot and moved three games ahead of the Pittsburgh Steelers in the
AFC Central.
	   Barry Sanders gained 102 yards for the Lions (5-8), but Detroit
had its three-game winning streak halted along with almost any hope
of a sneaking into the playoffs.
	   In Pittsburgh, Drew Bledsoe, playing in pain, threw an 86-yard
TD pass to Terry Glenn, who finished with a team-record 193
receiving yards for New England as the Patriots beat the Steelers,
23-9.
	   Bledsoe, who led the Patriots to last-second victories the
previous two weeks despite a broken index finger on his throwing
hand, was 21-of-34 for 327 yards and overcame three interceptions
that had backup Scott Zolak warming up late in the third quarter.
	   Bledsoe shook his finger in pain after nearly every pass, but
still managed to lead the Patriots (8-5) to their first win in
Pittsburgh since 1986. The Steelers (7-6) are in danger of missing
the playoffs for the first time in Bill Cowher's seven seasons as
coach.
	   In Charlotte, North Carolina, six days after losing tackle
Bryant Young for the season with a broken leg, San Francisco blew a
21-point lead in the final 16 minutes of regulation before
defeating Carolina in overtime, 31-28.
	   A Carolina fumble set up Wade Richey's 23-yard field goal on San
Francisco's first possession of the extra period, securing a
victory that assures the 49ers of at least a wild-card berth in the
playoffs.
	   The 49ers (10-3) finished with 236 yards rushing, the most
allowed by Carolina (2-11) in its nearly four-year history. Steve
Young threw for 213 yards and two touchdowns and Garrison Hearst
rushed for 139 yards and a score as the 49ers extended their NFL
record of consecutive 10-victory seasons to 16.
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Vinny Testaverde passed for 418
yards and two TDs and ran for the winning score on a disputed
fourth-down play with 20 seconds left as the Jets beat the
Seahawks, 32-31.
	   Although replays showed Testaverde didn't reach the end zone, a
touchdown was signaled after a long delay, giving the Jets (9-4)
their sixth straight home victory and keeping them atop the AFC
East.
	   Testaverde passed a career-high 63 times and completed 42. The
AFC's top-rated passer found Keyshawn Johnson nine times for 114
yards and the touchdown that closed the Jets to 31-26. The loss all
but eliminated Seattle (6-7) from playoff contention.
 &UR; Vikings 48, Bears 22 &QC; 
	   In Minneapolis, with a pregame injury sending Cris Carter to the
sidelines to join three other ailing offensive starters, Randall
Cunningham threw three touchdown passes to Randy Moss for the
second straight game as Minnesota clinched its first NFC Central
title since 1994.
	   The Vikings (12-1) outgained the Bears 341-14 on the way to a
27-0 halftime lead, guaranteeing themselves a first-round playoff
bye, the first time they have earned that during coach Dennis
Green's seven seasons.
	   Moss, the electrifying rookie who burned Dallas for 163 yards
and three TDs on Thanksgiving, caught scoring passes of 6, 3 and 34
yards against the overmatched Bears (3-10), who lost their fifth
straight.
 &UR; Giants 23, Cardinals 19
	   In Tempe, Arizona, Charles Way scored the go-ahead touchdown in
the third quarter and Brad Daluiso kicked three field goals as the
New York Giants damaged Arizona's playoff hopes.
	   The Giants (5-8), who had lost four of their previous five
games, beat the Cardinals (6-7) for the fourth straight time and
seventh time in their last eight meetings.
	   The loss dropped Arizona into a tie with New Orleans in the race
for the final NFC wild-card spot. The Cardinals have never made the
playoffs since moving to Arizona prior to the 1988 season.
 &UR; Broncos 35, Chiefs 31 &QC; 
	   In Denver, John Elway drove his team to two touchdowns in the
final 6:48, rallying the unbeaten Broncos to a victory over the
Kansas City Chiefs.
	   Denver, which overcame deficits of 14-0, 21-7 and 31-21, became
only the third 13-0 team in NFL history, joining the 1934 Chicago
Bears and 1972 Miami Dolphins. The Broncos clinched a first-round
bye and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.
	   Elway completed 22 of 32 passes for 400 yards and two scores,
including the game-winner _ a 24-yard pass to tight end Shannon
Sharpe with 3:34 remaining. Rich Gannon threw three TD passes for
the Chiefs (5-8).
 &UR; Dolphins 27, Raiders 17 &QC; 
	   In Oakland, California, linebackers Zach Thomas and Robert Jones
returned interceptions for scores and Miami turned four first-half
turnovers into 24 points to remain tied for the AFC East lead.
	   Thomas and Jones each had another interception in the second
half and the Dolphins had a team record-tying six overall, raising
their NFL-leading total to 26 this season. Miami also sacked Donald
Hollas eight times.
	   Dan Marino had a 19-yard scoring pass to Oronde Gadsden and
Olindo Mare kicked field goals of 47 and 25 yards for the Dolphins
(9-4). The Raiders (7-6) have lost four of their last five games.
 &UR; Oilers 16, Ravens 14 &QC; 
	   In Nashville, Tennessee, Al Del Greco kicked three field goals,
including two 48-yarders, as Tennessee broke a two-game losing
skid.
	   The Oilers (7-6) had to hold off one last comeback bid by
Baltimore's Jim Harbaugh. He moved the Ravens (5-8) 80 yards and
hit Floyd Turner with a 20-yard touchdown pass with 1:46 left to
make it 16-14.
	   The Ravens forced Tennessee to punt, and Harbaugh got the ball
back with 1:18 to go. Two plays later, Harbaugh's pass was tipped
by rookie Samari Rolle and intercepted by Steve Jackson to seal the
victory.

Ruling party leads Chiapas legislative vote
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS and UPDATES with PRI appearing to lead in vote count &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEJANDRO RUIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN PEDRO CHENALHO, Mexico (AP) _ Mexico's ruling party appeared
to lead state congressional elections held Sunday in Chiapas to
make up for voting that was canceled in October due to flood
damage.
	   With nearly 20 percent of voting stations reporting, the
Institutional Revolutionary Party was leading in the four
congressional districts, the Chiapas Electoral Council said.
	   Individual district tallies were not available and there were no
preliminary results for nine county mayor races.
	   Final results were expected Tuesday.
	   Voter turnout appeared to have been light. The rural towns where
the make-up vote was held were largely empty since most people had
gone into the countryside to harvest their corn crops, elections
officials in San Pedro Chenalho said.
	   Chiapas suffered severe flooding in September, wiping out some
elections records and forcing residents to focus attention on
clearing roads and rebuilding their homes.
	   The ruling party, known by its Spanish initials PRI, did well in
the Oct. 4 vote, winning in most of Chiapas' 111 counties and
recovering some seats that it had lost three years earlier.
However, the conservative National Action Party retained control of
the state capital, Tuxtla Gutierrez.
	   Because flooding had prevented the vote in eight counties _ and
residents in San Juan Chamula county boycotted the election _
voters could not elect enough representatives to form a quorum on
the state's 40-seat legislature.
	   On Sunday, between 40 and 50 supporters of the leftist Zapatista
rebels blocked a road in Aldama, 90 miles (145 kms) northeast of
San Cristobal de las Casas, to discourage people from voting, local
election officials reported. The protesters dispersed as soon as
police arrived.
	   The leftist Zapatista rebels rose up briefly in Chiapas state in
1994 to demand greater democracy and rights for impoverished Indian
communities. Scores of people have been killed since in political
disputes. The Zapatistas have retreated to northern jungles.
	   In San Pedro Chenalho, a handful of Chiapans wearing locally
made wool jackets in the chilly morning, with temperatures about 46
F (8 C), headed toward two voting booths set up in the central
plaza.
	   The mayor of San Juan Chamula county, Florencio Collaso Gomez,
said there was no reason to worry about the low turnout. Voters had
held a plebiscite in June naming Pascual Diaz of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party as the next mayor and Sunday's
vote was certain to make that vote official, Collaso said.

Report: Acid rain spreads to 40 percent of China, costs heavy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's rapid economic growth and heavy reliance
on coal have spread acid rain damage to 40 percent of the country,
an official newspaper reported Monday.
	   China depends on coal for 75 percent of its energy, and coal use
has doubled during breakneck growth over the past two decades of
economic reforms.
	   Acid rain is formed when fossil fuels such as coal are burned
and oxides of sulfur and nitrogen are emitted into the atmosphere.
	   A new report by Chinese scientists shows areas affected by acid
rain deposition have grown steadily _ from 18 percent of China's
land area in 1985 to 29 percent in 1993 and 40 percent now _ and is
expected to increase for another two decades, the China Daily
reported.
	   China emitted 23.5 million tons of sulphur dioxide, the main
source of acid rain, in 1997, a 30 percent increase from 18 million
tons in 1993, the report said.
	   A vast region south of the Yangtze River has become the largest
single area in the world affected by acid rain, and China now ranks
third, after Europe and North America, in acid rain pollution, the
report said.
	   Acid rain has in recent years moved to the north, an area once
thought protected by its low rainfall, dry climate and soil
alkalinity, the newspaper reported.
	   In two decades most northern Chinese forests _ already depleted
from unbridled logging _ will be seriously affected, the newspaper
quoted Wang Yanhui of the Chinese Academy of Forestry as saying.
	   Emissions from coal burning can stay in the atmosphere for
several days and travel long distances before falling back to the
Earth's surface. Japan and South Korea have in the past complained
to Beijing of acid rain caused by pollution from China.
	   Based on investigations earlier in the 1990s, the Chinese
scientists estimated that the damage to the environment was greater
than direct economic losses in timber and crops.
	   Loss of forests in Zhejiang, the province with the heaviest acid
rain damage, results in economic losses of 210 million yuan (dlrs
25 million) each year.
	   But the scientists put the overall ecological loss at 1.9
billion yuan (nearly 230 million). The newspaper did not say how
the latter figure was calculated.

Thomson vows International team will be ready

	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ At golf's Presidents Cup in 1996,
the United States got off to such a flying start on the opening day
that the International team appeared it would never be in
contention.
	   The Americans won all five four-ball events and three of the
foursomes while taking a 7 1-2-to-2 1-2 lead in points on the
Friday.
	   Despite winning seven of the 10 matches on Saturday, the
International team lost by one point overall when the 12 crucial
singles matches were split on Sunday.
	   When play begins in this year's competition on Friday at Royal
Melbourne, International team captain Peter Thomson, a five-time
British Open winner, vows his team will be ready to wipe out that
first-day memory from 1996.
	   ``Although the singles decided it, the United States really
jumped out of the box before we were quite ready,'' Thomson said
Monday. ``This time, I'll have the guys alert and ready to go from
the start.''
	   Thomson said his International team, which includes Greg Norman,
Nick Price of Zimbabwe, who beat Tiger Woods in a playoff at the
Sun City Challenge in South Africa on the weekend, and 1998 U.S.
PGA champion Vijay Singh of Fiji, will meet on Tuesday morning to
discuss strategy and team pairings.
	   ``The players themselves will have a say in team makeup,''
Thomson said. ``That's how we did it two years ago, and that's how
we'll do it again.
	   ``I don't really tell them what to do _ they're all captains in
their own right, and it would be silly for me to think otherwise.''
	   The American team had a late withdrawal when Hal Sutton had to
cancel plans to play due to the death of his father-in-law. He was
replaced by U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen, the next-highest player
on the U.S. rankings.
	   U.S. team captain Jack Nicklaus arrived into Melbourne on Sunday
night and had some business commitments in the city on Monday.
Davis Love III and John Huston spent some time on the practice
range while Fred Couples took the day off after playing, along with
Huston, at the Australian Open in Adelaide.
	   Thomson said there was a good chance that Norman and Steve
Elkington would play as a team. They won the Shark Shootout
together last month in the United States.
	   ``It's certainly possible that they'll play together, but it's
not automatic,'' said Thomson.
	   He said he didn't think the International team had any special
advantage with the tournament being held outside the United States
for the first time.
	   ``These players are all professional, they play around the
world, and one golf course is like another,'' said Thomson. ``I
wouldn't think there is the slightest disadvantage to them playing
here.''
	   He also said he felt Australian spectators at Royal Melbourne
wouldn't be overly supportive of the International side.
	   ``Golf fans here appreciate good players,'' said Thomson, ``I
don't think there will be any of that partisanship. I haven't seen
it before, I don't think I'll see it now.'' (djp)

Japanese icebreaker to aid stranded Australian Antarctic ship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ A Japanese icebreaker is going to the
aid of the Australian Antarctic research ship Aurora Australis,
which has been stranded in ice for a week with a broken propeller.
	   Australian Antarctic Division director Tony Press said Monday
the Shirase should reach the Aurora, which is about 85 miles (135
km) from Australia's Davis Antarctic base, in about a week.
	   However, with engineers still working on the propeller, it was
not known how much help would be needed.
	   Press said it would depend on what repairs could be made on the
spot and the state of the ice.
	   He also said the weather was fair and the Aurora was in no
danger.
	   The Japanese government uses the Shirase for its Antarctic
program.
	   Press said the Japanese help was in the spirit of the Antarctic
Treaty, which was based on international cooperation.
