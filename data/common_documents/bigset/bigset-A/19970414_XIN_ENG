<HEADLINE> Iran Claims 10-Billion-Dollar Compensation from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian official today urged
the government to speed up the procedure for claiming 18.3 billion
Deutsche marks (10.6 billion U.S. dollars) from Germany for
damages incurred to a submarine contract and suspension of a
nuclear power plant in southern port city of Bushehr.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Rowhani, First Vice-Speaker of the Parliament, today
also called on the government to fully revise Tehran's relations
with Bonn at the open session of the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Iran ordered two 1,200-megawatt units from the West German
firm of Kraftwerk Union in mid 1970s. The twin generating units,
named "Iran No. 1" and "Iran No. 2", were sited at Halileh, a
village 12 kilometers southeast of Bushehr.
</P>
<P>
Germany suspended the project during the eight-year Iran-Iraq
war (1980-1988) and refused to complete the project after the
Islamic revolution in 1979, under the pressure from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Russia has taken over the deal after it signed a
1-billion-dollar contract with Iran in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Iran's claim for compensation
indicates the escalation of the diplomatic battle between Bonn
and Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have already recalled their ambassadors and
expelled four diplomats from each other shortly after the
Thursday's verdict of the Berlin court charging top Iranian
leaders with ordering the killing of four Kurdish opposition
leaders in a Berlin restaurant in 1992.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran's official news agency IRNA did not specify
whether the Iranian government will downgrade or sever the
diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Some Iranian parliament members have already urged the
government to break up the diplomatic and economic ties with
Bonn in a protest against the court verdict.
</P>
<P>
Rowhani, who is also secretary of the Supreme National
Security Council, requested the judiciary to speed up legal
action against the German firms, which supplied Iraq with
long-range missiles and chemical arms during the Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
He said that the parliament would follow reassessment of
relations between Iran and Bonn through its special commission on
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
The official also criticized the European Union for recalling
their ambassadors, threatening that "Iran will reciprocate."
</P>
<P>
He said the government's decision to suspend Iranian
contracts with New Zealand as well as a visit to Tehran by an
Australian delegation was "a timely act."
</P>
<P>
Rowhani warned that Iran would take into consideration the
moves of the EU members and would adopt necessary decisions to
deal with them.
</P>
<P>
"we should remind the European states that gone is
the time for imposing unilateral views and expectations on
others in international relations and that the European states
that have turned into safe havens for terrorists could not claim
to be observing international law," he said.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Gulf War Victims to Get Compensations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 23,000 Egyptians will
begin receiving on May 3 the first of six installments of U.N. Gulf
War compensation totaling 823 million U.S. dollars, the Egyptian
MENA news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Names of those eligible to receive the checks will be
announced following the Bairam feast holidays, MENA quoted an
official at the Labor and Immigration Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
A total of 30,000 Egyptians filed demands claiming compensation
for their departure from Kuwait or Iraq because of the Gulf War,
but 7,000 applications were turned down.
</P>
<P>
The first installment will total 58.3 million dollars, meaning each
person will be receiving between 2,500 and 8,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
On March 19, a U.N. commission handed over 144 million dollars to
63 governments and an international organization which in turn will
distribute the money to nearly 60,000 people affected by Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The funds were made available by an oil-for-food deal signed
last May between Iraq and the U.N. enabling Baghdad to sell 2
billion dollars worth of oil over six months to raise money for
food, medicine and compensation funds.

<HEADLINE> Former Algerian President Appeals for Talks in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Former Algerian President Ahmed Ben
Bella today appealed for talks between the Algerian government and
all oppositions, including the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front
(FIS), reported the Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
In an interview with AFP in Madrid, where he was attending a
non-governmental conference on Algeria, Ben Bella said that
"violence has never been as strong as today" in his country.
</P>
<P>
"The new elections, such as the next legislative elections,
will not solve any problem," said the former president, who
served as Algeria's first head of state after the country won its
independence in 1962 from France.
</P>
<P>
Ben Bella also called for isolation of "extremists in both
camps," and called on Algerian government to launch a "real
dialogue" with all the components of the country's opposition,
including the FIS.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no solution without the participation of FIS
which is a strong party and represents 25-30 percent, if not 40
percent, of the population," he said.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 60,000 to 80,000 people have been killed in
Algeria in the war between Islamic militants and the Algerian
security forces and their militia allies since 1992.

<P>
PARIS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of interns, externs,
private doctors and insurance workers demonstrated today in Paris
to protest government budgetary cut in social security programs
and call for protection of "quality medical treatment."
</P>
<P>
Police said 8,600 took part in the demonstration, while the
organizers claimed 60,000, in the fifth demonstration staged by
the interns and private doctors since they began a strike nearly
five weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The protesters took the Hippocrate Oath at the Bastille Square
to show their belief in professional quality of medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
The protest was triggered by a government plan to establish a
convention for all hospitals and private doctors which will punish
those who over-spend.
</P>
<P>
The interns said that although they don't oppose medical
budgetary reform, they think that the measure would restrict
doctors' professional practice to provide quality treatment for
their patients.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese President Returns Home After Visiting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar
al-Bashir returned home this morning after a three-day visit to
Libya.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese president went to Libya last Friday across
Tunisia without previous declaration by both Sudan and Libya,
with the aim of getting Libyan support for the Sudanese
government in the face of internal conflict in Sudan, a
reliable source here said.
</P>
<P>
Libyan leaders failed to express their view on the
developments in Sudan during the visit by Sudanese First
Vice-President Al-Zubeir Mohammed Saleh to Libya in February.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese rebels have been fighting against government troops
since 1983 for more autonomy in the south.
</P>
<P>
Libya coordinated attitudes with Egypt and considered the
conflict in Sudan an internal affair, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Libya had attempted to act as a mediator between Sudan and
Uganda, and Sudan and Egypt. But it failed to bring foreign
ministers of the three countries together during the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) ministerial meeting in Tripoli, the
capital of Libya, last month.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese media made no mention of the outcome of President
al-Bashir's visit to Libya. Diplomatic sources here speculated
that the talks between the Sudanese and Libyan leaders focused on
bilateral cooperation and issues of mutual concern, including ways
of improving bilateral relations.

<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir
has held talks with Ugandan Foreign Minister Eriya Kategaya on
ways of settling the Sudan-Uganda border dispute and normalizing
bilateral ties during his recent visit to Libya, the Libyan news
agency (JANA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report, monitored here, said that during Sunday's talks
initiated by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, the Sudanese president
affirmed that Sudan was willing to settle its differences with
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
On his part, the Ugandan foreign minister stressed Uganda's
willingness to react positively with this initiative for
stabilizing its relations with Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Libyan General People's Commission for Foreign
Liaison and International Cooperation Omer el-Montasser and
Sudanese Foreign Minister Ali Osman Taha also attended the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The agency added that Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who
failed to attend the talks, had a telephone conversation with
Gaddafi, during which the two leaders held consultations on ways
of settling border dispute in central and east Africa through
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Omer el-Montasser held talks in Tripoli, the
capital of Libya, with foreign ministers of Sudan and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, he told reporters that the two sides
agreed on foundations for settling the dispute between them,
and that positive steps would be taken in the days to come for a
solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
The Khartoum government repelled an armed attack launched
by the Sudanese opposition forces in eastern and southern Sudan
in mid-January this year. Sudan accused a number of neighboring
states of supporting these forces, but this accusation was denied
by its neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Bhutanese Refugees in Nepal Urge U.N. Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 14 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 Bhutanese
refugees gathered at a mass rally in an eastern Nepali town today
to call for U.N. intervention in the Bhutanese refugee issue in
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The mass rally came after a procession around the town of
Damak, about 200 kilometers from here, with slogans calling for
U.N. intervention.
</P>
<P>
They also demanded that the Nepali government solve the refugee
problem or internationalize it.
</P>
<P>
The Bhutanese refugees at the rally shouted slogans urging
India to stop supporting Bhutan in crushing the refugee movement
for free repatriation.
</P>
<P>
The Bhutanese refugee organization, the Appeal Movement
Coordination Committee (AMCC), on the occasion declared the end of
a relay hunger strike by refugees as the 53rd session of the U.N.
Commission on Human Rights in Geneva approaches its end.
</P>
<P>
The 28-day-long relay hunger strike, launched by the AMCC last
month in a bid to call for a U.N. solution of the Bhutanese
refugee issue, had been participated by more than 15,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
Lashing out at India's role in deporting Bhutanese refugees to
Nepal by force, an AMCC official told the mass rally that the U.N.
reluctance to see the urgency of the Bhutanese refugee problem in
Nepal will be tantamount to encouraging violence.
</P>
<P>
Around 100,000 Bhutanese refugees, mostly of Nepalese origin,
have been living in various refugee camps in East Nepal since
1990.

BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian said here today the current visit of the Russian Minister
of National Defense Igor Nikolayevich Rodionov to China is
conducive to maintaining and developing the friendship between the
armed forces of the two countries, and to the all-round growth
of bilateral ties as well.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission
and a state councillor, made the remark during talks with
Rodionov, who arrived in Beijing Monday evening at Chi's
invitation.
</P>
<P>
Chi said the growth of the Sino-Russian relations is "in the
fundamental interests of the people of both countries," and is
also "conducive to peace, stability, and development of the
Asia-Pacific and the world as a whole."
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to usher in the 21st century together with the
Russian friends and act in accordance with the Five Principles of
Peaceful Coexistence, to enable our two countries to become good
neighbors, good partners, and good friends forever and to push
forward the strategic cooperative partnership between our two
countries," Chi said.
</P>
<P>
With the growth of the friendship between the two nations,
the Chinese defense minister said, the ties between their armed
forces is developing steadily.
</P>
<P>
He said in recent years, the two sides have made friendly
exchanges at various levels and in various areas. Senior officials
of the armies of the two countries have maintained friendly
contacts, and fruitful cooperation has been conducted in many
specialized areas, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chi expressed the hope that the armed forces of China and
Russia would maintain the momentum of high-level exchanges, and
step up military cooperation in various fields so as to further
the friendship between them.
</P>
<P>
Chi also briefed the Russian visitors on the building of
China's armed forces and its defense-oriented defense policy.
</P>
<P>
Rodionov, who is on his first trip to China as minister of
national defense, said the mutual trust between China and Russia
established through dialogue has set a good example for the rest
of the world to follow.
</P>
<P>
The establishment and advancement of their strategic
cooperative partnership that caters to the needs of the 21st
century entirely complies to the interests of the two countries
and two peoples, and is also conducive to the stability and peace
of the Asia-Pacific region and the world, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Rodionov spoke highly of the smooth growth of the friendly
cooperation between the armed forces of the two countries. This
mutually beneficial cooperation is not directed at a third nation,
he said, adding that it will help increase the understanding and
trust between the two countries and two peoples and enhance the
regional and global peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Chi presided over a ceremony to welcome Rodionov this morning,
and hosted a dinner in the Russian defense minister's honor this
evening.

LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Liz McColgan said on
Monday she would run the 10,000 meters race rather than the
marathon at the world championships in Athens in August.
</P>
<P>
McColgan, 10,000 meters winner of the 1991 world championships,
was beaten in a sprint finish to the London marathon Sunday by
Kenya's Joyce Chepchumba.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old runner was quoted as saying that the hot
conditions in Athens could preclude a fast time in the marathon
and her next race over the distance would be in either October or
November.

<HEADLINE> Importance of Agricultural Industrialization Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural industrialization, a
creation of farmers, is the basis for modernizing agriculture and
should get more attention from the government, said a senior
official during an inspection in east China's Jiangsu province
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The key to agricultural industrialization is to bring
agro-products into the market and make farmers become the main
force in the market, said Li Tieying, member of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
(CPC) and state councillor.
</P>
<P>
"We must encourage the farmer to enter the market in order to
push forward the pace of agro-industrialization," Li said, adding
that the idea of the market should be introduced to rural
households so that farmers could be closely connected with the
changing market.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the central government has always attached great
importance to agro-industrialization. The central agriculture
working conference held last year has mapped out plans to promote
agro-industrialization. The plan is being carried out smoothly
throughout the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li urged provinces known as agro-giants in the country to make
the breakthrough in developing agriculture and enhancing growth of
the rural economy. He said that agro-industrialization should be
outlined in local five-year plans (1996-2000) as a strategy of
stimulating development of local economy.

BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Hong Kong and
Macao Affairs Office of China's State Council on Sunday explained
in detail the policies regarding nationalities and the right of
abode of Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
He said that the policies dealing with the questions of
nationality and the right of abode of Hong Kong residents after
July 1 were welcomed by the majority of Hong Kong people, after
Wang Fengchao, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office of the State Council, covered the issues in a recent talk
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
However, some Hong Kong people have asked for clarifications on
some points, which were answered at length here today by the
office.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that on July 1, China's Nationality Law and
the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
will go into effect in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC) gave an account of issues related to the
implementation of China's Nationality Law in Hong Kong last May,
and afterwards, the preparatory Committee of the HKSAR of the NPC
put forward specific suggestions on the implementation of Article
24 of the Basic Law, which deals with Hong Kong residents' right
of abode.
</P>
<P>
These activities have laid a foundation for the HKSAR
government to formulate ordinances for entering and leaving Hong
Kong, he said.

his World Boxing Council junior featherweight title Monday in
Osaka with a unanimous 12-round decision over challenger Joichiro

match in Yokohama near Tokyo on March 1996, Zaragoza stopped
Tatsuyoshi in the 11th round.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Zaragoza collected a total of 55 victories,
including 27 knockouts, against seven defeats and three

According to the NPC Standing Committee's explanation of
China's Nationality Law, all Hong Kong residents of Chinese
descent, or those who are born in the Chinese territory, including
Hong Kong, and all other people who have Chinese nationality
status under the requirements of China's Nationality Law, are
Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
If those who have acquired the right of abode in foreign
countries do not report their foreign nationality, they can travel
to other countries and regions with certificates issued by foreign
governments, but they cannot be under the protection of foreign
consulates in the HKSAR and other regions in China.
</P>
<P>
If these people want to reside in Hong Kong as foreign
residents, they may change their nationality at the Immigration
Department of the SAR by showing valid documents. They will no
longer have Chinese nationality after they obtain the approval to
change citizenship.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that this rule will meet the aspiration of
the broad masses of Hong Kong compatriots to regard themselves as
Chinese, and at the same time, give them the opportunity to choose
any citizenship they prefer while living in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese citizens will acquire the right to live in Hong
Kong according to the stipulations of the Basic Law concerning the
requirements for Chinese, the spokesman said. The non-Chinese
citizens, including those who have obtained approval to change
their nationality, will be granted the right of abode in Hong Kong
according to the stipulations of the Basic Law concerning the
requirements for the non-Chinese citizens, he said.

<P>
The spokesman listed six categories of permanent Hong Kong
residents who can enjoy the right of abode in Hong Kong.

relations, and is willing to push bilateral ties up to a new level
through concerted efforts.
</P>
<P>
During talks with visiting Mauritian Prime Minister Navin
Ramgoolam, Li spoke highly of friendship between the two
countries, saying they have established sound co-operative ties in
various fields.
</P>
<P>
It is of great significance that Ramgoolam chose to visit China
at a time when the two countries are celebrating the 25th
anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between
them, Li said, expressing the conviction the visit will further
reinforce the bilateral relationship.
</P>
<P>
Ramgoolam said that 25 years ago, his father, as then prime
minister of Mauritius, forged diplomatic ties with China, and he
himself chose to visit China on this special occasion to show
Mauritius' stress on its relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Mauritius will continue the "one China" policy it has always
been pursuing over the past 25 years, Ramgoolam said, adding that
friendly co-operation between the two nations has been fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Li agreed that since the establishment of diplomatic ties, the
two nations have carried out fruitful economic and trade
co-operation, demonstrating the spirit of "south-south"
co-operation.
</P>
<P>
As a developing country, the Premier noted, China is willing to
continue its economic and trade co-operation with Mauritius
by various means, based on the principle of equality and
mutual-benefit, seeking practical results and common development.
</P>
<P>
Ramgoolam said that as an island country and a free port,
Mauritius, enjoying geographic advantages, is willing to serve as
a bridge between east Asia and Africa. Mauritius and China have
good economic and trade co-operative relations, he noted,
expressing the hope such co-operation will be strengthened. He
also invited China to take part in a series of important projects
Mauritius is planning for development.

1. A Chinese citizen born in Hong Kong either before or after
the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR has the right of abode in
the region if the child's father or mother had settled in Hong
Kong at the time of or after the child's birth.
</P>
<P>
If only his father is settled in Hong Kong, the child must have
been born to a married couple or have obtained legitimate legal
status.
</P>
<P>
A newborn of Chinese descent who has been abandoned in Hong
Kong, with no evidence to the contrary, can be regarded as a child
born to a married Chinese citizen who has settled in Hong Kong,
and thus has the right of abode in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman explained that the term "settled" can be applied
to anyone who ordinarily resides in Hong Kong and is subject to no
restrictions in terms of duration of residency.
</P>
<P>
2. Chinese citizens who have maintained ordinary residency in
Hong Kong for a continuous period of more than seven years before
or after the establishment of the HKSAR have the right of abode in
Hong Kong. The designated timeframe refers to any continuous
period of seven years before or after the establishment of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the term "ordinary residency," the spokesman
pointed out that if a Hong Kong resident studies or is dispatched
to work outside Hong Kong for a period of time, this time should
be figured into the period of "ordinary residency."
</P>
<P>
But people living in Hong Kong under other circumstances, such
as illegal immigrants, people in prison or those who are being
detained in Hong Kong, foreign laborers or household employees of
foreign nationality, do not have "ordinary residency" status.

The Basic Law grants foreign nationals the right of abode in
Hong Kong, under the prerequisite that they have ordinarily
resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of not less than
seven years, and also claim that they will live there permanently.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is necessary to stipulate that those permanent
Hong Kong residents of non-Chinese nationals, if not residing in
the HKSAR for a continuous period of 36 months at any time, will
lose their status as permanent residents. Exceptions are made for
anyone who has the right of abode only in Hong Kong, or who has
acceptable reasons (such as studying or being sent to work outside
Hong Kong), to stay outside Hong Kong temporarily, while
maintaining a close tie with the region.
</P>
<P>
If anyone with the right of abode only in Hong Kong obtains the
right of abode in another country or region after having obtained
the status of permanent Hong Kong resident, he or she will also
lose the status of permanent Hong Kong resident if he or she does
not reside in the Hong Kong SAR for a continuous period of 36
months at any time after having obtained the right of abode in
another country or region.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also presented an outline for the transitional
arrangements for those who have permanent Hong Kong identity cards
before June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that the following people will remain permanent
residents of the HKSAR:
</P>
<P>
-- The Chinese nationals with the status of permanent Hong Kong
residents before the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR, including
those who have moved overseas, but return to and are settled in
Hong Kong after July 1, 1997, while having not applied for foreign
nationality status.
</P>
<P>
-- The non-Chinese nationals with the status of permanent Hong
Kong residents before the establishment of the HKSAR. They can
still be permanent Hong Kong residents so long as they have been
settled in Hong Kong or returned to and been settled in the region
just before June 30, 1997; or they return to and settle down in
Hong Kong within 18 months after July 1, 1997; or they have been
away from Hong Kong only for a successive period of not more than
36 months just before they return and are settled there.

Referring to the settlement in Hong Kong on July 1, 1997,
mentioned in the transitional arrangements, the spokesman said
people are responsible for convincing the Immigration Department
that they have settled in Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, but they do
not have to be in Hong Kong on that day.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also pledged that the right of entry into Hong
Kong will be granted to those non-Chinese nationals who lose the
status of permanent Hong Kong residents due to the above
stipulations and transitional arrangements, in order not to
influence their life and work in Hong Kong. They will be free to
enter and leave Hong Kong, and live and work in the region without
restrictions, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said the issues of nationalities and the right of abode of
the Hong Kong residents concern the practical interests of
everyone in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Since there are basic laws and policies in this regard, he said
he hopes that the Hong Kong SAR government will work out the
specific stipulations as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said the Chinese government has always
solicited opinions from the British side while drawing up the
policy on the right of abode of the Hong Kong residents, and still
welcomes the British side to offer its opinions.

6. The people other than those listed in Article 1 to 5, who

</P>
<P>
The person should be responsible for presenting evidence that
corroborates his or her statement, if he or she is believed to
have the right of abode in another country or region.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the conditions that would result in a person losing
the right of abode in Hong Kong, the spokesman said that according
to the Basic Law of the HKSAR, the permanent residents in the
HKSAR include people either with or without Chinese nationality.
</P>
<P>
After they have obtained the right of abode in Hong Kong,
Chinese citizens shall not lose the right unless they change their
nationality.
</P>
<P>
If they change the nationality, they will be subject to Item
(4) of Clause 2 of Article 24, under which they will lose the
right of abode in Hong Kong if they have not lived in the HKSAR
for a continuous period of seven years immediately before they

<HEADLINE> Arafat Visits Cairo for Talks with Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat arrived here at noon today for talks
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak after the European and
U.S. mediation efforts failed to yield a breakthrough in the
stalemate peace process.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Arafat said he will discuss with Mubarak how
to protect the Middle East peace process from collapse. Besides,
they will also tackle economic and financial problems and the
Israeli closure on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"We will discuss how to prevent Israel's continued attempts to
violate agreements signed in both Cairo and Washington through
confiscating lands, setting up settlements and Judaizing
Jerusalem," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said he would ask the Egyptian president to exert more
efforts to activate the peace march, which has been stalled since
Israel started building a new Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit came as the separate initiatives proposed by the
U.S. and the European Union (EU) to revive Israeli-Palestinian
talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., hosting Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian envoys in Washington early this month, had apparently
failed to convince Israel to halt the building project, a condition
the Palestinians insist for resuming the talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu only cold-shouldered an EU initiative that
calls on Israel to freeze settlement expansion and Palestinians
to curb violence.
</P>
<P>
Arafat would fly to Valletta, Malta, to attend the
Euro-Mediterranean conference after meeting Mubarak, his longtime
advocate and a critic of the Israeli hardline policy.
</P>
<P>
There he will meet with American Mideast Peace Coordinator
Dennis Ross Tuesday in stepped-up efforts to salvage peace before
U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright's scheduled visit to the
region in May.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of Arafat's visit to Cairo, Mubarak said he will
send his political advisor Osama el-Baz to Washington tomorrow at
the request of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
As no progress has been made in the diplomatic front, violence
continued in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian woman crossing into the West Bank from Jordan
shot and wounded two Israelis and an Arab man Sunday, another
sign of Palestinian frustration over the Jewish housing project
that has touched off almost daily clashes in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
In Hebron, three Palestinians were injured by stones hurled by
Jewish settlers during rock-throwing between the two sides in the
partitioned town in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM to Meet Arafat at Malta Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel announced today that
its Foreign Minister David Levy would meet with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat at Tuesday's Euro-Mediterranean conference
in Malta.
</P>
<P>
Levy decided to attend the two-day conference of the foreign
ministers of the European Union (EU) and 12 Mediterranean
countries, which opens Tuesday, after EU peace envoy Miguel
Angel Moratinos telephoned him that Arafat was interested in
holding a meeting with him, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The Levy-Arafat meeting will be the first high-level contact
since Israel decided in March to build the Har Homa settlement
in Arab East Jerusalem, which has stalled the peace process. The
two leaders will seek ways of defusing the current crisis and
getting the peace talks back on track.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry sources said Levy's decision to
attend the conference came only after he got the EU promise that
a resolution denouncing Israel would not be adopted at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been strongly criticized for causing the current
Israeli-Palestinian crisis by beginning the building of the Har
Homa settlement. Israeli officials feared the Malta conference
could be exploited as a stage to attack the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Levy met with his Dutch counterpart Hans
Van Mierlo, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
Mierlo assured that Arab participants had agreed to leave the
Israeli-Palestinian confrontation out of the conference and to
keep the issue out of its resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The EU is currently seeking to strengthen its role in
mediating the Israel-Palestinian peace negotiations so as to
increase its political influence in the region.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the United States have so far rebuffed EU attempts
in this direction, citing that Europe cannot replace the U.S. as
the honest broker in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, the two U.S. vetoes of the United Nations Security
Council resolutions slamming Israel's settlement policies have
been widely criticized by the international community, thus
weakening the U.S. role in the peace mediation.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the EU nations, representatives from Algeria,
Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Syria,
Tunisia, Turkey and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) will
attend the Malta conference, which is supposed to focus on trade
and economic relations.
</P>
<P>
But the conference is overshadowed by the Middle East
politics at a time of rising tension between Israel and Arab
neighbors. Despite the Arab promise to put aside politics,
Israel is still expected to come under harsh criticism in
speeches made by Arab attendants.

<HEADLINE> China's Air Force to be Equipped with State-of-Art (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese air force plans to
build a new weapon system, equipped with state-of-art early
warning planes, electronic warfare warplanes, and ground-to-air
missiles by early next century, according to the commanding
officer of the air force.
</P>
<P>
"We shall focus our efforts on applying new high-tech to
raising combat effectiveness of the troops while importing some
high-tech weapons which have higher accuracy in hitting the
target," said Lieutenant General Liu Shunyao in an interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-eight-year-old General Liu was born in Zhaoyuan County in
eastern China's coastal province of Shandong in 1939 and joined
the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in 1958.
</P>
<P>
He became a pilot after he graduated from a flying school of
the air force in 1964. He was conferred the title of lieutenant
general of the airforce in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding 48 years ago, the Chinese Air Force has
developed into a modernized armed service of the PLA, which
includes combat branches of ground-to-air missiles, antiaircraft
guns, radars, and paratroopers with air units as its main body,
General Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese air force is now capable of waging high-level
long-distance combats, rapid manoeuvrability, air defense, and
providing assistance to the navy and the ground forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Soon after the Chinese Air Force was founded in 1949, it went
to Korea as the air force of the Chinese People's Volunteers to
fight the U.S. invasion and assist the Korean people," he recalled.
</P>
<P>
"During the Korean War (1950-1953) and the national defense of
its own territory over the past 48 years, the Chinese Air Force
altogether has shot down or damaged a total of 3,800 enemy planes,"
General Liu noted.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Legislator on Sino-Mongolian Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese National
People's Congress (NPC) Chairman Qiao Shi said today that China
will, as always, respect Mongolia's independence and sovereignty,
as well as its people's own choice for their road of development.
</P>
<P>
At a dinner given in his honor by Radnaasumberel Gonchigdorj,
chairman of Mongolia's State Great Hural, the country's
parliament, Qiao said China attaches great importance to
developing friendly relations with Mongolia, an important neighbor.
</P>
<P>
China and Mongolia, Qiao said, are friendly neighbors linked
by mountains and rivers and their exchanges and cooperation have
expanded over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people are willing to push forward,
with the Mongolian government and people, friendly and
good-neighborly relations on the basis of the five principles of
peaceful co-existence and the China-Mongolia Treaty of
Friendly Relations and Cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The top Chinese legislator hoped his visit would deepen
understanding, promote friendship and enhance relations between
China and Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Gonchigdori said China is an influential country in
the world and its peaceful foreign policy is an important
factor guaranteeing peace, stability and development in the
Aisa-Pacific region and the world.
</P>
<P>
Developing friendly and good-neighborly relations with China,
just as in the past, will be one of the main planks of Mongolia's
foreign policy, the Mongolian parliamentary leader said.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia is the last stop of Qiao's European and Asian tour,
which has already taken him to France, Norway and Italy. It is
also the first visit to Mongolia by a Chinese NPC chairman.

<TEXT>
<P>
During the Korean War, the Chinese Air Force brought down 330
American planes and damaged 95, according to General Liu.
</P>
<P>
After decades of development, the Chinese Air Force has
localized most of its equipment, with a large number of
self-designed and Chinese-made high-quality fighters, attackers,
bombers, reconnaissance planes, and special-purpose planes, Liu
noted.
</P>
<P>
To support the air force weaponry system, the Air Force has
been equipped with sophisticated air-to-air missiles, air-borne
radars, fire control systems, communications and guidance
facilities, and flying control systems, he noted.
</P>
<P>
With 76 percent of its pilots being able to fly all-weather and
a flying safety for 16 years running, the Air Force is developing
an advanced air defense system equipped with a complete set of
high-range, medium-range, low-range, long-range and short-range
missiles, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Air Force is now able to fight both defense and
offense battles under high-tech conditions," the Chinese general
noted.
</P>
<P>
"Over the next few years the Chinese Air Force will enhance its
deterrent force in the air, ability to impose air blockades and
launch air strikes, as well as the ability to conduct joint
operations of ground forces, navy and the air force," he said.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Overseas Assets Estimated at 350 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Gulf Arab states have an
estimated 350 billion U.S. dollars of overseas assets but some is
expected to flow back to support domestic reforms, a local
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Al Khaleej on Sunday, Mahammed al Mulla,
secretary general of the Union of Chambers of Commerce and
Industry of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) said the bulk of
the funds were accumulated by the big profits of the oil industry
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states which group Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United
Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Oman are abundant in
petroleum deposits and they possess some 60 percent of the
total oil reserves in the world.
</P>
<P>
Mulla said the GCC states hopes that private investment in the
region would increase in the years to come and that overseas assets
would begin to flow back to support the domestic reforms.
</P>
<P>
"GCC states have marched a long way in improving their
investment climate,... we expect a large increase in private
investment in the GCC," the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
The GCC assets abroad are mainly concentrated on real-estate,
stocks and bank deposits in the Western countries.
</P>
<P>
The six countries enjoyed huge abundance of wealth collected
from their oil industry in the oil boom in the late 1970s and
early 1980s when they earned more than 150 billion dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
But This income decreased to about 70 billion dollars a year in
the following years due to a sharp drop in oil prices, which fell
to as low as about 18 dollars per barrel from above 30 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Export of 10 Top Products Decreases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The contribution of Indonesia's
10 leading industrial products to total non-oil/gas exports is
decreasing because of their lower competitiveness and
diversification, a monthly report said today.
</P>
<P>
The April report issued by the Ministry of Industry and Trade
said that in 1996 the 10 products -- textiles and products,
leather shoes, wood products, electronic goods, food, paper,
rubber, fish, vegetable oils and toys -- accounted for 83.63
percent of Indonesia's total industrial product exports. In 1995,
they took up 84.31 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the export value of the 10 commodities amounted to
26.859 billion U.S. dollars in 1996, representing an 8.62-percent
increase over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The growth of the 10 products has also shown a decline in
comparison to the total exportation of industrial products, with a
rise of 9.51 percent last year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Only electronic goods have registered a higher growth of 30.59
percent between 1995 and 1996, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Electronic export value amounted to 3.256 billion dollars in
1996, up from 2.493 billion dollars in 1995.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Euro-Med Cooperation in Hard Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VALLETTA, MALTA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The second
European-Mediterranean conference to be held here Tuesday and
Wednesday can hardly have an easy time as the cooperation between
the two regions has met great challenges.
</P>
<P>
Jean Pierre, the French ambassador for European Union's (EU)
dialog with its southern Mediterranean countries partners said
last week that the Malta conference comes "in a difficult
situation and a hard time."
</P>
<P>
This viewpoint, widely shared among officials and analysts
across the Mediterranean, largely refers to the deadlocked Middle
East peace process and the difficulties arising from the
cooperation launched at the first Barcelona conference 15 months
ago.
</P>
<P>
Just days before the conference, Arab countries expressed
their reservations over a French proposal for a Euro-Mediterranean
"stability pact", on the agenda of the Malta conference, because
it would include Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The arabs unanimously believe that it is premature to speak of
constraining measures and to fix a date for their implementation,"
said Fathi Shazli, An assistant to the Egyptian foreign minister
for European affairs, on behalf of the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The Barcelona conference put forward two concepts -- namely,
the Euro-Mediterranean partnership and the establishment of a free
trade zone linking the two regions by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The Malta conference is to be attended by foreign ministers
from EU's 15 members and their 12 Mediterranean partners --
Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco,
Syria, Tunisia, Turkey and Palestine.
</P>
<P>
So far, the EU has concluded bilateral partnership agreements
with six countries and is negotiating with three others. Political
dialogs have been intensified with a frequent exchange of leaders'
visits. European countries, particularly France, have been seeking
active mediation role in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In the economic field, EU has promised to provide some 5.3
billion U.S. dollars of aid to its Mediterranean partners during
the 1996-2000 period and many of the projects involved are now in
place. The two sides have also set up joint chambers of commerce
and export agencies, and even a Mediterranean bank network.
</P>
<P>
Hailing these achievements, officials and analysts from both
sides acknowledged that they appear to be rather meager in
proportion to the ambitious free trade goal.
</P>
<P>
Major problems found in the existing cooperation include the
wide political and economic disparities between the two sides,
EU's strict limits on agricultural imports and anti-dumping
measures, and a huge trade deficit -- some 185 billion dollars
annually -- on the southern countries' side. Differences in
societies and cultures are also complicating factors.
</P>
<P>
An article carried on the latest issue of Malta Sunday Times
said that the Euro-Mediterranean partnership is "an unequal one,"
heavily biased in favor of the EU.
</P>
<P>
What worries the EU is that some southern Mediterranean
countries are questioning Europe's motives in cooperation, fearing
to be dominated and robbed of profits. Turkey has even threatened
to withdraw from the customs union reached with the EU.
</P>
<P>
To allay these fears, the EU says it will reaffirm Barcelona
conference's goal in Malta and strengthen dialog with its partners.
</P>
<P>
Not alone, these problems will most likely be taken into Malta
discussions together with the faltering Middle East peace process
as widely predicted.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that a prerequisite to a full
Euro-Mediterranean cooperation is the increased trade and business
links among the southern countries themselves, which are always
marred and influenced by the political and security situation.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral conflicts are seen in relations between Israel and
Palestine, Israel and Syria, Greece and Turkey as well as
internal problems in Cyprus and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
In protest against Israeli hard-line policy in the Middle East
process, the Arab League made a decision a fortnight ago to
suspend its normalization process of political and economic ties with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Despite all these, politicians and analysts voiced confidence
in achieving success in Malta, saying that the gathering of the
all sides involved around one table itself is great.
</P>
<P>
Still further, observers say, EU's strategy of shifting focus
southwards, together with its poorer southern neighbors' desire
for development, are destined to serve as a joint push to
cooperation and the South-North type dialog like the Malta
conference.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that the EU wants to play a bigger role in the
Mediterranean after the end of the Cold War as a counterbalance to
the United States, an idea also favored by the Middle East
countries.
</P>
<P>
An article carried on Britain's Independent Daily early this
month said a good opportunity has arrived for Europe to seek a
more active involvement in the Middle East -- at a time when the
United States gives bias toward Israel in mediation at the cost of
losing Arab countries' trust.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Launches Reloadable Stored Value Card </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China (BOC) Group,
Standard Chartered Bank and Visa International today announced the
launch of the reloadable Visa Cash card, representing a big leap
forward in forging an electronic cash payment system in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Not only can card holders make small amount transactions with
the reloadable Visa Cash, but they can also carry out other
financial applications such as credit and debit with just one
card.
</P>
<P>
Card holders will be able to load and unload their cards at the
territory's over 100 designated BOC Group and Standard Chartered
Bank Automatic Telling Machines (ATMs) displaying Visa Cash signs.
The maximum load value each time is 3,000 HK dollars (385 US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
In August 1996, the three institutions joined hands in
launching "Prime Visa Cash", the disposable stored value card
which is a convenient, fast and clean alternative of paying for
smaller value cash items.
</P>
<P>
To date, half-a-million Visa Cash transactions have been
completed with a total value exceeding 15 million HK dollars (1.9
million US dollars). The average transaction value is around 30 HK
dollars.
</P>
<P>
With the launch of the reloadable card, a number of new
merchants have signed up to accept Visa Cash, in addition to the
existing 1,000 merchants, including those from a broad section of
retail and service industries.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference today, the deputy chief executive of
BOC's Hong Kong and Macao Regional Office, Zhang Hongyi, said the
new card brings more efficiency and convenience to the card
holders and participating merchants.
</P>
<P>
And Philippe Paillart, group executive director of Standard
Chartered Bank, said, "Cash purchase transactions therefore march
into a truly coinless generation making purchases more efficient
and become a truly enjoyable experience."
</P>
<P>
Visa Cash eyes a respectable proportion of cash based
transactions, which nowadays make up over 70 percent of total
personal consumption expenditure in Hong Kong, within the next 10
years.

<HEADLINE> Apes on Verge of Extinction Due to Demand for Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Illegal hunting to supply meat to
restaurants from Nairobi to Brussels is pushing the great apes
towards extinction, a report released by the World Wide Fund for
Nature (WWF) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Across Africa and Asia, the last homes of the chimpanzee, the
gorilla and the orangutan, commercial hunting in defiance of
national laws and international conservation agreements is
reaching crisis point, according to the report, Great Apes in the
Wild: Wanted Alive.
</P>
<P>
The report confirms that the mountain gorillas of Zaire, Uganda
and Rwanda are the great apes most at risk, with only 620 animals
left.
</P>
<P>
Under the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered
Species, trade in meat and parts of great apes is either banned or
strictly controlled. The WWF is calling for tougher action to
enforce these rules.

<HEADLINE> Zairean Rebels Capture Kananga Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Zairean rebels have captured
the town of Kananga, capital of Western Kasai Province and one
of the largest towns outside Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
The town fell to the rebel forces on Saturday, a report
reaching here this morning said, quoting Voice of the People
Radio broadcast from the eastern town of Goma, where the rebel
headquarters is located.
</P>
<P>
The fall of Kananga leaves the rebels in a good position to
move on Bandundu, about 270 km northeast of the Zairean capital
Kinshasa, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the
Liberation of Congo-Zaire, led by Laurent Kabila, took arms
last October to topple President Mobutu Sese Seko. In less than
six months, they have occupied two thirds of Africa's third
largest country.
</P>
<P>
The rebels seized the country's diamond capital Mbuji-Mayi
on April 5 and the second largest city of Lubumbashi on the
Zairean-Zambian border on April 9, thus controling the
country's valuable mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
Rebels said on Sunday they were resuming their offensive after
a three-day halt called to give President Mobutu time to resign.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the rebel forces are marching forward to the
Zairean capital Kishasa from two directions, by using the Zaire
River in the north and from the Mbuji-Mayi-Kananga axis in the
east.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the rebel forces are just 300 km away
from the capital. enditem

<HEADLINE> First Bridal Photography Show Held In Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 bridal photography
companies have gathered here for the first time at a show targeted
at the pockets of newlyweds in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Met with non-stop enthusiasm for their goods and services, the
companies each took in some 100 orders a day during the five-day
show, which ended today. Each order is valued at 2000-10,000 yuan,
according to Liu Sheng, an organizer of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that that local Beijing companies, which represent the
majority of those in the wedding photo profession, make up only
some 40 percent of the total number of the participants.
</P>
<P>
The rest are from Beijing-based companies funded by Hong Kong,
Taiwan and the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Beijing residents have been less inclined to
throw lavish banquets at weddings and are becoming generous --
spending one or two months' salary or even more -- on bridal
photography.
</P>
<P>
Some of the romantic photographs are as large as a full-sized
calendar.
</P>
<P>
There are 100,000 marriages reported in Beijing annually,
according to statistics of the Beijing Civil Affairs Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Bridal photography originated in Japan in the 1970s, and
flourished in Taiwan. The first Taiwan-Beijing joint bridal
photography venture was established in 1989, which invigorated the
stagnant Beijing bridal photography market.
</P>
<P>
There are currently more than 300 businesses engaged in bridal
photography in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen companies handling tourism, diamond, bridal
wear, photo frames and design also participated in the fair, which
was sponsored by the China Light Industrial Council.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Warns Sudan on War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has warned that Uganda will give the government of Sudan
a blow if the latter attacks first, "the New Vision" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Museveni delivered his address last Saturday to the residents
of north-western city of Arua when new conflicts flared in
southern Sudan and near the Uganda-Sudan border.
</P>
<P>
Uganda reinforced its army build-up on its north border to
prevent the spilling over of the war between the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and the government troops
in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by George Willy Odwong, resident district
councilor of Kitgum District, northern Uganda, when he
explained to the residents in the north, responding to the
inquiries for the reason of the increase of the troops in the
border areas.
</P>
<P>
The increase of the troops in the border areas was not yet
confirmed by the army.
</P>
<P>
There are two military conflicts near the Uganda-Sudan border:
one between the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) on one hand
and the Sudan government troops and the rebel Lord Resistance
Army (LRA) of Uganda on the other, and another between the
Ugandan government troops and the rebel LRA.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the SPLA attacked LRA headquaters in
southern Sudan and the government troops of Sudan guarding the
headquaters. The SPLA killed some 150 government soldiers and LRA
members, and captured more than 200 LRA fighters.
</P>
<P>
The LRA is one of the three main rebel groups in Uganda. The
other two are the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in the west and
the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF) in the north-west.
</P>
<P>
Both ADF and WNBF had lost their main forces since last
December in their fightings against the government troops of
Uganda and SPLA in southern Sudan.

<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Aviation Expo/China '97 is to be
held in Beijing from October 8-12, running concurrently with
Airport Expo/China '97, the country's only airport exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Organizers say nearly 300 aviation companies from more than 20
countries and regions, including such industrial giants as
Boeing, Airbus Industrie, and Daimler Aerospace, will take part in
the biennial event to be held in the China International
Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
At least six pavilions from China, Australia, France, Israel,
Japan and Britain will join this year's exposition, which is
expected to take up an exhibition area of 10,000 sq.m., according
to the organizers.
</P>
<P>
It will be the seventh Aviation Expo/China held in Beijing. The
event was initiated in 1984 with the approval from the State
Council and co-sponsored by the Civil Aviation Administration of
China (CAAC), Aviation Industries of China and China Council for
the Promotion of International Trade, said Andrew Kay, general
manager of the Hong Kong-based China Promotion Ltd., which
organizes the exposition.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some 1,400 companies from 30 countries have
participated in the exposition since 1984.
</P>
<P>
With China's rapid economic growth and increasing exchanges with
other parts of the world, the airline industry has become one of
the fastest-growing sectors in the country.
</P>
<P>
The industry is expected to score an annual growth of 13
percent by the year of 2000, according to CAAC Director Chen
Guangyi.
</P>
<P>
Last November, China held its first international aviation and
aerospace exhibition in Zhuhai. The show will also be held every
two years in this south city adjacent to Macao.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Meets Macao Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
said here today that Macao's return to the motherland has been on
the agenda since less than three years remain until its return.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark during a meeting here this afternoon with Ma
Man-kei, president of Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in
Macao, and his party who are attending a forum to commemorate the
fourth anniversary of the promulgation of the Basic Law of the
Macao Special Administrative Region and the 10th anniversary of
the signing of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on the
Question of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Qian said it is imperative to strengthen cooperation between
the governments of China and Portugal based on the implementation
the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration.
</P>
<P>
The Macao compatriots should further bring into full play the
spirit of loving the country and Macao and involve more in the
work during the later transitional period and make efforts for
Macao's stable transition and smooth transfer of the power so as
to establish a special administrative region with a high-degree of
autonomy, said Qian.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted slow progress in solving the localization of civil
servants and law as well as status for official Chinese language
and expressed the hope that the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison
Group will accelerate the work.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government is concerned about the
provisional issues related to Macao's public security and economy,
hoping that the Portuguese side will earnestly assume the
responsibility in this regard during its transitional period.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong's return to the motherland, Qian said economic
ties between Hong Kong and Macao will be closer. "We will
encourage Hong Kong, Macao, and China's inland areas to strengthen
their economic ties".
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that with the concerted efforts of the
Macao compatriots, Macao's economy is bound to grow.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that under the care of the mainland people, Macao is
stable in society during its transitional period and its people
have boosted confidence in its future.
</P>
<P>
The work for the localization of civil servants and law and
status for official Chinese language should be done in an
accelerating way, said Ma.
</P>
<P>
Ma said he was sure that in the coming two years or more, the
Macao compatriots will, as always, unite under the banner of
loving the country and Macao, and contribute to the realization of
its stable transition and a smooth transfer of the power.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Qian also answered a number of questions
raised by the visitors.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of
the State Council, also met with Ma Man-kei and his party at the

<P>
TOKYO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Boris Becker returned to tournament
play after two-month layoff due to a wrist injury but was beaten
in the doubles here on Monday at the Japan Open tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
Becker, three-time Wimbledon champion, teaming up with partner
Patrik Kuhen conceded the game to Japanese duo Hiroki Ishii and
Michihisa Onoda 1-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4.

<HEADLINE> Forum to Mark Anniversary of Macao Basic Law and Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A forum was held today in the
Great Hall of the People in Beijing to mark the 4th anniversary of
the promulgation of the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) and the 10th anniversary of the
signing of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration.
</P>
<P>
Participants, who are from various circles of the inland areas
and Macao, agreed that the Basic Law and the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Declaration are focused on the implementation of the principles of
"one country, two systems", "Macao people governing Macao," and a
high-degree of autonomy in Macao, which will be a special
administrative region of China.
</P>
<P>
They believe Deng Xiaoping's great concept of "one country, two
systems" will surely come true if the two documents are strictly
carried out.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the forum, Lu Ping, director of the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, expressed
satisfaction over the development of friendly relations between
China and Portugal and their cooperation on the Macao question in
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
"Macao has maintained a stable society, and a continuous
economic development. As each piece of work in the transitional
period is in smooth progress, people are much more confident about
Macao's future," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the "one country, two systems" principle is the
most essential factor for Hong Kong and Macao to maintain their
stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
It greatly inspires the people's confidence and guarantees a
splendid future for the two regions, he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the "one country, two systems" concept, put forward
by late Deng Xiaoping, "not only complies with the current trend
of peace and progress, but also accords with the practical
situations of Hong Kong and Macao."
</P>
<P>
"It not only guarantees the country's reunification and
territorial integrity, but also maintains the stability,
development, and prosperity of Hong Kong and Macao."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, it wins the support from all the Chinese people
including Hong Kong and Macao residents, and draws widespread
attention from the international community," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
Referring to the tasks concerning the maintenance of Macao's
stability and prosperity as well as the smooth transition, Lu said
these tasks include the further study and promotion of the Basic
Law, the formation of the Preparatory Committee of the Macao SAR,
the participation in affairs in Macao's transitional period, and
the stability and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Lu also said the Preparatory Committee of the Macao SAR has an
important job to implement the Basic Law and decisions of the
National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Hong Kong, a preliminary working committee for the
Preparatory Committee is unnecessary, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ma Man-kei, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said the
signing of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration has smoothly
settled the Macao question left from history, and gives an example
for solving international disputes in a peaceful way through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said the smooth return of Macao is the people's will and the
current trend.
</P>
<P>
Although there are some difficult matters, "I believe they are
sure to be solved, as long as China and Portugal stick to the
stipulations of the Joint Declaration, follow in the direction in
line with the Basic Law, stand firmly on the development and
stability of Macao and the interests of the local residents, and
keep in accordance with a spirit of mutual understanding," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ma also expressed the hope that the majority of Macao residents
and people in the various circles will unite under the banner of
love of country and Macao, and contribute to the stable transition
of Macao as well as the smooth transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the forum, Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua
News Agency Macao Branch, reviewed the work done by the people in
the various circles of Macao and the social organizations there to
promote the Basic Law in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
As a national law, the Basic Law of the Macao SAR must be
abided by not only by Macao residents, but also by people in the
inland areas, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Today's forum was held by the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office of the State Council. Chen Ziying, vice-director of the
office, presided over the forum.
</P>
<P>
Also attending today's forum were Vice-Chairman of the National
People's Congress Standing Committee Lei Jieqiong; Vice-Chairmen
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National
Committee Qian Weichang, and Wan Guoquan; and some officials from
relevant departments.

<HEADLINE> Australia Might Continue Its Ban On Imports Of N.Z. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Australia's quarantine
authorities said today it might continue the ban on imports of New
Zealand apples, a move which was welcomed by local growers but
angered its neighbor New Zealand
</P>
<P>
The Australian Quarantine Inspection Service (AQIS) released a
draft pest risk assessment, calling for community and industry
comment before issuing a final report in June.
</P>
<P>
The assessment said apples sourced under the New Zealand
proposal could carry fire blight bacteria, a disease not present
in Australian orchards.
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of those findings, AQIS foreshadowed rejecting
the New Zealand proposal," the AQIS said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Apple and Pear Growers Association said this was
a major win for the industry, worth up to 600 million Australian
dollars (470 million US dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports quoted New Zealand International Trade
Minister Lockwood Smith as saying that the draft recommendation
was extremely disappointing. N.Z. apple growers were expected to
work with their government to determine the next steps including
taking the issue to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
This is an important case for growers of both countries and it
would be a major decision for the Australian Government to make,
as there is a Closer Economic Relations agreement signed between
them, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Mechanism Urged to Aid African States in WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) and the African Economic Community (AEC) today called
for the formation of a permanent institutional mechanism to
support the negotiating capacity of African governments at the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The call came from Assistant Secretary General of OAU/AEC,
Vijay S. Makhan when he was opening a two-day meeting of African
experts on trade policy here.
</P>
<P>
Makhan emphasized that in the new global context of the multi-
lateral trade regime, Africa countries should coordinate their positions
so that their interests be fully reflected in decisions
taken at the WTO.
</P>
<P>
He concluded that such a setup should be proactive and should
help African governments initiate negotiating proposals on trade
issues of common interest to their countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is convened to examine the theme "Building the
Capacity of African Governments to Examine the World Trade
Organization (WTO) Negotiations" and to make recommendations on
how OAU/AEC member states could effectively contribute to the
shaping and designing of the rules and regulations governing
international trade relations under the WTO and to engage
effectively in trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The African trade experts will be deliberating on the follow-up
to the WTO first ministerial conference held in Singapore in December
last year with particular reference to issues of interest to Africa.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to map out strategies for strengthening
Africa's participation in the WTO negotiations, as well as
building capacities at the national level to address, on a
continuous basis, international trade issues.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is also expected to deliberate the program of
action of the WTO for the least developed countries, trade in
services, specially the proposed multilateral investment
agreement and on other issues on the future negotiating agenda of
the WTO.

<HEADLINE> HK's Lantau Link to Open to Traffic in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The doubled-decked Lantau Link,
comprising two major bridges and a viaduct, will open to traffic
in May.
</P>
<P>
The link is built as part of the 34-kilometer transport
corridor to the new international airport under construction at
Chek Lap Kok.
</P>
<P>
Traffic will be carried on a dual three-lane expressway on the
open upper deck. In case of bad weather, traffic can be diverted
to two single-lane carriage ways on the sheltered lower deck,
which will also carry the airport railway.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles using the link will have to pay tolls, at a toll plaza
located on the Lantau side.
</P>
<P>
Both bridges are the largest of their kind to carry road and
rail traffic. The Tsing Ma Bridge, spanning the marine channel
between Tsing Yi and Ma Wan islands, has a central span of 1,377
meters while the cable-stayed Kap Shui Mun Bridge, which connects
Ma Wan and Lantau island, has a main span of 430 meters.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Works Kwong Hong-sang said that Hong Kong has
never built such long-span bridges before.
</P>
<P>
He said that it has been a great achievement, considering that
the two contracts to build the bridges were only awarded in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Lantau Link and its associated road network have been
designated as a control area, to maintain safe and efficient traffic
operations on it.
</P>
<P>
The control area is equipped with a sophisticated
computer-based Traffic Control and Surveillance System.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is the first time that a system of this kind
covers such a large area. The system contains a log of
state-of-the-art techniques and in many ways it is one of the most
advanced systems in the world.
</P>
<P>
The control area includes about 17 kilometers of the airport
transport corridor stretching from the Mei Foo Interchange at the
start of the Kwai Chung Viaduct section of Route 3 to the Yam O
Interchange on the North Lantau Expressway.
</P>
<P>
The main control center is housed in the North West Tsing Yi
Administration Building. The system's equipment includes closed
circuit television, automatic incident detector, automatic weight
detectors, environmental sensors, emergency telephones, vehicle
overweight detectors, variable traffic signs, land control signals
and radio re-broadcast facilities.

enterprises in the country.
</P>
<P>
The project involves a total investment of nearly 200 million
yuan. Once construction is complete by the end of next year, the
shipway will be able to accommodate the building of 2.5
vessels of 100,000 DWT per year, the China State Shipbuilding
Corporation says.
</P>
<P>
The shipyard has so far finished basic designs for the shipway
and a dyke-closing project.
</P>
<P>
The Bohai Shipyard is located in the city of Huludao, in
northeast China's Liaoning Province. Huludao, near the Liaodong
gulf of the Bohai Sea, is an important city in the booming Bohai
economic rim. Shipbuilding has become a pillar industry for
Huludao.

<HEADLINE> India's UF to Choose New Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The 13-party United Front (UF)
will choose a new leader to replace Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda
in a bid to form a new government with support from the Congress
party, the Press Trust of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
Front convenor, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu
Naidu, said today the front would choose a new leader at its
Steering Committee meeting in New Delhi on Thursday in view of the
"historical necessity" to continue the coalition government and
block the entry of communal forces (Bharatiya Janata party).
</P>
<P>
"We will select the most suitable candidate (for prime minister
post) from among the front constituents in the interest of
survival of the front government," Naidu told reporters in
Hyderabad, capital of Andhara Pradesh on his return from New
Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Deve Gowda, who is also leader of the front, had
voluntarily offered to step down to pave the way for new
leadership and keep the front intact, said Naidu, who had played a
key role in installation of the Deve Gowda government last June.
</P>
<P>
Deve Gowda lost a vote of confidence in his government last
Friday in parliament. The Congress party, which withdrew support
for the Deve Gowda government on March 30, has insisted that a
change of leadership in the front is a precondition for the party
to renew its support for the UF.
</P>
<P>
"We (the United Front constituents) have arrived at a consensus
that mid-term elections should be avoided at any cost. There are
no legal hurdles in the way of continuation of the front
government under new leadership," he said.
</P>
<P>
Naidu also clarified that he was not in the race for prime
minister's post.

<HEADLINE> Test-Tube Baby Born in Chongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China's newest municipality,
with a population of 30 million, has welcomed the arrival of its
first test-tube baby, and three more are expected to be born this
year.
</P>
<P>
The boy, weighing three kilograms, was born last Thursday at
the Chongqing Woman and Baby Hospital. The mother had been unable
to get pregnant due to blocked fallopian tubes.
</P>
<P>
The hospital pioneers the research of assisted reproductive
technology in southwest China, launching the study in this field
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
It has so far used the technology on 67 women, 27 percent of
whom got pregnant. The hospital said another three test-tube
babies, including a set of triplets, will be born this year.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing is the seventh Chinese city reporting the birth of
test-tube babies, following Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Shenyang,
Haikou and other cities.
</P>
<P>
More than 250 such babies have been born in these cities since
the first in Beijing in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping on Preparatory Committee of Macao SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The formation of the Preparatory
Committee of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) is a
major job concerning the return of Macao, but the establishment of
a preliminary working committee is not necessary.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of
the State Council, made the remark in a speech at a forum to
mark the 4th anniversary of the promulgation of the Basic Law of
the Macao SAR and the 10th anniversary of the signing of the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration.
</P>
<P>
He said the formation of the Preparatory Committee of the Macao
SAR is an important task for implementing the Basic Law and
relevant stipulations of the National People's Congress, and has
drawn widespread attention of the public.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Hong Kong, a preliminary working committee for the
Preparatory Committee is unnecessary, he said, adding that all
matters concerning the formation of the Macao SAR will be
submitted to the Preparatory Committee for study and discussion.
</P>
<P>
Although more than two years remain before Macao's return, the
time is still pressing, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lu said Macao is a small place, but it will be the same as Hong
Kong in pursuing the principle of "one country, two systems" and
the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Work done by the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong
SAR also needs to be done by the Preparatory Committee of the
Macao SAR, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the Preparatory Committee of the Macao SAR can draw on
the experiences of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR,
but Macao has its own characteristics, and must, like Hong Kong,
deal with some difficult matters.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure the smooth operation of the Preparatory
Committee, it is appropriate to make some preparations in advance,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Anorexia Linked to Brain Deficiency, British Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A British science team has found
anorexia is linked to an abnormality in the brain, the Times
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Using new scanning techniques, researchers at the London-based
Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children have discovered that 16
out of 18 anorexic children studied reduced blood flow in the part
of the brain that governs visual perception, appetite and sense of
fullness.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a physical cause has been found for
anorexia. The findings will reassure many parents who fear that
they are to blame for their children's eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
Bryan Lask, a consultant psychiatrist who studied anorexia
patients as young as seven, said that a deficiency in the anterior
temporal lobes, which interpret vision, would explain why
anorexics see themselves as fat when they are thin.
</P>
<P>
Lask said that once the cause of the physical abnormality was
found, pharmaceutical companies would be able to look for the
first medical cure for anorexia.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Work With NGOs in Housing Slum Dwellers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
taken up a comprehensive program to provide permanent housing for
slum dwellers in the country's capital, Dhaka, while trying to
stop the migration of village people to the city, according to a
government official.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications Minister Mohammad Nasim, who is also in
charge of the Ministry of Public Works, said on Sunday that under
the program, the government would construct multi-story buildings
for the slum people.
</P>
<P>
In the capital of this poor South Asian country, millions of
slum dwellers, most from the rural areas, have been living a
sub-human life in an unhygienic environment.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the multi-story buildings program would start
from the Bashantek slum which was allotted to the poor people by
former President Mujibur Rahman, father of present Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
Each genuine slum dweller would be allotted one unit of the
apartments and they could be the owner of the apartment forever
through paying construction cost in installments.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the commitment of the prime minister not to evict
any genuine slum dweller without making alternative arrangement,
the minister said the multi-story buildings would be constructed
in cooperation with non-governmental organizations.

<HEADLINE> Train Travelers on Decrease in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The number of train travelers was
three percentage points lower in the first quarter of this year
compared with the same period of 1996, latest statistics from the
Ministry of Railways show.
</P>
<P>
In the past three months, trains have carried 227 million
passengers. The figure for March stood at 76.66 million,
representing an 8.1 percent year-on-year decrease.
</P>
<P>
Many travelers in recent years have opted for highway or air
travel to get faster or more comfortable service, resulting in a
smaller market share for railways. In 1996, the number of train
travelers fell by 12.3 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
China's railway departments have taken heed of the downturn in
business and are working to change the situation.
</P>
<P>
As of this month, China's trains increased their speed. On the
three major rail lines of Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Guangzhou, and
Beijing-Harbin, trains' per-hour speed reached 140 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
A total of 78 overnight trains are now running between large
and medium-sized cities, with a distance within 1,500 km, in an
effort to make train travel more convenient.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, railway departments are improving service and
promoting market sales, such as ensuring the supply of clean water
and reasonably priced food.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Railways say that the past three months were
all listed as "Safety Months" for railways, with no train
accidents reported.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Robbers have struck at least
43 banks in the Johannesburg area since the beginning of this year,
the local daily the Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
Accurate figures on losses are not available following a media
black-out agreement made between banks and police last year, but
conservative estimates place them at more than five million Rands,
(1.14 million U.S. dollars), the report said.
</P>
<P>
While most major banks have fallen victim to the gangs in the
past months, Nedbank and Trust Bank, two well-known banks in
Johannesburg, have been affected in the worst, with 10 and four hits
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The impact on morale is increasingly being felt with employees
refusing to do teller duties unless better security measures are
introduced, the report quoted informed sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bank robberies, together with rapes and hijackings, were declared
priority crimes last year and police and the Council of South African
Banks have joined forces to combat bank bandits. enditem

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government Stops Campaigns for Abacha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The federal government of Nigeria
has issued a stern warning and urged for an immediate halt to
calls for the candidature of Head of State General Sani Abacha in
the country's the presidential election next year.
</P>
<P>
As the first official reaction to the campaigns, Minister of
Special Duties Alhaji Wada Nas said in a two-page statement last night
that the media advertisements might cast doubt in Nigerians about the
government's true intentions in the transition program.
</P>
<P>
"These advertisements have consequently generated a belief among
unsuspecting Nigerians either that they are being sponsored by the
government or are done with its knowledge and approval," he said,
quoted by press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Reports on calls from some government officials, politicians, and
religious and traditional leaders on Abacha to run for the presidency
have been increasing in the media of the country since late last year,
along with those on opposite views.
</P>
<P>
The latest surge in the campaign followed a call recently by Chief
Press Secretary to the head of state, Chief David Attah, that pressure
be mounted on Abacha to run.
</P>
<P>
But the minister said the government has nothing to do with such
activities which are "prejudical to the integrity of the political
transition program".
</P>
<P>
Abacha himself has parried the issue. In an interview with the U.S.
daily Washington Times two months ago, he said he had not given
thought to it and the decision on his candidature was his
"constituency's".

LAGOS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has regained frozen
foreign accounts worth of 55 million U.S. Dollars, "the Guardian"

The newspaper said the accounts were defrozen by banks in

</P>
<P>
The accounts had been frozen on court orders following

appellate courts in these countries.
</P>
<P>
Those foreign nationals fell victims of fraudsters because
they were greedy and were themselves culpable, being accomplices
in plots to defraud Nigeria, a official of the bank was quoted as

<HEADLINE> IAF Introduces New Training Method in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel Air Force (IAF) has
introduced the use of a latest simulator in its training of
reservists.
</P>
<P>
The IAF this week revealed its latest simulator, a small-arms
video machine where reservists hone their marksmanship skills by
blasting away at moving targets on a large screen.
</P>
<P>
The air force says it not only saves money by reducing the
amount of live ammunition airmen use, but it greatly enhances
marksmanship.
</P>
<P>
For now it is being used by the IAF's ground defense
battalions, but the Israeli army's Ground Forces Command is
interested in incorporating it into its training as well, said
Shmuel Frankel, chief ground defense training officer.
</P>
<P>
"The simulator saves in transportation costs, ammunition, and
time," Frankel said. "Soldiers here shoot 150 rounds in about
two hours of training, while in the field it could take them all
day."
</P>
<P>
While the Israeli army has numerous battle simulators, there
is only one other small-arms simulator currently in use, by an
unnamed unit in the Northern Command.
</P>
<P>
The new air force simulator is more sophisticated since it is
based on video input, not laser disks, said project manager
Yitzhak Ben-Moshe.
</P>
<P>
"We are able to program the actual scenarios in which our
soldiers may find themselves," Ben-Moshe said. "We can videotape
the setting where the soldier will be on guard duty and then
implant the enemy onto the scene."
</P>
<P>
A simulator costs 960,000 shekels (more than 300,000
U.S. dollars) and was built by the Petah Tikva-based NCC
company, whose representative said they are currently
participating in a tender to supply the U.S. Army with 500
simulators.
</P>
<P>
The simulator has only been operational for about a month,
but Ben-Moshe and others involved in the project say it has
"significantly" improved marksmanship.
</P>
<P>
While no scientific research has been carried out, they said
a simple comparison of two similar companies shows that airmen
who went through simulator training easily outshot those who
only had live-fire training.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Airline Suffers Huge Loss in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- the Israeli airline (EL AL), is
reportedly to have suffered an 80-million-US-dollar loss in 1996,
which could harm the Israeli government's intention to begin the
company's privatization process this year.
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post quoted sources from the company as
saying that the poor performance is due to external factors and
not internal company inefficiencies.
</P>
<P>
According to El Al, an 30 percent increase in fuel costs and
the decline in numbers of tourists in a year because of heightened
terrorist activity are the main reasons for the loss, which will
formally announced by the company in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
This is still a better end-of-year picture than that forecast
by general manager Yoel Feldschuh, who in last October predicted a
100-million-US-dollar loss for 1996.
</P>
<P>
In order to offset the anticipated loss, El Al cut 20
percent of its planned winter schedule, and increased layoffs
of seasonal employees.
</P>
<P>
"We are optimistic of an improved situation this year," said
company spokesman Nachman Klieman, adding that "there are signs of
an increase in tourism, and we already have large numbers of
bookings from Israelis traveling abroad."
</P>
<P>
Israelis comprise more than 50 percent of El Al's overall
market, a change from previous years, when foreigners made up
the bulk of the airline's customers.
</P>
<P>
Since the Israeli government demand that El Al make every
effort to be break-even, the 80-million-US-dollar loss will be a
blow to the prime minister's office and transport ministry, which
are intent on privatizing the company as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Talks among El Al, the transport ministry and government
companies authority are said to be near completion, but many
close to the talks believe an imminent flotation is a
pipe-dream.
</P>
<P>
Among the problems envisaged are the insistence of Transport
Minister Yitzhak Levy that the company not be allowed to fly on
Shabbat, no matter who owns the airline.
</P>
<P>
The workers and the company executives have held a series of
meetings to discuss the problem of unemployment after the company
being privatized.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the workers have been seeking independent
advice on the possibility of purchasing shares in El Al in any
future flotation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a government committee on selling El Al, which
should have made its recommendations by mid-January, has still
not reached an agreement as to the nature of the privatization.

MANILA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos today
ordered his ruling Lakas-NUCD Party to form a committee to
recommend the guidelines, criteria, procedures and timetable for
selecting the party's presidential candidates for the 1998 polls.

procedures and timetable for the selection of other candidates for
the 1998 national and local polls.

<HEADLINE> Israel Accuses PNA of Smuggling Arms to Prepare for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel accused today the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) of smuggling Katyusha
rockets, anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles in preparation for
future conflicts.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli security official was quoted by the English daily
The Jerusalem Post as saying that the PNA had ambitions to buy
weapons in violation of Oslo peace accords. "They are trying to
get anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons. There's no problem to
get these things," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the PNA had numerous options to buy cheap rockets and
missiles from Russia and eastern European countries. He noted
that smuggling weapons into the PNA-controlled areas was not
difficult either, because anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons
were small missiles that can fit into a suitcase.
</P>
<P>
He also suspected the PNA of bringing weapons into Gaza by
fishing boat either from the Mediterranean or from the Sinai
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Weapons could also be smuggled into the PNA-controlled areas in
the cars of senior Palestinian officials, whose vehicles are
exempt from Israeli security searches, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Although declining to estimate the amount of weapons being
smuggled into PNA self-rule areas, he said the the PNA's aim of
smuggling was not to amass enough weapons to try to defeat Israel
in war, but to upgrade its military capability so that it can
destroy several Israeli tanks in future conflicts to reap
"tremendous propaganda value."
</P>
<P>
Israel is highly sensitive about the alleged PNA's moves to
seek advanced weapons which would threaten its tanks and military
helicopters, Israel's main means of deterrence in the current
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Following the Palestinian violent protests sparked by Israel's
building of a controversial settlement in East Jerusalem, Israeli
army has deployed tanks, armed personnel carriers and snipers
around major Palestinian cities as a way of deterrence.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have also indicated that it would recapture
the Palestinian cities in case of all-out escalation of the
Palestinian violence.

<HEADLINE> Coastal Erosion Serious in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Coastal erosion nation-wide
in Malaysia has reached an "alarming stage" with the number of
problem sites increasing over the last 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Until the end of last month, 74 sites have been identified as
having serious problems, Neo Tong Lee, director general of the
Irrigation and Drainage Department under the Ministry of
Agriculture, said today while opening a seminar on sustainable
development of the coastal zone in Petaling Jaya near here.
</P>
<P>
"This situation is alarming because the number of sites
identified has increased compared to only 47 in 1985 when the
National Coastal Erosion study was conducted," he was quoted by
the Malaysian national news agency Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
The erosion was mainly caused by poor siting, planning and
design of coastal development projects, he said quoting the
finding of the study, adding that to tackle the problem, the
government has allocated 400 million ringgit (about 160 million
U.S. dollars) this year for coastal erosion-control works.
</P>
<P>
The official said the study also revealed that some 1,290
kilometers or 29 percent of the Malaysian coastline was subjected
to erosion.
</P>
<P>
"The finding is highly alarming and disturbing for which short
and long term measures have been recommended for implementation,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Long term strategies for proper planning, regulation and
control of future development in coastal zone are needed so as not
to aggravate existing problems or create new ones, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Neo, the government's efforts in coastal zone
planning include the National Coastal Zone Management Project
under the Danish Cooperation on Environment and Development
Project which involves the drafting of an Integrated Coastal Zone
Management Plan for States of Pulau Pinang, Sabah and Sarawak as
pilot projects.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to generate further impetus for similar
studies in the other states, he said.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Review Trade Dispute With Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
seriously considering seeking a review of the 121.5 percent
countervailing duty imposed by Brazil on Philippine exports of
desiccated coconut, the Presidential Palace said today.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Trade and Industry informed President Fidel
Ramos that it was considering this option after the Dispute
Settlement Body formed by the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled
in favor of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The dispute arose from Brazil's decision in August 1995 to
impose the countervailing duty, claiming that the Philippines
subsidized its desiccated coconut exports to the detriment of
Brazil's domestic industry, the Palace said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines had earlier disputed the Brazilian claim and
challenged the countervailing duty before the Dispute Settlement
Body under WTO law.

<HEADLINE> Asia's Largest Gifts, Premium Shows Open in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong giftware industry
is expecting a gift for themselves this year with rising demands
from major markets, an industry leader, Jeffrey Lam, said here
today.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking on the opening day of Asia's largest gifts and
premium trade fairs -- the 12th Hong Kong Gifts and Houseware Fair
and the 7th Hong Kong Premium Show.
</P>
<P>
Larger than ever, the two-in-one event has attracted a record
high of 1,570 gifts and premium companies from 34 countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
Overseas participation, in particular, registered a remarkable
31 percent increase over last year, with the number exceeding 580
companies.
</P>
<P>
Lam, who chairs the organizing committee of the Gifts and
Houseware Fair, said, after a year of modest growth, the industry
is expecting a better prospect for 1997.
</P>
<P>
"We expect a six to eight percent growth this year with surging
consumer spending in the United States, our biggest market.
Teaming with rising demand for all kinds of giftware and household
products in the booming Asia-Pacific region, there are every signs
of optimism for the industry," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hong Kong exported 295 billion HK dollars (37.8
billion US dollars) of gifts, premiums and household goods, while
imports also reached 234 billion HK dollars (30 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The United States absorbed over 35 percent of the territory's
gifts exports, followed by Japan, Germany, the Chinese mainland
and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Gifts and Houseware Fair is organized by the Hong Kong
Trade Development Council (TDC), and the Premium Show is jointly
organized by the TDC and the Hong Kong Exporters' Association.
</P>
<P>
Besides taking up the entire six levels of exhibition space at
the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, the twin fairs,
also expanded to cover the exhibition hall at the nearby Hong Kong
Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
Expected to receive 32,000 buyers, the four-day events featured
all kinds of innovative gift items, household products, premiums
for promotion, advertising and souvenir purposes, including home
furnishings, watches and clocks, kitchenware, stationery,
decorative items, electronic appliances and toys.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai: China's Biggest Flower Consumer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Flowers are becoming an
important part of life for the residents of Shanghai, which has
been listed as the country's biggest flower consumer for the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
The annual fresh flower sales in China's largest city comes to
270 million bouquets, making up a third of the country's flower
market, figures show.
</P>
<P>
Just a few years ago, buying fresh flowers was a luxury in the
eyes of ordinary residents. People went to flower markets mainly
at festival time or on special occasions, and the varieties were
limited to carnations, roses and chrysanthemums.
</P>
<P>
With the growth of the country's flower planting area, the
number of flowers for sale has soared, and there are now more than
40 different types of locally planted flowers alone. Over 3,000
flower shops scatter throughout the city's streets and residential
areas.
</P>
<P>
The prosperity of the flower market has led to a drop in
prices, making it possible for more and more residents to enjoy
the fresh fragrant blossoms.
</P>
<P>
"Many people have gotten into the habit of buying one bouquet
of fresh flower every time they go shopping," said a flower
dealer. "It's fashionable to take a bouquet of flowers to a
hospital patient, or when going to a party."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, people are becoming increasingly discriminating
about their flower buying: statistics show that the sales of
high-quality imported flowers account for a third of the total in
the city's two major flower markets.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the flower planting industry has become a "ready
source of money" for Shanghai. Official figures reveal the city
has earned more than 10 million US dollars through flower export
every year.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Burundi's opposition parties
have called for the continuation of sanctions against their
country ahead of a regional summit on Burundi to be held this
week, the East African reported today.
</P>
<P>
The weekly newspaper said that the oppositions made the call
when they met Great Lakes mediator Julius Nyerere last Saturday
in Tanzania's northern city of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government of Cameroun, Ethiopia,
Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Zaire, Zambia and host Tanzania are
scheduled to hold a regional summit in Arusha on April 16 to
review the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
A delegate to the meeting with Nyerere said, "conditions are
still not favorable to lift the sanctions."
</P>
<P>
He noted that people are still kept in camps, political
parties are not allowed to operate freely and the parliament is
still not operating well in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi-dominated Burundi government led by Pierre Buyoya
pledged in February this year to hold talks with his opponents
unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions against Burundi imposed by the regional states
are aimed at forcing the junta leader, who seized power last
July, to quit, and getting the rival sides to negotiate an end to
the three-and-a-half year war between the minority Tutsi-led army
and Hutu rebels.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Behind Pakistan's Wheat Supply Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has been facing an
acute wheat flour shortage for a few months. However, the crisis
of wheat scarcity still persists despite some emergency measures
taken by the government to stabilize the situation.
</P>
<P>
Wheat flour, the main ingredient used by the Pakistanis in
making their staple diet, is still being sold at a price much
higher than what has been fixed by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
People standing in long queues at major flour shops in
different cities trying to get the hardly available commodity has
almost been a national phenomenon these days.
</P>
<P>
Millions of people have been affected by the wheat shortage
brewing since the middle of January this year. There have been
incidents in the last few weeks of angry citizens looting utility
stores and even snatching flour bags from government trucks and
private shops.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the crisis has set off a fresh price spiral
especially in the northern regions, with hoarders and
blackmarketeers selling the commodity at almost double the
official rate.
</P>
<P>
The shortage, however, is expected to be eased with the start
of wheat crop harvest and arrival of about ten shiploads in the
country before the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Government sources believe that the recent wheat crisis has
been mainly attributed to the hoarding of wheat by businessmen and
traders, and smuggling of the commodity to Afghanistan and Central
Asian states for higher profits. This has created a somewhat
"artificial shortage."
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that the recent wheat supply crisis has
also brought to light some long-standing problems facing
Pakistan's agricultural sector, including lower productivity,
inconsistent implementation of government policies and lower
enthusiasm of farmers.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's economy depends primarily on agriculture. The sector
contributes the largest share to the GDP which was estimated at 25
percent in 1995-96 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
However, despite being an agricultural country, Pakistan's
imports of various major food items have been increasing in the
last few years.
</P>
<P>
As far as wheat is concerned, Pakistan's total annual
requirement is estimated to be at 20 million tons. However, wheat
production last year was only 16.82 million tons, much below the
estimate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the wheat acreage is also reported to have gone down
by five to six percent mainly in the irrigated areas of Sindh and
Punjab.
</P>
<P>
The import of food items amounted to 1.07 billion US dollars in
the last fiscal year, which was the largest ever in terms of
value. The imported food items include edible oil, wheat, tea,
milk and cream, sugar and even vegetables such as potatoes and
onions.
</P>
<P>
As against the imports, the foreign exchange earnings through
exports of food items such as rice, fish and fish preparations,
fruit and vegetables in the last fiscal year was only about 716
million dollars, indicating an adverse balance of about 300
million dollars in the imports and exports of food items.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Pakistan has been a net importer of food items despite
being an agricultural country. Local economists are of the view
that there is an urgent need to inject dynamism in Pakistan's
vital agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
And to solve the wheat shortage on a more permanent basis, at
least two basic factors should be taken into consideration. One is
to increase per acre yield, and the other is to increase the
support price of wheat to a level where its production is not
squeezed out by any other crop.
</P>
<P>
To increase the per acre yield in various food crops, which is
much lower than the neighboring countries, is believed to be the
most imminent task facing the government.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose the search for new policy directions for
injecting dynamism in agriculture will have to take into account
the urgent need for accelerating research and development.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, farmers should be able to have increased access to
financing facilities for purchasing inputs, machinery and other
items besides financing for marketing their produce.
</P>
<P>
The government led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, which came
to power in mid-February, has emphasized the need to give top
priority to the development of agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the procurement price of wheat announced by the
government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in the agricultural
package early this month will help boost wheat cultivation.
</P>
<P>
However, the problem of increasing the per acre yield of wheat
will not be solved in a short period of time. It needs consistent
efforts by government, farmers as well as researchers for a better
situation.

GENEVA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Canada collected two victories
while the Americans suffered two losses in the women's events at

<HEADLINE> Preparations For Burundi Summit In Arusha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Preparations are going on
for the Fourth Great Lakes Region Summit on Burundi, to be held
in Arusha, northern Tanzania, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
International Co-operation was quoted today by Daily News as
saying that former Tanzanian President Mwalimu Julius Nyerere is
scheduled to submit his report at the summit on the progress made
so far.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the summit would be preceded by a meeting
of the sanctions committee today, while a ministerial technical
committee would meet tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Mwalimu's report was likely to determine the fate
of Burundi, on which an economic embargo was imposed since last July.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere's report will be the basis of deliberations to be made
by the leaders of the Great Lakes Region whether to lift or tighten
the sanctions, he further said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Zaire imposed sanctions on
Burundi following a military coup in which President Sylvestre
Ntibantunganya was deposed and Major Pierre Buyoya brought back to
power on July 25, last year.

<HEADLINE> Chang lifts Third Salem Open Hong Kong Tennis Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 14 (Xinhua) -- It was just 45 seconds that
decided the winner of what the tournament director described as
"the most unusual final in the eight years of the Salem Open
tennis tournament" here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
And it was top seed Michael Chang of the United States that won
the rain-delay men's singles final against Australia's Patrick
Rafter at the 328,000 U.S. dollars 1997 Salem Open.
</P>
<P>
Chang led 6-3, 5-3 and had two match points on his serve in
hand overnight after a heavy shower halted play on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
When the final resumed Monday morning, the fifth-seeded
Rafter, now ranked 43rd in the world, won the first point with an
overhead smash but then his backhand return was too long on the
next point. Chang thus sealed his victory 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Tournament Director Michael Luevano said the final was probably
the first one that has been delayed overnight by rain with a
player holding two match points.
</P>
<P>
But Chang had already showed his form on Sunday with a great
display of baseline tennis.
</P>
<P>
Martin Damm Daniel Vacek of Czech Republic beat Karsten Braasch
of Germany and Jeff Tarango of the United States to take the men's
doubles title.
</P>
<P>
"I do not know how many times I thought about the match last
night," said Chang, winner of the annual Hong Kong event in 1994
and 1995.
</P>
<P>
"There were so many things going through my mind -- should I
hit it to his backhand, should I slice it or serve and volley.
</P>
<P>
"It is strange to have so much time to think about a match,
especially when the first few points are so important. If I lost
them it could have been a turning point in the whole match," he
continued.
</P>
<P>
Chang then mentioned a moment early Monday morning when he
watched television coverage of the U.S. Masters golf championship
where his compatriot Tiger Woods scored a record victory.
</P>
<P>
"He is quite incredible -- it made me think a bit about me
winning the French Open at 17 and how professionals accomplish
things so young. I had the feeling Tiger Woods did not quite know
what was going on and it was like that for me at the French. It
was only afterwards that I realized the significance," said Chang,
winner of the French Open in 1989 at the age of 17 years and three
months.
</P>
<P>
Rafter said that he tried to be calm when remaining part of the
final match resumed this morning.
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to be relaxed but it was over quickly," said
Rafter. "I had my chances yesterday but did not take them. He
took his chances and that is why he is where he is," he
added.

<HEADLINE> India's Federal Front Opposes Move to Dissolve House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- In a significant development,
India's Federal Front on Sunday openly came out against any move
to dissolve the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament) and hold
fresh elections, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement to this effect issued by the leaders of the
four regional parties assumed significance in the wake of a strong
move by a section of the United Front (UF) leaders favoring
dissolution of the Lok Sabha to pave the way for mid-term polls
following the government led by Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda
lost a vote of confidence last Friday.
</P>
<P>
"After a review of the events, subsequent to the withdrawal of
support to the UF government by the Congress party, the Federal
Front leaders have not favored the dissolution of the 11th Lok
Sabha," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The four regional parties of the Federal Front, part of the
ruling 13-party United Front, are the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam
(DMK), Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC), Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and
Asom Gana Parishad (AGP).
</P>
<P>
As the general elections last year resulted in a hung
parliament, the four regional parties have played a major role in
the formation of the UF.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Front will still play a decisive role in any new
political realignment following the Deve Gowda government's defeat
in the vote of confidence.

signed an Investment Guarantee Agreement aimed at expanding and
deepening economic and industrial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed in witness of Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad and his Egyptian counterpart Karmal Ahmed
El-Ganzouri, provides for a framework to further expand the flow
of investment and business activities between Malaysia and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed here by Malaysian International Trade and
Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz and Egyptian Trade and Supply
Minister Ahmed A. Gewili, protects investments by investors of
both countries made prior to as well as after the signing of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
It also addresses the concerns of investors about expropriation
and nationalization and repatriation of investment in terms of
free transfer of income accruing to investment.

It also covers settlement of dispute through the International
Center for Settlement of Investment Dispute (ICSID) or the
Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce or

<HEADLINE> 72 Taliban Killed in West Afghanistan: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-two Taliban soldiers
were killed and 41 others wounded during fighting in the western
Afghan province of Badghis.
</P>
<P>
The forces of the anti-Taliban alliance have been advancing
toward the Badghis capital of Kala-i-Now, about 500 kilometers
west of Kabul, since Saturday night, reports reaching here said
today.
</P>
<P>
There have also been reports of exchange of heavy fire between
the warring groups in the area north of Kala-i-Now, but no figures
of losses and casualties were available.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the anti-Taliban forces have gained more territory
in southeastern Parwan Province in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Masood, former military chief of the ousted Afghan
President Burhanuddin Rabbani, has threatened that the
anti-Taliban alliance would launch a coordinated offensive against
the Islamic student militia.
</P>
<P>
"In a couple of days we will have a meeting in which we will
create a unified command center," Masood said last weekend at a
town in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said the alliance, composed of his own force and troops of
northern warlord Rashid Dustam and Hezb-e-Wahdat leader Karim
Khalili, was preparing to open a new front with combined offensive
against the Taliban, which were already "overstreched" on several
fronts.
</P>
<P>
There had been no such coordination in the past in the
anti-Taliban alliance, Masood said, adding that this was why the
Taliban were able to make such dramatic gains north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
"This year, all our groups will begin fighting from several
directions simultaneously," he said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Sees More Areas for Cooperation With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Finance
Minister Wong See Wah said today that there are more possible
areas for investment in Malaysia by Chinese businessmen.
</P>
<P>
These include resource-based industries if Malaysia's natural
resources such as rubber, timber, palm oil and clay could be
utilized for downstream processing, he told reporters after
meeting with visiting Chinese Vice Finance Minister Xie Xuren
here.
</P>
<P>
Other areas are agro-based industries such as cultivation of
fruits and vegetables and the breeding, rearing and culturing of
livestock and aquatic products, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also cited industrial machinery and equipment such as
machinery and machine tools for metal working and wood working as
potential areas.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, the Chinese could also venture into ancillary
and supporting industries to provide the necessary linkages to the
established larger industries such as the manufacture of molds and
dies.
</P>
<P>
At present, the investment from China in Malaysia is in areas
like chemical, electrical, electronic and rubber products.
</P>
<P>
There were a total of 44 projects in the manufacturing sector
with Chinese investment amounting to more than 610 million
ringgit (about 244 million U.S. dollars) between 1989 and 1996,
which Wong said was relatively low.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the Chinese have also shown interest in the
operations of the Labuan International Offshore Finance Center and
Multimedia Super Corridor in Malaysia."
</P>
<P>
He also said there exists potential for Malaysia to increase
exports to China, which has a huge market potential for Malaysia's
products such as palm oil, rubber and timber.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Xie Xuren, who is on an eight-day visit to Malaysia,
told reporters that he is keen to learn about the fiscal
relationship between Malaysia's federal and local governments and
the management of government expenditure which is under the
jurisdiction of the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said his delegation is also interested in Malaysia's rice
management and purchasing policies, which are under the auspices
of the Agriculture Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Keep Exchange Rate Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's central bank said it will
maintain the current exchange rate of the Vietnamese dong against
the U.S. dollar in order to keep a stable currency, press reports
said today.
</P>
<P>
The current exchange rate is 11,500 to 11,600 dong to the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
In late February, the central bank allowed commercial banks to
vary official exchange rates by 5 percent, which prompted
speculation of a depreciation of the dong against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Some enterprises have started to stockpile the dollar,
resulting in a freeze of bank loans.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the year, the dollar appreciated against
the dong, jumping from 11,100 dong for one dollar in late December
to 11,200 dong. The dollar kept rising, gradually reaching its
current 11,600 dong level.
</P>
<P>
"The stabilization of the exchange rate induces stabilization
of other things including commodity prices and inflation," a
central bank official said.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that fluctuations in the past months were due to a
higher demand for foreign currencies and a growing trade deficit
since the end of 1996.

NEW DELHI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Prices in India ended the

<HEADLINE> New Generation of Scientists Play Major Roles in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A number of young scientists in
China's north port city of Tianjin are now reaching maturity, as a
result of the municipality's "cross-century talent project".
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1995 Tianjin selected 145 excellent young leading
scientists and gave them special attention and assistance in
provision of funds and facilities. This was named the
"cross-century talent project."
</P>
<P>
These young scientists have been involved in nearly 200 key
research projects, and made nearly 100 scientific discoveries
among which 46 won awards from related departments of the central
and provincial governments.
</P>
<P>
Some of these scientific findings have been turned into huge
economic benefits. A new cucumber strain named "Jinchun NO.4"
developed by several young scientists, for example, have created
a direct economic benefit of more than eight million yuan (nearly
1 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The "cross-century talent project" is also believed to have
greatly improved the young scientists' academic level and
researching ability.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, some 80 papers written by the 145
selected young scientists have been published in national academic
journals, and more than 90 papers presented at national or
international seminars.

<HEADLINE> Leftist Party to Continue Peace Talks with Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' major leftist
party, the National Democratic Front (NDF), will continue its
peace talks with the government this month, local press reports
said today.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the NDF and the government next week in the
Netherlands will proceed despite obstructions from some members of
the government peace panel, NDF leader Jose Sison was quoted as
saying in a statement sent to media groups here.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed last month to continue the next round of
talks this month to discuss three important items leading to an
agreement on human rights in June this year.
</P>
<P>
During the coming peace talks, Sison said, the government and
NDF reciprocal working committees will complete the drafting of
the comprehensive agreement on human rights and international
humanitarian law from April 18 to 21.
</P>
<P>
On April 22, the two sides will sign certain short agreements
on security of personal in consultations and initial the
comprehensive agreement on human rights and international
humanitarian law.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also begin to draft agreements on social and
economic reforms from April 23 to 27, said Sison, who has lived in
exile in the Netherlands since the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The NDF has been opposing the government since it was created
by the Philippine Communist Party in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The NDF had been one of the country's major anti-government
forces in the 1980s, with its military wing, the New People's
Army, operating all over the country.
</P>
<P>
But the NDF's strength was weakened considerably after the
government stepped up its crackdown on the New People's Army in
the late 1980s, forcing some NDF leaders to flee to the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The NDF, which began its first exploratory peace talks with the
government in 1992, resumed its peace talks with the government in
January after four years of suspension.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Boy Survives Liver Transplantation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A 12-year-old Chinese boy who
underwent a liver transplant, has now returned to school, 320 days
following the operationa.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said his survival period is the longest among Chinese
patients who suffered from Wilson's disease and received
transplants.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xi was near-death last May when he was diagnosed with
Wilson's disease, or hepatolenticular degeneration, which leads to
hepatic failure, cirrhosis of the liver, ascites, and ultimately
death.
</P>
<P>
Doctors of the Changzheng Hospital in Shanghai performed the
transplant on May 22, 1996. He was in intensive care for 60 days,
and pulled through a number of near-fatal post-operative
complications, such as transplant rejection.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's transplanted organ has functioned normally since his
discharge from the hospital last September, according to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
A nine-year-old girl in Shanghai who underwent a liver
transplant about three months ago is believed to be the youngest
liver transplant recipient in China, an expert on liver
transplants told Xinhua in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 hospitals in Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Wuhan and
Guangzhou reportedly have conducted liver transplants since the
first surgery was done in China in 1973. One of the patients has
survived for about two years, he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, compared with foreign countries, China still lags
behind in the field of transplant surgery," said Professor Zhang
Kaizhi in Beijing Anzhen Hospital.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl vowed
today that Germany will meet the criteria in time to qualify for
the single European currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote address opening the world's largest industrial
trade fair in Hanover, Kohl said Germany would make the first wave
to join the Euro and the scheduled January 1, 1999 start date of
the single currency would be adhered to.
</P>
<P>
Although doubted by many leading experts, including two top
government economic advisers and Germany's central bank, Kohl said
he still believed that Germany would be able to meet one of the
key Euro targets which requires a member state to bring its budget
deficit under 3 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the realization of the European Monetary Union
and the Euro is a central building block for the construction of a
common Europe.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that such a Europe would not do without the
participation of Britain. "I cannot imagine a house of Europe in
which there is no apartment for the British," Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
The Hanover Fair, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this
year, will be formally opened to the public on Monday. With 7,259
exhibitors over more than 270,000 square meters of exhibition
ground, the show is expected to attract 300,000 visitors.

BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Non-government-run technology
enterprises in Beijing have gained in both numbers and economic
scales, after ten years of development.
</P>

The total income of city's non-governmental technology
enterprises reached nearly 30 billion yuan (3.7 billion US
dollars) last year, 38 times the figure when they first got
started ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
Their industrial output reached more than 15 billion yuan (1.8

<P>
URUMQI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Farmers and herdsmans in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region no longer need to walk
hundreds of kilometers to see a doctor as they used to do.
</P>
<P>
All 846 townships in the region have established at least one
hospital of their own. In many villages the farmers or herdsmans
even have their own commune hospitals or clinics.
</P>
<P>
Becauses of historical and geographic reasons, rural medical
and health services have long remained a weakness in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Even by the year 1991, more than ten percent of the Region's
townships had not established their own hospitals. Townships that
had their own hospitals were handicapped by lack of funds, poor
equipment, and backward technologies.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, a decision was made to improve the medical and health
service by the government of the autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
To date, 140 million yuan (17 million US dollars) of special
purpose funds have been allocated by the central government and
the government of the autonomous region to promote the rural
medical sector in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
During the past several years, 104 township hospitals have been
built, and 619 have been upgraded or expanded, in addition to the
autonomous region's efforts to improve the rural medical equipment
and train professionals.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by the public health department
of the region, last year the number of rural patients that visited
doctors went up by 16.4 percent, and the number of patients
hospitalized up 24.8 percent in the autonomous region.

<HEADLINE> Long March Launch Readied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China plans to launch two
domestically made satellites aboard its Long March 3 rockets in
the next few months, according to a senior official with the China
Aerospace Corp (CASC).
</P>
<P>
The Dongfanghong-3 (East is Red) telecommunications satellite
will be launched aboard a Long March 3A rocket in early May, said
Vice-President Xia Guohong of CASC.
</P>
<P>
It is the first satellite that China Great Wall Industries Corp
(CGWIC), a CASC affiliate, will launch this year after two
failures.
</P>
<P>
The Fengyun-2 meteorological satellite will be put into orbit
by a Long March 3 rocket in early July, Xia said. Both rockets
would be launched from China's Xichang Satellite Launch Center in
Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Effective preparation is under way for the planned launches,
Xia said.
</P>
<P>
After the two launches, Mabuhay, a Philippine
telecommunications satellite, is also scheduled, Xia said.
</P>
<P>
With a capability to lift as much as a 5-metric-ton payload
into Geostationary Transfer Orbit, the powerful LM 3B was
developed on the basis of Long March 3A. In its first launch in
February of last year, however, the rocket failed to send an
Intelsat communications satellite into space.
</P>
<P>
After Mabuhay, the LM 3B will have two more space missions to
launch the Apstar IIR of Hong Kong and ChinaSat-1, which were
originally scheduled in early 1997 and in September of 1997
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Apstar IIR will replace the Apstar II that was destroyed in
a failed launch in January of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Last year, after signing the agreement with China Carrier
Rocket Technology Research Institute, the LM 3B manufacturer,
China Oriental Telecom Satellite Company Ltd (COTSCL), owner of
the ChinaSat-1, said the company was confident of the basic
reliabilities of the LM-3 launch vehicle series.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (21-22) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (21-22)
in a question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Will private real estate and properties of Hong Kong
people be nationalized after 1997?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Since capitalism will continue in Hong Kong after 1997
and since the protection of private property is the nucleus of the
capitalist system, the Basic Law has given great priority to
protecting the right of private property ownership for Hong Kong
residents.
</P>
<P>
Article 6 of the Basic Law explicitly stipulates, "The Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region shall protect the right of
private ownership of property in accordance with law."
</P>
<P>
Article 105 of the law again makes this provision: "The Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region shall, in accordance with law,
protect the right of individuals and legal persons to the
acquisition, use, disposal and inheritance of property and their
right to compensation for lawful deprivation of their property.
</P>
<P>
Such compensation shall correspond to the real value of the
property concerned at the time and shall be freely convertible and
paid without undue delay."
</P>
<P>
So private real estate and properties of Hong Kong residents
will not be nationalized after 1997.
</P>
<P>
Question: Will Hong Kong residents have freedom of speech and
other freedoms?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association,
procession and demonstration is a right for residents to conduct
normal social and political activities, and participate in the
administration of local affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law not only provides for the various rights and
freedoms of Hong Kong residents in 16 paragraphs in Chapter Three
but also stipulates that provisions of the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and international labor
conventions that are applicable in Hong Kong remain in force and
be implemented through laws of the Hong Kong SAR.

<HEADLINE> Central China Province to Speed Up Highway Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan Province
plans to invest 17 billion yuan into local highway and bridge
construction projects in the 1996-2000 period, expecting to extend
the provincial highways to 61,600 kilometers by the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
Priority will given to provincial sections of the highway
linking Beijing and coastal Zhuhai in South China, the highway
linking Changde and the provincial capital Changsha, and 15 other
important trunk roads.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a 1.2 billion-yuan highway linking Changsha and
Xiangtan was put to use, the first ever such high-speed
transportation line in the province.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period, the province invested 7.4 billion
yuan in fixed assets in local transportation construction.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 the province listed some highway construction projects,
linking Changsha, Xiangtan and Laiyang, to attract more than 300
million US dollars of overseas investment from international
financial organizations.
</P>
<P>
During recent years, Hunan has raised more than one billion
yuan for developing local transportation networks, stretching the
local highways to more than 30,000 kilometers, including 800
kilometers of high-grade highway, and adding more than 600
bridges.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebel Group Boosts Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Some 5,000 disgruntled members of
a former Philippine Muslim rebel group have joined the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), which still opposes the
Philippine government, during the past months.
</P>
<P>
With the joining of these Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF)
members, the MILF now has a force of 14,900 men, with 9,300 arms,
today's local press reports quoted the military as saying on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF fighters left their group because they do not believe
they are bound by the September peace agreement on Mindanao, said
a ranking military official on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF and the government concluded a peace agreement last
September, ending nearly three decades of armed conflicts in the
southern Philippines between the government forces and the MNLF,
the then largest Muslim separatist group.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF guerrillas who have already transferred to the MILF
reportedly came from the provinces of Zamboanga, Basilan and Sulu
in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The military official said the MILF leadership, in turn, sent
"token firearms" to its new members as "a symbol of support." But
he did not say what the military would do about this latest
development.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a splinter group of the MNLF and currently the
largest anti-government force in the country, has refused to
accept the peace deal signed between the MNLF and the government.
</P>
<P>
The MILF began its own peace talks with the government in
January, but the talks have been on-and-off because of sporadic
fighting between the MILF guerrillas and the government forces.

WASHINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Sixth seed Lindsay Davenport
trounced 11th seed Mary Pierce of France 6-2, 6-3 to win the title
of the Bausch &AMP; Lomb Championships in Amelia Island, Florida, on
Sunday.

The eighth-ranked Davenport, who will move up one spot in the
rankings Monday, is the first American to win at Amelia Island
since Czech expatriate Martina Navratilova in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment in UK reaches 14 Percent: NSBC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain's unemployment is probably
more than twice as high than the official figure shows, according
to a new study.
</P>
<P>
The study, carried out by the HSBC, suggested the true rate of
unemployment in Britain is 14 percent -- or four million people, and
higher than in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The Government announced that Britain had 1.7 million jobless,
or 6.2 percent of the working population.
</P>
<P>
But the HSBC report argued that the Government had ignored
inconvenient categories such as those working part-time, young
people on training schemes and those who have gone on to sickness
or disability benefit rather than the dole.
</P>
<P>
The findings, disclosed by HSBC's chief economist Roger Bootle,
could not have come at a more embarrassing time for the
Conservatives, who plan to move the general election campaign on
to jobs this week.
</P>
<P>
The official figure puts Britain at the bottom of the European
Union jobless league, which is claimed the result of Conservative
policies: deregulating the labor market, opting out of the Social
Chapter and rejecting a minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
However, the HSBC report said that when definitions set by the
International Labor Organisation are used, and the impact of
hidden unemployment is taken into account, unemployment in Britain
could be more greater.
</P>
<P>
The HSBC pointed out that it is much harder to qualify for the
dole in Britain than in France or Germany, and students and those
under 18 are not counted.
</P>
<P>
Differences in the treatment of part-timers -- 800,000 of whom
in the Britain would like a "proper" job -- also understate the
rate, the report added.

<HEADLINE> UK's Pound Probably to Stay High Until Autumn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Although the pound has overvalued
about 18 percent since last August, it is likely to stay strong until
this autumn, according to currency strategists in the City.
</P>
<P>
They said that a fairly stronger domestic demand and the US
rate hike have revived expectations of a risk in UK rates soon
after the general election and this in turn will renew the pound's
upward momentum.
</P>
<P>
"We can carry on for a while yet with sterling," said Ian
Gunner, senior economist at Chase Manhattan in the City.
</P>
<P>
It is commonly believed that the pound is likely to continue to
benefit from its main support: high British interest rates.
</P>
<P>
With base rates at 6 percent, compared with a german rate of 3
percent and Japanese rates of 0.5 percent, foreign money has been
sucked into high yielding pound deposits.
</P>
<P>
The currency strategists said, even if Britain's rates rise
slowly, they are likely to remain well above overseas levels for
the next few months.
</P>
<P>
Rates in Germany and Japan appear to be on hold until those
economies start recovering, they added.
</P>
<P>
Both the Conservatives and the Opposition Party may want to
weaken the pound, but it would be hard for whichever party wins
the general election to do so.
</P>
<P>
But these currency experts believe that if Labor wins the
election, it is expected to tighten monetary policy almost
immediately on taking over at the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
The pound closed in London at the weekend at a
four-and-a-half-year high of DM2.802 against the D-Mark and 1.625
US dollars against the dollar. But they said that by the end of
the year the pound should have fallen to about DM2.62.

<HEADLINE> Athens Moves to Better Ties with Ankara, Skopje </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Greece was preparing to launch an
international initiative in order to improve the general climate
in the Balkan region, including its relations with Ankara and
Skopje, according to local reports today.
</P>
<P>
The Greek newspaper "The Tribune" reported today that Greek
Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos would call a summit meeting of
his counterparts from the countries such as Turkey, The former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Albania, Bulgaria,
Yugoslavia, Romania and Bosnia-Herzegovina, to be held in June in
the Greek northern city of Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos reportedly sent letters to his counterparts last week
briefing them on Greece's plans for such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also quoted the well-informed sources as saying
that Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis wanted a meeting with his
Turkish counterpart Necmettin Erbakan if talks between their
foreign ministers produced some indication of positive intent on
the part of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
It mentioned the three new elements in Athens' position.
Firstly, the fact that Greece accepts direct bilateral dialogue at
the level of a committee of experts; Secondly, that these experts'
committees would be authorized to record bilateral problems and
differences. Finally, it observed that for the first time in
decades Athens appeared ready to discuss the demilitarization of
the Dodecanese islands in the eastern Aegean on the condition that
Turkey carried out similar moves, mainly concerning its large
landing fleet and fourth army.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos today denied the recent press reports here that
Athens had started secret dialogue with Turkey over issues of
their common interest.
</P>
<P>
"I am not aware of any Greek-Turkish dialogue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Athens has repeated that Greek-Turkish relations can not be
improved before Ankara takes its claims to the Imia islets in the
eastern Aegean to the International Court of Justice at The Hague
and finds a peaceful solution to the Cyprus problem.

ATHENS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Defense Minister Costas
Iliadis arrived here today for an official visit to Greece.
</P>
<P>
During his visit here, Iliades is expected to discuss with his
Greek counterpart Akis Tsohatzopoulos the joint defense doctrine
issues and other matters related to cooperation with Athens in the
defense field.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure for Athens, Iliadis said that military
exercises in the framework of the joint defense doctrine between
the two countries would be conducted as planned this year.
</P>
<P>
All infrastructure projects and plans regarding the
Greece-Cyprus joint defense space are being carried out according
to schedule.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Athens and Nicosia are reportedly continuing to
coordinate their positions in view of intensified efforts to bring
about direct talks between the Cypriot government and the Turkish
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have already decided to form a joint
committee of legal experts to study the various matters and to
make proposals during talks aimed at solving the Cyprus problem as
well as regarding negotiations for the island republic's accession
to the European Union (EU).

BEIRUT, April 13 (Xinhua) -- One member of the Israeli-backed
South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia was killed and two others
wounded this afternoon when anti-Israeli guerrillas detonated a
roadside bomb in an Israeli-occupied border strip in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Israeli surrogate militia confirmed that the
bomb was detonated by remote control at 4:30 p.m. (13:30 GMT)
as a SLA military vehicle was rolling on a road near the town of
Tair Harfa in the western sector of the Israeli self-carved
"security zone."
</P>
<P>
The sources said on the condition of anonymity that one SLA
officer was killed and his two companions were wounded.
</P>
<P>
No Lebanese militant faction has claimed responsibility for
the attack, which added the casualties of the militia since this
year to three killed and 17 injured.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or the Iranian-backed Party of God, spearheads a
guerrilla warfare in south Lebanon to oust the Israeli forces
from the border enclave.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite fundamentalist party has apparently turned its
armed muscle at the 2,500-strong SLA militia since this month,
and carried out three major operations against them, in which two
militiamen were killed and seven wounded, but refrained from
hitting the Israeli occupation forces.
</P>
<P>
The last bloody attack on the Israelis took place on March 19
when Hezbollah militants killed one Israeli soldier and wounded
three others.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon said that the Israeli
occupation forces and the SLA militia this morning swept with
machine-gun fire the vicinities of their positions at Barasheet
and Haddatha.
</P>
<P>
They also opened fire at the areas around the villages of
Zibgin, Mansouri and Yater in the western part of south Lebanon,
and no casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"

<P>
CAIRO, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today met with Somali faction leader Hussein Fareh Aideed
in his latest efforts to reconcile the warring factions in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Moussa told reporters that the talks, held
this evening, were important as they completed the Egyptian
consultations with various Somali faction leaders in a bid to end
the raging armed conflicts in the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
"It is crucial that all Somali leaders find common ground for
ending the existing problem in the country," he added.
</P>
<P>
Aideed, leader of the most powerful militia in the southern
half of the Somali capital, Mogadishu, arrived here Friday.
</P>
<P>
His visit followed the one paid last month by his rivals in the
Somali National Salvation Council, an umbrella group representing
26 factions fighting him.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Ali Mahdi Mohamed, leader of Mogadishu's
northern section, also came here to meet Egyptian officials
mediating in the six-year Somali conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arab League Secretariat sources said today Aideed
and his accompanying delegation will meet with the Arab Seven-Man
Committee concerned with the Somali crisis, comprising Egypt,
Tunisia, Libya, Sudan, Algeria, Djibouti and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid, in his
capacity as chairman of the meeting, will get acquainted with
Aideed's view regarding means to settle the crisis and realize
national detente.
</P>

The Arab League will intensify its efforts in the near future
along with many Arab countries and international organizations to
bring closer disputing Somali factions, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1991 ouster of the late President Mohamed Siad Barre,
Somalia has been fragmented into fiefdoms protected by factional
leaders, who continued to fight to expand their turfs despite
several peace conferences.
</P>
<P>
The factional fighting, combined with a 1992 famine, has
claimed about 350,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain Decides to Establish Aid Committee to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain, one of the oil-rich
Gulf states, decided today to set up a special committee to
help Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
As part of the efforts by the island state to support
Palestinians, the Bahraini cabinet decided during a weekly
meeting held in the Bahraini capital of Manama today to establish a
national committee to provide humanitarian aid for Palestinian
people, Bahraini news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The decision came amid anti-Israel protests by Palestinians in
the West Bank town of Hebron because of Israel's settlement
policy in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain has blasted the Israeli housing policy and stressed
its support for Palestinian people after Israel decided to build
6,500 new houses in Har Homa in East Jerusalem, which
Palestinians want to be the capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
The committee called National Committee For Supporting
Jerusalem was headed by Bahrain's Minister for Justice and
Islamic Affairs Sheikh Abdullah Bin Khaled al-Khalifa.
</P>
<P>
It was the second special committee established in the Gulf
region for helping Palestinians since Israel starting
construction of the Har Homa settlement last month.
Qatar set up a similar one named Defending Jerusalem
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that other Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have also taken measures to
support Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> 11 Killed in Terrorist Attacks in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A car bomb explosion killed four
and wounded eight last Friday in Haouch Gros, south of the
Algerian capital Algiers, while seven people were killed Thursday
night by unidentified gunmen on a road between Blida and Medea,
southern Algeria, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
This added to at least 147 the number of civilians killed in
about 10 days in terrorist attacks allegedly launched by Islamic
militants.
</P>
<P>
The car bomb explosion in the village of Haouch Gros, in the
region of Boufarik, took place about 15 meters from the office of
the local self-defense militias set up by the Algerian government
to engage Islamic militants in an all-out war.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two villagers, including 14 women, five children and two
men and one 80-year-old, were massacred Friday night in Douar
Menaa, also in the region of Boufarik, which is only 30 kilometers
from Algiers.
</P>
<P>
Algerian army and the self-defense militias, backed by military
helicopters, launched a man-hunt on Saturday looking for the
Islamic militants who had committed the killings.

<P>
LONDON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The British Referendum Party held
a rally here today to demand Britain's withdrawal from the
European Union (EU), with thousands of people attending.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the rally, the party chairman James Goldsmith said:
"The issue is whether Britain remains an independent and free
nation or whether it becomes a province of a bureaucratic, federal
superstate."
</P>
<P>
"The politicians have no right to give away without our consent
the freedoms that have been fought for generations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Some 10,000 people, mainly elderly supporters, waved Referendum
Party banners and sang the chorus of the party's
specially-composed anthem "Let the People Decide".
</P>
<P>
The party, formed last year and largely funded by billionaire
Goldsmith, says its sole purpose is to secure a referendum on
whether Britain stays in the EU.
</P>
<P>
Both the ruling Conservative and opposition Labor parties say
they will hold a referendum on joining a single currency, but
Goldsmith wants a poll on EU membership itself.

<HEADLINE> Food Prices on Rise in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Prices of basic food items have
risen by about 40 to 70 percent across Nigeria since the
beginning of this year, making life difficult for many families,
especially those with fixed income.
</P>
<P>
This was the result of recent investigations conducted in parts
of the country by the official New Nigerian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In Nigeria's commercial center of Lagos, a bag of rice now
sold for over 40 U.S. Dollars as against 30 U.S. Dollars in
January. Prices of beans and yam tubers also continued to rise.
</P>
<P>
In the northern industrial center of Kaduna, a 100-kg bag of
maize which sold for 15 U.S. Dollars in January now costs 25 U.S.
Dollars, while the same measure of millet was priced at 30 U.S.
Dollars as against 25 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
In capital Abuja, the price of rice and beans are also on the
rise.
</P>
<P>
The price rise was believed to be related to the current fuel
crisis in the Africa's largest oil-producing country, though many
experts said the seasonal increase in food prices was normal.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the National Committee of Heads of
Agricultural Colleges, the 1997 food problem is bound to be worse
in view of the decline in farm harvests recorded in the last
cropping season.
</P>
<P>
Leonard Agbo, chairman of the committee, disclosed that the
nation's food output declined by 21 percent in 1996 over the
previous season.
</P>
<P>
While disagreement exits among experts on the cause of decline
in food production last year, many said the shortage of
fertilizer in the year is largely responsible for the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, investigators were also surprised to find that the
cost of manufactured goods such as milk and sugar still remained
relatively stable despite the price hike of basic food items.

<HEADLINE> Britain Likely to Ban Non-Oil Imports from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The British government may
prohibit the import from Nigeria of non-oil products, mainly
perishable items such as vegetables and fruits, citing its
substandard quality.
</P>
<P>
According to a confidential report sent here today by the
Nigerian High Commission in London, the possible ban would put 36
billion Naira (about 424 million U.S. Dollars) of Nigeria's
annual export revenue at risk.
</P>
<P>
Britain has remained Nigeria's leading trading partner in
non-oil products, accounting for more than one-third of such
exports from Nigeria annually.
</P>
<P>
An official of the British Customs and Excise Department,
Jeffrey Herbert, was quoted by the report as saying that most
Nigerian goods imported into Britain, especially agricultural
products, had substandard quality and were often infested with
insects and rodents.
</P>
<P>
Such products were usually destroyed on arrival, causing
serious losses to importers as well as to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
If the problem is not checked, it could lead to a ban by the
British government on the importation of some goods from Nigeria.

Adamawa state, has claimed 100 lives during the last five weeks.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of CSM vaccine in Koma interland and bad roads

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Air Controllers in Mass Exodus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's aviation sector lost 30
percent of air traffic controllers by 1995 and the situation is
still worsening, the local newspaper Sunday Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of Kenya Air Traffic Controllers Association, Erastus
Njogu, was quoted by the paper as saying on Saturday that more
controllers were leaving the Kenyan Air Traffic Department in
search of greener pastures.
</P>
<P>
At the association's annual meeting held here, Stanley Murage,
Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Transport and
Communications, acknowledged the mass exodus, adding that the
Kenyan government would address the salary problem of aviation
staff.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan air traffic controllers downed their tools last year
for several days demanding better pay which the government had
promised to review and implement.
</P>
<P>
However, Njogu said that the salary hike has not yet been
implemented in the air traffic department.
</P>
<P>
The average monthly salary of Kenyan air controllers is about
100 U.S. Dollars, far below the 2000-U.S.-Dollar salary provided
by other airliners.

MAPUTO, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique Airlines (LAM) is to
formally open a weekly-scheduled flight between Beira, central
Mozambique, and Johannesburg, South Africa's biggest commercial
center, the local Domingo newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
An opening ceremony will be held on Monday, first in
Johannesburg, then in Beira, the report quoted Aderito Macaba,
LAM's Commercial Director, as saying in Beira on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
About 80 delegates from the two countries, including a deputy
minister in Mozambique's Ministry of Transport and
Telecommunications, will attend the ceremony, he said.
</P>
<P>
A Fokker-100 plane, leased from Swaziland last year, will be
used in the Beira-Johannesburg maiden flight, said Macaba.
</P>
<P>
The move will improve air service in central and southern
Mozambique, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, people living there have to travel to capital
Maputo first for flying to South Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new flight is expected to be profitable since quite a lot
of tourists and businessmen from South Africa now intend to visit
central and northern Mozambique and many Mozambicans there also
frequently travel to South Africa, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, Mozambicans now can get visas only in Maputo, but the
problem will be solved soon, he said.

<HEADLINE> Mkapa Praises Nyerere for Distinguished Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Pei Shanqin)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
today praised Mwalimu Julius Nyerere for his distinguished and
exemmplary services to Tanzania and African continent as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tanzanians should honour him by implementing and
upholding all the good things he has left, particularly peace and
nationalism in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during celebrations to mark 75th birthday of Mwalimu
Nyerere, held at Diamond Jubilee Hall in Dar es Salaam this
evening, President Mkapa said the third phase government will
strive to ensure that liberty, unity, peace, nationalism and
self-reliance, among others, are maintained.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa described Mwalimu Nyerere as an unique leader who spent
his lifetime working to improve the lives of the people not only
in Tanzania but Africa as a whole and who did not work for self
aggrandizement.
</P>
<P>
He told over 1,000 guests who attended the brithday tea party
that despite the liberisation of the economy, the government was
determined to bring development to all Tanzanians and avoid
having the haves and have-nots which he said were source of riots
and peace destablization in many societies.
</P>
<P>
The president appealed to Tanzanians to support the government
in maintenance of peace, tranquility and unity, which, he said,
has earned the nation a lot of respect, and a point of referene
by many countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to youths, civil servants and young politicians to
read the country's history and understand it for them to be able
maintain the existing peace and unity which Mwalimuu Nyerere and
other retired leaders and politicians worked so hard to get.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the Tanzanians were born after independence and did
not participate or witness the struggle for this independence
which was fielded by Mwalimu Nyerere. "From expressions and deeds
there are people who think that independence came like rain, so I
advise, youths, young politicians and civil servants to read the
history for them to appreciate and value this peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
In respect to work done by the old people in the country, he
said, he has put in place arrangement of meeting elders in all
regions he toured and asked other leaders to do the same.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa also said during his tenure of office he will
work towards making the country less dependent on foreign aid,
which he said has been Mwalimu's life dream.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Govt Urged to Raise National life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Former Tanzania President
Julius Nyerere today called on the government to find ways to
raise national life expectancy from currently 52 years to at
least 70.
</P>
<P>
"Our people are still dying too young compared to the life
expectancies in developed countries. We are wasting too many
lives, especially children many of whom never live to see their
fifth birthdays," he said at his 75th birthday party here today.
</P>
<P>
"In the South, including Tanzania, reaching my age is a
privilege. The majority of the people don't reach my age, that's
a pity," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said when the country declared independence some
36 years ago, life expectancy of Tanzanians stood at only 30
years old.
</P>
<P>
Organization of African Unity Secretary-General Salim Ahmed
Salim, representatives of United States President Bill Clinton
and French President Jacque Chirac, and more than 1000 other
figures attended his birthday gathering.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes he would see the third-generation government
finish its 10-year term under the leadership of incumbent
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa and witness Tanzania's fourth
president to assume office in 2005.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see why I should not be able to reach 100 years if my
mother has managed. I'm very healthy and this is what the
government should strive to achieve for Tanzanians," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere exhorted Tanzanians to maintain the ten-year culture
of retirement for presidents, saying it is a healthy system.
</P>
<P>
He retired from presidency 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, retired Tanzanian president Ali Hassan Mwinyi said he
wished Nyerere a longer life.
