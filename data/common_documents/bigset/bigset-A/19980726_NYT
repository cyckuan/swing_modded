 REAL ESTATE: NAVAJOS TURNING HOGANS INT B&AMP;Bs   By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. _ A few mles across the sagebrush from the
Navajo Nation Inn, a standard roadside motel on the Navajo
Reservation with wall-to-wall carpeting and remote-control
television, lies a different kind of overnight lodge. It is built
with pine logs, a red dirt floor and _ as tradition dictates _ a
door that faces east toward the sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a parking lot outside, there is a sheep pasture and a
sandstone canyon that cuts through a wooded plateau. Instead of
table lamps and shower, there is a kerosene lantern and a sweat
lodge dug a few feet into the parched earth.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents here on the nation's largest Indian reservation,
a territory as big as West Virginia in the remote Four Corners
region, have created a business by transforming and, in many cases,
building a traditional Navajo home to lodge tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Called hogans (pronounced HOE-ons in Navajo), the homes are used
as part of a cultural tourism package that can include guided
hiking tours, storytelling, and lessons in cooking mutton stew on
an open fire, for example.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the tribe began encouraging Navajos to develop more
of these so-called hogan bed-and-breakfasts by holding workshops
and publishing a how-to booklet. The program is intended to
stimulate the economy of the reservation by relieving a shortage of
motel space and helping Navajos earn money to escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard about the bed-and-breakfast idea I thought, `I
can do that, since I have a hogan and I can do cultural things like
cooking and weaving,''' said Lorraine Nelson, a school teacher from
near Window Rock, which is 160 miles west of Albuquerque, N.M. She
recently began accommodating tourists in a hogan on her ranch. ``My
main objective was to do some fund-raising to send my grandchildren
to school,'' she said. ``I also wanted my grandchildren to help so
that they could learn the traditional ways that I was taught but,
these days, are being lost.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, Ms. Nelson's hogan was comfortably warm
and sturdy as a strong chilly wind whipped down the valley. That
morning, a couple from Brazil had left after spending three days
hiking among the red rocks, singing with a medicine man and
learning Navajo customs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm beginning on a very small basis,'' said Ms. Nelson, who is
limiting herself for now to a few guests a month during her summer
vacation period. ``I don't know what I'm getting myself into.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of staying in one of several hogans on the reservation
starts at about $70 per night for one person. But guests generally
participate in a few activities, which can more than double the
price.
</P>
<P>
   By spending the night in a hogan, visitors experience how the
Navajos have lived for centuries. Though relatively few Navajos
live in hogans today, the structures are still important to the
tribe as venues for many traditional religious ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite encroachment of modernity, hogan building design has
changed little over the years. They are built in the round, using
cedar or pine logs, with mud and straw as insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nelson's is shaped like a tepee, with log poles (some
streaked with white corn pollen from a blessing ceremony) that
family members cut from the forest and walls made from wood planks.
Her family originally built the hogan three years ago for a niece's
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is luminous from two windows, and spacious with a
peaked 15-foot-high ceiling. There is a wood-burning stove, two
cots, a stack of mattresses, several chairs and a wood door where
in previous times Navajos hung a blanket.
</P>
<P>
   There is no electricity, telephone or running water. For now,
the toilet is anywhere outside, though Ms. Nelson is considering
building an outhouse.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Nelson has had only a few guests so far, Loretta Nez
and her husband, Ray Bedonie, a silversmith, have accommodated
nearly a dozen since March after building two hogans near the red
sandstone buttes of Monument Valley, made famous in several Western
films directed by John Ford. The couple call their business the
Country of Many Hogan, and advertise with a brochure and on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tourist dollars are very attractive out here,'' Ms. Nez
said. ``And a lot of people pass through the reservation without
having face to face contact with indians.''
</P>
<P>
   One of their hogans is built similar to Ms. Nelson's, a style
that Navajos refer to as male. The other is built with stacked logs
and a domed roof, a design that is called female.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. Nez, who works in the Navajo attorney general's
office and takes care of the money matters of the
bed-and-breakfast, building a hogan requires months of hard labor.
She said that Bedonie and several family members _ some paid in
cash or jewelry _ cut the wood from the forest 300 miles away,
shipped the lumber by truck and spent a lot of time shaping the
logs and placing them just right.
</P>
<P>
   For the Navajo Department of Tourism in Window Rock, which lists
most of the hogans, the effort to create more is critical. This is
because economic development is vital on a reservation where the
average annual family income is $4,200 and unemployment hovers at
50 percent, according to the tribe. The department also hopes that
more hogans will alleviate crowding at the 12 motels on the
reservation, which forces many tourists to spend the night _ and
their money _ in towns just beyond the reservation's boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year, we have millions of people coming to our
reservation, but they have no place to stay because everything
fills,'' said John Largo, a planner with the tribal tourism
department. ``Cultural tourism is a big thing nowadays and we have
a lot of inquiries from tourists about Navajo culture. They want to
be with Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   But Largo cautions Navajos who are considering opening a hogan
bed-and-breakfast against ``getting caught up with how much money
they can make'' and revealing too much of their culture. Some
traditional stories, he said, are supposed to stay just among
tribal members or be told only during certain seasons. ``You can
give the guests a touch,'' Largo said. ``You tell them just so
much, but you don't go in depth because it's taboo to tell
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, reservation businesses like hogan
bed-and-breakfasts are supposed to operate under a tribal license
and, in certain areas, get approval from neighbors. However,
regulation on the reservation is fairly lax and most owners have
not bothered to apply for a license.
</P>
<P>
   Whether there is enough demand on the reservation to support
more than a dozen hogan bed-and-breakfasts is unknown. But that
such businesses can be successful is demonstrated by Will Tsosie,
who has operated the Coyote Pass Hospitality bed-and-breakfasts for
nearly 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   He welcomes visitors to one of a dozen hogans owned by family
members near the town of Tsaile, 50 miles to the north of Window
Rock near the Anasazi cliff ruins of Canyon de Chelly National
Monument. Most of the guests are foreigners, which Tsosie takes as
a sign that Americans are generally not interested in Indian
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the hogan bed-and-breakfast owners, Tsosie is
selective in the visitors he accommodates. He often rejects
potential guests who do not seem interested in learning Indian ways
and requires others to read up on the tribe before they arrive.
``You just don't call up and say you want to stay overnight,''
Tsosie said. ``We take a few minutes by phone and inventory you and
ask you questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I determine whether we can be of service to you,'' he added.
``This is not for everyone.''

REAL ESTATE: SELLING WITHOUT A BROKER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When eager buyers outnumber anxious sellers _ as is
apparently the case in much of the New York metropolitan region
today _ an increasing number of ``For Sale by Owner'' signs sprout
up on residential lawns.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of making sales in such a fashion is becoming
increasingly attractive as sellers now extend their front lawns
into cyberspace by placing ``For Sale'' signs on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But there are pitfalls along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest blunder most people make is getting into the FSBO
process with a complete and utter lack of preparation,'' said Jim
Edwards, author of ``Selling Your Home Alone,'' a primer for
selling a home without a real estate broker.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, a real estate agent in Norge, Va., who also maintains
an FSBO Internet Web site at http://www.fsbohelp.com, said that the
most important considerations in trying to sell a home without a
broker are preparing the house for sale and then getting the
broadest exposure possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``People expect your home to be immaculate,'' Edwards said,
explaining that if it is not, sellers will probably see a lot of
prospective buyers come and go before one stays long enough to look
below the grit and clutter.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, the value of exposing the house to as
many potential buyers as possible is something many such sellers
underestimate.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said that the best way for a seller to market his home
is to blitz prospective buyers with information. For example, he
said, sellers should distribute fliers containing information and a
picture of the house as widely as widely as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, classified ads should be paired, if
feasible, with a more detailed description of the house on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using the Internet gives you a way to tell a whole lot more
about you house than you can in a classified ad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are an ever-increasing number of Internet sites _
including individual postings, and regional and national databases
_ that list ``For Sale By Owner'' homes. (A search of the term
``for sale by owner'' using the Alta Vista search engine produced
no fewer than 20,000 hits.)
</P>
<P>
   Some larger sites include the For Sale By Owner Network
(http://www.f-s-b-o.com); Real Estate For Sale By Owner, USA.
(http://www.webbrowsers.com) and the For Sale By Owner Real Estate
Listing Service (http://www.fsbolistings.com).
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bell, chief executive officer of Balch Buyers Real Estate,
a ``buyers only'' real estate broker in Mamaroneck, N.Y., said that
a common mistake made by FSBO sellers is failing to establish the
correct sale price.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very common to see FSBOs greatly overpriced,'' Bell said,
adding that overpricing can cause two problems for sellers: First,
an overpriced house is much more difficult to sell, and second,
even if a buyer can be found there is a good chance that the buyer
will have difficulty obtaining a mortgage if the lender's appraisal
comes in for less than the sale price.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bell said, it is wise for sellers to ask two or
three real estate brokers to do a market analysis for the house in
order to determine the appropriate sale price.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that sellers should be candid with the broker and
explain that they are going to be using the analysis to market the
house themselves, at least for a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most brokers won't mind because they figure that you'll give
them the listing if there hasn't been any action on the house a
couple of weeks down the road,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell pointed out that a significant element missing from many
sales by the owner is the ability of the seller to assess the
ability of the buyer to go through with the deal. Most experienced
real estate agents, he said, will ``pre-qualify'' a buyer to
determine how much house the buyer can afford. In sales by owners,
however, sellers _ and frequently buyers as well _ have no idea
whether the buyer will qualify for the necessary mortgage, Bell
said.
</P>
<P>
   In this regard, access to the Internet again proves valuable in
that there are an increasing number of web sites that can provide
buyers with pre-qualification letters. Sites such as Intuit's
Quicken Mortgage (http://www.quickenmortgage.com) permits
prospective buyers to apply for a mortgage on-line by
electronically submitting an application, which is then distributed
to the site's 12 participating lenders. If qualified, prospective
buyers can then print out a pre-qualification letter on the
lender's letterhead and then give it to the seller when making an
offer.
</P>
<P>
   But what is a seller to do when a buyer actually bites?
</P>
<P>
   ``Get it in writing and get a check,'' said William Selsberg, a
Stamford, Conn., real estate lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   To get the offer in writing, Selsberg said, sellers should talk
to a lawyer before they start marketing their homes to provide a
simple binder they can use to formalize any offer they receive. The
binder Selsberg faxes to clients, which is later used as a
framework for a more formal contract, has spaces for the names of
the parties, the address of the property, the price, deposit, the
amount of the mortgage sought, the date by which the mortgage
commitment must be obtained and a list of items included or
excluded from the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The check, Selsberg said, should be for 1 percent of the
purchase price and should be made out to the seller's lawyer, as
trustee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every deal needs some glue to hold it together,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the driving force behind most sales by owners is the
desire to avoid paying the standard 6 percent commission. By
bypassing the broker, the seller of a $200,000 house can save
$12,000.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, however, it doesn't always work that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the buyer's perspective, if the seller isn't paying a
commission, the savings should be passed along to the buyer,'' said
Frank Struck, owner of Realty Network Better Homes and Gardens in
Rutherford, N.J. As a result, he said, a sale by owner may hardly
be worth the time and effort expended by the seller if the buyer
ends up with the savings.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Struck said, sellers should also be aware that
while the Internet may provide a vast audience of potential buyers,
the multiple listing systems in place in most areas generally
result in a more focused sampling of more serious buyers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Struck said, sellers should be open to cooperating
with real estate agents with qualified buyers in tow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a broker can produce a seller for the best price and the
best terms, why turn him away?'' Struck said, adding that in such a
case, the seller would only be required to pay the commission
earned by the buyer's broker. ``And commissions are always
negotiable.''

BIG DAY TURNS SOUR AT DEL MAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR _ The Del Mar racetrack and Thoroughbred Owners of
California added $100,000 to the purse for Saturday's San Diego
Handicap to make sure that drawing card Silver Charm would run.
Here's what they bought.
</P>
<P>
   _ An increase of a measly 656 in on-site attendance over the
same day last year.
</P>
<P>
   _ A last-place finish by Silver Charm, apparently a victim of
respiratory bleeding, a disappointment to the bettors who made him
1-5 and especially the bridge-jumpers who dropped more than
$100,000 in show bets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Big worries about the marquee value of the Pacific Classic, in
which Silver Charm, the 1997 Kentucky Derby winner, was to be the
star attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Unrelated to the San Diego, the day also saw Laffit Pincay, the
greatest active jockey, fracture his left collarbone and a rib in a
10th-race fall. Pincay is one winner from Bill Shoemaker's Del Mar
record for career winners and 202 from Shoemaker's world record.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, a great day to be a Del Mar executive.
</P>
<P>
   The Mark McGwire show had left town, and now it was Silver
Charm's turn to take batting practice, tuning up to face Gentlemen
in the $1 million Pacific Classic on Aug. 15. Not only didn't he
knock his four opponents into the upper deck, he barely made
contact.
</P>
<P>
   He was well-positioned on the outside of leader Mud Route
halfway through the 1 1/16-mile race. But when Hal's Pal applied
pressure from the outside, and Gary Stevens asked Silver Charm to
quicken to maintain position, the 4-year-old didn't respond.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm dropped back steadily and jogged home last, no
longer urged by Stevens, 27 lengths behind victorious Mud Route. Of
the purse, raised to $250,000, Silver Charm collected $5,010.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in 15 starts he'd finished worse than
second.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens was reassuring. ``It's definitely not an injury,'' the
jockey said. ``Not that I felt. All the symptoms would tell me he
bled pretty significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, an endoscopic examination of Silver Charm's
lungs revealed ``very minor'' bleeding, trainer Bob Baffert
announced. But Baffert seemed to think there was something else
wrong internally.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something wrong with his motor,'' Baffert said.
``We're going to check him from stem to stern.''
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis, and how quickly Silver Charm returns to training,
will determine whether he runs in the Pacific Classic. He missed
the $1 million Santa Anita Handicap and Hollywood Gold Cup after
minor physical problems were announced within days of the races.
</P>
<P>
   There were boos from the crowd of 19,231, but not many, a
tribute to his popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to see a special horse, especially one you're part
of, give the public a bad performance,'' Stevens said. ``There were
some boos out there. The horse doesn't deserve that.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Pincay was injured when Sid the Author fell at the start
of the backstretch. Brice Blanc fell from Totana in the same
incident but walked off. Neither horse appeared hurt. Pincay, 51,
has broken collarbones a dozen times.... Sicy d'Alsace ($84.80) and
Corey Nakatani rallied from last and survived an inquiry to win the
$112,500 San Clemente Handicap for 3-year-old fillies on the turf.
The French-bred won in a photo over Miss Hot Salsa just two days
after stepping off the plane.... Nick Canani trained Sicy d'Alsace.
His dad, Julio Canani, trained three winners Saturday, sweeping the
early double with McFig and T.V. of Hemet, and adding Ree Saspri in
the ninth.... Pick-six carryover: $209,286.... Son of a Pistol is
the 2-1 favorite for the Bing Crosby sprint today.

GARCIAPARRA HR DELIVERS RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Showing they can circle the wagons with the best of
them, the Red Sox fought off enemies real and imagined Saturday in
a 5-3 win over the Toronto Blue Jays at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Saberhagen, no stranger to soap opera, pitched seven strong
innings, Nomar Garciaparra, no stranger to high drama, delivered
the two-run home run that broke a 3-3 tie in the eighth, and Derek
Lowe, a true stranger to the winner's circle, was rewarded with his
first win in 13 months against the Blue Jays, whose last 16 batters
went down in order without so much as a loud out.
</P>
<P>
   But the flashpoints of the afternoon were provided by designated
heavy Mo Vaughn, no stranger to just about anything imaginable on
Yawkey Way.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn negotiated a second straight day of mass grumbling by a
sellout crowd of 33,099 by singling home John Valentin with the
tying run in the sixth, then battling back from an 0-and-2 count
with two out and nobody on in the eighth to draw a walk, just
before Garciaparra hit a classic Fenway Fly into the left-field
screen off Blue Jays loser Woody Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo Vaughn's the man and he knows it,'' said Darren Bragg, who
of late had been an invisible man until delivering a two-run home
run in the bottom of the second to wipe out the lead Toronto had
seized in the top of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to come through more often than he doesn't. He's
been around. He can handle anything. He's the man made of steel.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Red Sox are a team wrapped in Teflon, if Saberhagen is
to be believed. Throwing a season-high 110 pitches after the last
two Sox starters, Jin Ho Cho and Steve Avery, failed to make it
past the fourth inning, Saberhagen did not allow a hit after Ed
Sprague's one-out single in the fourth, which center fielder Darren
Lewis converted into an out by gunning down Tony Fernandez at
third.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen dismissed the suggestion that the Red Sox clubhouse
has been turned into a crucible of controversy by Vaughn's latest
public falling-out with the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not concerned with Mo,'' he said. ``I don't know why
everybody else is concerned with Mo, but we're in a race for the
playoffs. That's our concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, what Mo said (about playing next year
for Toronto) was innocently said. I'd have been saying the same
thing if I hadn't signed a contract. Things got blown out of
proportion.
</P>
<P>
   ``People keep nitpicking, pulling things out to doubt us, but
we're concentrating on baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn good-naturedly waved away questioners. ``Let the other
guys have their time,'' he said. ``Braggie, and Nomar. I've just
got to get through one more day.''
</P>
<P>
   The days are starting to get numbered for the Blue Jays, whose
manager, Tim Johnson, had warned they needed to win three out of
four in this series to climb into the wild-card hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, after their second loss in Boston's last at-bat in
three games, they're looking at the prospect of losing three of
four.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got Pedro going (Sunday),'' Saberhagen said. ``I like
our chances of taking three out of four, which is exactly what we
wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe has taken little but grief since June 23, 1997, the last
time he won a major league game. That was when he was a continent
away, playing for Seattle. Since coming to the Red Sox last July
31, Lowe had pitched in 42 games without once winding up with a
win.
</P>
<P>
   That changed with just six pitches Saturday, as he set down the
Blue Jays on three ground balls in the top of the eighth, and
watched as Garciaparra parked a high changeup from Williams into
the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great one, especially for the situation we were
in,'' said Lowe, who was presented the game ball and lineup card by
Saberhagen afterward. ``This is a big series, and to come in and
with six pitches keep the momentum going, and then Nomar hits the
big home run. That was very gratifying.''
</P>
<P>
   The home run was Garciaparra's 18th of the season, first in
three games since being installed in the cleanup spot by manager
Jimy Williams. He, too, paid tribute to Vaughn for giving him the
chance to come to the plate. Toronto pitcher Williams, who gave up
just five hits in 7 2/3 innings, bounced two straight pitches to
Vaughn, missed just outside on ball three, then nearly had Vaughn
struck out on a pitch that was fouled at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The next pitch was low, and the changeup he threw to Garciaparra
was high, resulting in a fly ball that barely cleared the Monster.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any other park that doesn't go out,'' said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has seen few days like the last two, however. ``Mo, the
situation with him, that's one thing I've never seen,'' Johnson
said. ``The guy's hitting .330 and he's getting booed. That's the
first time I've ever seen a guy hitting .330 get booed.''

VAUGHN NOT EASILY REPLACED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The prospect of losing slugger Mo Vaughn clearly is not
causing Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette to lose any sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Quite the contrary. In television and print interviews Friday
night, Duquette sounded nonchalant about the likelihood of Vaughn
departing after this season as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten million dollars will get you a pretty good hitter,'' said
Duquette, asserting that the Red Sox would use the money they saved
on Vaughn to replace him, just as they signed Pedro Martinez to
replace Roger Clemens one year after the Rocket left as a free
agent.
</P>
<P>
   But in the pool of potential free agents that may be available
after this season, there are no former Most Valuable Players, and
only a couple of players who come close to matching Vaughn's
production in the last five seasons: Mets catcher Mike Piazza and
Orioles first baseman Rafael Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   And to sign Piazza, assuming he doesn't agree to a long-term
contract extension with the Mets, Duquette may be forced to pay
much more than $10 million a year, just as he had to pay Martinez
more than double the $32 million contract Clemens signed with the
Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza earlier this spring turned down a six-year, $80 million
offer from the Dodgers that would have paid him an average annual
salary in excess of $13 million, eclipsing the record $12.5 million
average standard set by Martinez. Piazza's rejection of that offer
prompted the Dodgers to trade him to the Florida Marlins, who a
week later sent him to the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had taken their offer,'' Piazza told Sports Illustrated
after the Dodgers traded him, ``I would have never been able to
look at myself in the mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   At 29, Piazza is a year younger than Vaughn, and though he has
caught his entire career, he probably would be open to a move to
first base.
</P>
<P>
   His numbers are remarkably similar to Vaughn's in the last five
years before 1998. Vaughn entered this season with a .310 average,
173 home runs and 548 RBIs and a slugging percentage of .564.
Piazza had a .337 average, 167 home runs and 526 RBIs, with a
slugging percentage of .583.
</P>
<P>
   But while Vaughn is in the midst of another season in which he
should finish well over .300 with close to 40 home runs and more
than 100 RBIs, Piazza has not been producing anywhere close to what
he did last season, when he hit .362 with 40 homers and 124 RBIs.
Piazza is batting .314 with 16 home runs and 57 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   In the 51 games he has played with the Mets, Piazza has just
seven home runs and 21 RBIs and has been booed at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can be harder on me than myself,'' Piazza said
recently. ``I understand the situation. I don't question their
reaction at all.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Sox are looking for another lefthanded slugging first
baseman, Palmeiro fits that description. In the last five seasons,
Palmeiro hit .291 with 176 home runs, 537 RBIs and a slugging
percentage of .543. With 33 home runs and 87 RBIs already this
season, Palmeiro is on his way to his first 40-homer season and
should drive in more runs than any previous season except 1996,
when he had 142 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, who turns 34 in September, is three years older than
Vaughn, who will be 31 Dec. 15. Last winter, he reportedly was
seeking a five-year, $50 million contract extension from the
Orioles, who are expected to try and re-sign him.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro said Saturday that while he can't understand why the
Red Sox would not keep Vaughn, he would not let Vaughn's situation
affect his interest in the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking from the outside,'' he told Baltimore Sun
columnist Ken Rosenthal. ``I don't know what's going on in the
inside. I don't know their situation. I can't close the door on
that, if it's going to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I'm not going to look into that. I've got to leave
all my doors open.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a few other All-Star type players who may be
available, like second baseman Roberto Alomar of the Orioles,
center fielder Bernie Williams of the Yankees, and outfielder Brian
Jordan of the Cardinals. But none of the three are in Vaughn's
class as a power hitter, and the Red Sox probably would have much
more interest in outfielders Williams and Jordan than second
baseman Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   Williams last winter was seeking a seven-year, $77 million
extension from the Yankees before signing a one-year deal for $8.25
million on the eve of his arbitration hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Other potential free agents include Angels first baseman Cecil
Fielder, Cubs first baseman Mark Grace (if the club doesn't
exercise an option), White Sox third baseman Robin Ventura, Rangers
first baseman Will Clark, Phillies outfielder Gregg Jefferies, and
Padres first baseman Wally Joyner.
</P>
<P>
   A few sluggers could be available in trade. The White Sox gladly
would unload $11 million-a-year outfielder Albert Belle, while the
Dodgers would consider moving first baseman Eric Karros or $10
million man Gary Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   But of all the players mentioned above, only Piazza is in
Vaughn's class in terms of charisma. And none of the players have
Vaughn's reputation as a team leader.

PLUMMER BEARS CARDS' WEIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. - The savior and domed-stadium builder really
is just a homebody.
</P>
<P>
   That's because if Cardinals second-year quarterback Jake Plummer
goes out in public, he gets mobbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not every person can understand what it's like when you stop
at Dairy Queen to get a Blizzard, and five people recognize you,''
Plummer said. ``You hear them whispering and yelling and five of
the clerks working in the back run out to just stop and stand there
and look at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, there was the time Plummer and teammate Chad Carpenter had
their dinner at a restaurant interrupted by patrons shouting,
``Jake, Jake, Jake.''
</P>
<P>
   At an appearance at the NFL Youth, Education and Training (YET)
center in Phoenix earlier this year, Plummer became the center of
attention as soon as he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone in the crowd said, `Look, it's Jake Plummer,' ''
Cardinals kicker Joe Nedney said. ``The rest of us were standing
there with pens in hands, wondering, `Where did everyone go?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer almost always is the first Cardinals player requested
for appearances. He can't always accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's neat and that's part of being a celebrity, and if I can't
deal with it, I have only one option _ quit playing and move to the
mountains and become a mountain man,'' Plummer said. ``Other than
getting up from being sacked, it's probably the hardest thing to
deal with _ the public scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   How life has changed for Plummer in the past year. The same guy
who was a confused third-string rookie, nationally famous for
sharing his training-camp dormitory room with a skunk, now is being
asked to carry a franchise on his bony back. &QL; 
Under the gun &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Talk about pressure. The NFL's media site recently asked fans
who will be the league's breakthrough player of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jake the Snake was the winner, getting 19.9 percent of the 3,338
votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake Plummer gave us a glimpse of what he can do last
season,'' voter Gabriel Botkins of Cincinnati said. ``Simply put,
the Cardinals win with him at quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   They haven't had a winning season since 1984 or been to the
playoffs in a non-strike year since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   So all Plummer is expected to do is get the Rio Solado Crossing
stadium/convention center project built, lead the Cardinals out of
the Dark Ages and become the league's premier quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``One rookie year doesn't mean I'll be the next Joe Montana,''
Plummer said. ``Maybe I'll be first Jake Plummer.'' &QL; 
Great expectations &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Plummer won only two games last season, beating Baltimore,
16-13, and Atlanta, 29-26.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he already is a member of the prestigious NFL Quarterback
Club, a business arm of the players union that ``offers corporate
America a chance to tap into the popularity and power of the NFL's
biggest stars.''
</P>
<P>
   The Quarterback Club already has lined up Plummer to endorse
Foot Locker's new ``Q'' line of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a unique combination of attributes,'' said Gary
Gertzog, NFL Properties senior vice president. ``He did a great job
on the field and has generated excitement in the Arizona market.
Jake's performance, coupled with what we expect to be a much
stronger performance by the Cardinals, will lead to increased
merchandise, sales and opportunities for Jake and the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot of traits the average fan can relate to. He's
not as big as some but has youthful exuberance. He has elements
that are exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough losing &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The extra money Plummer will make is nice, but he's more
interested in victories. He played on a 3-8 team at Arizona State
and a 4-12 Cardinals team last year. It's the last time he plans on
losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team last year, at times, I was bewildered at the way they
acted after a loss,'' Plummer said of last season. ``Maybe I was
young and didn't know. But if you lose a game that you had won and
just give it away, you should be steamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when I was third string, I think I was more
mad than a lot of the guys who played in the game. I'd sit on the
plane and just be (angry) how the game turned out. Some of the guys
would be laughing, playing cards or just joking around. That's not
the way I'm going to be. If I ever get that way, it's time to
quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer said he just can't accept losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Winning championships) can happen here,'' he said. ``It's an
attitude, a mind set, not settling for just going out and
practicing but going out and getting something done, going hard
every single play.'' &QL; 
Growing pains &QL; 
Plummer was listed on the fourth team when he showed up at camp in
Flagstaff a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a few months after he was placed on two years
probation. He pleaded no contest to one misdemeanor count of
disorderly conduct and guilty to one misdemeanor assault count in a
highly publicized incident at a Tempe nightclub. He was fined
$1,020 and ordered to perform 100 hours of community service, which
included working with Special Olympics kids.
</P>
<P>
   He completed his community service work, and the probation ended
more than a year early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done all I can to get over the whole issue,'' he said.
``If I let it bother me, I wouldn't be where I am today. I enjoyed
working with the (Special Olympics) kids. I just wish it hadn't
been mandatory.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer's first preseason game was a disaster. He completed only
5 of 16 passes for 52 yards in the preseason opener at Seattle. He
also was sacked once and threw an interception.
</P>
<P>
   That was better than he looked some days in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shaky,'' he said. ``I didn't know what was going on. I'd
(drop back) and start running right away. I had no patience. I was
confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was real frustrated at camp. I would drop the snap and have

BLACK JOURNALIST FINALLY GETS HIS DUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ If you live long enough, someone like Sam
Lacy comes along. He is a black man who has been a journalist since
1930. Yet, it has taken that long for major league baseball to give
him his proper due.
</P>
<P>
   It comes Sunday, and there is no doubt that Lacy, still writing
a weekly column at age 94, is deserving of being honored by the
Baseball Hall of Fame. He will be the 49th winner of the J. Taylor
Spink award. And there will be no excuses made because his body of
work appeared chiefly in black newspapers _ the Washington Tribune,
the Chicago Defender, and the Baltimore Afro-American.
</P>
<P>
   When Lacy was selected last winter by the Baseball Writers
Association of America, there was a large sigh of relief. Better
late than never to honor a man who played such an important role in
breaking the color barrier in the major leagues. In 1997, baseball
celebrated the glory of Jackie Robinson for a whole year. Without
Sam Lacy, there might never have been a Jackie Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never ever thought I had a chance even after Wendell Smith
was inducted a couple of years ago,'' says Lacy, who since his
selection has received numerous awards and made several national
television appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had been so long, and over the years I'd covered other
sports more than baseball. But I'm very grateful for the honor. I
owe thanks to a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   That goes both ways. All minority players owe a debt of
gratitude to a man who showed amazing courage in an era when racial
harmony seemed almost impossible. It has been a long journey for
Lacy. His first exposure to baseball came as a teenage go-fer in
the early 20th century. Lacy was born in 1904 and grew up in
Washington, D.C., about five blocks from old Griffith Stadium. In
those days he shagged fly balls and ran errands for players on the
Washington Nationals. Maybe you don't remember Walter Johnson, Sam
Rice, and Chick Gandil, who played for Washington before he was
traded to Chicago and banned from the game because of the 1919
Black Sox scandal. Sam Lacy does.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought that that the same black kid who hawked
goods in the stands would in 1937 urge owner Clark Griffith to sign
a few stars from the talent-rich Negro leagues and be the first
team to break the color line? Or that a few years later he would
team with Smith, the sports editor of the Pittsburgh Courier, to
select Jackie Robinson as the right man to make major league
history? Lacy loved the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my upbringing that allowed me to do so much,'' says
Lacy. ``My mother was of Indian descent, and I think I inherited a
certain amount of determination from her. The memory of those
players as a youngster stuck with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I grew up, I had seen and played against the old Washington
Black Sox and some of the Negro league players. It started me to
thinking that some of them were just as good as those who came to
Griffith Stadium. I knew that something was wrong. I made up my
mind to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   What Sam Lacy did is one of the most fascinating stories you
will hear about any sportswriter, past or present. Black papers in
the 1930s and '40s were in the shadow of big city dailies up and
down the East Coast. But Lacy used the power of the pen to take on
major league baseball, which in the 1940s had a shortage of talent,
but steadfastly refused to sign players of the Negro leagues. Lacy
covered the National League for the Baltimore based Afro-American,
which followed teams in New York, Washington, Philadelphia,
Richmond, and the Carolinas. His name got around.
</P>
<P>
   At his peak, right after World War II, Lacy reached 200,000
readers through 14 editions that ran six days a week. He had two
stints at the Afro-American. From 1946 to 1957, he covered the
Brooklyn Dodgers and Jackie Robinson. But the BBWAA in Baltimore
would not issue him a membership card. The New York chapter decided
his coverage qualified him for an associate membership, and it was
issued April 3, 1948. Thus he is considered the BBWAA's first black
member.
</P>
<P>
   Lacy and Smith worked hand-in-hand to help integrate major
league baseball. Both chronicled the rise of Robinson, from his
arrival in Montreal to his closing days in Brooklyn. They went to
spring training in Florida, living with and counseling black
players like Don Newcombe and Roy Campanella. It was a relationship
between media and players that could not exist today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wendell was closer to Jackie than I was,'' said Lacy, but we
both had the advantage of being able to live with the black
players. The closeness started before Jackie got to the majors. In
1945, we were in constant contact with one another on the
possibility of breaking the color line. We both agreed on Jackie
because we thought he was the most suitable. He was not the best
player, but Jackie was college trained (at UCLA) and had interfaced
with black and white competitors. Plus, he had military training.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Dodgers left New York and went to California in 1958,
some people thought I might retire. But I went back to Baltimore,
where I have been ever since. Typing is a little painful. But I
still write one column a week. I go into my office on Sundays,
Mondays, and Tuesdays. I leave my apartment in Washington very
early in the morning. I like quiet when I write.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lacy was anything but quiet in the 1930s when he covered many of
the glamour teams of the Negro leagues. The Homestead Grays with
Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson. The Philadelphia Stars, the New York
Cubans, the Baltimore Elite Giants, the New York Black Yankees, and
the Brooklyn Royal Giants to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1937, when I was with the Washington Tribune, I was ready
when I approached Clark Griffith about adding black players,'' said
Lacy. ``His team was just floundering. Why not erase the old
bromide about Washington being first in war and last in the
American League. He told me the time wasn't right.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to tell me that if a Negro came in, there will be
constant confrontations and that it would break up the Negro
Leagues and cost 400 jobs. I told him when Abraham Lincoln signed
the Emancipation Proclamation, he put 400,000 of my people out of
jobs, and life went on.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, Lacy moved to Chicago for four years. By then, he had
added the title of assistant national editor to his resume, but his
heart remained in sports and he never gave up his fight to
integrate the major leagues, which were losing fans and players
because of World War II. He pestered owners and boldly invited
commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis to a 10-minute meeting
anywhere in the United States. Landis refused and went to his grave
knowing that he had kept blacks out of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   But Lacy kept trying. In 1943, after Landis's death, Lacy had
another setback. He was able to arrange an appointment with several
team owners but instead his paper sent Paul Robeson, a dynamic
speaker, in his place. Soon after, Lacy resigned and returned to
Baltimore as sports editor. No one would have blamed him if he
abandoned the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was furious,'' says Lacy. ``I knew his presence would not
accomplish anything. They knew that Robeson had communistic
leanings and could say don't call us, we'll call you. That's when I
went back to Baltimore, where the editor there told me to go for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And go for it he did. In 1944, baseball administrative assistant
Leslie O'Conner granted Lacy an audience. He proposed adding a
fourth Triple A league, made up of Negro league players, to join
the International League, American Association, and Pacific Coast
League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once formed, the new league could be used as a talent reserve
like the others,'' Lacy said. ``But all they did was set up a
committee of Larry MacPhail, Branch Rickey, and myself. We never
really met because MacPhail was all that busy. Also, Wendell was
having problems with black owners about the losses to their ball
clubs if the Negro leagues folded. Finally, Mr. Rickey went on his
own. Wendell and I had agreed on Jackie.
</P>
<P>
   All that was left to complete the dream, said Lacy, was for
Robinson to convince Rickey he was prepared to handle the off-field
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rickey was deeply religious and was worried about Jackie even
though he was a UCLA graduate and in the military,'' says Lacy.
``He was told that Jackie's mother always insisted on him going to
church. That sold Rickey. Jackie was his man.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacy isn't greedy. While accepting his honor, he will give
credit to writers who helped him along the way. He is one link of a
chain. He lived long enough to see the Washington Post hire a black
sports columnist, Michael Wilbon. The Sports Task Force of the
National Association of Black Journalists now lists more than 300
members. They don't play baseball. But they owe a great deal to Sam
Lacy.

ASU PLAYERS WEIGH IN ON CONDITIONING  
 SHOW COMMITMENT IN WEIGHT ROOM

   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Film buff? Grey Ruegamer has seen them all this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Halfback of Notre Dame. North Texas Forty. There's
Something'' ``about Washington''.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Arizona State lost to Arizona in the
regular-season finale, the center popped into strength coach Rich
Wenner's office and said, ``Now what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to begin work for the 1998 season,'' Wenner said.
``He said, `Let's go.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ruegamer's commitment _ which includes five or six days in the
weight room and 1{ to 3 hours of viewing opponents' film _ typified
the attitude of ASU's football players in the off-season, Wenner
and several coaches said.
</P>
<P>
   With most preseason polls predicting a Top 10 finish for the Sun
Devils, players visited the weight room in record numbers. Wenner
saw approximately 55 a day during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were always so many people in there,'' quarterback Chad
Elliott said. ``You could really see the commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   One frequent face was J.R. Redmond, who remained in Tempe this
summer for the first time in his career.

<P>
   SUTTON _ They are playing a continent apart, and entering
Saturday's third rounds of their respective tournaments, they were
both three shots out of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   As Dave Stockton Jr. finished up play at the CVS Charity Classic
at Pleasant Valley CC, he had climbed into a tie for the lead. Dave
Stockton Sr. was tied for second at the US Senior Open at Riviera
in Los Angeles, still three shots back of leader Raymond Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Just three years ago they found themselves in a similiar
situation, with Dave Jr. tied for the lead in the Greater Hartford
Open and Dave Sr. in the lead in the Senior Players Championship.
Dave Jr. faded, but Dave Sr. went on to win by six shots. There is
an intriguing backdrop to this transcontinental scenario: When Dave
Jr. was just 3 years old, Dave Sr. won the 1971 tournament at
Pleasant Valley.

   ``To have my name on the same trophy,'' said Dave Jr., ``would
be special.''
</P>
<P>
   He opened the door when he sank a birdie putt from inside 1 foot
on the 18th hole, a hole that half the field seemed to eagle with
its cozy left/front pin placement, for a 66 and a three-round total
of 12-under par 201. From the press tent, Stockton heard the roar
when Willie Wood sank the eighth eagle putt of the day to match him
with 68_201. Stockton and Wood finished one shot in front of Steve
Pate, who finished with three straight birdies and 67_202.
</P>
<P>
   The rolling hills of central Massachusetts yielded some low
scores Saturday. There were no fewer than 16 players within three
shots of the lead to set up a potential shootout for Sunday's final
round of the 32d and final PGA Tour event at Pleasant Valley. The
grouping at 203 includes Rhode Islander Patrick Horgan (67), GHO
winner Olin Browne (65), and Steve Flesch (67). Horgan and Flesch
joined the party with eagles at the par-5, 583-yard finishing hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the tournament we all grew up hoping to play in some
day,'' Horgan said.``I think it's a disgrace the Tour's not
returning. The bottom line is we could be playing for $3 million
next year and we're not. New England has a lot of golf fans. It's
disgusting. We need a tournament up here. It's about the players.
It's about us. It's not an ego thing. It's a bittersweet weekend
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockton set up his round when he rolled in a 15-foot eagle putt
on the fourth hole, and ended the round free of bogeys with his
tap-in on the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was anxious to get started,'' he said, ``and I left my tee
shot short on the par-3 first hole but managed to get it up and
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockton talks to his father every night, and the GHO
experience, when he saw Greg Norman and David Frost go by him on
Sunday, will undoubtedly come up.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is come out tomorrow and try to play the way I
know I can play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The finishing eagle punctuated what Wood said was ``an average
round,'' up until he sank the 27-foot putt from 9 feet off the
green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a lot of greens,'' he said, ``and I two-putted for a lot
of pars.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood's round started with his only bogey when he hit a 7-iron
over the first green, but birdies on the third (wedge, 20 feet) and
fifth (sand wedge, 12 feet) turned it around and the eagle rounded
it off. The 18th shouldn't be so inviting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pin,'' said Wood, ``will be front right behind a trap.''
</P>
<P>
   Pate is making a comeback following injuries in an automobile
accident after the 1996 Phoenix Open that curtailed his play for
the next 17 months. After a bogey on the 15th, when he came up
short of the green and missed from 6 feet, Pate birdied the 16th
(5-iron, 1 foot), 17th (7-iron, 15 feet), and 18th (two putts, 30
feet), to leave the course with an eagle and two birdies on 18 in
his three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only missed two fairways in the last two days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Horgan, who was tied for the lead with Wood when the
storm-delayed first round was concluded Friday morning, finally
came back from a double bogey he registered on his first hole of
the second round. He birdied the fourth and fifth holes to get back
into it, and a birdie on the 12th moved him to 10-under par. Bogeys
on the 13th, out of a divot, and the 15th, when he took three putts
from 6 feet, cost him good position, but the eagle put him in the
hunt.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a solid year for Horgan, who grew up in Newport,
R.I. He was paired with Tiger Woods in the final round at Doral,
and outplayed him, but a triple bogey on the finishing hole cost
him. He had three rounds in the 60s two weeks ago at Quad Cities,
and finished 66-66-65 last week in Madison, Miss., to tie for
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been making a lot of bogeys,'' he said. ``In my last
three rounds last week I had one bogey and 20 birdies. I've been
close all year, but I haven't been getting the most out of my
rounds.''

SMELLS LIKE TEAM SPIRIT IN FLAGSTAFF

<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. - The contraption looks like a door frame.
Visitors are required to pass through it, single file.
</P>
<P>
   When I did, it beeped.
</P>
<P>
   A Cardinals cheerleader flashed a winning smile. ``Step back,
please.''
</P>
<P>
   Like an airplane passenger who triggers a metal detector,
exasperating others in line, I began patting myself down as Heather
recited the check list. ``Negative verbs? Any unflattering
adjectives?'' Eyes rounded in innocence, I turned my pockets inside
out.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Camp Feel Good.
</P>
<P>
   If Disneyland didn't exist, this would be the happiest place on
Earth. Take a deep breath. Ahhhh. The pine-scented air is
invigorating, as clean as a clean slate.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is last year's 4-12 flop. In its place is a new attitude.
Renewed hope. On the field and in the chow hall, coaches are
smiling and giving the thumbs-up sign.
</P>
<P>
   Like Snow White's friends, the players march to work with a
spring in their step and a song in their hearts. Hi-Ho, Hi-Ho. This
isn't drudgery. It's a golden opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   I know what you're thinking. What else is new? The Cardinals
peddle optimism every year.
</P>
<P>
   Same old cheer?
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, new head Coach Joe Bugel could hardly contain himself.
``Are we excited? Are we enthusiastic?'' Bugel asked. ``You bet!
This is the greatest moment of my life.'' The Cardinals finished
5-11.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Bugel said, ``I'm not saying . . . we'll be in
the Super Bowl, but I know we'll be better than last season.'' They
dropped to 4-12.
</P>
<P>
   During the '94 camp, Bill Bidwell said he would be disappointed
if his team didn't make the playoffs. The Cardinals didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Buddy Ryan said of his new quarterback, ``With
(Dave) Krieg in there, we've got a helluva shot.'' On Dec. 25,
before Buddy's final game as coach, the 4-12 Cardinals celebrated
the Christ child's birth by trading punches in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then. The franchise has turned the page. The
Cardinals see that light at the end of a long tunnel described by
long-suffering coaches and railroad engineers.
</P>
<P>
   The uncrowned champions of the NFL off-season really do believe
they will be a good team, potentially very very good.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Plummer returns. Former Jets standout Adrian Murrell, a
1,000-yard rusher the past two seasons, will be in the backfield
with him. Last year the Cardinals had no running game.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals added speed in receiver/return specialist Eric
Metcalf. They upgraded on defense, too. Rookie Corey Chavous will
join the secondary. Once he signs _ he is the only player who
hasn't _ No. 1 pick Andre Wadsworth will start on the front line,
which should be one of the best. &QL; 
Happiness around corner &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The other night, while cooking coat-hangered hotdogs over the
campfire and singing ``If you're happy and you know it, clap your
hands. . .'' one happy camper predicted the team will win 10 games.
Another actually said, ``Why not 11, or 12?''
</P>
<P>
   I almost burned my wiener.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this team should be better. If not, Coach Vince Tobin will
be hunting for a job. But at the risk of being branded as a
naysayer, perhaps we should take a deep breath and ask ourselves
some questions.
</P>
<P>
   First, who is going to block for Plummer? A year ago the
offensive line allowed the second-most sacks (78) in history.
Ex-Raiders lineman Lester Holmes is the new right guard. The team
drafted tackle Anthony Clement in the second round. But he isn't
expected to start.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hill is gone. Is Ronald McKinnon, small for a middle
linebacker, durable enough to play the position the entire season?
</P>
<P>
   How about safety? Both starters are gone. Replacements Kwamie
Lassiter and Tommy Bennett weren't drafted.
</P>
<P>
   It says here the Cardinals should double their win total to
finish 8-8. &QL;

LOCKOUT OR NOT, PIPPEN SPECULATION LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - As the NBA moves perilously close from wait to wake,
the Suns are forced to play their own waiting game.
</P>
<P>
   What about  &UR; Scottie Pippen?
</P>
<P>
   It's a question within a question within a question. No answer
is possible until the league attempts to resolve the lockout that
indefinitely has tabled free-agent negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But there are as many theories surrounding Pippen as there are
subplots with the league's motorcycle chapter in Chicago. First
 &UR; Phil
 &UR; Jackson on a Harley, then  &UR; Michael Jordan on a BMW. Is there a Bull
without a bike?
</P>
<P>
   A leading theory is that an extended lockout probably means
Pippen will stay parked in Chicago. Free-agency rules are
uncertain. Pippen might be caught with little time and few options.
The Bulls could be his best bet.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Jordan looms as the key factor. Is he going or gone?
He hinted at retirement last week as the team hired  &UR; Tim
Floyd, &UR; whom he has mockingly dubbed ``Pink'' after the rock group.
Jordan's pink slip? Who knows? But Jordan's decision clearly will
influence Pippen, who several months ago appeared to be ticketed
for the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen's decision will be strictly business, his agent  &UR; Jimmy
Sexton said last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the lockout's over, he'll make a decision,'' Sexton said.
``It's not a lock that's he's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Suns, a concern has to be mounting reports that Pippen
has a bad back.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, CBS Sports reported that he visited a hospital twice,
once for an overnight stay. According to the report, surgery is a
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   If the Suns back away from Pippen,  &UR; Tom Gugliotta is thought to
be a possibility. But who knows? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Briefly.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Scott Skiles' &UR; interview with the Bulls two weeks ago has pegged
the Suns assistant as a leading candidate for any head-coaching
job. He has been mentioned as a possibility for the vacancies at
Denver and the Los Angeles Clippers. However, Suns General Manager
 &UR; Bryan
 &UR; Colangelo said that only the Bulls have asked for permission to
talk to Skiles. It's only a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   The people's choice: In at least one poll, Skiles was the pick
to succeed Jackson. In an ESPN poll, Skiles got 39.1 percent of
votes cast by 10,067 respondents. Charlotte assistant  &UR; Paul
 &UR; Silas, &UR; a former Suns assistant and player, was second at 20.4
percent. Floyd was third at 17.9.
</P>
<P>
   NBC-TV, at least, must think the Suns will contend next season.
The network plans to carry the team 10 times in 1998-99. Most
telling is the appearance against the Los Angeles Lakers in the
second half of a Christmas Day doubleheader, NBC's annual opener to
its season of NBA telecasts. The Bulls vs. New York Knicks is the
first game. &QL;

IRWIN IN POSITION TO POUNCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He's back.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Floyd may be the man to catch in today's final
regulation round of the U.S. Senior Open, but Hale Irwin could be
the one to watch.
</P>
<P>
   No player has started his Senior PGA Tour career faster than
Irwin, who has won 17 tournaments and $12,395,864 in just over
three years.
</P>
<P>
   So no one may be better equipped to finish faster _ which is
what Irwin must do at Riviera Country Club if he is to chase down
history and catch Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, who will tee off in today's last group with Floyd, trails
Floyd by three strokes in a national-championship event that has
never seen anyone come from more than one stroke back in the final
round to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a chance, and that is all I ever asked,'' said Irwin,
who has shaken off a near-disastrous first-round 77 with subsequent
rounds of 68 and 71 to improve to 3-over-par 216.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very happy to have fought back to a position where I am
going to be in contention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, who includes three U.S. Open championships among his 20
PGA Tour victories, will challenge today with a game that ranks
with the best on the senior tour.
</P>
<P>
   He leads the tour in scoring, greens in regulation, putting and
birdies and ranks second in total driving. He also holds a firm
position in Dave Stockton's memory as one heck of a comebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton, who won the U.S. Senior Open two years ago at
Canterbury Golf Club in Ohio, came away feeling as much relieved as
elated after what Irwin nearly pulled off in the final round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a seven-shot lead and (after) 15 holes of never missing
a green, I am even par and I am one shot ahead,'' Stockton said.
``So Raymond has to play good (today), no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd said he would continue to concentrate just on the course,
as he has done all week long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hale is an incredible player, but I can't play Hale Irwin,''
Floyd said. ``I have to go out and do the things that I have to do
and play the golf course, not him.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, who also came from five strokes back to win this year's
Toshiba Classic at Newport Beach Country Club, says he wouldn't use
the word ``surprised'' to describe his reaction to being back in
contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can play golf,'' he said. ``I think I have the
ability to come back. I think I have the capacity to deal with that
kind of a score (his opening 77) that is quite a setback.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin also said it's better to be set back early than late.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have to shoot a 77, shoot it in the first round,
because then you have successive rounds in which to try and make
that up,'' he said. ``The later in the week that you shoot a round
like that, the more devastating it can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin also thinks he is helped by the attitude he takes into
major championships. Like Jack Nicklaus, who has won more majors
than any golfer in history, Irwin likes playing in majors and likes
the challenge of how those courses are set up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is going to be some particularly difficult shots,'' he
said. ``There is going to be some difficult situations. You have to
be ready for that.... That is what I enjoy about golf. I enjoy the
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps, he said, that he has the game for major courses, that
he is generally straight off the tee and accurate with his irons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be venturing off into the rough,'' he said. ``You
can't be missing greens. You have to really contain yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, he must do that and find a way to make up three shots on
the steadiest player in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, who says he loves a challenge, should feel right at home.

HAVE PATRIOTS LEARNED THEIR LESSON? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Willie McGinest and Lawyer Milloy didn't have
to learn the hard way what Patriots vice president of development
Don Lowery constantly preaches to his players.
</P>
<P>
   They were lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Lowery warns players to avoid compromising situations.
Unfortunately, nowadays, in a lawsuit-happy world, that means even
staying out late at night. It should be an unwritten rule for all
athletes that sometime after 11 p.m. they should be home. If
they're at a restaurant or club, the limousine should be outside
waiting to take them away from the maddening crowd.
</P>
<P>
   McGinest and Milloy were out one night in late June at a
nightclub having a good time, feeling they had done nothing wrong
or improper. They were actually doing a charity benefit for Jam'n
94.5 FM. Less than three days later, they were accused of assault
and battery by a 20-year-old Boston woman.
</P>
<P>
   For as poorly as some athletes behave _ and we're speaking of
the Lawrence Phillipses of the world _ there are many who want to
profit at the athletes' expense. These are the same people whom
Pedro Martinez referred to in his diatribe this week.
</P>
<P>
   This is why when Boston attorney Harry Manion was asked to work
out a monetary settlement in the incident, he responded with a
resounding ``no'' and vowed the woman wouldn't get a dime from
McGinest or Milloy. A civil suit is still a possibility, so the two
athletes aren't out of the woods yet.
</P>
<P>
   Manion has represented athletes in legal dilemmas for many years
and has seen it all. This one just didn't seem right.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a case of two young athletes going out, acting
responsibly and drinking responsibly, doing absolutely nothing
wrong, and suddenly they're hit with charges like that,'' Manion
said. ``I told Willie that he had a malicious prosecution case that
he could bring against the woman. He spent a lot of money in hiring
us to defend him and he had the right to bring suit, but Willie
just decided he didn't harbor any ill will against the woman and
just wanted to put it behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing wrong with McGinest or Milloy or Mo Vaughn
going out at night. They are young, single, rich men. But this
latest incident shows that even when everything is done properly _
including getting space in the VIP section to avoid the rest of the
crowd, drinking responsibly, and acting like gentlemen _ things can
get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletes are being targeted, there's no question about that,''
said Manion, who worked on the case with lawyer Ralph Boyd, who
represented Milloy. ``There are certainly a lot of them that bring
it on themselves, but nowadays an athlete has to take extra
precaution. He has to be extra careful for his well-being and his
livelihood.''
</P>
<P>
   Manion was in constant contact with the Patriots for many weeks
on the case. He presented Bob Kraft, Lowery, and other officials
all the facts and the Patriots stuck by their players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriots were tremendous throughout the process,'' said
Manion. ``They have an understanding what can happen out there and
they knew, based on all the facts, their players had done nothing
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as strongly, they stood behind Drew Bledsoe, Max Lane, and
Todd Rucci during the Paradise Club incident, where lawsuits are
still pending. All three players are now more cautious of their
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Lowery's work with the players involves educating them
about the perils awaiting them off the field. He goes through the
entire NFL program currently in place, touching on issues of
dealing with people who don't have the players' best interest at
heart. That umbrella covers everything from groupies, to not being
out too late, watching the people they associate with, and
certainly the pitfalls of alcohol and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The team can use Dave Meggett's Toronto incident as a firsthand
example.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all targets,'' said McGinest. ``It's like we have a
bull's-eye on our back. It's unfortunate it has to be that way. It
seems like all we do for the kids in the community doesn't mean
anything. Someone is always trying to get us.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest signed a five-year, $25 million contract in the
offseason, complete with an $8 million signing bonus. He is indeed
a walking target for someone looking to make money. This is why
players have to sacrifice a night on the town for a night of
Blockbuster and popcorn. The other night at the Patriots' camp, a
group of players sat around the TV watching ``Monday Nitro,'' a TNT
wrestling show. Some players go to the movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think professional athletes today must be conscious of where
they are going and what they are doing,'' said Patriots coach Pete
Carroll. ``They have to be careful of their surroundings. We start
every camp with that kind of conversation. When the situations pop
up when you have a chance to teach, you have to capture the moment.
Here's another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone can be squeaky clean all the time. Everyone has
their irresponsible moments. It's hard to tell single men in their
20s to be hermits.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes the price of being young is high _ a career, a
life.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Stay home.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New Patriots running back  &UR; Robert Green  &LR; bears an incredible
likeness to Meggett. He's the same size (5 feet 8 inches) and the
Patriots have shown a sense of humor by issuing him Meggett's No.
22. If you saw Green practice, you'd swear Meggett was back. Like
Meggett, he's from Maryland, and he attended William &AMP; Mary.
Meggett went to Towson State. ``It's been pretty good so far,''
Green said. ``They've kept all of the Meggett-lookalike things to
themselves for the moment.'' A free agent, Green was thinking about
starting a day care center with his wife if football didn't work
out. He said the Patriots want him to work closely with the young
runners and push them. ``With just a little guidance here and there
they should be fine,'' said Green. ``They have a lot of talent.''
... If  &UR; Yatil Green &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Miami's first-round pick last year who broke
his leg and missed the season, can make it through the year, it
will give  &UR; Dan Marino  &LR; his best deep threat since the  &UR; Mark
Clayton-Mark Duper  &LR; days. Green, 6-2, 205 pounds, is still limping,
but word is he may be limping for the rest of his playing days, and
the injury should not affect his ability to make big plays ... If
 &UR; Greg Lloyd  &LR; has something left, the Carolina Panthers may have
brought their defense back to where it was two years ago. Lloyd
played for  &UR; Dom Capers  &LR; during the coach's days as defensive
coordinator in Pittsburgh. A  &UR; Kevin Greene &LR; -Lloyd pass rush could
be devastating. Lloyd received an estimated $500,000 guaranteed
salary with the chance to earn $1.5 million ...  &UR; Al Lerner's
 &LR; ownership group in Cleveland is the front-runner to land the
Browns expansion franchise that begins play in '99. Lerner, who is
said to be worth $2.5 billion, is also close to the top political
figures in Cleveland.  &UR; Carmen Policy &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who left the 49ers to join
the group, wouldn't have done so if he didn't know Lerner's group
had the best shot. Former Browns quarterback  &UR; Bernie Kosar  &LR; is also
part of the group ...  &UR; Jerome  &LR; ``The Bus''  &UR; Bettis  &LR; is pretty
realistic about the Steelers. Having lost  &UR; Yancey Thigpen &LR; , &UR; Chad
Scott,  &LR; Lloyd,  &UR; John Jackson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Myron Bell &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Bettis doesn't
feel the Steelers are the team to beat in the AFC. ``We're one of
the best teams, but we have too many questions,'' said Bettis.
``Until we answer those questions we can't be the team. Denver is
that right now because they've won a Super Bowl and they have most
of their team intact.'' ... All eyes will be on Detroit quarterback
 &UR; Scott Mitchell  &LR; this year. Under intense criticism for his play a
year ago, Mitchell has reported to Lions camp at about 230 pounds,
20 pounds lighter than last year. The Lions want Mitchell to go
back to being mobile, so he can roll out of the pocket and away
from harm. ``Everyone's going to see Scott Mitchell in the best
shape he's ever been in,'' said strength coach  &UR; Adrian Crook &LR; . In
the meantime, the Lions will be force-feeding rookie QB  &UR; Charlie
Batch  &LR; the system, hoping he catches on fast. ``He's picking things
up well,'' said Lions coach  &UR; Bobby Ross &LR; . ``He's got a good idea of
what to do with our running game.''... Philadelphia's  &UR; Mike Mamula
 &LR; may be battling to keep his right defensive end job. For one, the
right side is  &UR; Hugh Douglas's  &LR; natural position, and for another,
 &UR; Greg Jefferson &LR; , &UR; Jon Harris &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Al Wallace  &LR; could all have big
camps and force the move. Another sleeper in the group is Delaware
State's  &UR; Uhutu Hamiter &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who played this spring for the London
Monarchs ... It seems as though  &UR; Mike Tomczak  &LR; has been fighting
for a job his entire career. Tomczak, who lost his job to  &UR; Kordell
Stewart &LR; , &UR;  &LR; has  &UR; Mike Quinn  &LR; breathing down his neck in Pittsburgh.
While Quinn has really come on, he still can't offer everything
Tomczak does in helping Stewart with game preparation ... As
impressive as  &UR; Jim Murphy  &LR; has been in the Patriots camp, there
probably isn't going to be room for the former Northeastern
standout ...  &UR; Warren Moon  &LR; is 41 and wants a two- or three-year
deal with the Seahawks. What's the problem? Moon has saved the
Seahawks, even at his tender age, and plays like he's 31. He's
scheduled to make $550,000, but wants around $4 million a year.
It's not a massive amount for your starting quarterback ... Talk
shows in Miami are all over  &UR; Jimmy Johnson  &LR; because he hasn't led
the Dolphins to a Super Bowl. Don't think that Johnson isn't aware
of the criticism and that he'll be turning up the heat a little
higher this year to make it to a Super Bowl being held in his
backyard ... Greene, who dabbles in professional wrestling for
World Championship Wrestling in the offseason, and WCW champion
 &UR; Bill Goldberg  &LR; were roommates with the Rams ... The Bills had at
least a respectable defense going for them, but now with the free
agent loss of  &UR; Bryce Paup  &LR; and the announcement that  &UR; Chris
Spielman &LR;  will take a year off to be with his ill
wife, &UR;  &LR; second-rounder  &UR; Sam Cowart  &LR; will have to begin a new era in
Buffalo. Spielman, 32, made the announcement after learning his
wife had breast cancer, and he wanted to be there for her and his
small children.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that the league's top pick,  &UR; Peyton Manning &LR; , &UR;  &LR; is
still without a contract? Both Manning's agent and the Colts
management know how important the rookie quarterback is to the
franchise, yet negotiations are still going on.  &UR; Ryan Leaf &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the
second overall pick, ended his holdout Saturday night, and will
report to Chargers camp Sunday ... Patriot fans had to like
undersized linebacker  &UR; Bernard Russ  &LR; in a shoving match with 6-7,
340-pound  &UR; Ed Ellis  &LR; the other day. Ellis has Russ by 100 pounds,
but Russ never backed down ... Second-round pick  &UR; Tony Simmons  &LR; can
flat-out run, he's caught just about every ball thrown his way, and
he may surprise a lot of people before the camp is over. He can
also block, which is very important for the  &UR; Ernie Zampese  &LR; offense
to work ... Expect the next round of contract talks between  &UR; Ted
Johnson's  &LR; agent,  &UR; Jack Mills &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and the Patriots, to take place in
San Francisco before the Patriots-49ers exhibition game ...
Patriots defensive coordinator  &UR; Steve Sidwell  &LR; on those tying to
break into the second-string defense: `` &UR; Mark Tate &LR; , &UR; Kato
Serwanga &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Terry Billups  &LR; all have a chance to stay.  &UR; Chris
Canty  &LR; has done a very good job, but he's worn out, there's no
question. He takes a lot of snaps. We just have to do a better job
of taking care of him. You're always looking for guys who can step
in and fit in where they might not fit in a regular scheme. There's
also competition up front. I'm impressed with (defensive end
 &UR; Greg &LR; )  &UR; Spires &LR; . He's shown a great deal of pass-rushing
ability.''... &UR; Glenn Foley  &LR; is going to be the answer for  &UR; Bill
Parcells &LR; . He's tough, feisty, and can really throw the ball. His
offseason conditioning was outstanding. Now he has to stay
injury-free ... Jets defensive personnel are amazed at  &UR; Curtis
Martin's  &LR; speed and quickness and claim he is head and shoulders
above  &UR; Adrian Murrell &LR; . &UR;  &LR; One thing Parcells hopes to change is this
alarming statistic: 55 percent of Martin's runs last year were for
3 yards or fewer ...  &UR; Adam Vinatieri  &LR; thinks he's corrected
mechanical problems that reduced his yardage on kickoffs last year.
Vinatieri's agents, Woolf Associates, will resume talks on a
long-term deal for the kicker this week ... The best hit of the
Patriots camp is one fullback  &UR; Tony Carter  &LR; put on Johnson during a
drill on Thursday. The hit was so hard, it may have hurt Carter's
lower back ... ...The Patriots may soon learn the six-year, $36
million deal Martin received from the Jets could be commonplace.
Denver saw the light and decided to rip up  &UR; Terrell Davis's  &LR; deal
and reward him with his third contract since coming into the league
in 1995 as a sixth-round pick. Davis received $56 million for nine
years with an $11 million signing bonus. Davis probably won't be
around in nine years, but it was good business to not only match
the marketplace but go a little beyond with such a valuable player
...  &UR; Tony Eason  &LR; has the highest quarterback rating in Patriots
history _ 80.6, and  &UR; Drew Bledsoe  &LR; is second with 74.9 ...
Little-known fact:  &UR; Scott Zolak's  &LR; father,  &UR; Paul &LR; , &UR;  &LR; produced two
professional quarterbacks at Ringgold (Pa.) High. One is obviously
his son. The other?  &UR; Joe Montana &LR; . ``It's funny, sometimes I can
remember vividly when Joe was 17 and our quarterback and kicker,
and Scott was about 7 years old and he'd be the kid who'd run out
on the field to get the kicking tee after Joe used it.'' ...
Amazing: House Speaker  &UR; Tom Finneran  &LR; wants a ``guide'' or a clue
on how to resolve the Patriots stadium issue.

LACK OF EXECUTION DEADLY TO WILLIAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Woody Williams knew exactly the pitch he wanted to
throw to Nomar Garciaparra. He knew exactly where he wanted it to
be, and he knew exactly how he wanted to execute it. But what
Williams didn't know _ quite exactly _ was the damage Garciaparra
would do to his changeup in the bottom of the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``First time up, I got him out with that pitch,'' Williams said.
``I'm not saying that if I make my pitch that I get him out, but
it's the pitch I wanted to throw and I believed in it, but I didn't
execute and do what I wanted to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied, 3-3, Garciaparra delivered the winning blow
off Williams's 1-0 delivery with a towering two-run homer that
sailed 360 feet into the screen in left. It lifted Boston to a 5-3
victory over the Blue Jays and, more important, enabled the Red Sox
to extend their lead to 8 1/2 games over Toronto in the American
League wild-card chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``This series, really, it would've been nice to come in and play
a little bit better,'' said Williams, who absorbed the loss (9-5,
4.12 ERA) after going 7 2/3 innings and allowing nine hits and five
earned runs. ``It would've been nice to be up in the series, 2-1,
instead of being down, 1-2. But this series is no different from
any others. You've got to go out and take care of business each and
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Blue Jays arrived in Boston, they hoped to take at
least three in this four-game set. But Toronto dropped behind the
Orioles as the closest wild-card challenger after suffering a
stinging 8-7 loss to the Red Sox Thursday night in 10 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite dropping below .500 at 52-53, the Blue Jays'
clubhouse did not appear to be in the grips of separation anxiety.
Quite the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't put everything on one series,'' said Toronto manager
Tim Johnson. ``We've still got a lot of games left. And they still
got a lot of games left. We can pick up games when we win and they
lose. Hey, they're going to face some good teams, too, you know?
They're going to the West Coast (for a 12-game road trip beginning
Tuesday in Oakland) after us and they're going to face some damn
good ballclubs, so nobody's going to give anybody anything,
especially when everybody's fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're out of it when the numbers say you can't make it
anymore,'' he added. ``I've never been a negative person,
especially the way I grew up in Los Angeles and the way I'd been in
the Marine Corps. Hey, you've gotta believe until you're completely
out of it by the numbers. So until then, we're going to continue to
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   When he emerged from the manager's office, Johnson conveyed that
message to Williams, who sat on an equipment trunk near his locker
with his right ankle propped up and an ice pack bandaged to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of stepped on Darren Lewis's foot at first,'' said
Williams, referring to his attempt to cover the bag in the eighth
when Lewis reached on a head-first slide after bunting one down the
line. ``That's why he was kind of hobbling around there. I think I
spiked him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Garciaparra returned the favor later in the inning by
spanking Williams's changeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to get down,'' Williams said. ``I know we have
to take care of ourselves, and it would've been nice to win Sunday.
But every game's important, whether you're playing Boston or
someone else.''

A BUMPER CROP SHOULD HAVE ROSE  
 HALL OF FAME MAY ADMIT SEVERAL RE CENT STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ(at) 
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame will welcome  &UR; Don Sutton this afternoon. It's
been years since more than one contemporary player has landed in
Cooperstown in the same season, but that will surely change next
summer when as many as five modern-era players could wind up being
inducted into baseball's hallowed shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Next year's bumper crop is led by pitcher  &UR; Nolan Ryan and third
baseman  &UR; George Brett, both of whom should easily make it into the
Hall of Fame in their first attempt. Shortstop-turned-outfielder
 &UR; Robin
 &UR; Yount, who like Brett is a member of the exclusive 3,000-hit club,
should also make his way into Cooperstown next summer as a rare
first-ballot member.
</P>
<P>
   The two players on the bubble, at least for next year, are
catcher
 &UR; Carlton Fisk, who caught more games than anyone else ever has, and
outfielder  &UR; Dale Murphy, whose chances may be severely hindered by
his non-flashy style and the fact that he played for so many losers
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains that the one player who belongs in the baseball
Hall of Fame who remains unwelcome is  &UR; Pete Rose. Yes, it's a tired
subject. But the majority of baseball fans remain convinced that
Rose should take his place in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   Rose wants to meet with newly elected commissioner  &UR; Bud Selig to
see what Rose needs to do to gain favor with the baseball
hierarchy. At the top of the list is that Rose must admit he
wronged the game by betting on baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The strong belief is that there is conclusive evidence to prove
Rose did, indeed, gamble on major league baseball games. It's
hot-button topic that brings out deep-seated passion from most
serious baseball fans.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that most fans want Rose in the Hall, as a recent
poll proved. It's where the player with the most hits in the
illustrious history of the game belongs. No question.
</P>
<P>
   Until baseball and Rose come to an agreement that allows Charlie
Hustle to be enshrined into the hallowed halls, the game will have
an ugly blemish on its face.
</P>
<P>
   Do whatever needs to be done to get Rose into Cooperstown. &QL; 
Oh, Andruw, Andruw, Andruw &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves, specifically Manager  &UR; Bobby Cox, reached the
boiling point with the extremely talented, but seemingly immature,
center fielder  &UR; Andruw Jones last week.
</P>
<P>
   After the 21-year-old Jones loafed after a soft line drive that
just about everyone agreed should have been caught, Cox pulled him
from the game in the middle of the inning, hoping it would be the
tonic to kick-start the talented kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like he's a real bad guy or anything like that,'' Cox
said. ``He's not. It's just that there are certain ways you play
the game, and that's the way it is. If you don't want to do it,
then go home. It's that simple to me. You don't like the game?
Quit! Leave!''
</P>
<P>
   Cox followers were stunned by his words. This is a manager known
to protect his players to the end.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Jones has stayed out of trouble away from the field,
he has been a habitual offender in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   He was aired out in the tunnel at Philadelphia and benched for a
game after not hustling after a single, allowing a run to score. He
missed the team picture. He arrived late after the All-Star Game
and has been fined by Cox to the point where ``he's about to go
broke already,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to get him going, not sit him down,'' Cox said.
``That's a manager's job _ get his butt in gear and playing on the
same page as everybody else, abiding by the same rules . . . I have
never tolerated anything. I can't stand that, and I won't tolerate
it.'' &QL; 
Dodging in and out &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles may have been 16-11 since replacing Manager  &UR; Bill
 &UR; Russell and General Manager  &UR; Fred Claire with  &UR; Glenn Hoffman and
 &UR; Tommy
 &UR; Lasorda, respectively, but the recent winning did not stop star
outfielder  &UR; Gary Sheffield from challenging Lasorda to do more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're really serious about winning, about catching the
Giants and San Diego, the time to make that move is now,''
Sheffield said of acquiring a big-time starter to take the place of
injured No. 1 starter  &UR; Ramon Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to have that stopper, that veteran guy,''
Sheffield added. ``When we had Ramon Martinez, he set the stage for
everybody else. Ramon, a guy like that, makes a big difference. He
can end losing streaks. He can extend winning streaks. Without him,
or a guy like him, they've got to carry the load. And that's asking
a lot when they're all pretty young themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the Dodger players' wish list is Seattle's  &UR; Randy
 &UR; Johnson. Lasorda is very aware that if the Dodgers manage to make
the playoffs this season, the interim label will be stripped away
and he will have his dream job of Dodgers GM. &QL; 
Red with anger &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati GM  &UR; Jim Bowden was awfully upset after learning that
the Reds extended pitcher  &UR; Pete Harnisch's contract without his
knowledge. In a disturbingly odd trend (remember  &UR; Fred Claire), the
GM was kept out of the loop as contract talks wound down.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, who pulled Harnisch off the scrap heap last off-season,
badly wanted to trade the right-handed pitcher for future help for
one of the most depleted organizations in baseball. Plenty of other
clubs seemed willing to part with prized prospects in exchange for
getting Harnisch for the stretch drive.
</P>
<P>
   But managing executive  &UR; John Allen, the guy appointed to take
over for the suspended &UR; Marge Schott, backdoored Bowden and
finalized the three-year deal with Harnisch's agent,  &UR; Gregg
Clifton.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden learned of the deal when Harnisch approached him before a
game last week and the pitcher told Bowden he was ``glad we got the
deal done.'' Bowden was left in an awkward position, not being able
to announce the deal because he could not confirm it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do baseball deals,'' Allen said. ``Jim does a very
good job of that. I'm not taking over as GM. It was just the timing
and Jim missing his voice mail (where the message was left). There
is no usurping of authority or change or responsibility.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE HIT LIST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What if she lived next door to his favorite
 &UR; restaurant?: As part of the restraining order he agreed to with
former girlfriend  &UR; Alina Elgarresta, Florida pitcher  &UR; Livan
Hernandez cannot linger when playing at the par-4 third hole at the
Biltmore Golf Course in Coral Gables, Fla. It's the hole that backs
up to her family's home.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What's next, fuchsia with silver highlights?: Tampa Bay's  &UR; Tony
Saunders started the season with brown hair, its true color. After
going 1-9 he went trendy and dyed it platinum blond. A few winless
starts later, Saunders is now walking around with auburn-colored
hair.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: ``Disco'' Dan Ford.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hey, if we weren't human we'd be machines: Sorry for the error.
As several of you pointed out, the direct descendant of hockey
legends  &UR; Bernie ``Boom Boom'' Geoffrion and  &UR; Howie Morenz is
 &UR; Shane Monahan, not  &UR; Rico Rossy. My bad.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What if they decide to add a Starbucks?: The budget for Safeco
Stadium, soon-to-be new home of the Seattle Mariners, has gone from
an initial quote of $320 million to $380 million to $417 million to
its current expected cost of $498 million.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Maybe once baseball leaves, this guy will get it: Quebec
Premier  &UR; Lucien Bouchard will not allow anyone helping bankroll
Montreal's bid to build a new baseball stadium to claim a tax
exemption. &QL; EXTRA BASES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's  &UR; Paul Molitor, a sure-fire first-ballot Hall of
Famer, collected hit No. 3,256 last week, breaking the tie he had
with  &UR; Eddie
 &UR; Murray on the all-time hits list. Molitor is in sole possession of
10th place on that esteemed list. Willie Mays is next.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kevin Tapani, who became the first Cubs pitcher since
 &UR; Burt Hooten in 1972 to hit a grand slam, is 20-9 in 34 starts for
Chicago. He did not begin his Cubs career until July 23, 1997
because of surgery on his pitching hand.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago White Sox first baseman  &UR; Wil Cordero, a convicted
wife-beater, was taken out of a game last weekend because he
apparently missed one of his mandatory anger-management counseling
classes.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's offense ranks last in home runs (65 before the
weekend). To compensate, the Pirates have been running more than
anyone. The club's .776 success rate (104 for 134) on stolen bases
is the best in ball.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's 1-11 season-series record against San Diego this
year is the Reds' worst against any one club since divisional play
began in 1969. &QL; THE RUMOR
MILL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis'  &UR; Brian Jordan, a free agent after this season, would
be a near-perfect fit in San Francisco's outfield for the remainder
of the season. As much as Jordan would welcome the chance to play
for  &UR; Dusty
 &UR; Baker, a deal seems a distant possibility because the Cardinals,
who are going nowhere, are asking an awful lot in return.
</P>
<P>
   White Sox third baseman  &UR; Robin Ventura, one of the classiest
players in the game, has all but declared he will be traded soon.
``I don't know for sure, but the questions now seem to be when and
where,'' he said after meeting with chairman  &UR; Jerry Reinsdorf.
</P>
<P>
   With  &UR; Pete Harnisch agreeing to stay in Cincinnati, the Anaheim
Angels are counting on a pair of injured pitchers to bail them out
down the stretch.  &UR; Allen Watson and  &UR; Jack McDowell are being
counted on as the saviors for the barely treading water Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's management is subtly suggesting to reliever
 &UR; Mark Wohlers that another stint in the minors might be necessary.
Wohlers, who allowed five runs in 1 innings, did not take kindly to
the remarks. He then went out and had a 1-2-3 inning Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota veteran pitchers  &UR; Mike Morgan and  &UR; Bob
 &UR; Tewksbury may have been taken off the trade market last week after
each landed on the disabled list. The pair of nearly 40-year-olds
is scheduled to be activated July 30, one day before the trading
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   With the Twins probably not able to move either Tewksbury or
Morgan, their attention has turned to trying to trade relievers
 &UR; Rick Aguilera and  &UR; Greg Swindell. Aguilera has a no-trade clause
but would probably be willing to waive it to play for a serious
contender. &QL;

ARIZONANS EYE BASS FISHING TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's called High Rock Lake and lies about 30 miles
from Greensboro, N.C. High Rock is a private lake, owned by a
corporation that uses its water to generate power for its plants.
</P>
<P>
   It's a favorite of local anglers. Spring through fall, there are
usually several small bass tournaments going on it each day.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 6 it will become the focal point of the bass fishing
world, when contestants from far and wide begin competition in the
B.A.S.S. Masters Classic, the most prestigious fishing tournament
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Western anglers have had trouble qualifying for the
tournament, which generally is held in the East or South.
</P>
<P>
   Lakes there are shallower and more turbid than the deep, clear
lakes of the West.
</P>
<P>
   That changed this year when Bass Anglers Sportsman Society
(B.A.S.S.) instituted a Western Division. Four tournaments were
held in the West, and the five anglers with the heaviest overall
catches qualified for the Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Two were from Arizona, three from California. The Arizonans are
Greg Hines of Tempe and Mark Kile of Tonto Basin.
</P>
<P>
   This tournament isn't new to Hines, who earned a spot in both
1988 and '89. His highest finish was 11th in the three-day
competition. Now in his 40s, Hines has said he lost his focus after
those tournaments until this year, when he was the second highest
qualifier in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Consistency pays
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really focused this year,'' Hines said. ``When they
(B.A.S.S.) said five people from the West were going to make it (to
the Classic), I said, `I'm going to be one of them.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He, like Kile, never won a qualifying tournament, but both
finished consistently high to earn their spots.
</P>
<P>
   Kile, 32, is at the opposite end of the spectrum. He has fished
mostly in Arizona, while Hines has won the prestigious U.S. Open on
Lake Mead and is well known by his national peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew me in Arizona,'' Kile said. ``I've won 30-some
tournaments, but if you want to make fishing a career, you have to
make it in B.A.S.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Both spent six days fishing High Rock Lake this month. Even that
experience was impressive to Kile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited,'' he said. ``Even during the pre-fish,
people would line up on the docks to get your autograph. Someone
saw my boat in a filling station, asked if I was going to fish in
the Classic and then asked for my autograph.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Arizonans said their time on High Rock was well-spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good pre-fish,'' Hines said. ``There is a tremendous
amount of fishing pressure on that lake. There's a tournament
almost every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fishermen are well-educated on catching fish, and that
makes the fish well-educated. It was hard work. I was fishing from
5 in the morning to 7:30 at night. You might get only four to six
bites all day. And you have to catch every one if you're going to
win this tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Hines said the fish fall into two categories: 12- to 13-inch
bass and 3- to 5-pound ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they tend to hit hard when they hit,'' he said. ``I didn't
miss a fish the whole time I was there.'' &QL; 
Shallow waters &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lake is only about 55 feet at its deepest point. And both
Hines and Kile said few fish are taken deeper than 15 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's basically two kinds of fishing there,'' Kile said.
``There are a lot of (boat) docks on the lake, and lot of the guys
will be flipping the shallow water around those docks. But a lot of
guys will fish deeper structure, too. They mostly use deep-diving
crankbaits.''
</P>
<P>
   Hines said he had his best luck with reaction baits, lures that
come past a fish quickly and cause it to make a reflexive action.
</P>
<P>
   ``But those fish are so well-educated,'' he said. ``You might
make five or six casts to the same place until you finally get the
bait to bounce off a brush pile, or whatever, in the right way to
cause a strike.'' &QL; 
Strategy involved
</P>
<P>
   Kile said he did his best with Carolina-rigged worms, big ones.
</P>
<P>
   Both agree there will be strategy involved.
</P>
<P>
   The first two days are Thursday and Friday. A current will be
running through the lake because of power generation. Fishing will
be at its best. On Saturday, however, with little or no generation,
results will not be as good.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to plan for that in your strategy,'' Hines said.
</P>
<P>
   This type of pressure isn't new to Hines, but it is to Kile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did everything I knew to do well in the tournament,'' he
said of the pre-fish. ``If I win it, great. But I'm not going to be
timid. I'm not going up shallow like most of the other guys. I
going to fish my strengths. I'm going for it.'' &QL; 
Big bucks at stake &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The top prize is $100,000, but that's not where the real money
is. Endorsements can make a victory worth a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``You become an instant hero if you win the Classic,'' Hines
said. ``One win can make your career for 10 years.'' &QL;

300-GAME WINNER READY FOR THE HALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Don Sutton always knew he'd make it to
Cooperstown. But to get there, he felt he had to win 300 games;
that goal became his passion.
</P>
<P>
   So you'll understand if the former Dodgers star sheds a tear or
two when he is inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In a 23-year career, Sutton won 324 games (12th all-time) and
struck out 3,574 (fifth). In his fifth year of eligibility, he was
the only player elected by the Baseball Writers' Association of
America after being named on 386 of 473 ballots (81.6 percent of
the vote). Last year, he fell just nine votes shy of the required
75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why I had to win 300 games,'' said Sutton, a
broadcaster with the Atlanta Braves. ``So I could have this day. I
thought if I could win 300, it would be very hard to justify me not
being in the Hall of Fame. I finally made it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone through my speech over and over, and every time I
get emotional about it. I don't want to be influenced by what other
players said and did. This is my day.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton only had one 20-win season (21-10, 1976) with Los
Angeles, but he twice went 19-9. He joined the Brewers after a 13-8
start with Houston in 1982. His 4-1 finish helped Milwaukee to the
World Series. Sutton was 0-1 in the Series against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think that Milwaukee team was one of the best I ever
played for,'' said Sutton. ``We won the pennant by beating the
Orioles on the final day.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sutton's Hall of Fame plaque, he will be wearing a Dodgers
cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't find any reason I shouldn't wear a Dodger cap,'' he
said. ``It's what my mother wants, it's what Walter Alston wanted,
It's what the O'Malleys wanted, it's what my dad wants.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Sutton, who played in three World Series with the
Dodgers (1974, '77, '78) and the one with Milwaukee, the inductees
will include four choices of the Hall of Fame veterans committee _
Negro League and Cleveland Indians star Larry Doby, baseball
executive Lee MacPhail, turn of the century slugger George Davis, a
shortstop who batted .300 or better nine times, and Bullet Joe
Rogan, a dominant pitcher in the 1930s and '40s, and the 15th Negro
League player to be honored.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the day of awards are the induction of Jamie
Jarrin, the sports voice to Latin America for 40 years, and Sam
Lacy, 94-year-old columnist for the Baltimore Afro-American. Jarrin
and Lacy will be part of a Hall of Fame special section honoring
media. From all sources, there are now 233 members in the Hall.

FULLBACK MAY BE OUT FOR SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, ARIZ. - The knee injury to Cardinals fullback Cedric
Smith apparently is more serious than first thought.
</P>
<P>
   Smith suffered a right-knee sprain and perhaps a tear of the
anterior cruciate ligament, an injury that would end his season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fear the worst,'' one team official said.
</P>
<P>
   Several players said Smith told them he tore the ligament. He is
scheduled to return to the Valley to be diagnosed by team doctor
Russell Chick on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the team's short-yardage runner and lead blocker,
suffered the injury Friday morning on a hit by rookie safety Pat
Tillman. The injury occurred after rain and lightning forced the
team inside on the artificial turf surface at the Walkup Skydome.
Tillman hit Smith high, but Smith's shoe apparently stuck in the
turf. &QL;

CAMP HAS UN EASY RIDER

<P>
   FLAGSTAFF _ Among the 140 motorcycles driven up from the Valley
on Saturday to Cardinals training camp was one with a custom paint
job bearing the Cardinal bird logo, driven by a young man who
caught heck from his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got here, my dad said, `Your position is open; so far
I've taken three applications for it, and I'm seriously considering
two of them,' '' said  &UR; Michael Bidwill, vice president and general
counsel of the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   His father,  &UR; Bill, owns the team.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bidwill rode his Titan Sidewinder in the Rock N Roll
Ride to Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I've ridden a motorcycle this big,''
said Michael Bidwill, who also is a licensed pilot. ``I had a much
smaller one in college.''
</P>
<P>
   The riders helped swell the attendance to an estimated 2,000 for
the afternoon practice, the largest ever for the club here,
according to the elder Bidwill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' Michael Bidwill said, ``I'm going to go park this thing
next to (fullback)  &UR; Larry Centers' motor scooter.'' &QL; 
Numbers, please &QL; 
Negotiations with holdout rookie defensive end  &UR; Andre Wadsworth
might now pick up speed since quarterback  &UR; Ryan Leaf, drafted in
the position ahead of Wadsworth, agreed to terms Saturday. Leaf,
taken second overall by San Diego, will get $31.25 million over
five years with a signing bonus of $11.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth, selected third overall, said he would wait until Leaf
signed before signing. The player directly behind Wadsworth in the
draft, Oakland's  &UR; Charles Woodson, got $13.36 million over six
years with a signing bonus of $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   With Leaf getting a $11.25 million bonus, Wadsworth likely will
command in excess of $9 million. The Cardinals refused comment. &QL;

DOYLE OFFICIALLY AN OLD PRO 
</HEADLINE>
 CLASSIC-DOYLE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL HARBER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUTTON, Mass. _ If you see Norwood, Mass., native Allen Doyle
Sunday at Pleasant Valley, wish him a happy birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The former Catholic Memorial hockey star turns 50 Sunday. While
most American males reach the milestone with apprehension, Doyle is
happy it has arrived. He has been planning for this day for three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Go back to 1995. Doyle, who learned the game on the fairways of
Ponkapoag in Canton and as a caddie at Spring Valley, was one of
the best amateur players in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an unorthodox golf swing that he developed while
practicing his hockey shot in a low-ceilinged room as a youngster,
his amateur resume is impressive.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the Walker Cup team in 1989, '91, and '93. In
'90, '92, and '94 he represented the US in the World Amateur Team
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   He won the Georgia Amateur more times (six) than any golfer,
including the immortal Bobby Jones.
</P>
<P>
   His final season as an amateur, 1994, he won five prestigious
events: the Porter Cup, the Sunnehanna, the Cardinal, the Dogwood
Invitational, and the Rice Planters Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   There was little left to prove as an amateur, so at age 47,
Doyle turned professional.
</P>
<P>
   At the time he gave three reasons for yielding his amateur
status.
</P>
<P>
   Reason One: His daughters, Erin and Michelle, were a few years
from college, and the Norwich University grad knew there would be
big tuition bills.
</P>
<P>
   Reason Two: There was nothing left to prove as an amateur. ``I
needed something to take my game to the next level,'' said Doyle.
``I think my game would have gone stale if I remained an amateur.''
</P>
<P>
   Reason Three: The money. Doyle might have been making a good
living, as owner of a driving range in his adopted hometown of
LaGrange, Ga., but it pales in comparison to the money that can be
made on the Senior Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Well, his daughters won't have to pay for college. Erin is on a
golf scholarship at Southern Mississippi, and Michelle enrolls at
South Alabama on a golf scholarship this fall.
</P>
<P>
   As for raising his game to another level, Doyle's rise has been
meteoric. He started playing in mini-tour events, such as the
Hooters Tour in 1995. The next year he was given a sponsor's
exemption to the Penascola Nike event. He finished in the top 25 in
that event, which made him eligible to compete the following week
in the Mississippi Gulf Coast Classic. He won that tournament,
which exempted him on the Nike Tour for the remainder of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the year he won the Texarkana Open and finished the
season winning the Nike Tour Championship, which vaulted him to
second on the money list ($176,652).
</P>
<P>
   Doyle was automatically exempted on the PGA Tour, which
surpassed his initial plans. In fact, he became the oldest rookie
golfer in PGA history in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour experience was valuable. ``I won't trade it for
anything. But I didn't play well at all. I was trying too hard,''
said Doyle, who finished 140th on the money list and had to go back
to Tour Qualifying School. ``I didn't have any trouble there and
regained my Tour card, but I still tried too hard'' and he fell to
187th on the money list.
</P>
<P>
   Don't feel bad for him or think of Doyle as a failure. He has
earned $206,608 during those two years on Tour.
</P>
<P>
   This season he has played in seven Nike events and last week he
earned a spot in the Deposit Guaranty Classic in Mississippi. Doyle
put together four great rounds (67-69-69-69_274) to tie for seventh
and earn $36,150. Besides being his best-ever finish in a PGA Tour
event, it exempted him into this week's tournament at Pleasant
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect timing. He could celebrate this special birthday with
his New England family. He had many followers Saturday and Saturday
night he returned to his father's home in Norwood for a birthday
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's round, Doyle will do a corporate outing for
Foxwoods in Connecticut and then head to Minnesota where he will
try to earn a spot in a Senior Tour event in a Monday qualifier. He
already has an exemption into the Pensacola Senior event this fall
and he is hoping to receive a couple of more exemptions this year.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle would really like to play in the BankBoston Senior Classic
in August. ``I'm hoping to get an exemption, but if I don't, I'll
be there on Monday and try to win a spot.''
</P>
<P>
   If Doyle got an exemption to the BankBoston event, he wouldn't
be the first local 50-year-old given a break. Last year Dana
Quigley got an exemption, played well, and it catapulted him on to
the Senior Tour.

CARPENTER LAUDS LEAF, REGRETS FINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Washington State teammate  &UR; Ryan Leaf recently left a
phone message for Cardinals wide receiver  &UR; Chad Carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called my wife and said he was going to send me an invoice
for the $10,000,'' Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, in his second year as a pro, didn't lose a bet. He
also doesn't owe Leaf any money.
</P>
<P>
   But Leaf was fined $10,000 by the NFL for leaving the league's
mandatory rookie symposium last month to speak at Carpenter's
football camp in Fruitland, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of my better friends and came out of his own will,''
Carpenter said. ``He's a guy who gets paid a whole bunch of money
from endorsements, yet he came on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was a big deal that he left early. I know
last year guys had to leave. But I don't think he told them. They
wanted to know where he was. If he would have checked in and said,
`I got to go,' it might have been different.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a great job at the camp, and the camp was a big
success. (Leaf) said if he reached one kid, it was worth it. But it
doesn't seem fair. The NFL at the symposium stressed getting
involved with the community and kids, and then something like that
happens.'' &QL; 
Free food &QL;
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco 49ers players were told at 11 p.m. last Tuesday
that they needed to go to the cafeteria at training camp
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Some players were already asleep and were not amused by what
they thought was a rookie prank.
</P>
<P>
   The team was about to be informed that highly respected team
President  &UR; Carmen Policy had resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us what had happened, and a lot of the younger guys
said, `Does that mean the cafeteria is still open?''' veteran
quarterback  &UR; Steve Young said. ``We said, `Yeah, it's still free
food.' This is over the top of a lot of the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Policy's departure is the latest blow to what was once the
league's premier franchise. In the past two years, the team has
changed head coaches, offensive coordinators, defensive
coordinators and now club presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, former 49ers wide receiver  &UR; Dwight Clark now is the
longest-tenured high-ranking employee in the front office.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle  &UR; Harris Barton thinks the predicted demise of
the team is premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing was surprising at 11 p.m,'' Barton said. ``But
there's been a lot of talk that Carmen was going to take a league
job, or take the Cleveland job or take over ownership here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish him well. He did a lot for my family, this organization
and the city. . . . But we've still got talented players here. The
last time I checked, I didn't see anybody come out of a luxury box
and make a tackle.'' &QL; 
Thinking big
</P>
<P>
   New York Giants Coach  &UR; Jim Fassel needs to quit stealing
material from his old boss, Cardinals Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Fassel said he didn't care about the Giants' past.
He wanted to be a pioneer, which was Tobin's line.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when Fassel, whose team won the NFC East last year with a
10-5-1 record, is asked about the Super Bowl, he borrows another of
Tobin's lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not us?'' Fassel said. ``Sure, why not us?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I do think about the Super Bowl. It's the ultimate
thing. You do not want to set your goals too low. You want to set
them where it's realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we ready for the Super Bowl? I don't know. I want to see
our work ethic, our attitude, before I have any serious or
realistic thoughts.'' &QL; 
Short shots
</P>
<P>
   Former Cowboys Coach  &UR; Barry Switzer has had a couple of cameo
roles in movies, vacationed with his family in Italy and been
spending time in Norman, Okla., Oklahoma City and Dallas since
being fired last winter. ``Am I glad I'm not having to go to
Wichita Falls?'' Switzer said of the Cowboys' training camp site.
``I think it's the best thing. But I will miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the door of prospective NFL owner  &UR; Red McCombs' office at one
of his San Antonio car dealerships is the sign: ``Minnesota Vikings
Headquarters.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a rumor that first-round draft pick
 &UR; Grant Wistrom celebrated signing with the St. Louis Rams by
attending a Van Halen concert in St. Louis. Asked his opinion of
Van Halen, Rams Coach  &UR; Dick Vermeil said, ``Is he a running
back?'' &QL;

PLUMMER BEARS CARDS' WEIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. - The savior and domed-stadium builder really
is just a homebody.
</P>
<P>
   That's because if Cardinals second-year quarterback Jake Plummer
goes out in public, he gets mobbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not every person can understand what it's like when you stop
at Dairy Queen to get a Blizzard, and five people recognize you,''
Plummer said. ``You hear them whispering and yelling and five of
the clerks working in the back run out to just stop and stand there
and look at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, there was the time Plummer and teammate Chad Carpenter had
their dinner at a restaurant interrupted by patrons shouting,
``Jake, Jake, Jake.''
</P>
<P>
   At an appearance at the NFL Youth, Education and Training (YET)
center in Phoenix earlier this year, Plummer became the center of
attention as soon as he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone in the crowd said, `Look, it's Jake Plummer,' ''
Cardinals kicker Joe Nedney said. ``The rest of us were standing
there with pens in hands, wondering, `Where did everyone go?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer almost always is the first Cardinals player requested
for appearances. He can't always accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's neat and that's part of being a celebrity, and if I can't
deal with it, I have only one option _ quit playing and move to the
mountains and become a mountain man,'' Plummer said. ``Other than
getting up from being sacked, it's probably the hardest thing to
deal with _ the public scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   How life has changed for Plummer in the past year. The same guy
who was a confused third-string rookie, nationally famous for
sharing his training-camp dormitory room with a skunk, now is being
asked to carry a franchise on his bony back. &QL; 
Under the gun &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Talk about pressure. The NFL's media site recently asked fans
who will be the league's breakthrough player of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jake the Snake was the winner, getting 19.9 percent of the 3,338
votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake Plummer gave us a glimpse of what he can do last
season,'' voter Gabriel Botkins of Cincinnati said. ``Simply put,
the Cardinals win with him at quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   They haven't had a winning season since 1984 or been to the
playoffs in a non-strike year since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   So all Plummer is expected to do is get the Rio Solado Crossing
stadium/convention center project built, lead the Cardinals out of
the Dark Ages and become the league's premier quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``One rookie year doesn't mean I'll be the next Joe Montana,''
Plummer said. ``Maybe I'll be first Jake Plummer.'' &QL; 
Great expectations &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Plummer won only two games last season, beating Baltimore,
16-13, and Atlanta, 29-26.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he already is a member of the prestigious NFL Quarterback
Club, a business arm of the players union that ``offers corporate
America a chance to tap into the popularity and power of the NFL's
biggest stars.''
</P>
<P>
   The Quarterback Club already has lined up Plummer to endorse
Foot Locker's new ``Q'' line of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a unique combination of attributes,'' said Gary
Gertzog, NFL Properties senior vice president. ``He did a great job
on the field and has generated excitement in the Arizona market.
Jake's performance, coupled with what we expect to be a much
stronger performance by the Cardinals, will lead to increased
merchandise, sales and opportunities for Jake and the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot of traits the average fan can relate to. He's
not as big as some but has youthful exuberance. He has elements
that are exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough losing &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The extra money Plummer will make is nice, but he's more
interested in victories. He played on a 3-8 team at Arizona State
and a 4-12 Cardinals team last year. It's the last time he plans on
losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team last year, at times, I was bewildered at the way they
acted after a loss,'' Plummer said of last season. ``Maybe I was
young and didn't know. But if you lose a game that you had won and
just give it away, you should be steamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when I was third string, I think I was more
mad than a lot of the guys who played in the game. I'd sit on the
plane and just be (angry) how the game turned out. Some of the guys
would be laughing, playing cards or just joking around. That's not
the way I'm going to be. If I ever get that way, it's time to
quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer said he just can't accept losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Winning championships) can happen here,'' he said. ``It's an
attitude, a mind set, not settling for just going out and
practicing but going out and getting something done, going hard
every single play.'' &QL; 
Growing pains &QL; 
Plummer was listed on the fourth team when he showed up at camp in
Flagstaff a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a few months after he was placed on two years
probation. He pleaded no contest to one misdemeanor count of
disorderly conduct and guilty to one misdemeanor assault count in a
highly publicized incident at a Tempe nightclub. He was fined
$1,020 and ordered to perform 100 hours of community service, which
included working with Special Olympics kids.
</P>
<P>
   He completed his community service work, and the probation ended
more than a year early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done all I can to get over the whole issue,'' he said.
``If I let it bother me, I wouldn't be where I am today. I enjoyed
working with the (Special Olympics) kids. I just wish it hadn't
been mandatory.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer's first preseason game was a disaster. He completed only
5 of 16 passes for 52 yards in the preseason opener at Seattle. He
also was sacked once and threw an interception.
</P>
<P>
   That was better than he looked some days in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shaky,'' he said. ``I didn't know what was going on. I'd
(drop back) and start running right away. I had no patience. I was
confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was real frustrated at camp. I would drop the snap and have
(former offensive line coach Carl) Mauck yell at me. It was no
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't play in the regular season until the seventh game when
he came in the fourth quarter and drove the Cardinals 98 yards for
the go-ahead score on his first pro possession. But the next week,
he was intercepted four times in a lopsided loss to Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   He ended up breaking most of the team's rookie passing records,
but he doesn't remember many of the bright moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some key errors that didn't lose it for us but might
have swung games in the other direction,'' Plummer said. ``That's
why they call it a rookie season. I made rookie mistakes. I would
hold the ball (too long) sometimes. Other times, I didn't know
where I was going.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiming his crown &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The season ended with Plummer leading the team 80 yards in the
final two minutes to beat the Falcons. He threw a game-winning
touchdown and then ran for a two-point conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, offensive coordinator Dick Jamieson was fired.
He eventually was replaced by Marc Trestman, considered a
quarterback guru.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer has noticed a big change in the West Coast offense
installed by Trestman, who formerly was offensive coordinator at
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year's system wasn't as precise, and this year's is more
quarterback friendly,'' Plummer said. ``I liked (Jamieson) as a
person, but he had to handle the whole offense and didn't spend as
much time with me. It took me a few weeks last season to realize I
had to learn things on my own. . . . Trestman has more modern kind
of views.'' &QL; 
The crystal ball &QL; 
Plummer's teammates saw enough of him last year to know he can be a
star.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the most important thing, an aura about him,'' Pro Bowl
wide receiver Rob Moore said. ``He knows how to make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran offensive lineman Joe Wolf said the players don't expect
Plummer to be the savior.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't put it all on one guy,'' Wolf said. ``But when he's
out there running around, rolling in the pocket, he fakes
(defenders) and they are brought to their knees. He scrambles,
makes people miss and dumps it. He throws perfect on the run.''
</P>
<P>
   Stadium by Jake? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to play football,'' he said. ``I let all that
other stuff just happen. I see it in the papers. I see my picture
all over things. But, really, I just have to keep playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I retire, (people) might say, `This is the stadium Jake
built.' That's when it will hit me. But I'm not worried about it.
It would be nice to have a new stadium, but we have to win
ballgames.'' &QL;

STOCKTON HAS MANY PLEASANT MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SUTTON, Mass. _ Sunday's final round of the CVS Charity
Classic is the curtain call for the PGA at Pleasant Valley, and
part of the charm of the 32 tournaments that began with the old
Carling World in 1965 has been the family ties, ranging from the
Mingollas, who have presided over tournament golf at Pleasant
Valley since the LPGA first made it a regular stop in 1962, to the
Stocktons. Dave Stockton Sr. won at PV in 1971, when Dave Jr. was
just turning 3. He'd return as a teenager to caddie, and on
Thursday shot a 67 to open the final event.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when a majority of the pros stayed at the old
Pleasant Valley Motor Lodge, which is now in some disrepair and has
had a variety of owners since it parted company with the course.
``I could walk up the hill,'' said Stockton, ``and my dad would be
on No. 3. That's where everybody stayed. They had a pool table in
there and they had good pancakes in the morning. I remember I had a
birthday here one year and my parents had a clown come in. I was
probably 8 or 9.''
</P>
<P>
   His father's victory didn't have much impact on Dave Jr. ``I was
probably taking a nap,'' said Stockton. He talks daily with his
father, who is playing in the US Senior Open at Riviera this
weekend. Stockton says his father was an inspiration. ``He'd say,
`If you're thinking of doing it for a living, you'd better do it
110 percent.' But he never said, `Hey, don't you think you should
go practice?' I played several sports growing up but every day I'd
ride my bike to the golf course and practice. Whether it was
raining or not, I'd be out there playing and having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest experience of his young life came when his dad was
captain of the US Ryder Cup team at Kiawah in 1991. ``The week
before, he had our guys come in early,'' said Stockton. ``He knew
the wind blew in different directions at Kiawah. He thought it
would be an advantage if our guys got familiarized with the course.
I got to play a few rounds with the guys, and it really elevated my
game. It was an incredible two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The English love a sports hero, and  &UR; Justin Rose  &LR; became the
object of their affection in the British Open that drew to a
rousing conclusion last Sunday at Royal Birkdale. Rose stole the
show on a gusty Friday with the best round of the day (66) and when
he holed out from 45 yards with his final shot of the championship
Sunday evening, the roar of the crowd reached the highest decibel
level of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, who doesn't turn 18 until Thursday, spent the first five
years of his life in South Africa before his family moved to the
Hampshire section of southwest England. He first picked up a
plastic club when he was an infant, became the youngest member of a
Walker Cup team at 16, and beat Stanford's Jeff Kribel but lost to
Jerry Courville Jr. in his two matches last year at Quaker Ridge.
After finishing tied for fourth at Royal Birkdale, the best British
Open finish by an amateur since Frank Stranahan tied for second in
1953, Rose turned pro.
</P>
<P>
   This was a formality, part of the game plan. Rose had left
school when he was 15 to concentrate on golf. The British press
wrote endless stories last week, including one regarding Rose's sex
appeal. He made his pro debut at the Dutch Open and the magic
carried over on Wednesday when he won the pro-am and his first
check as a professional. He'd have made more than $100,000 had he
turned pro prior to the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it, really,'' said Rose of his slam-dunk
finish. ``I mean, it was a tough shot, out of the rough, over a
bunker. I said to my caddie, `I'm going to go for the shot, try to
get it close.' I could have bailed out. I had nothing to lose. It
was one of those incredible moments. The ball got nearer and nearer
and finally disappeared. I couldn't believe it. The whole week had
been really, really special for me. Unbelievable. To finish on that
note was in context with the whole week.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose became the  &UR; Matt Kuchar  &LR; of the British Open. Kuchar was in
his sophomore year at Georgia Tech and just 19 when he captivated
the crowd at the Masters with his warm smile, and he will soon be
at a camp near New Hampshire's Lake Winnipesaukee to consider his
future. Rose has a similar warm smile that charms the crowds. ``I
was put at ease by the crowds,'' said Rose. ``The incredible
support I had didn't give me time to be nervous. I went out there,
had a lot of fun, and luckily played well.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose hit a bump in his first professional round, shooting 77 at
Hilversunsche GC Thursday. He came back with a 65 Friday, but
missed the cut by one shot.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a year makes _ just ask  &UR; Mark O'Meara &LR; . Just a
year ago, a national magazine ran a story with the headline: ``King
of the B's.'' The theme was that O'Meara had been a hit on the
Tour, but a flop in the majors. Even though O'Meara had won 14
times on the PGA Tour and had won the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am
five times, he was 0 for 56 in the four majors and had missed the
cut 17 times entering this season.
</P>
<P>
   Then O'Meara holes a 20-foot putt to win the Masters, outlasts
 &UR; Brian Watts  &LR; to win the British Open in a four-hole playoff, and
now can become only the second player to win three majors in the
same year with a victory at the PGA Championship next month at
Sahalee CC in Redmond, Wash. The talk a year ago was all about
 &UR; Tiger Woods  &LR; and the Grand Slam. Suddenly Woods has been shoved
into the background by his neighbor and friend, the guy he has said
is his big brother. Instead of Woods being mentioned in the same
breath with  &UR; Jack Nicklaus &LR; , &UR;  &LR; O'Meara is approaching  &UR; Ben Hogan's
 &LR; 1953 standard when he won the Masters, US Open, British Open, and
didn't play in the PGA because he couldn't walk the two rounds a
day because his legs had been battered in a car crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that this championship has always been very
highly regarded throughout the world,'' O'Meara said after the
British Open awards ceremony. ``I think in my book it's because I
play a lot of international golf and to come out on top and win an
event such as this is just an incredible feeling. To win two major
championships in one year is just not that easy. I think it's
maturity and time and just a little bit of patience and realizing
if I just hung in there I would have a chance to get the job done.
I've been able to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The win at Royal Birkdale put O'Meara in the company of previous
American winners  &UR; Arnold Palmer &LR; , &UR; Lee Trevino &LR; , &UR; Johnny
Miller &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Tom Watson. &LR;  O'Meara said he loves links golf. ``I
think what makes this championship different and so special is the
fact it is played on a links golf course,'' he said. ``It's the way
golf was started at St. Andrews. You look at the history of the
game and where it relates back to, and links golf really challenges
and tests a player's ability. With the narrow fairways and the deep
rough, you had to drive the ball well. You had to create a lot of
different shots with the winds, cross winds, head winds, down
winds. Variety is kind of what golf is all about. There's no
question when you come and play a links golf course you're going to
get a lot of variety. I think that's what makes it so special.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Watts, who executed a trap shot for the ages on the 72d hole of
the British to set up the playoff with O'Meara, has an interesting
dilemma. Watts, who has been a regular on the Japanese tour since
losing his PGA card, is a US citizen, and his wife  &UR; Debbye  &LR; and
infant son  &UR; Jason  &LR; still reside in Edmond, Okla. The $309,260 he
won at Royal Birkdale guarantees him a spot on the US PGA Tour for
next year. He has $634,637 on the world money list to rank 33d. He
drew criticism in his sixth year on the Japanese Tour when he
deliberately whacked a couple of shots into the Pacific Ocean in
the Fuji Sankei Classic in early May in order to miss the cut and
utilize a nonrefundable plane ticket home. He was fined the
equivalent of $2,000 and was banned from the Japanese Open. The
future? ``I haven't even thought about it,'' said Watts. ``I guess
I'll make up my mind some other time.'' ...  &UR; Fuzzy Zoeller &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who
was inducted into the Pleasant Valley Hall of honor by owner  &UR; Ted
Mingolla  &LR; at the final pro-am dinner Wednesday night, has filed a
suit in US District Court in Orlando, charging that  &UR; Peter
Kerasotis  &LR; of Florida Today magazine acted ``intentionally,
recklessly, wantonly, and with malice'' in a satirical column
published during the Masters. The column was headlined ``Fuzzy
Speaks with Forked Tongue'' and quotes Zoeller making a variety of
ethnically sensitive remarks. The column was an offshoot of remarks
Zoeller made regarding Woods following the 1997 Masters that caused
Zoeller to lose lucrative endorsement contracts and draw
considerable criticism ...  &UR; Richard Coughlan &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who caddied in the
1991 Walker Cup for US members  &UR; Phil Mickelson &LR; , &UR; David Duval &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and
 &UR; Allen Doyle  &LR; at Dublin, played with Rose on the Great
Britain/Ireland team in last summer's Walker Cup in New York's
Westchester County. ``He's big, strong, and smart,'' said Coughlan,
who attended Clemson and earned his PGA Tour playing card by
finishing 12th in the Qualifying School. ``He'll do fine for
himself.'' ...  &UR; Mac O'Grady &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who waged a long struggle with the
PGA Tour a decade ago, still can't resist the opportunity to get a
few shots in. Noting the Pleasant Valley tournament is going by the
boards, O'Grady said the PGA Tour is being run by ``corporate
cannibals and neo-Nazis.'' Ouch. Ever wonder why O'Grady has never
been on the PGA Tour's favored son list? ...  &UR; Joe Henley &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a
former Dartmouth golf captain and regular at Woods Hole GC, was
quick to point out as a salesman for Spalding that since O'Meara
left Titleist 2 1/2 years ago and switched to the Top Flite Strata
ball, he has earned $3.7 million and averaged $70,000 per event. In
15 years with Titleist, O'Meara earned $6.4 million and averaged
$15,000 per event.

RANGERS FAIL TO DEFEND LEAD, FALL TO TWINS, 7-6
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Manager Johnny Oates took off the gloves.
</P>
<P>
   It mirrored the Rangers' defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense is killing us,'' Oates said after a 7-6 loss to the
Twins last night at the Metrodome. ``We don't have shutout-type
pitching, and we're getting burned every time we don't make a
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Rangers trail the Anaheim Angels by a half-game in the
American League West and could be without right-hander John Burkett
(stiff neck) for a scheduled start against the Chicago White Sox on
Friday at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers committed two errors, but the play that most
disturbed Oates did not involve an error in the Twins' three-run
fourth inning. Burkett, who took a 5-0 lead into that inning,
induced what appeared to be a double-play ground ball from Twins
third baseman Ron Coomer.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers second baseman Mark McLemore fielded the ball cleanly
and retired first baseman David Ortiz with an accurate throw to
second base, but a weak throw by shortstop Domingo Cedeno to first
baseman Will Clark bounced and failed to retire Coomer.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno's poor throw occurred because he failed to transfer the
ball cleanly from his glove to his right hand. It resulted in a
palm ball throw to Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of defense just kills us,'' Oates said. ``We got away
with it in the first inning, but it seems like it burns us every
time we don't make a play. We get a routine double-play ball there
and don't turn it, and it kills us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Twins parlayed that extra out into three runs despite only
one well-hit ball. Second baseman Todd Walker's one-out double,
which rolled beyond the reach of Rangers third baseman Fernando
Tatis and down the left-field foul line, advanced Coomer to third.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett induced a come-backer to the mound from left fielder
Alex Ochoa for the inning's second out, but catcher Terry Steinbach
dumped a two-run, bloop double into shallow right field. The only
well-hit ball of the inning was by shortstop Pat Meares, who lined
a double into right field to score Steinbach with the Twins' third
run.
</P>
<P>
   Oates dismissed Cedeno's lack of experience with McLemore as a
reason for the potential double play not being turned.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's no excuse,'' Oates said. ``This is the major leagues. I
could understand if it was a tough throw, but that's routine.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkett, who did not surrender a hit in his first three innings,
breezed through that stretch despite his first-inning error and
another by McLemore in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth inning, though, proved unkind.
</P>
<P>
   Walker led off the sixth inning with an infield single and
advanced to second on a single by Ochoa, who grounded the ball into
the hole vacated by McLemore on the hit-and-run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Execution wins games,'' Oates said. ``You win if you execute.
You lose if you don't, and that includes defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Xavier Hernandez replaced Burkett after Ochoa's
at-bat and surrendered a one-out, two-run single to center fielder
Otis Nixon that tied the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got worse and worse,'' Burkett said of the stiff neck. ``I
tried to grind it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkett struggled to dress and tie his shoes after the game and
wondered whether he will be able to start Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know with these things,'' he said. ``Sometimes they
disappear. Sometimes they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, a left-handed hitter, provided what proved to be the
game-winning base hit with his two-out, two-run double off on the
first pitch he saw from left-hander Eric Gunderson in the eighth
inning. Gunderson began the game allowing left-handed hitters a
.292 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   ``His job is to get left-handed hitters out,'' Oates said. ``The
game is on the line there. He's got to make a better first pitch in
my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense, though, disturbed Oates most.
</P>
<P>
   Oates expected this team to play better defensively in the
season's second half. It hasn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about it is it hasn't been one or two guys,'' Oates
said. ``It's been all of them. Maybe I overrated some of these
guys. We've got guys who have caught it before, but we're not
catching it now.''

CAMPBELL THE NEW SHERIFF IN TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Welcome to the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   That's where former Rangers coach Colin Campbell will find
himself as he begins his new role as the NHL's senior vice
president and director of hockey operations. Campbell, 45, replaces
Brian Burke, who left the post after five years to become the
Vancouver Canucks' general manager.
</P>
<P>
   One of Campbell's key roles will be the unenviable task of
meting out supplemental discipline, i.e. fines and suspensions. One
infraction which Campbell intends to cut down is reckless
stickwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``One area that really bothered me was when a player would use a
stick to injure another player,'' said Campbell. ``There would be
accidental situations when a player had a puck and another player
was trying to stop him. We all remember the Adam Graves incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when there's an infraction in play and a stick's involved,
I think all players want discipline and all players _ anybody in
hockey _ will cringe when something like that happens, when a
player is injured, and I think that we all look forward to
discipline. Hopefully my past and experience as a player and coach
will do me good in the situations that I'm sure are going to be
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell has a two-year commitment to the job. He said after
being fired by the Rangers that a break from coaching will likely
prove beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give a lot when you coach,'' he said. ``We had fun here in
New York, my family and I met a lot of great people and the
Rangers' organization was fun. And we had an opportunity to ride in
the parade and have fun and coach some of the greatest players
ever. And I hadn't expected to get right back into coaching in a
hurry. This opportunity came along and one day I talked to
(commissioner) Gary Bettman and he said I was on a short list. I
thought he said I was the short guy on his list but ... It seems
like it will be very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke is an intelligent, principled man who never got the credit
he deserved for his work in the league's most difficult position.
Campbell inherits a job in which he will have to battle, among
other things, the persecution complexes of some GMs and players.
Like Burke before him, Campbell will be viewed as the traffic cop
who stops someone for speeding only to have the violator bark,
``Yeah, I was speeding but so was everyone else. Why didn't you
stop them?''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell has the necessary ingredients for success in the job _
a sense of fairness, a sense of what's best for the game, and, most
important, a sense of humor. As is often the case, the job is one
of the sport's most important, but also perhaps its most thankless.
</P>
<P>
   As one reporter during the league's conference call with
Campbell put it, ``Congratulations on your promotion, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; John Cullen &LR; , &UR;  &LR; whose non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is in remission,
has been invited to try out with his former team, the Tampa Bay
Lightning, but the former Boston University standout wants a
contract before going to camp. The club wants Cullen to report to
camp, play in two exhibition games in Austria, and prove he
deserves a contract. ``Right now, we have a spot for him in camp
and we're saving a spot for him on the team but he has to show,''
said GM  &UR; Phil Esposito &LR; . ``That's all.'' Cullen's agent,  &UR; Ron
Salcer &LR; , &UR;  &LR; said Cullen, who stopped playing in April 1997, feels
good and is working out hard. ``When he left, it was because of
illness not an injury,'' Salcer said. ``He's training every day
now, he's skating. He's feeling better. Certainly we feel _ based
on the history of what he's done with the organization and the fact
he has so much support from the entire Tampa Bay area _ that it's
in everyone's best interest for John to come in with a contract.''
Salcer said Cullen wants to stay in Tampa but would listen to
offers from other clubs since he is an unrestricted free agent.
Coach  &UR; Jacques Demers  &LR; said he very much wants Cullen on his team.
``I like John Cullen as a player,'' said Demers. ``But I really
admire him as a person for what he's battled and gone through.''
... Rumors persist that the Flyers will deal captain  &UR; Eric
Lindros &LR; . Word out of Canada is that Maple Leafs goalie  &UR; Felix
Potvin  &LR; would go to Montreal, Canadiens forward  &UR; Mark Recchi  &LR; would
go to Toronto, and then Recchi and Maple Leafs forward  &UR; Mats Sundin
 &LR; would be swapped to Philly for Lindros ... Phoenix defenseman  &UR; Jim
Johnson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who missed 65 games last year because of post-concussion
syndrome, retired; the 35-year-old will serve as the Coyotes' radio
analyst next year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You thought the Bruins had a ton of free agents to sign this
summer? Take a look at Montreal's list. Topping it is Recchi, who
is the No. 1 priority for general manager  &UR; Rejean Houle &LR; . Recchi is
scheduled for an arbitration hearing Aug. 7 in Toronto. Other
Canadien free agents include captain  &UR; Vincent Damphousse &LR; , &UR;  &LR; center
 &UR; Saku Koivu &LR; , &UR;  &LR; wings  &UR; Martin Rucinsky &LR; , &UR; Brian Savage &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Turner
Stevenson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; defensive center  &UR; Scott Thornton &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and defensemen
 &UR; Vladimir Malakhov  &LR; and  &UR; Patrice Brisebois &LR; . Recchi is bound to be
the most interesting. As the Habs' top scorer with 32 goals and 74
points, he would likely fare well in a hearing. If the arbitrator
gets the case, the 30-year-old Recchi would sign for a year and
become an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season. If he
agrees to terms on a one-year deal before the hearing, he also
would be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season.
Recchi would likely command a huge amount of money to sign a
multiyear deal and give up free agency, making it seem likely he
could be dealt ... Pittsburgh forward  &UR; Stu Barnes  &LR; recently inked a
one-year deal for what is believed to be about $1 million. Barnes,
27, had a career season last year (30-35_65). He was third on the
team in scoring behind  &UR; Jaromir Jagr  &LR; and  &UR; Ron Francis &LR; , &UR;  &LR; with whom
he played on the top line. With Francis now in Carolina, the
Penguins wanted to make sure Barnes's lofty season was no fluke
before making a long-term commitment. ``What we both agreed to
right from the start is that the fairest way to approach Stu's
situation is a one-year agreement,'' said Barnes's agent,  &UR; Rick
Curran &LR; . ``This buys Stu a little time to show the Penguins that he
can duplicate what he did last year. I know Stu is confident he can
do it.'' ... Ottawa is thriving as a result of its playoff series
with Washington. Even though the Senators lost, their fans are
excited. The Senators have 1,400 new season-ticket accounts,
putting them over 10,000, and they have a 93.4 percent renewal rate
from last year. ``We're extremely pleased,'' said president  &UR; Roy
Mlakar &LR; . ``Obviously, the business is going in the right direction
and we're moving closer to the league average of 12,500. As long as
we get to the 11,000 mark, anything can happen from there and I'm
confident we're going to reach that. The more season tickets you
sell, the less you have to sell on game day.'' ... The Mighty Ducks
finally found a coach _ former Blackhawks bench boss  &UR; Craig
Hartsburg &LR; . Hartsburg got the job after former Bruins coach  &UR; Butch
Goring &LR; , &UR;  &LR; behind the bench for the Utah Grizzlies of the
International League, turned them down because he said he felt
Anaheim was lowballing him salarywise. Hartsburg said he was
unconcerned that he wasn't the team's first choice. Ducks GM  &UR; Jack
Ferreira  &LR; said it wasn't worth discussing. ``It's no big thing,''
said Ferreira. ``I wasn't even my wife's first choice.'' ... Now
that  &UR; Eric Fichaud  &LR; is in Edmonton, the Islanders are saying that
 &UR; Tommy Salo  &LR; is their No. 1 netminder. This is the same Tommy Salo
that GM/coach  &UR; Mike Milbury  &LR; called the worst conditioned athlete
he had ever seen during an arbitration hearing last year, which
caused the goalie to break down in tears. It appears the fences
have been mended. The club has hired Swedish National Team coach
 &UR; Stefan Lunner  &LR; as goalie coach. Lunner is considered a mentor by
Salo. Milbury told reporters that Salo was excited about being
chosen No. 1. ``There had been an underlying uncomfortability
between (Fichaud) and Tommy,'' Milbury said. ``Always it was a
question of who was going to get the job. Trading (Fichaud) removed
that.'' ... Former Bruin  &UR; Jim Nill  &LR; has been named Red Wings
assistant GM, adding that title to his duties as scouting director.
Nill will also serve as GM of the Adirondack Red Wings, Detroit's
American Hockey League affiliate. Nill takes over for  &UR; Don
Waddell &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who left the organization to become GM of the Atlanta
Thrashers, who begin play in 1999-2000 ... The future of  &UR; Brian
Bradley's  &LR; hockey career isn't looking very good. The Lightning
forward hasn't announced his retirement but it's possible that he
will be forced to because of injuries. Tampa Bay's career scoring
leader, who is 33, missed all but 14 games last season because of a
wrist injury that required surgery and post-concussion syndrome ...
Defenseman  &UR; Phil Housley  &LR; has landed back in Calgary after being
claimed on waivers from the Capitals. The 34-year-old didn't play
much during the Stanley Cup finals, when the Caps were swept by the
Red Wings. Word out of Calgary is that the Flames may package him
in a deal for a point-producing forward ... Just when you thought
you'd heard the last word regarding the numbskulls who trashed the
dorm rooms in Nagano at the Olympics in February comes the report
that the US Olympic Committee has given up trying to find out who
was responsible. ``I think for all practical purposes it's over
with,'' said USOC executive director  &UR; Dick Schultz &LR; . ``We've done
all we can do and I don't see the NHL or the players' association
doing more.'' What a shocker ... The Globe next Sunday will publish
a poster of Bruins coach  &UR; Pat Burns  &LR; and Rookie of the Year  &UR; Sergei
Samsonov  &LR; ... 76 days until opening night.

TATE HOPING PRACTICE TIME BEHIND HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ You can get caught up in who looks good and
who doesn't. From day to day and play to play, that changes in the
early days of training camp. One day's phenom can be the next day's
bust. So it's the steady, consistent players who eventually begin
to be noticed.
</P>
<P>
   It is those players who usually make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Patriots second-year man Mark Tate couldn't
have picked a better time to be performing at a high level. He's
playing right corner, and he's probably playing it better than
anyone in the camp.
</P>
<P>
   He's consistently mentioned by Pete Carroll, defensive
coordinator Steve Sidwell, and defensive backs coach Ron Lynn. A
rookie free agent last year, the Penn State product spent the
entire season on New England's practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 1 inch, 190 pounds, he's bigger, and some think
faster, than Chris Canty. He's had a year of apprenticeship,
learning the ins and outs of life in the big leagues. In the
offseason he did everything Carroll asked of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm a lot more comfortable this year,'' said Tate.
``Last year I didn't know what was going on. This year I've had a
chance to show the different techniques they wanted me to work on.
I think I'm a lot stronger, quicker, and faster. Being in the
offseason conditioning program with coach (Johnny) Parker really
helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll likes big, physical cornerbacks. He isn't fond of guys
who play off the receiver. The coach saw too much of that on the
right side last year. He wanted more.
</P>
<P>
   He told Tate that he needed to be more physical. He wanted him
to gain weight so he could be a bump-and-run type corner.
</P>
<P>
   So he attended every Parker workout. They were grueling,
especially when Parker introduced sandbag training this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never done the sandbags, but I'll tell you it was mentally
challenging because you'd have to go out there after a workout and
throw those sandbags around,'' said Tate. ``It was hard on your
body. It prepared you mentally and physically for the camp.''
</P>
<P>
   As much work as he did, the Patriots sent his emotions reeling
when they drafted Tebucky Jones and traded Jimmy Hitchcock. He
vowed he wouldn't get caught up in the bodies in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had to make sure I was in the best shape and give
myself the best opportunity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Soaking up all he could, he came to camp a much more confident
player. All of the frustration he felt being on the practice squad
week after week, hoping he'd get his one chance to be activated,
bottled him up. But now he seems freed from that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just basically looked at it like I'm a competitor and I
couldn't compete,'' he said. ``There were times I'd say, `Ah, I
could have helped out in this situation.' I got to compete in
practice, and that's what I had to hold on to, but I learned a lot
just being in the meetings with all the veterans and just to be
around our coaching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he was around last year, he is expected to know the
plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year (Carroll's) a lot more critical because he expects
me to know what he's talking about,'' said Tate. ``Every time I
make a mistake, he lets me know it's not good enough and this is
what I want you do. I can take it from him because I know he wants
me to be the best football player I can be.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt that while at Penn State, Tate successfully
defended Ohio State's Terry Glenn. It didn't hurt his cause that in
practice he was able to stay with Glenn, while others couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I covered Terry in his best year in college,'' said Tate. ``We
talk about it sometimes. I did real well against him. That gives me
a lot of confidence to see what he does to guys in college and the
pros and know that I can cover him. It tells you that if you can
stay with Terry and cover him hard, then you can cover most
receivers in the NFL. That's the way I look at it. We have a lot of
good speed receivers _ with Shawn (Jefferson) and Dietrich (Jells)
and Troy (Brown) _ you don't get much faster than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tate still has no assurances about anything. His experience puts
him ahead of North Carolina's Terry Billups and California's Kato
Serwanga, who may wind up in Tate's spot on the practice squad.
Tate is still competing with Canty, Jones, and veteran Steve
Israel, the latter two who have not taken the field yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's hard to make it as a free agent,'' Tate said.
``There are a lot of guys who didn't start as a highly-touted pick
but through the years they made themselves starters, Pro Bowlers or
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   He says thinking about why he wasn't drafted is wasted time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just let it go,'' Tate said. ``There's nothing I can do
about it now.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of camp the coaching staff told him to compete and
make plays. And not to get beat deep.
</P>
<P>
   That's how he measures himself on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``An ideal day would be if I know I didn't give up a big play
and if I made a big play,'' said Tate. ``If I don't get beat deep,
I feel pretty good about myself. It's a fight everyday. You'd
better be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   A biology major at Penn State, Tate once had ambitions of
becoming a doctor. After he had success as a football player, the
academic goals became less ambitious and ``I'm just happy I
graduated.'' He says football is his top priority, but he'd like to
return to college to earn his graduate degree in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``My No. 1 ambition is to play football,'' he said. ``It's nice
to hear them say they like me, they like me, but now I want to
play.''

PROGRAM EXPEDITES ADOPTION OF FOSTER CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At 54, Diane Bell thought it was too late for
motherhood. And having waited 2 1/2 (one-half) years for the
paperwork to come through on her two foster children, she began to
wonder if adoptive parenthood would elude her as well.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday was Mother's Day for Bell, who walked into a
downtown Los Angeles law firm to take part in an accelerated
adoption program and within hours had the paperwork to adopt
11-year-old Robyn and her 9-year-old brother, James.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally get to be a mom,'' said Bell while being hugged by
Robyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been waiting two years for this,'' Robyn said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell and her children were among almost 300 new families taking
part in an innovative program for expediting the adoption of foster
children. Put together by lawyers at the law firm of Gibson, Dunn
and Crutcher, 60 to 70 lawyers donated their time Saturday to set
up a paperwork assembly line that in a matter of hours finished
work that can take several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They streamline three years of work in one morning,'' said
Bell, who is divorced.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 15, she will appear in children's court with her new
family to confirm the adoption and receive new birth certificates
for the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is such a blessing to be able to expedite the adoption.
It's permanency in a child. It's a wonderful thing,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   By quickening the paperwork necessary for adoption, the program
helps put a dent in the county's backlogged foster care system _
more than 70,000 children need homes.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ullman, a staff attorney for Public Counsel, a nonprofit
organization that provides free representation to adopting parents
to finalize adoptions, said that waiting for documents to arrive in
the mail is just one of several problems families face trying to
adopt through the county foster care system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just for this half sheet of paper, it would take months and
months to come,'' she said, holding up one of the documents that
parents were helped with Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, families cannot afford attorneys, Ullman said,
and therefore they make mistakes completing paperwork, which gets
shuffled and sent back in an already slow system.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's adoption program was masterminded by Steven Meiers, a
partner at Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher, who got the idea from Judge
Michael Nash, presiding judge in Los Angeles County Dependency
Court. Nash had opened up his courtroom around Christmas last year
to confirm about a dozen adoptions. Meiers said that since then,
Nash has initiated a referral program for difficult adoption cases
to get transferred to services such as Public Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Meiers said he signed up attorneys from his firm, trained them
how to complete the paperwork correctly and got them to volunteer
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second event the group held, the first took place
on a Saturday in March when 120 adoptions were processed, and
confirmed in court one month later.
</P>
<P>
   Meiers said his firm anticipates on continuing Saturday adoption
events throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sensational thing that's happening. It's giving kids
who have nothing, something. These kids are tomorrow's homeless if
we don't help them,'' Meiers said.

NEW WOOD BUILDING PRODUCTS HELP MORE THAN JUST CREAKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Owning a house can be a creaky experience.
</P>
<P>
   Floors creak when you walk across them, windows creak when you
slide them open and doors creak when you shut them. Sometimes,
mostly at night when sleep is hard to come by, the whole house
seems to creak.
</P>
<P>
   Gremlins are at work all right and they have been on the job
since the frame was nailed together. It happens because the wood
used to build the house _ especially plywood sheets and the solid
wood joists used on the floors _ can change shape as the years roll
by.
</P>
<P>
   But the gremlins are dying off. Now, with increasing frequency,
new homes are being built with engineered wood products throughout
the structure, from floor to roof.
</P>
<P>
   Used as substitutes for plywood sheeting and solid wood floor
joists and beams, these products make a house stronger and quieter.
And while they're more expensive than traditional wood products,
these engineered wood products are preferred by more and more
builders because they don't warp like traditional wood and can be
made from just about all parts of smaller trees, saving old-growth
timber.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stuff is good for everybody. It's good for the
environment because (we're) utilizing a resource that would
otherwise just be thrown out by the mills. And it's been proven to
be as strong or stronger than actual milled lumber,'' said John
Diepen, owner of A Straight Line Construction Co. in Simi Valley
northwest of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The main component of an engineered floor system is an
``I-joist,'' which looks a lot like an iron I-beam.
</P>
<P>
   Flanges at the top and bottom of the joist are strips of
laminated veneer lumber. They are made by taking thin sheets of
wood peeled from a tree trunk _ Douglas fir in the West or southern
pine in the East _ that are then layered together with glue, heated
and put under pressure to create a strong bond.
</P>
<P>
   The flanges are then joined by what is called a web, which is
made from a pressed-wood product called oriented strand board.
</P>
<P>
   A series of I-joists are put down across the slab and then large
sheets of the oriented strand board are nailed on top.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of this construction method is that it is stronger
than a solid wood joist floor, the components won't warp so
shimming is not needed, and the nails won't pop loose, rub against
the wood and cause squeaking as the product ages.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Stottrup, editor of Rural Builder and Frame Building News,
which are publications of the National Frame Builders Association,
said these kinds of products are good substitutes for what is known
in the trade as ``solid and sawn lumber.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The big problem is that the quality (of solid and sawn lumber)
isn't very good any more. There are a lots of twists, warps and
splits and all the other things that can make two-by-10 or a
two-by-six not a nice piece of wood to work with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stottrup also said the dimensions of engineered lumber products
are more dependable than what comes directly from trees.
</P>
<P>
   And home builders are more and more dependent on the engineered
products, especially I-joists.
</P>
<P>
   The Engineered Wood Association said that 1997 production of
wood I-joists totaled 627 million linear feet. That number is
expected to double to 1.3 billion linear feet by 2002, said Jack
Merry, the association's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   I-joists now total about 33 percent of the residential floor
construction market and the number should jump to 40 percent this
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is proving to be a lucrative market for TJ International, a
Boise, Idaho-based lumber company that makes engineered wood
products.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the company's sales totaled $706 million, up 22
percent from 1996, while net income jumped to $27.5 million, up
from $16.2 million. Sales to the U.S. new home construction market
jumped 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Denig, the company's president and chief executive, said
sales are growing because the products provide faster installation
and less waste.
</P>
<P>
   Prices vary depending on market conditions but the engineered
products have not yet reached a point where they can be swapped on
a one-for-one basis with traditional wood products.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Lindsay, president of the Lumber Association of California
and Nevada and owner of Lindsay Lumber, said the products are
indeed gaining favor in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Engineered wood can be used for ceiling beams and the headers
over doorways and windows.
</P>
<P>
   And the oriented strand board has just about replaced plywood as
a sheeting material for roofs and the the exterior walls of homes,
which makes them stand up better in an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   ``For about the last five years it's virtually taken the market
over. There are still some old-timers who won't use it, but more
and more people are willing to accept it,'' he said. ``It might be
more expensive but I think you get a better product, a more stable
product and I think in the long term it's going to make a better
house.''

DODGERS' HOFFMAN PRAISES BROTHER TREVOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Glenn Hoffman remembers the days when he and his
brother Greg used to push their much younger sibling Trevor around.
But despite the disadvantage in age and size, Trevor wouldn't give
in to his brothers' bullying.
</P>
<P>
   And with that competitiveness in mind, the Dodgers manager can
understand why Trevor, a member of the San Diego Padres, is
currently the most dominant closer in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor pitched a hitless ninth Saturday to tie Rod Beck's
major-league record with his 41st consecutive converted save
opportunity during the Padres' 6-5 victory over the Houston Astros
in front of a sellout crowd of 54,176 at Qualcomm Stadium in San
Diego. The All-Star, whose streak began last year, has converted 33
saves this season. Beck did the same from 1993-95.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Trevor) works tremendously hard at what he does,'' said
Glenn, 40, who is 10 years older. ``You have to have luck, too. But
luck is also talent. I'm proud of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we (used to) push him away, he would always come
back. He always wanted to compete (with us), even though we were
much bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers right fielder Gary Sheffield also has a connection with
the Padres reliever. Sheffield was traded from San Diego to the
Florida Marlins in a five-player deal that sent Trevor to the
Padres on June 24, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A different brother tale: Learning that he was traded to the
Padres wasn't the only interesting news that ex-Dodger Jim Bruske
heard after Wednesday night's game at Dodger Stadium. According to
sources, Bruske's brother Danny was arrested during the game
against the Astros that night after being intoxicated and acting
disorderly.
</P>
<P>
   Danny, who was in the stands with a group of friends, apparently
got involved in a fight and was shouting obscenities. He also
wasn't cooperative with a female security officer who approached
him. Soon after, he was arrested and temporarily detained in a
Dodger Stadium holding cell before being taken to the Los Angeles
Police Department downtown precinct. An LAPD spokesman couldn't
locate information about what happened to Danny after he was
brought downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Live from Cooperstown: Jaime Jarrin, the Dodgers' 40-year
Spanish broadcaster, and former Dodgers pitcher Don Sutton will be
inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown,
N.Y., today.
</P>
<P>
   KWKW 1330-AM, the Dodgers' Spanish radio flagship station, will
carry the induction ceremonies live from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. The
ceremonies will also be aired live on the Dodgers' Web site
(www.dodgers.com) and via the Lotus Satellite Network throughout
the U.S., Mexico and Jarrin's home country of Ecuador. ESPN2 will
air a half-hour Hall of Fame special today at 4 p.m. and 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Young doubtful: The Dodgers' Hoffman said it was doubtful Eric
Young would come off the disabled list Tuesday because he felt a
twinge in his right quadricep while rounding third base during a
running exercise Friday. The second baseman, who didn't work out
Saturday, has missed 13 games since being placed on the 15-day
disabled list on July 14.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said Young, who is eligible to come of the DL on Monday,
an off day, might return by the end of the week. Young was recently
the National League leader in stolen bases with 33, but he entered
Saturday six behind Pittsburgh's Tony Womack.

BRYAN TWINS BRING SPIRIT TO GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ American men's tennis has been desperate for an
infusion of spice ever since Jimmy Connors put down his racket _
and John McEnroe threw down his.
</P>
<P>
   That could change soon, but fans will have to wander away from
the high-profile arena of singles play to find it. Over there, on
the doubles court, a couple of young men from Camarillo are really
having some fun.
</P>
<P>
   They are Bob and Mike Bryan, 20-year-old twin brothers who
turned pro soon after combining last month to produce a rare triple
crown in college tennis _ NCAA team, singles (Bob) and doubles
championships while at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, they've smoked through three lower-level pro events
(two satellites and one challenger), have made a respectable
showing in a major pro event this past week in Washington, and
generated a bit of a stir all along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Next up: The Mercedes-Benz Cup this week at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wear black shoes, long pants (knee-length),'' Bob Bryan
said recently in a phone interview. ``We always have fun out there.
We're pretty enthusiastic. In exchange for that, we get a lot of
crowd support.... We bring the crowd into the match. We make it
fun. We want to definitely give back instead of just being stoners
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes their opponents are considerably less taken with their
exuberance. Michael Tebbutt of Australia, a top singles seed upset
by Bob Bryan in a recent tournament in Aptos, grumbled afterward
about the antics.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford coach Dick Gould realizes a fine line exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so much fun because they do bring that enthusiasm to
the game,'' he said of the twins. ``I think you have to be a little
careful because things can rub people the wrong way. Let's not put
it in the context of the Bryans, but in general context: What comes
across as unbridled enthusiasm for one person.... you have to be
careful you don't rub something in someone's face at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very aware of that. But they're always bouncing around
and hopping. A chest bump here and there. On the other side, every
once in a while I catch someone rolling their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gould added, ``I think people realize it's not malicious,
it's just the way they are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bryans certainly have just cause to be excited. After
producing dominant juniors careers in Southern California, they
continued the act at Stanford, where they were a combined 139-19 in
singles and 67-15 in doubles over the two years they were there.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to turn pro last month was made easier by the
lopsided nature of these numbers. ``They sort of maxed out college
tennis,'' said Wayne Bryan, the young men's father and coach.
``That's not a record you could grow with. You need to have more
losses to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the twins are already storming through lower-level
pro competition without many setbacks. Bob won the singles and the
two combined for doubles championships in $15,000 future events in
Waco, Texas, and Tulsa, Okla. Another doubles title followed at a
$50,000 challenger tournament two weeks ago in Aptos, where Bob
also survived to the round of 16 in singles.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, at the $700,000 Legg Mason Classic, they advanced
to the semifinals in doubles before losing, although Bob was
eliminated in the first round of singles by Michael Sell.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Mercedes-Benz Cup at UCLA, Mike Bryan said, ``It's going
to be awesome going back home. We always get a big turnout. We live
an hour away, and so many people come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing in such events is nothing new for these two _ they
competed in 25 pro events as amateurs, including the U.S. Open
three times and the Los Angeles tournament (then sponsored by
Infiniti) twice.
</P>
<P>
   As a direct result, the pro circuit ``hasn't been a big shock so
far,'' said Bob. ``We've been through these tournaments before. Now
it's just a matter of taking the money. We try not to let that
affect our play. `I could make another $1,000 if I make this
serve.' You get a little tight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Davis Cup seems undeniably in their future, since many of
the top singles players eschew doubles, while many American doubles
players have foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
   But the implicit challenge for the Bryans will be to keep this
act together as they advance their professional careers
individually.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bryan, as the reigning NCAA champion, is getting wild cards
in singles draws, but Mike Bryan often must go through qualifying.
If the two play events back-to-back and continue to maintain their
run of success in doubles, they'll be competing in doubles well
into weekends _ when qualifying at the ensuing tournament is being
conducted. Mike, for example, missed a chance to qualify for the
Washington event because of their doubles success at Aptos.
</P>
<P>
   It would behoove them to keep this alliance going as long as
possible, though. The novelty of the pairing, combined with their
on-court animation, is sure to heighten their popularity. The sport
could probably use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they can contribute a great deal in that way,'' said
Stanford's Gould. ``The top players don't play doubles. I guess
they feel it's too much tennis. That hurts (tennis).
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, when you have a team that obviously loves
it and is communicating well, and they're involved in the game and
projecting their joy for what they're doing, it makes games more
exciting to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Bryan twins, in this new career path called professional
tennis, the excitement, clearly, is mutual.

GALAXY LOSES TO D.C. UNITED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- Even the best teams suffer through slumps and the
Los Angeles Galaxy certainly is in the midst of one its toughest.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to snap out of a recent funk, the Galaxy failed to
respond in one of its biggest games this season, suffering a bitter
1-0 loss to D.C. United in front of 26,873 disappointed fans
Saturday night at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Things got so bad at the end that the team left to a chorus of
boos until every last one of players exited the field.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Galaxy lose back-to-back games for the first
time this season, the team fell flat in what had been anticipated
to be a huge revenge game.
</P>
<P>
   Just 15 days prior, United manhandled the Galaxy, 3-0, in
Washington, making many wonder if the Los Angeles team indeed was
the best MLS had to offer after it had won 15 of its first 17
games.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse was the way the loss transpired as the only
score came on a first-half own goal by Galaxy defender Robin Fraser
following a hard cross by United's Marco Etcheverry.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Galaxy (16-5) was up a man after D.C. United's
Mario Gori picked up his second yellow card, resulting in his
ejection in the 16th minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, this was a big game, said Galaxy defender Paul
Caligiuri. ``Most people say we are the teams that should meet in
the final and this was an opportunity to get some revenge and to
show our fans we can play at a high level.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, D.C. United (18-5) won for the fifth consecutive time
and swept the two-game season series between the teams.
</P>
<P>
   United coach Bruce Arena said Saturday's game was not one in
which he could really evaluate his team's play because of the early
ejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a man down for as long as we were changed the complexion
of the whole game, Arena said. ``The only thing I could say is that
we showed the kind of heart this team has.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United was a man down until the Galaxy's Welton was red
carded for pushing United's Carey Talley away from the ball in the
57th minute, but by then the team had expended much of its energy,
according to Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Although true scoring opportunities were limited for the Galaxy,
the team had two goals disallowed, the first of which came in the
34th minute.
</P>
<P>
   In that sequence, Martin Machon gathered the ball in the middle
of the penalty area, firing a left-footed shot past goalkeeper
Scott Garlick, but Welton was ruled offsides and the goal taken
away.
</P>
<P>
   The second one involved forward Carlos Hermosillo, who continued
his scoring drought. The Mexican star failed to register a goal for
his seventh consecutive game since joining the team June 6.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration appeared to be over in the 61st minute when
Hermosillo broke free and managed a weak shot that trickled by
Garlick, but again an offsides call spoiled the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was Hermosillo guilty of the infraction, although
by only a half-body length at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't look for excuses at this point, said Caligiuri, who
had a strong game at outside defender, although he was substituted
for late in the game. ``We created a lot of chances, but we just
couldn't finish. We were effective, but we maybe could have
pressured them a little more.

GALAXY LOSES ON OWN GOAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Oops, there it is.
</P>
<P>
   An error by the Galaxy's Robin Fraser or perhaps we should call
him D.C. United's Fraser forced the faithful at the Rose Bowl to
shower him in boos as he exited the field Saturday night. Fraser
scored an own goal in the 43rd minute to give D.C. United a 1-0 win
over the Galaxy in front of 26,873 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser's goal is the Galaxy's only own goal this season.
United's Marco Etcheverry tried to pass to Roy Lassiter, who was in
front of the goal. Etcheverry's pass overshot Lassiter and landed
next to Fraser, who booted it into his goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things happen in the game,'' coach Octavio Zambrano
said. ``There is no player in world who wants to score in his own
goal. Those unfortunate things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser refused to be interviewed about the miscue. He jumped on
the team bus before the media was allowed in the Galaxy's locker
room. Despite the accident, Zambrano praised his team because of
its effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a good game because of the intensity,'' he
said. ``The two teams have a lot of mutual respect.''
</P>
<P>
   On the only goal, Fraser was so close in proximity to goalkeeper
Kevin Hartman that there was no chance the backward shot could have
been defended. That goal gave the win to United (18-6), the
two-time MLS champ. The Galaxy's loss made it the first time this
season that they have dropped two consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   The faux pas capped a half of missed chances by the Galaxy
(16-5). The misses continued in the second half as the Galaxy
finished with 11 shots, five on goal. United had four shots, two on
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Physicality marked the game. Each team committed 11 fouls.
</P>
<P>
   United's Mario Gori received his second yellow card in the 16th
minute and thus was ejected. Despite his exit, the Galaxy could not
score with the man advantage in the first half. They mustered three
shots, just one on goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy evened the sides in the 58th minute when Welton
received a red card for elbowing Carey Talley in the head. This was
Welton's first objection of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy appeared to score twice, Danny Pena in the 33rd
minute and Carlos Hermosillo in the 61st minute. But both goals
came with a linesman flag held and were disallowed because of
offsides. Hermosillo, heralded as one of Mexico's most prolific
scorers, finished his seventh game with the Galaxy. The almost goal
would have been his first.
</P>
<P>
   The referee calls on the offsides plus some close shots had the
Galaxy questioning the officiating. ``This was a very strange
game,'' Welton said. ``For us we tried and controlled the game. We
scored, and the referee made mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   The calls, in particular a near goal by Martin Machon in the
42nd minute, had Zambrano commenting on the officiating, even
though he makes it a rule to not do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's happening now with the referees is the intent
is being lost,'' Zambrano said. ``I'm not so sure it's helping the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano, however, did not question the only goal, the own goal.

ONE BAD INNING BURNS DREIFORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Darren Dreifort's two career landmarks were
spoiled by one bad inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers right-hander earned a pair of career-highs by
striking out 10 batters and hitting the first home run of his
career on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   But those accomplishments meant little in light of his bad
fourth inning, in which he allowed five runs during the Dodgers'
5-3 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks in front of 38,937 at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Dodgers five games behind the Chicago Cubs
in the wild-card race and was just their seventh setback in their
last 18 games at Chavez Ravine. The expansion Diamondbacks, who own
major-league baseball's worst record, also snapped a three-game
losing streak with the victory and earned just their second win in
their last six contests.
</P>
<P>
   It was just last Monday when Dreifort worked the most impressive
start of his career by keeping the visiting Cincinnati Reds
scoreless on just one hit in eight innings. During the first three
innings Saturday, he mimicked that awesome performance by
impressively fanning five and allowing a game-opening single to
Andy Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Than came the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks loaded the bases with no outs on three singles.
Devon White followed with a two-run double that put Arizona up 2-0.
With Jay Bell at the plate with no outs, Dreifort then threw a
costly wild pitch that scored David Dellucci from third before
White came in from second and barely slid safely at the plate for
another run.
</P>
<P>
   The damage was completed when Tony Batista's sacrifice fly
scored Bell to give Arizona a nice 5-0 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks entered the game as the major league's worst
offensive team with a .247 average. But at least in the fourth
inning _ which was the only one Arizona scored in _ the
Diamondbacks temporarily shed that image with five hits and batted
around.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the fourth, Eric Karros hit a no-out RBI single
off Arizona starter Omar Daal that scored Raul Mondesi from second
and trimmed the Dodgers' deficit to 5-1. Karros' hit also gave the
Dodgers two men on base, but neither would score.
</P>
<P>
   While a collegian at Wichita State, Dreifort was known for more
than just pitching. He once was an All-Missouri Valley Conference
second-team designated hitter in 1993 and batted a career .318 with
25 home runs and 89 RBI in 314 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   When he was named a starter before the season, he joked to
reporters about how he would hit numerous home runs since he would
receive more at-bats. But on this night, he began his trek toward
Roger Maris by hitting a leadoff home run on a full-count pitch off
Daal in the fifth inning that trimmed Arizona's lead to 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   The 430-foot shot landed in the left-field bleachers and was the
first home run by a Dodgers pitcher since now-New York Met Hideo
Nomo hit one against the Milwaukee Brewers on April 28.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers came within two runs of Arizona in the seventh 5-3
when Mondesi's RBI sacrifice scored Roger Cedeno. After a wild
pitch that moved Wilton Guerrero to third was followed by a Gary
Sheffield walk, Karros came to the plate with two outs and
representing the go-ahead run for the Dodgers. But Arizona reliever
Bobby Chouinard got Karros to hit into a force-out to end the
threat.
</P>
<P>
   In 61/3 innings, Daal allowed three runs (two earned) on eight
hits and struck out four.
</P>
<P>
   After the fourth, Dreifort regained his form, struck out five
batters during the next three innings and looked more like Monday's
untouchable pitcher. He finished by allowing five earned runs on
seven hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   In some good news for the Dodgers, reliever Mike Judd pitched a
scoreless eighth and struck out two of the three batters he faced
in his season debut. Judd, who was rated as the Dodgers' third-best
prospect by Baseball America, was recalled Thursday from Triple-A
Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had yet another chance in the eighth inning to
either tie or overcome the Diamondbacks. Trenidad Hubbard was on
third with two outs when pinch-hitter Tripp Cromer walked to the
plate. Cromer hit a hot grounder off reliever Alan Embree that
seemed destined for a RBI single, but second baseman Danny Klassen
made a successful dive for the ball and threw the Dodger out at
first to end the inning.

DODGERS LOSE TO ARIZONA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Darren Dreifort's two career landmarks were
spoiled by one bad inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers right-hander established a pair of career-highs by
striking out 10 batters and hitting the first home run of his
career on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   But those accomplishments meant little in light of his bad
fourth inning, in which he allowed five runs during the Dodgers'
5-3 loss to the expansion Arizona Diamondbacks in front of 38,937
at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than walking two guys and giving up five hits (in the
fourth) inning, it wasn't a bad outing,'' said Dreifort, who
pitched seven innings, allowed five hits and only gave up runs in
the fourth. ``The pitches in the fourth weren't bad pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Dodgers (53-51) five games behind the wild
card-leading Chicago Cubs and kept them from climbing four games
over .500 for the third time this season. Arizona, which owns the
majors' worst record, also snapped a three-game losing streak with
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was just last Monday when Dreifort worked the most impressive
start of his career by keeping the visiting Cincinnati Reds
scoreless on just one hit in eight innings. During the first three
innings Saturday, he mimicked that performance by fanning five and
only allowing a game-opening single to Andy Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Than came the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks loaded the bases with no outs on three singles.
Devon White followed with a two-run double that put Arizona up 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a key part of the game,'' said White. ``In that
situation, I'm trying to hit the ball hard and drive in some
runs.''
</P>
<P>
   With Jay Bell at the plate with no outs, Dreifort then threw a
costly wild pitch that scored David Dellucci from third and White,
who came in from second and barely slid under Dreifort's tag at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort (6-9) said, ``I don't think I was positioned right at
the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big risk with no outs, but fortunately it gave us a
big lift,'' said Arizona manager Buck Showalter, who preached to
his club before the series about the large mass of backstop space
at Chavez Ravine.
</P>
<P>
   The damage was completed when Tony Batista's sacrifice fly
scored Bell to give Arizona a 5-0 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks entered the game as the major leagues' worst
offensive team with a .247 average. But at least in the fourth
inning the Diamondbacks temporarily shed that image with five hits
and batted around.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Dreifort) looked awesome except for that one inning when he
got the ball up,'' said Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman. ``That one
bad inning got him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the fourth, Eric Karros hit a no-out RBI single
off Arizona starter Omar Daal that scored Raul Mondesi from second
and trimmed the Dodgers' deficit to 5-1. Karros' hit also gave the
Dodgers two men on base, but neither would score.
</P>
<P>
   While a collegian at Wichita State, Dreifort was known for more
than just pitching. He once was a second-team All-Missouri Valley
Conference designated hitter in 1993 and also batted a career .318
with 25 home runs and 89 RBI in 314 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort's leadoff home run came on a full-count pitch from Daal
in the fifth that trimmed Arizona's lead to 5-2. The 430-foot shot
landed in the left field bleachers and was the first home run by a
Dodgers pitcher since now-New York Met Hideo Nomo's against the
Milwaukee Brewers on April 28. Dreifort also became the first
pitcher ever to hit a home run off Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers came within two runs of Arizona in the seventh, 5-3,
when Mondesi's RBI sacrifice scored Roger Cedeno. After a wild
pitch that moved Wilton Guerrero to third was followed by a Gary
Sheffield walk, Karros came to the plate with two outs representing
the go-ahead run for the Dodgers. But Arizona reliever Bobby
Chouinard got Karros to hit into a forceout to end his club's
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Daal (4-5) took the win and allowed three runs (two earned) on
eight hits in 61/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   In some good news for the Dodgers, reliever Mike Judd pitched a
scoreless eighth and struck out two of the three batters he faced
in his season debut. Judd, who was rated as the Dodgers' third-best
prospect by Baseball America, was recalled Thursday from Triple-A
Albuquerque.

BIG DAY TURNS SOUR AT DEL MAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR _ The Del Mar racetrack and Thoroughbred Owners of
California added $100,000 to the purse for Saturday's San Diego
Handicap to make sure that drawing card Silver Charm would run.
Here's what they bought.
</P>
<P>
   _ An increase of a measly 656 in on-site attendance over the
same day last year.
</P>
<P>
   _ A last-place finish by Silver Charm, apparently a victim of
respiratory bleeding, a disappointment to the bettors who made him
1-5 and especially the bridge-jumpers who dropped more than
$100,000 in show bets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Big worries about the marquee value of the Pacific Classic, in
which Silver Charm, the 1997 Kentucky Derby winner, was to be the
star attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Unrelated to the San Diego, the day also saw Laffit Pincay, the
greatest active jockey, fracture his left collarbone and a rib in a
10th-race fall. Pincay is one winner from Bill Shoemaker's Del Mar
record for career winners and 202 from Shoemaker's world record.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, a great day to be a Del Mar executive.
</P>
<P>
   The Mark McGwire show had left town, and now it was Silver
Charm's turn to take batting practice, tuning up to face Gentlemen
in the $1 million Pacific Classic on Aug. 15. Not only didn't he
knock his four opponents into the upper deck, he barely made
contact.
</P>
<P>
   He was well-positioned on the outside of leader Mud Route
halfway through the 1 1/16-mile race. But when Hal's Pal applied
pressure from the outside, and Gary Stevens asked Silver Charm to
quicken to maintain position, the 4-year-old didn't respond.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm dropped back steadily and jogged home last, no
longer urged by Stevens, 27 lengths behind victorious Mud Route. Of
the purse, raised to $250,000, Silver Charm collected $5,010.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in 15 starts he'd finished worse than
second.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens was reassuring. ``It's definitely not an injury,'' the
jockey said. ``Not that I felt. All the symptoms would tell me he
bled pretty significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, an endoscopic examination of Silver Charm's
lungs revealed ``very minor'' bleeding, trainer Bob Baffert
announced. But Baffert seemed to think there was something else
wrong internally.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something wrong with his motor,'' Baffert said.
``We're going to check him from stem to stern.''
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis, and how quickly Silver Charm returns to training,
will determine whether he runs in the Pacific Classic. He missed
the $1 million Santa Anita Handicap and Hollywood Gold Cup after
minor physical problems were announced within days of the races.
</P>
<P>
   There were boos from the crowd of 19,231, but not many, a
tribute to his popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to see a special horse, especially one you're part
of, give the public a bad performance,'' Stevens said. ``There were
some boos out there. The horse doesn't deserve that.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Pincay was injured when Sid the Author fell at the start
of the backstretch. Brice Blanc fell from Totana in the same
incident but walked off. Neither horse appeared hurt. Pincay, 51,
has broken collarbones a dozen times.... Sicy d'Alsace ($84.80) and
Corey Nakatani rallied from last and survived an inquiry to win the
$112,500 San Clemente Handicap for 3-year-old fillies on the turf.
The French-bred won in a photo over Miss Hot Salsa just two days
after stepping off the plane.... Nick Canani trained Sicy d'Alsace.
His dad, Julio Canani, trained three winners Saturday, sweeping the
early double with McFig and T.V. of Hemet, and adding Ree Saspri in
the ninth.... Pick-six carryover: $209,286.... Son of a Pistol is
the 2-1 favorite for the Bing Crosby sprint today.

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

   &UR; A CRIME IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Suzanne Berne. Owl/Holt, $11.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-year-old narrator tells of the brutal murder of a young boy
in a Washington suburb and its aftermath, but her story also
captures the history of child-parent relations in the last 25
years, from the adults' casual abandonment of their children to the
next generation's revenge. Last year in the Book Review, Jacqueline
Carey called this a ``remarkable first novel.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NO MERCY: A JOURNEY TO THE HEART OF THE CONGO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Redmond O'Hanlon. Vintage Departures, $14.
</P>
<P>
   This wild account of a nutty expedition in search of a living
dinosaur is mostly told through comical, scientific and
self-probing digressions, but at its core it is about different
ways -- both linear and nonlinear -- of perceiving the world. In
1997 our reviewer, Tim Cahill, called this eccentric travelogue
``half mad and unremittingly brilliant.'' The same publisher has
issued another book that happily wanders off the beaten track,
 &UR; TROPICAL CLASSICAL: ESSAYS FROM SEVERAL DIRECTIONS &LR; , by Pico Iyer
($13), a collection of essays, book reviews and other short
journalistic pieces by an eloquent observer of foreign locales and
surprising culture clashes. ``Iyer is open and curious, both
humorous and thoughtful,'' Elizabeth Hanson wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE JADE PEONY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Wayson Choy. Picador USA, $12.
</P>
<P>
   Set in Vancouver's Chinatown during the late 1930s and early
1940s, this coming-of-age novel focuses on three siblings in an
immigrant family struggling with the burden of old ways and the
need to learn new ones. Last year in these pages, Philip Gambone
admired ``Choy's keen insight into the way children come to terms
with the diversity of everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PROMISCUITIES: THE SECRET STRUGGLE FOR WOMANHOOD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Naomi Wolf. Fawcett Columbine, $13.95.
</P>
<P>
   The author uses her own experiences as a springboard for
blasting away myths and examining the complicated legacy of the
sexual revolution for young women today. The result is ``a searing
and thoroughly fascinating exploration of the complex wildlife of
female sexuality and desire,'' Courtney Weaver said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE PHYSIOGNOMY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jeffrey Ford. Avon/Eos, $3.99.
</P>
<P>
   This Kafkaesque allegory unfolds in the Well-Built City, where
Physiognomist First Class Cley can read subversive thoughts in the
topography of a man's cranium; the novel follows his painful
journey from committed scientist and zealous torturer to selfless
rebel. ``Ford writes equally well about the scientific cult of
precision and the acceptance of ambiguity,'' Gerald Jonas wrote
here last year. In another science fiction tale by the same
publisher,  &UR; I WHO HAVE NEVER KNOWN MEN &LR; , by Jacqueline Harpman
($3.99), the youngest of 40 women kept under guard in an
underground bunker struggles to figure out what it means to have a
life of her own. Last year our reviewer, Sally Eckhoff, called this
postapocalyptic novel, which was translated from the French by Ros
Schwartz, ``bleak but fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CORNER: A YEAR IN THE LIFE OF AN INNER-CITY NEIGHBORHOOD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By David Simon and Edward Burns. Broadway Books, $15.
</P>
<P>
   The authors camped out almost daily for over a year on a corner
in a West Baltimore ghetto, tracking the lives of drug addicts and
ordinary residents struggling to coexist. Their report, which
explodes many stereotypes of the urban poor, is ``brave,
unblinkered and heartbreaking,'' Sara Mosle wrote here last year.
In another ground-level look at inner-city life,  &UR; OUR AMERICA: LIFE
AND DEATH ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO &LR; , by LeAlan Jones and Lloyd
Newman with David Isay (Washington Square/Pocket Books, $14), two
teen-agers tape their voices and experiences, as well as those of
other housing-project residents. In 1997 our reviewer, Judith
Newman, said this gritty chronicle ``reveals the humanity, humor
and pathos among petty dope dealers, teen-age mothers and even
pre-teen-age killers.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE NATURE OF BLOOD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Caryl Phillips. Vintage International, $12.
</P>
<P>
   The author, a West Indian raised in England, uses the story of a
young Jewish woman in Nazi Germany to explore the problem of
European tribalism and the terrible price it exacted during the
Holocaust, as well as the historical roots of intolerance. This is
``an extraordinarily perceptive and intelligent novel, and a
haunting one,'' James Shapiro said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OLD BOOKS, RARE FRIENDS: TWO LITERARY SLEUTHS AND THEIR SHARED
PASSION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Leona Rostenberg and Madeleine Stern. Main Street/Doubleday,
$11.95.
</P>
<P>
   The engaging authors of this joint memoir describe their
uncommonly harmonious 60-year friendship and a mutual devotion to a
life of the mind as scholars and rare book dealers. ``Their story
is irresistible to anyone in love with books,'' Margot Peters wrote
in the Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN THE PALM OF DARKNESS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Mayra Montero. Translated from the Spanish by Edith Grossman.
Harper Flamingo, $12.
</P>
<P>
   An American herpetologist and his local guide search for a
nearly extinct species of frog in the mountains of Haiti, a ravaged
land where the magical and occult still flourish. Last year our
reviewer, Zofia Smardz, called this ``a resplendent piece of
writing that brings a mysterious and murderous country throbbingly
to life.''

character, and its fear of ceding political control to a a mainly

   TV-COMEBACK-MEDIA (Pasadena, Calif.) _ At a time when the
broadcast networks are ever more battered by viewer defections,
with ratings this summer hitting unexpected new lows, the need for
exciting new shows to bring the audiences back has never been
greater. But few television executives expect the new fall season
to produce the comeback the networks need. The failure of the
networks to generate much excitement for the fall line-up, even
among some of their own executives, is increasingly being blamed on
a program development system that many consider antiquated and
counter-productive. By Bill Carter.

greater. But few television executives expect the new fall season
to produce the comeback the networks need. The failure of the
networks to generate much excitement for the fall line-up, even
among some of their own executives, is increasingly being blamed on
a program development system that many consider antiquated and
counter-productive. By Bill Carter.

PATENTS: TRANSPATENT SHOES, WRISTWATCH ACCUPRESSURE, MIRRORED HAT,
AUTOMATIC WORKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.J., N.Y., South Korea, England)  (js) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most patents cover devices or scientific discoveries. But some
are for inventions people can wear.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sileo of Edison, N.J., has designed a pair of transparent
laced shoes. The tongue, insole and shoelaces are made of colored
or ornamented material, and are coordinated to match one another.
The design or color is intended to be clearly visible through the
shoes. Sileo suggests that the top and bottom of the tongue be
different colors or patterns, and that the shoelaces match one side
or the other. He wants the shoes to come with packages of two
tongues, two insoles and two pairs of shoelaces with coordinating
designs so the look of the shoes can be changed. Sileo received
patent 5,659,979.
</P>
<P>
   Using Accupressure To Alleviate Nausea
</P>
<P>
   Accupressure applied to the wrist is believed to alleviate
nausea. Tae Woo Yoo of Seoul, South Korea, has patented a
stimulator that can be worn on the underside of a wristwatch. The
device is a small disk with accupressure spikes on one side. The
opposite side is covered with adhesive. The stimulator is attached
to the back of a watch. When the watch is strapped on, the
accupressure spikes are in contact with the wearer's wrist. The
invention received patent 5,774,424.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing Where You've Been
</P>
<P>
   Mark Steele, an inventor from Wellington, England, has patented
a mirrored hat that lets the wearer see what is behind him or her.
The hat is transparent and block-shaped, and is designed to sit on
top of the head. It does not come down the forehead enough to block
normal vision, but can be seen when the wearer looks up. The rear
of the block is open. Inside the block, the upper surfaces reflect
light that shines in from the rear. When the wearer looks up, he
sees a reflection of what is behind him. Steele received patent
5,771,497.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise Pants For Leg Muscles
</P>
<P>
   A pair of exercise pants lined with restrictive rubber bands are
intended to work major leg muscles. Timothy Dicker of Lake View
Terrace, Calif., designed the pants to have one or two restricting
rubber bands that run from waist to foot in the front and back of
the pants. The bands are aligned with the long muscles of the leg.
Suspenders hold the pants up. The bands divide at the knee in the
front of the pants, and end in a stirrup around the heel. Dicker
received patent 5,727,254.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping that Tie Under Control
</P>
<P>
   Unruly neckties can now be restrained by a shirt. Bob Caniglia
of Scarborough, N.Y., has patented a shirt with two methods of
controlling flyaway ties. His first suggestion is for a shirt with
a small opening in its front. The rear tail of the tie is pulled
through the opening. A second idea is for a shirt with a loop
attached to its front. The rear tail of the tie is pulled through
the loop. The front panel of the tie conceals the loop. The loop
also serves as a tie pin that prevents the front of the tie from
flopping around. Caniglia received patent 5,571, 218.
</P>
<P>
   Jewelry For the Feet
</P>
<P>
   Jewelry for the feet is more than toe rings. Alberta Moore of
Hopewell, N.J., has patented an ankle ornament that loops around
the second toe. The jewelry is a chain or woven rope that circles
the ankle and comes together at the top of the foot, then extends
in a straight line to the second toe, where another loop encircles
the digit. The entire piece is beaded or covered with decoration.
The beads or ornaments can be padded for comfort. Ms. Moore
received patent 5,368,710.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Score another one for John Malone, chairman of
Tele-Communications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he strike a savvy deal for himself in selling the
huge cable television operator to AT&AMP;T Corp., he also reaped some
extraordinary benefits for a part of the TCI empire that he will
still control: Liberty Media Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty will get a tax loss of roughly $1.8 billion that can be
used to offset future tax bills, and it will get the right to
borrow billions without seeking permission from AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone trying to value Liberty, which is the cable
programming arm of TCI with stakes in many companies, the job keeps
getting more difficult. And as Malone's financial plan unfolds
piece by piece, it is worth remembering that his deals are rarely
transparent.
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, Malone's financial performance has been
stunning. His initial investment of $42 million in Liberty Media
seven years ago would be worth more than 40 times that today, or
$1.76 billion, though he has sold some shares in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   Not all his shareholders have done so well. Two-thirds of the
shareholders of Tele-Communications passed up the chance to take a
stake in Liberty when he spun it off in 1991. At the time, one
stock analyst suggested that by making the spinoff so complex,
Malone discouraged investors and wound up with more Liberty shares
for himself. A TCI investor who participated in the initial Liberty
offering, admittedly a risky one, has made 10 times as much money
as one who just held on to the TCI stock.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, who was traveling last week and did not return phone
calls, was recently quoted in Broadcasting and Cable, a trade
publication, as saying that he needed ``a corner somewhere where I
can just sit and scheme. Come up with creative, structural ideas,
technical or financial _ that's me, that's my personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bennett, president of Liberty Media, says Malone is the
primary financial architect of his deals even though he works with
associates and investment bankers. Bennett also noted that all TCI
investors had the chance to participate in the Liberty spinoff and
that even those who did not had enjoyed strong stock gains.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's creativity is on proud display in the AT&AMP;T deal. AT&AMP;T
will pay $36 billion for TCI and assume $11 billion in debt. For
Liberty, AT&AMP;T will do a stock swap with a new class of shares,
allowing Liberty to remain a ``tracking stock,'' meaning that the
company does not directly own its assets. Instead, the assets will
be owned by AT&AMP;T, and Liberty's stock will ``track'' the
performance of those designated assets.
</P>
<P>
   As previously reported, Malone structured the TCI sale so that
class B shares will get a premium of 9.7 percent more AT&AMP;T stock
than class A shares. Malone owns about 30 million class B shares.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, about half his fortune is in TCI and half in Liberty,
but after the deal Malone will effectively control Liberty and will
be able to sell the company, if he wants, with little prior
approval from AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty has told stock analysts that as part of the deal it will
get the right to a $1.8 billion net operating loss that has been
spread across the Tele-Communications businesses. By carrying
forward that loss in future years, Liberty could realize a gain of
up to $1.8 billion, say from the sale of assets, without owing any
taxes. A valuable right indeed.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all. Under the agreement, Liberty can borrow up to 25
percent of its market capitalization without requesting AT&AMP;T's
permission. The arrangement permits Liberty to borrow even more as
long as it does not affect AT&AMP;T's double-A credit rating. In all
likelihood, the credit rating agencies will assign ratings based on
AT&AMP;T's balance sheet, instead of Liberty's, meaning lower borrowing
rates as well.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T declined to comment on the tax loss or the borrowing
authority.
</P>
<P>
   As the deal is structured, Liberty Media will be merged with
another unit, also a tracking stock, TCI Ventures, and the combined
company's operations will remain essentially independent of AT&AMP;T.
But when it comes to tax breaks and borrowing power, Liberty will
be part of the AT&AMP;T family, getting all the benefits of that
blue-chip name.
</P>
<P>
   John Tinker, a stock analyst at Nationsbanc Montgomery
Securities, is bullish on Liberty's future. ``They have cash,
access to lots more and they are still part of the family,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Media, which now has stakes in Time Warner, USA
Networks, Discovery Networks and nearly two dozen cable programming
services, will get several Internet and other new media services of
TCI Ventures, which holds stakes in At Home, United Video Satellite
Group and Sprint Spectrum. The combined company's market
capitalization will be about $27 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That means Malone can borrow at least $6.75 billion at will. He
also expects to recognize $5.5 billion soon from planned asset
sales. So in all, Malone will have ready access to about $12.25
billion, which he says he will use to buy stakes in more
programming ventures. This pot of cash and its ultimate use are
critical to the company's valuation.
</P>
<P>
   From an investor's point of view, Liberty will look much like a
specialized media mutual fund, except with stakes in private
companies as well as public ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still very complicated,'' Tinker said, pointing out that
Liberty is a portfolio of investments _ in companies run by other
people _ not an operating company. Bennett, the president, added
that Liberty invests in concerns with strategic benefits and
usually puts one of its own executives on the boards of those
companies it invests in.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty's unusual corporate structure and the perks make it a
challenge to gauge just how much the company is worth. Its stock is
hovering near $40 for each A share, slightly off its all-time high
of $44, hit shortly after the AT&AMP;T deal was announced. ``But it's
trading at about 11 times 1998 cash flow,'' Tinker said. ``That's
low relative to other media companies in part because it is so
complex and the Street has not reflected the TCI Ventures merger.''
Even calculating the multiple is hard because many investments,
such as Time Warner, are publicly traded and fluctuate in value.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Its holdings will change fairly quickly, too. TCI Ventures now
owns a stake in Teleport, which some time ago struck a deal to
merge with AT&AMP;T. TCI Ventures was to have gotten $3 billion in AT&AMP;T
stock, but AT&AMP;T has agreed to buy back those shares for cash. AT&AMP;T
will also pay TCI Ventures $2.5 billion in cash for its stakes in
National Digital Television, Western Telecommunications and At
Home.
</P>
<P>
   And those sales won't create any capital gains. Tracking stocks
can sell an asset to another part of the tracking stock family _ in
this case AT&AMP;T _ without causing any tax gain.
</P>
<P>
   After those sales, TCI Ventures will still have a sizable stake
in Sprint Spectrum, which is expected to be spun off as a tracking
stock. Liberty's stake would be worth an estimated $2 billion in a
spinoff. If Liberty sold that stake, on which its investment is
negligible, it could shelter almost all the gain with the $1.8
billion net operating loss it has described to Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping a close tab on exactly what Liberty is and what it has
been is no easy matter. In 1991, when Malone spun off Liberty from
TCI, the company distributed an inch-thick prospectus describing
Liberty's 34 investments. Investors could get one Liberty ``right''
for every 200 shares of TCI. Each ``right'' let an investor
exchange 16 TCI shares for a Liberty share, valued at $256.
</P>
<P>
   While many shareholders were bewildered by the offering's
complexity and decided to sit on the sidelines, Malone got 8.7
percent of Liberty's shares, three times more than he would have
gotten had everyone participated. In later years, the company was
reacquired by TCI and then spun off again.
</P>
<P>
   Though many companies are trying to simplify complex financial
data, Malone feels no such pressure. For investors, that means that
keeping track of Malone is a full-time job.

<P>
   When news of the gunfire in the Capitol building swept the
country on Friday afternoon, a familiar ritual began. The Internet
news rush was on.
</P>
<P>
   At Cable News Network's Web site, cnn.com, servers running at 25
percent of capacity saw a surge to nearly 100 percent five minutes
after the shooting. A similar flood engulfed msnbc.com.
</P>
<P>
   All afternoon, as the reports grew more detailed _ the deaths of
two members of the Capitol police force, the emergency medical
treatment given to the gunman by Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., a heart
surgeon _ people kept checking in.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe, while they were there, they checked on how well their
stock portfolios had come out at the end of a rocky week, or looked
at the reviews of ``Saving Private Ryan,'' or monitored the weather
report to see how things were in the mountains where they were
going on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Like a photograph developing in the darkroom, the identity and
habits of Internet news audiences is not changing so much as it is
becoming clearer with every new crisis and every new computer user.
By and large, it is made up of younger men with college degrees and
professional jobs. They check in on the news from work, not home,
and even if they are drawn into a site by a crisis, they stay
around to pursue very particular individual interests.

   More than anything else, ``it's the big, big story that brings
them in,'' said Merrill Brown, editor in chief of msnbc.com. Second
in popularity is ``stuff with utility'' _ individualized stock
portfolios, reviews, listings, health and science news. The
sure-fire draw, he said, is a story about something that touches
both _ like a sharp shift in stock market prices. ``That's where
you're more likely to get people the other media don't get.''
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest difference between the Internet and other news
outlets, from newspapers and magazines to cable and network
television to radio, is that Internet news is read less often over
morning coffee and more often over eat-at-your-desk takeout food.
News _ the stuff of the morning newspaper, the evening newscast and
drive-time all-news radio _ is now the stuff of the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge difference,'' said Scott Woelfel, editor in chief
of cnn.com. ``Until recently, the only news that penetrated into
the workplace was radio. Now they go in and spend what could be
hours during the day'' checking into the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no surprise they don't watch the nightly news when they
go back,'' he added. ``They heard or read all those stories hours
before.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey last month from the Pew Research Center
for the People and the Press, one American in five goes online to
get the news at least once a week _ 15 percent of all women and 25
percent of all men. Two years ago, the overall figure was 6
percent. Some 35 percent of college graduates get their news from
the Internet at least once a week; 47 percent of college graduates
under the age of 30 do.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a big breaking story, what these people are
looking for, the Pew study indicates, is information about hobbies,
movies or restaurants (82 percent), science and health (64
percent), technology (60 percent) and finance (52 percent). Low in
the rankings was local news (28 percent).
</P>
<P>
   This makes sense, based on a recent study by the Newspaper
Association of America. It shows that 63 percent of those surveyed
regularly watch local television stations, more than use any other
medium. Internet news audiences don't try to find out about crimes
and fires and political squabbles while they are at their
computers. Why bother, when you can get it that night on
television?
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, just 7 percent of the news audience regularly gets its
news from the Internet, according to the association's survey,
which shows 51 percent regularly reading newspapers, 49 percent
listening to radio and 42 percent regularly watching national
television news. But different people are clearly gravitating to
different media. The Pew survey found that just 22 percent of men
under the age of 30 regularly watch network news, compared with 55
percent of women over the age of 50.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if Internet news sites draw but a small fraction of
news consumers, it is a fraction advertisers might find desirable.
More than 200,000 subscribers are paying up to $49 to read The Wall
Street Journal Interactive Edition (wsj.com), according to the
publication's managing editor, Rich Jaroslovsky. About two-thirds
of that group, he said, ``don't read The Wall Street Journal in
print.'' The interactive subscribers tend to be younger than the
readers of the broadsheet, he said (``40ish rather than 50ish''),
and four of five are male.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times on the Web (www.nytimes.com), which never
charged domestic subscribers and this month dropped the fee for
overseas subscriptions, now has about 4 million registered users,
77 percent of them men, according to Richard Meislin, the editorial
director. About 73 percent are college-educated and 55 percent have
household incomes greater than $50,000. The educational and income
profiles of msnbc.com's audience are similar _ 74 percent
college-educated, 62 percent with household incomes of more than
$55,000.
</P>
<P>
   Home consumption of online news is also rising, according to the
Web rating services Media Metrix and Relevant Knowledge. But even
at home, the audience is most often male; the favorite subject,
computers. The top news-related sites feature technology news:
Media Metrix ranks cnet.com, a computer-related site, highest,
above zdnet.com, the site of the Ziff-Davis Inc. technology news
magazines. Relevant Knowledge has zdnet ranked on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the peaks are when there is sexy technology news,''
said Jai Singh, the editor of C-Net's news.com site. The Capitol
shooting didn't cause a big spike in the audience numbers;
Thursday's Senate hearings on Microsoft's business practices did.
``If Bill Gates is in the news, it makes it big time,'' Singh said,
with a nod to the chief executive of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the online news audience, with its idiosyncratic
tastes, may arguably be helping cable news cut into the network
news audience. But it is not cutting into the time spent with
traditional media. Internet news junkies, apparently, are also just
plain news junkies. The Pew study reported, ``Those who go online
for news tend to spend more time than those who do not reading a
newspaper or watching television news.''

   EFFICIENCIES LOWER RETURNS OF UNSOLD HARD COVERS
</P>
<P>
   Book publishers are starting to brag about efficiencies that
have reduced the number of hard-cover returns, which in the worst
cases soared as high as 80 percent of the value of books shipped to
bookstores. In the first five months of 1998, hard-cover books sent
back by bookstores dropped by almost 19 percent, to $204 million,
from the comparable period in 1997.

   Every crisis, like the shooting in the Capitol building last
Friday, draws people to the Internet for news. These information

they are more often professional men eating takeout lunches at

   A presidential advisory committee is expected to call for a
significant increase in federal spending for advanced computer

current federal support for research in information technology
``dangerously inadequate'' and too short-term. The report requests

   A number of Internet bills that would protect children were

`TOO COOL': UNFLINCHING LOOK INTO TORMENTED YOUTHFUL HEART 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Blake said that the road of excess leads to the palace
of wisdom, and mythologist Joseph Campbell, in a statement that
Duff Brenna uses as an epigram to his new novel, said something
similar. Campbell wrote that ``the high road to the soul's
destination'' leads through ``dark and devious ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Such phrases have always made me wary, since they suggest a
justification, not for the hard anvil of experience but the soft
marshes of self-indulgence. And when a novel takes off from such
notions as the ``soul's destination,'' I worry that we might be in
store for a sentimental rhapsody, a redemptive fable.
</P>
<P>
   Brenna's book is indeed about the road of excess, but there need
be no worries about sentimentality here. His ``Too Cool'' is an
unfaltering, unflinching, piercing look into a tormented youthful
heart; it is finely modulated both in style and moral tone and
provokes a hard-won sort of compassion at the end. Brenna's
characters are teen-age desperadoes living on the nasty edges of
Denver. Their excesses involve things like stealing cars, smoking
dope, beating bystanders and one another, having rough sex and
hating their semi-absent parents.
</P>
<P>
   The main character is Elbert Earl Evans, 16, known as Triple E,
whom we first meet in a stolen Oldsmobile escaping into the wintry
mountains of Colorado ahead of the police. With him are Jeanne
Windriver, his 15-year-old girlfriend; a cousin named Ava and a
buddy named Tom. Triple E has escaped from reform school, where he
has done something very bad; we don't know yet exactly what, but it
had to do with an act of violence against the school psychologist,
Renee Bridgewater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ambition hooked him briefly, little daydreams about being like
her,'' Brenna's narrator says of Triple E's complicated
relationship with Mrs. Bridgewater. ``But then he lost faith. Words
coming from her mouth wandered over him empty as air, unable to do
anything, unable to physically take hold and change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The first few pages quickly demonstrate Brenna's keen ear for
his characters' aggressive vernacular, the macho swirl of language
that expresses the perverse intensity of their quest for
individuality, and at the same time insulates them from its
consequences, providing protection. They are bad kids, but not
irredeemably bad.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Triple E leaves the car to rob an elderly woman
carrying groceries, but he desists when she takes him for a
neighbor's boy and begins talking to him with affection. The group
drives into the mountains in a heavy snowstorm. The police close
in, and Triple E turns the car into a narrow mountain road where,
miles from anywhere and inundated by snow, they become hopelessly
stuck. Brenna achieves passages of lean beauty as he describes
Triple E's confrontation with the immensity of his predicament:
</P>
<P>
   ``He checks the circumference of his universe, vast and white
and indifferent, able to swallow life the way the sea can swallow
ships and even whole civilizations. A smothering dream: he becomes
the last living thing, his head bobbing on the surface of an empire
made of snow.''
</P>
<P>
   From here on, Brenna alternates between Triple E's efforts to
save himself and Jeanne and a recollection of the events that led
to this entrapment in snowy desolation. It would have been easy for
Brenna to fall into a kind of stock treatment here: the father who
tells him ``You're not the son I wanted,'' the distant, alcoholic
mother, the turn to crime and guns. But while those are the main
elements in the picture, he writes with such terseness and pungency
that we never feel as if we have seen exactly these things before.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Triple E's recent life, and of Brenna's vision
of a boy in trouble, is the unbridgeable divide between him and
those who try to help him. As he recalls his days at the
Goodpasture Correctional Facility, he remembers Mrs. Bridgewater's
delusional notion that Triple E was a special sort of boy whom she
would save with love and literature. She has him read passages from
a book called ``Modern Man in Search of a Soul,'' but as he
complies, his mind is occupied elsewhere. ``Painted nail pointing
at the book. Nail dark, like a drop of wine. He wanted her to put
it in her mouth, suck the drop off.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Tozer Douglas, a teacher at the reform school
who believes that boxing rather than literature is what will save
the souls of wayward youths. ``Life ain't fair,'' Tozer tells Mrs.
Bridgewater. ``Big deal. Be a man about it. Learn how to use it.
I'm teaching him how to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tozer and Mrs. Bridgewater are like the priest and the
pharmacist talking in ``Madame Bovary,'' each arguing a point of
view, both claiming to understand Emma Bovary's anguish, and each
revealing his own solipsistic blindness. Each wants to help but
also uses Triple E to satisfy a private ambition. After nearly
falling under their sway, he spectacularly rebels (his rebellion
against Tozer providing an unforgettably powerful passage). We
simultaneously cringe at his self-destructiveness and applaud his
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   As Triple E's struggles to find a way for him and Jeanne to
survive, his memories come in near-hallucinatory form. The idea
here is for the boy-man to face the explosive rage, the death wish,
the primitive urgings and the craving for love that brought him
face to face with death.
</P>
<P>
   Again, in less skillful hands, this could come across as a
cliche, an imitation of a breathless dust-jacket blurb. But
throughout Brenna's story we have the sense of being guided by a
probative narrator whose wise, unillusioned stare gets to the
reality of things. What especially characterizes ``Too Cool'' is
not just compassion but the honed intelligence of a skilled writer
who has brilliantly evoked the airtight, impenetrable inner logic
of youth determined at all cost to find its own way.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: LISTENING FOR IDEOLOGY IN COMMOTION OF TV NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is television news infected by a liberal virus or is it infested
with right-wing vermin? Recent eruptions confirm that this
much-chewed argument doesn't go away but continues to stir
ideological juices on all sides. Journalists' claims of objectivity
are perhaps imperfectly realized; even so, the hard-line critics
protest too much.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, in an aside about the CNN-Time magazine
``Valley of Death'' embarrassment, William Kristol, a conservative
voice on ABC, charged that the journalists who reported that the
United States used nerve gas in the Vietnam War were reflecting an
anti-military spirit common to the liberal communications complex.
I wrote on July 7 that it was more revealing of conservative animus
than of any special acquaintance with the mind-set of the program's
producers.
</P>
<P>
   By way of response to my response came a letter from Stanley
Rothman, the director of the Center for the Study of Social and
Political Change at Smith College, who agreed that the Kristol
crack was ``inappropriate'' but added, ``There is, in fact, a good
deal of evidence that television reporters tend to be social and
political liberals who have, since the Vietnam War, been quite
suspicious of the American military and willing to believe the
worst of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Kristol's or Rothman's suspicions, however, a striking
aspect of the episode was the failure of the liberal establishment
to rally to the defense of the anti-military reporters. As a group,
journalists, albeit not known for their sympathies for the
Pentagon, came down hard on their own cohorts.
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence and contrast, the summer issue of Extra, a
publication of Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR), an outfit
given to exposing right-wing machinations, was devoted to ``The
Myth of the Liberal Media.''
</P>
<P>
   According to this batch of studies and opinions, the upmarket
Washington press corps leans left on social issues like abortion
and homosexuality. But when it comes to issues in which they and
their corporate masters have an economic interest, like welfare,
health care and trade agreements, they are pretty much in the camp
of the well-to-do. (An acknowledged exception is concern for the
environment.)
</P>
<P>
   The FAIR articles also drew attention to the preponderance of
white male establishmentarians who are commonly displayed as
on-camera experts and to the glut of right-wing radio ranters. But
then, from the perspective of FAIR, even reputed leftists are
champions of the status quo in liberal clothing. In FAIR speak, the
few dependably good guys are known as ``progressives.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there is little anyone can do to dissuade true believers,
whether of left or right, from the conviction that the other party
is entrenched in positions of power from which it misleads the
public. Often there is something to such charges, be it about
plutocratic control of the networks or the political bent of
workaday reporters. And nothing any reviewer mutters is likely to
deprive either side of the precious feeling of being beleaguered by
the barbarians.
</P>
<P>
   But getting a political fix on television journalism is not
easy; it's like trying to navigate with flawed instruments in heavy
weather. There's just too much of the stuff pouring forth for tidy
measurement, and although all big news operations work within the
confines of mainstream politics, what seems generally true of Ted
Turner's CNN on any issue is not always true of Rupert Murdoch's
FoxNews. Performing content analysis of news programs and of
commentators is difficult enough, but when you add in hybrid forms
like news magazines and fictions with some sort of message, they
challenge the most sophisticated calculation. And the camera itself
remains a powerful imponderable.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some impressionistic analysis is relatively easy: homosexuality
and abortion and environmental concerns can count on friendlier
treatment on the tube than is generally accorded to, say, the
Christian right; on the other hand, business news receives far more
attention than labor news.
</P>
<P>
   But even so, figuring out where the media, broadly defined, are
coming from or heading, can be daunting. Commentary on expanding
the North American Free Trade Agreement, for example, may have been
tilted in favor of expanded trade, but the many reports that
focused on workers losing their jobs to foreign competition carried
a dramatically different message. Insofar as coverage of the
General Motors strike seems to be in favor of the auto workers and
their union, that may be due less to doctrinal sympathy than simply
to the camera's preference for T-shirts over suits.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to fathom a party line on many other matters can be
perplexing. Take U.S. relations with China. Just when you're
persuaded by business-centered analysts that accommodation is
desirable or inevitable, the famous picture of the young Chinese
man standing before a tank in Tiananmen Square touches the
conscience. Or faced with the ``ending welfare as we know it''
debate, where are our sympathies to go? To the welfare mother who
faces tough times trying to make do or to the welfare mother who
says she is grateful for liberation from dependence? Both have
appeared on television, permitting viewers to find whatever seems
congenial.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is meant as a defense of television journalism as a
model of objectivity, much less comprehensiveness. But it is not a
model of conspiracy either. Many of the points made by media
critics are fairly taken. Where the more zealous and rancorous of
them go astray, I think, is in their exasperation with mainstream
journalism's resistance to arguments that diverge much from the
political consensus. The inveterate ideologue is too quick to
explain contrary or merely conventional approaches to issues as
some sort of conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Television can be exasperating for many reasons, from timidity
to stupidity, but, when it comes to delivering news and opinion,
what saves the medium as a whole from the worst sorts of
journalistic sins is the unmanageable abundance, the unmeasurable
commotion, the undependable ideology and the truth of the
photograph.

   First virtual toys, now virtual toy stores.
</P>
<P>
   With toy makers and sellers catching up with the computer age
and making a big push into Internet retailing, shoppers can now buy
everything online _ from Tamagotchi virtual pets to Teletubbies
plush dolls. The hope is that these stores-without-walls will
attract parents with modems and motivation, people either too busy
or too impatient to deal with the big chain stores' huge,
warehouse-like retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
   So, well ahead of the 1998 critical year-end selling season, toy
companies are racing to become the Amazon.com of their industry.
Some of the online players include Noodle Kidoodle Inc., Toys ``R''
Us and the leading upstart company, Etoys, a unit of Idealab. Some
manufacturers, including Mattel Inc., which has a Barbie Web site,
www.barbie.com, are also experimenting with online marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Having had one of its best years in a decade last year, thanks
to a healthy economy, and hoping for a repeat performance this
year, the toy industry is in an expansive, experimental mood.
Though online retailing still accounts for only $13 million of the
$22 billion annual U.S. toy market, the virtual toy shop is the
industry's attempt to find new or additional sales among the
households that are most likely to value time-saving efficiency and
to have the discretionary income to pay a premium for such
convenience. Nearly 20 million Americans now shop online, according
to the Web measurement company Media Metrix Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry's move online is not without risk. The big
retailers face the same sort of internal conflicts that bookseller
Barnes &AMP; Noble does in trying to counter Amazon.com _ how to
respond to the online upstarts without cannibalizing the
brick-and-mortar franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Toy makers must venture carefully into cyberspace, lest their
direct-sales activities rankle the retailers they rely upon to move
their merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the online upstarts, despite the cost advantages
of not having to invest in stores, warehouses and big inventories,
may find themselves struggling to match the marketing muscle of big
established retail brand names.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of whether the touch and the texture
of toy shopping can translate as readily to the digital realm as
some other consumer activities that have taken hold online, like
booking airline seats or trading shares of stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big strengths of toy retailing is the in-store
excitement, merchandising and the personal touch,'' said Frank
Reysen Jr., editor of Playthings, a toy industry publication.
``There is a danger of that getting lost in the web of technology.
The initiatives, attitude and approach have to be a virtual
representation of the store itself, and that's not an easy thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The toy merchants are undaunted, though.
</P>
<P>
   The large retailers say they will win the Internet game because
their well-regarded names and vast resources give them an in with
consumers that should spill over into online selling. For
customers, the companies say, those strengths will translate into
low prices, quick response to orders and a better chance of finding
limited-edition items _ like Mattel's popular Share a Smile Becky
doll, a wheelchair-bound friend of Barbie _ that smaller toy
sellers may have trouble obtaining in large volume.
</P>
<P>
   But the small, niche operators say they have the upper hand
because they offer many of the must-have items and also specialty
products _ like Schylling's make-your-own chewing gum kit _ that
tend to sell in such small numbers that the big guys find them not
worth stocking.
</P>
<P>
   And whether large or small, the companies say they can offer
online consumers the advantage of not having to traipse around in
search of the last Beanie Baby in town.
</P>
<P>
   Longer term, toy merchants envision that this type of retailing
will become the modern equivalent of that more traditional form of
direct-to-consumer marketing _ catalog shopping. Like catalog
sales, which rely on mailing lists assembled from consumers' past
buy-by-mail habits, the databases created by electronic commerce
would enable toy makers to observe the shopping habits of
computerized households and use discounts and other enticements to
keep them coming back for more. It is a way for merchants to get to
know their customers' preferences to an extent not possible when a
person goes into a store and pays cash for a Sing and Snore Ernie.
</P>
<P>
   All of the industry's behind-the-scenes strategizing for her
money and loyalty is just fine by Chana Wilson, a housewife and
mother of two boys, ages 3 and 12, who was in the market recently
for an ant farm for her out-of-state nephew. ``I knew I had to buy
a toy, wrap it up and ship it to Houston,'' said Mrs. Wilson, who
lives in Beckley, W.Va., and ranks shopping at toy stores right up
there with visiting the dentist.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to avoid ``all that rigamarole,'' Mrs. Wilson, whose
husband, Derric, is a supervisor at a prison, went online and found
Etoys, where she bought an Uncle Milton ant farm for $19.95 plus $4
for shipping and $3 for gift wrapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``That saved me time and money and a major headache with my
3-year-old,'' Mrs. Wilson said. ``You just don't want to take a
3-year-old shopping for other kids' toys.''

LAMB SHANKS GIVE LEG UP TO TASTY MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dick Francisco, a Seattle resident who might be described as The
Eager Eater, tells about the day he visited one of those Italian
coastal communities where the whitewashed buildings seem ready to
slide off the side of the cliff.
</P>
<P>
   Attacked by a case of the hungries, Francisco stopped at a
restaurant and was served a superb platter of pasta. The sauce was
so good, he decided to get the magic formula from the chef.
</P>
<P>
   ``This dish is sensational!'' he told the cook. ``Is it your
original recipe?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it'sa not,'' the chef confessed. ``I got it from a cousin
of mine in America, whosa name is Victor Rosellini.''
</P>
<P>
   No Seattlite would have been surprised by the news.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sad day in the city when Rosellini decided to retire
from the restaurant business. A lot of people wondered why. I had a
hunch, but I didn't dare tell anybody.
</P>
<P>
   I'm pretty sure Vic quit because I ate up all of his lamb
shanks.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he had other items on his menu, as his Italian cousin would
attest. But nobody prepared braised lamb shanks like Rosellini.
And, late in his career, he must have decided he would never manage
to stay one lamb shank ahead of my appetite.
</P>
<P>
   Since Rosellini served so many terrific meals to others, it is
only fair that I should now be feeding him.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I'm not. Frances and Mary Beth Kelly are the ones
showing up at Marcia Rosellini's kitchen door bearing casseroles.
Longtime friends of the Rosellinis, the sisters were somewhat
concerned about Victor's health and decided what he needed in his
diet was a nice rice casserole.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me it is called Capt. Cook's Rice and it's from John
Owen's cookbook,'' Marcia Rosellini reported in a recent phone
conversation. ``It is very good rice. We sometimes mix in a few
other ingredients and always enjoy it. Frances and Mary Beth tell
us as soon as the casserole is empty to let them know, so they can
bring us more Capt. Cook's Rice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rosellinis did not report that their cousin in that Italian
cliff town wanted the recipe, too. But just in case he does, here
it is.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Cook's Rice
</P>
<P>
   1 cup brown or wild rice (or combination of the two)
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup chopped onions
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup diced celery
</P>
<P>
   1 10-ounce can beef bouillon
</P>
<P>
   One and two-thirds cups water
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup butter, cut in bits
</P>
<P>
   1 cup stuffed green olives, halved
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Plunk the rice, onions, celery, bouillon, water and salt into a
greased, shallow casserole. Dot top with butter and bake uncovered
in a 350-degree oven for 45 minutes, adding more water if needed.
Mix in olives, top with cheese and bake another 15 minutes. Serves
two to three.
</P>
<P>
   I agree, it's pretty good rice. But I'll let you in on a secret.
It's not as good as lamb shanks. This recipe may not produce a meal
on par with the feasts once served at Rosellini's Four-10, but it
is a pretty fair alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Ten-10 Lamb Shanks
</P>
<P>
   6 lamb shanks
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon, cut in half
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup flour
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon pepper
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 cup red table wine
</P>
<P>
   1 10-and-one-half-ounce can consomme
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sliced carrots
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sliced celery
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   Massage the shanks all over with the cut lemon, squeezing out
the juice. Let stand 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper bag combine the flour, salt and pepper. Shake the
shanks in the sack two at a time until they are coated. Heat the
oil in a large skillet and brown the shanks on all sides. Remove to
a large oven pot or casserole large enough to hold the shanks in
one layer.
</P>
<P>
   In the same skillet saute the onions 3 minutes. Add the garlic
and cook another 30 seconds. Dump into the skillet any flour
remaining in the sack and stir-cook until it begins to brown. Still
stirring, add the wine and consomme. When sauce is smooth and has
thickened, pour over the shanks. Add the carrots, celery and bay
leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Cover the pot or casserole and bake in a 375-degree oven for
about 2 hours, or until the shanks are fork tender. Remove bay leaf
and serve one shank to each guest.
</P>
<P>
   You can serve this with rice, but Victor used to dish up his
shanks with mashed potatoes, some mixed vegetables and sourdough
bread for sopping up the juices.
</P>
<P>
   Shanks for the memories, Vic.
</P>

 UNDATED: kids' toys.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is just this sort of shopper that the big conventional
retailers are going after. Toys ``R'' Us, the nation's largest toy
retailer, started a Web site last month that it intends to heavily
advertise on the Internet as well as on television and through home
delivery circulars later this year. So far, the site has about
2,000 items, compared with about 15,000 stocked in Toys ``R'' Us
stores. Tens of thousands of Internet users have already visited
the site, though the company declined to say how many had bought
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to www.toysrus.com are assured that shopping is ``fun
and fast.'' Say, for instance, someone is clueless as to what to
buy an 8-year-old girl. The shopper need only choose a category,
like dolls, click on the child's age and the target price. Seconds
later a suggested list of merchandise appears, including Baby Pick
Me Up, which sells for $14.97 plus shipping and handling.
</P>
<P>
   Just like a theater operator who tries to drum up concession
sales by piping in the smell of freshly popped corn, Toys ``R'' Us
is using its personalized suggestion feature also to get shoppers
to consider buying items they may not have intended to. Those
looking for dolls, for instance, are also shown a Barbie Disc Girl
CD Player for $16.99. Call it an electronic hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are typically the same for toys bought online or in
stores. But the convenience of Internet shopping does mean having
to pay shipping rates, which are about $5 for a $25 order and
around $9 for a $100 purchase. The companies insist, though, that
the cost is more than worth the convenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more strapped for time, and they are looking for
new ways of shopping,'' said Joel Anderson, vice president of Toys
``R'' Us Direct. ``There is a new medium out there that is
emerging, and it is an area we need to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Toy maker Hasbro Inc. is feeling the same need. The company,
which has been dabbling in online product marketing for more than a
year, recently hired a specialist in Internet commerce to develop a
plan to advertise further and sell selected items like collectibles
directly to the consumer (www.hasbro.com). The executive, Wendy
Riches, had managed the interactive advertising unit of WPP Group's
Ogilvy &AMP; Mather agency, as part of her role as chairman and chief
executive of the Ogilvy One North America division.
</P>
<P>
   One potential problem is that Hasbro sells mainly to retailers,
some of whom may frown on any form of added competition. This sort
of conflict has also been a problem for computer makers, like
Compaq, which has a well-established network of distributors who
have been wary of the company's plan to expand into online direct
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some toy retailers are raising concern about Hasbro's
intentions. ``This is the manufacturer cutting out the middle
man,'' said Shane Igoe, new media manager at F.A.O. Schwarz, which
was one of the first toy sellers to go online when it started a Web
site (www.faoschwarz.com) nearly two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us is less concerned, saying Hasbro's Internet appeal
will be limited because it will offer only its own brands and not
Barbie, Beanie Babies and other popular toys made by its
competitors. For its part, Hasbro says its online selling efforts
are not meant to put it in competition with Toys ``R'' Us or any
other retailer. Rather, the company says, it is seeking to augment
what retailers are already doing, even listing store locations
where shoppers can find certain items.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at this as a partnership with the retail trade,'' said
Adam Klein, Hasbro's head of global marketing. ``Each one of our
key retailers is going at this thing a different way. We have to
have our own in-house expertise to both work with them and, where
there are gaps, to be able to recognize them and go after these
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro also says that, at least initially, it will limit its toy
selling to items not available in retail stores. The company, which
has not determined when it will begin selling online beyond the
interactive products like the Yahtzee CD-ROM it already offers, was
fuzzy on whether consumers would have to pay retail prices for toys
bought directly from the manufacturer. Klein said only that ``the
idea is not to compete with the retail trade, and this is part of
everything we are going to be looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   With Hasbro and other industry giants edging in on its domain,
Etoys, a year-old company based in Santa Monica, Calif., that has
about 3,000 items listed for sale on its site, www.toys.com, may
need a Star Wars laser to fend them off. But the company says its
strength is in the range of playthings it provides.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do is have the popular products and also have a lot of
cool products like kits to make your own chewing gum, products you
never see in Toys `R' Us,'' said Toby Lenk, chief executive of
Etoys. ``A big retail buyer can't buy six of something. It's too
inefficient for them so they buy in bulk and can't test on a
smaller scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Etoys also knows it will have to rev up its marketing machine to
avoid getting overshadowed by the competition. Without discussing
precise amounts, the company said it planned to triple its
multimillion-dollar marketing budget for the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   If people like Mrs. Wilson, the mother in West Virginia, are any
indication, the online toy market is up for grabs to anyone who can
make toy shopping effortless without significantly adding cost. But
won't she miss an intrinsic part of the toy-buying experience by
buying a lovable baby doll without first giving it a squeeze or
without reading product information on a box of building blocks?
</P>
<P>
   ``Heavens, no,'' Mrs. Wilson said. ``I could care less. I
already know what a box of Legos looks like. I wish I'd found this
before last Christmas.''

   NEW YORK _ Shoppers for truffles, Champagne and other fine
things will soon be able to buy them through their television sets
or computer monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Ivana Trump and a company based in Miami, Tel-Com Wireless Cable
TV Corp., plan to start a combined video and Internet venture this
fall, the 5th Avenue Channel, billed as offering ``luxury
lifestyles and shopping opportunities'' to TV viewers and World
Wide Web surfers. Ms. Trump, who owns a 10 percent stake, is
chairwoman and spokeswoman for the channel; Tel-Com is the majority
shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   The service is being tested on cable television in Miami and
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., while its Web site is being developed at
www.5thavenuechannel.com. The television service is expected to be
available to as many as 5 million homes by the end of the year. The
channel's business plan, though, has more to do with the Internet,
said Melvin Rosen, president of Tel-Com. ``I want us to become the
Amazon.com of the luxury goods business.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nicole Vanderbilt, director of digital commerce for Jupiter
Communications, a research firm, said, ``It is questionable how
well high-priced goods will do'' in a setting where the consumer
will be unable to handle them.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th Avenue Channel hopes to address that drawback through
programs like ``Ivana's World of 5th Avenue,'' where Ms. Trump will
escort celebrities as they do some serious shopping around New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Home Shopping Network or QVC, where Ms. Trump was
once a saleswoman for her own clothing and jewelry line, the
programming won't be all shopping all the time. There will also be
travel, fashion and interview segments and news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Still, according to Sandy Simkin, a Tel-Com vice president, the
emphasis will be on consumerism. ``We're looking for that couple
from Kansas City who come to New York once a year and go into
Tiffany's to buy something special,'' he said.

   SECOND LIFE FOR OUT-OF-PRINT BOOKS
</P>
<P>
   Lightning Print, a division of Ingram Book Group, a wholesaler,
has started a campaign to give a second life to out-of-print books
written by National Book Award winners.
</P>
<P>
   After Youngsuk Chi, president of Lightning Print, learned that
52 of 295 books by National Book Award winners are unavailable, he
sent a letter to publishers holding the rights to those titles,
urging them to bring the books back through Lightning's
print-on-demand system. A copy of a 250-page paperback produced
through print-on-demand costs only about $3, making small print
runs possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``My letter said, `For the sake of the literary world, let's
make these wonderful books available again, and it's now
economically feasible''' Chi said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had reached agreements with Random House, Simon
&AMP; Schuster and HarperCollins, and that Penguin Putnam, Time Warner
and St. Martin's had responded as well, pledging their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The publishers must find a copy of the book that is sound enough
to be digitally scanned. But because some of these titles were
published in the 1950s and have been out of print for years, this
may be a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, however, Random House will publish about 100 copies
of ``The Far Field'' by Theodore Roethke, originally published in
1965 by Doubleday, now an imprint of Random House, and out of print
for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Chi plans to solicit publishers of titles that have won the

   NEW TECHNOLOGY RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT RIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   As the publishing world begins to explore the implications of
print-on-demand technology and digital books, writers and their
agents are finding that the term ``in print'' may need to be
redefined.
</P>
<P>
   Though technology has the potential to keep authors in print
forever, there is a hitch: those who want to regain the rights to
their out-of-print titles may be unable to do so. Under current
contracts, ``in print'' means physically stored in a warehouse, not
digitally stored on a disk. Usually, if a publisher lets a book go
out of print, its rights revert to the author after 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   But if the contract does not clearly spell out the author's
wishes, trouble can ensue. For example, Toni Morrison, the Nobel
Prize-winning novelist, switched houses after the publication of
her first novel, ``The Bluest Eye.'' Her original publisher, Henry
Holt, let the hardcover version lapse for about 20 years and
concentrated on the paperback instead. Though Ms. Morrison secured
the hardcover rights after applying for 10 years and resold them to
her current publisher, Knopf, ``it was still difficult, and it's
still a bad deal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the new technology, recovering rights is likely
to be more difficult, especially after the death of an author.
``What is possible for the heirs of the estate is extremely limited
if a book can be kept in print by being on a hard drive,'' Ms.
Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the issue is addressed, that is. ``The big fear is that
publishers will warehouse rights,'' said Paul Aiken, executive
director of the Authors Guild.
</P>
<P>
   One solution, Aiken said, would be to set a yearly sales figure
that publishers would have to meet for a book to be considered in
print.
</P>
<P>
   But some see the technology as a boon to the entire industry.
``You'll see bigger, richer, more diverse backlists available to
the consuming public,'' said Jonathan Newcomb, president and chief
executive of Simon &AMP; Schuster.
</P>

   CHIEF OF CONDE NAST SOLICITS IDEAS FOR WIRED
</P>
<P>
   Steven Florio, chief executive of Conde Nast, has had a
troublesome month. Tina Brown, the popular editor of The New
Yorker, resigned to start her own venture. And Fortune published a
company profile with the theme: ``In Florio's hands, truth is a
fungible commodity.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be notable, then, that Florio was able to focus last week
on a piece of the Conde Nast empire new and unplumbed enough to go
unmentioned in the Fortune article _ Wired magazine. Few
perceptible changes have been made in the neon bible of digital
culture since it was acquired by Conde Nast, a unit of Advance
Publications, in May.
</P>
<P>
   At a lunch at Harvard University, Florio sought advice from
Internet gurus about how Wired is perceived and whom the magazine's
audience ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   The small group included Jonathan Zittrain, director of the
Berkman Center for Internet and Society, Lawrence Lessig, the
Harvard law professor, and Walter Bender, director of the News in
the Future Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Steve Newhouse, who oversees Internet efforts for Advance
Publications, also attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was genuinely curious about what people thought about
Wired,'' said Zittrain, who contributes to the magazine
occasionally. ``He seemed to be looking at it as a unique
property.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio, who met with Wired's editor, Katrina Heron, in New York
later last week, declined to comment on his plans.
</P>
<P>
   The fear at Wired's headquarters in San Francisco when the sale
was announced was that Conde Nast would homogenize the magazine's
off-beat approach to attract the kind of mass audience behind the
success of its other publications like House &AMP; Garden and GQ.
</P>
<P>
   Florio's speech to employees after the sale, in which he urged
them to ``think of us as your rich uncles in New York,'' did little
to assuage such anxieties. But some Wired staffers were heartened
to hear that Florio was talking to members of the technology
community in addition to advertisers and Conde Nast insiders.

CRITICAL, BOX OFFICE SUCCESS FOR SPIELBERG'S `PRIVATE RYAN' 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ By Sunday morning, Steven Spielberg was one of the
few people left in the movie business who were unaware that
``Saving Private Ryan'' had earned the best reviews of the year and
was a box-office success.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Dreamworks, which made the World War II epic with
Paramount, said that the director of the movie was at his home in
East Hampton, N.Y., and had told his staff in recent days not to
read him any newspaper or magazine reviews or inform him of its
opening-weekend box-office take. This has been his personal policy
for years when he opens a film.
</P>
<P>
   So Spielberg, 52, whose movies, like ``E.T. the
Extra-Terrestrial,'' ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and ``Jurassic
Park,'' have been among the highest grossing of all time, was also
unaware that ``Saving Private Ryan'' had earned an estimated $30
million in its opening weekend and was No. 1 at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, ``Forrest Gump'' _ another drama with the star of
``Private Ryan,'' Tom Hanks _ opened in July 1994 with a weekend
box office that reached $24.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   It's highly unusual for a nearly three-hour drama to earn so
much on its opening weekend. Spielberg's 1994 Holocaust drama,
``Schindler's List,'' which went on to win seven Academy Awards,
including best picture and director, opened slowly around the
nation in contrast to the new film. ``Schindler's List'' was
eventually a commercial success, grossing $96 million domestically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan,'' written by Robert Rodat, stars Hanks as
an Army captain who leads his platoon across the Normandy
countryside following D-Day in search of Private Ryan (Matt Damon),
the only one of four enlisted brothers who may still be alive.
</P>
<P>
   Reviews have cited the film's two prolonged and bloody battle
scenes, which depict the mayhem of war in a way never quite seen in
films. Critics for major newspapers and magazines have almost
uniformly called it a milestone for Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Tharp, the distribution chief at Dreamworks, said that the
R-rated film played broadly across the nation, attracting equal
numbers of women and men, with its appeal drawing heavily on
moviegoers over 25.
</P>
<P>
   He said the movie's audience appeal seemed just as strong in
cities like San Antonio and Dayton, Ohio, as in New York and Los
Angeles. Tharp said the positive reviews, which helped lure
audiences, were consistent around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film seemed to have a very strong reaction on audiences,''
said Tharp. ``In some cases, people exiting the theaters were
crying. In other cases, they could not initially talk.'' He added,
``The success of the film is a result of a combination of reviews,
the director, the cast and the fact that audiences this summer are
starved for something substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Press, the Dreamworks marketing chief, said: ``People's
reaction to the movie has been so visceral, so overwhelming. The
strongest thing going for the movie is people's reaction to it.''
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged that it was a gamble to release the movie in
the summer, which is generally a time of action-adventure, family
and escapist entertainment. Serious films are often released in the
late fall and winter. ``Frankly, having the name Steven Spielberg
and a star on the level of Tom Hanks helps us release it now,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Friedman, vice chairman of the Paramount Motion Picture
Group, which is releasing the film abroad, said that the movie's
strong showing was even more ``phenomenal,'' given that theaters
were holding one or two fewer screenings a day because of the
length of the drama.
</P>
<P>
   But the box office for the movie was hurt a bit because of what
Dreamworks said was a distributor's problem delivering the film's
prints to hundreds of theaters in California and Arizona on Friday
morning, leaving many filmgoers unable to see the first scheduled
showings. By late Friday afternoon, the films had arrived.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Initially, ``Saving Private Ryan'' was developed at Paramount by
Rodat and executives there. Hanks read the script and was
immediately interested. At that point, Spielberg, who had a
longtime interest in World War II, and whose father was a combat
veteran, also read the script and said he wanted to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Spielberg's involvement, his company, Dreamworks,
shared the producing credit. In jointly producing the film,
Paramount and Dreamworks tossed a coin as to which company would
release the movie in the United States. Dreamworks took over the
film's domestic distribution, with Paramount releasing it abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The coin toss also involved another joint project, ``Deep
Impact,'' the doomsday film released earlier this year about a
deadly meteor hurtling toward the earth. Paramount took over the
domestic distribution of that film, which has grossed about $138
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' cost $65 million, a relatively low
figure for such an epic. One of the reasons for the budget lid was
that Spielberg and Hanks, who are usually enormously paid, took
only minimal fees up front.
</P>
<P>
   But The Los Angeles Times reported that each had a guarantee of
17.5 percent of the studios' first-dollar gross profit, meaning
that 35 cents of every dollar earned on the film would go to
Spielberg and Hanks.
</P>
<P>
   Such deals are hardly unusual. ``Lethal Weapon 4,'' which may
have cost as much as $140 million, has grossed about $95 million.
But the two stars, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, as well as the
director, Richard Donner, and producer, Joel Silver, have
first-dollar gross deals that reach at least 35 cents on every
dollar, said one executive close to the project. Because of the
high cost of ``Lethal Weapon 4,'' its actual profitability remains
uncertain.

MOROCCAN POET'S BOOK ON RACISM STRIKES A CHORD IN FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Tahar Ben Jelloun knew he was touching a delicate
subject when he recently wrote a book on racism. But the Moroccan
poet and novelist, who lives in Paris, never imagined how much his
life would be changed by his latest work, a slim volume called
``Racism, as Explained to My Daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   The prize-winning author set out to answer questions about
racism posed by his 10-year-old daughter, Merieme. In doing so, Ben
Jelloun purposefully described racism as a universal phenomenon and
not one limited to France. He certainly did not expect the book to
become a runaway best seller in France, selling more than 250,000
copies since its publication in January.
</P>
<P>
   He views the book's success as an encouraging sign. That France
has a racism problem is no secret here. In a recent government
survey, 58 percent of those questioned described themselves as
racist or somewhat racist. Some 56 percent said there were too many
Arabs in France, 27 percent said there were too many blacks and
almost half said they no longer felt at home in their own country.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the rush to buy Ben Jelloun's book also suggested that many
French people were not only aware of this problem, but were also
eager to find ways of addressing it. And the book itself has helped
feed public discussion of the topic.
</P>
<P>
   The response has baffled Ben Jelloun and pulled him into the
vortex of the debate on race relations. He is now called on to
offer advice, to appear on panels and above all to visit schools.
Being with schoolchildren, he said, has made him aware how much
they talk and worry about racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find there is an enormous debate among young people,'' Ben
Jelloun, 54, said in an interview in his attic studio overlooking
the roofs of the Left Bank. ``Students have lots of questions about
dealing with kids from different cultures. And the questions come
from both sides, from the French and the immigrants.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book he tells his daughter that being a racist depends
largely on one's upbringing, on what someone hears at home or at
school. ``You are not born a racist, you become one,'' he writes, a
phrase that is perhaps the book's main axiom.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Jelloun believes that the interest among children springs
from the growing racial mix in the schools. More than ever before,
schools that were used to mostly white, Christian students now have
children of legal and clandestine immigrants _ Arabic-speaking
Muslims from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, and French-speaking
blacks from France's former West African colonies.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers here say that it is easier for adults to hide behind
their masks or stay in their own worlds, but that children in class
face differences more directly and act out prejudices they learn at
home. It is above all the teachers and students in France, blacks
and whites alike, who have seized on Ben Jelloun's book.
</P>
<P>
   Outside France, sales are also soaring. The book has sold more
than 200,000 copies across Europe, appearing in a dozen languages.
(Published here by Seuil, the book is due out in North America next
year from The New Press with the probable title ``Daddy, What Is
Racism?'')
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But in France in particular, the book's success is being watched
as a kind of barometer of the turmoil over immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Racism and immigration are constantly close to the surface. They
have fueled the rise of Jean-Marie Le Pen and his anti-immigrant
National Front party, which routinely wins 15 percent of the
national vote.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, as the French soccer team won the World Cup,
the government used the victory as a way to celebrate a
multi-ethnic France, one whose team included French blacks from the
Antilles and others of Arab and African descent.
</P>
<P>
   The little book on racism has now shattered the peace of Ben
Jelloun's life, which normally plays out amid a jumble of books and
art in his studio high above the Boulevard St.-Germain. A
psychologist by training, the author has a fine sense for the
cruelties even the most civilized people can inflict on one
another.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``The Sacred Night,'' his novel that won the
prestigious Goncourt prize in 1987, and its forerunner, ``The Sand
Child,'' tell the story of a young Muslim girl whose father feels
humiliated because he has no son. When the girl is born, he
announces that the child is a boy and to save his honor he raises
her to become a man.
</P>
<P>
   His book on racism is written as a long and deceptively simple
dialogue between the author and his daughter. Ben Jelloun said he
got the idea one Saturday afternoon last year when he took Merieme,
who was 10 at the time, to a street protest against anti-immigrant
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Metro, Merieme began to ask: `What is a law? What is an
immigrant? What is discrimination?''' Ben Jelloun said. ``At first
I gave her some sketchy answers. Then I thought I would write it
all down, so she could absorb it better.''
</P>
<P>
   That led to more questions and answers. Then Merieme's friends
became involved. The writer said that many questions in the book
came from the children; others are his. But his daughter and her
friends were always the arbiters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept giving them the texts and asking them to underline all
the difficult words in my answers,'' he said. ``That's how we got
to a point where the writing became entirely clear and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   He begins by explaining notions like ``stranger,'' ``culture,''
``prejudice.'' About prejudice, he says: ``It's a way of judging
others before knowing anything about them. Often we make mistakes.
Prejudice can make us afraid.'' He includes physical facts, like
the meaning of race, skin pigment, and genetic traits, and words
like ``cloning'' and ``hereditary.''
</P>
<P>
   Merieme poses disarming and moving questions. At one point she
asks if it is possible for her to give blood to Abdou, a black boy
in her class. Would that work? Her father explains that, yes, the
human race is one and the variable is in the blood group. He
reminds Merieme that her mother, who is Moroccan, donated blood to
a Vietnamese friend.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Jelloun at times looks through the prism of a North African
who knows about discrimination in France, yet he often explains
that racism has many faces. And there is also racism as a pretext,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A cousin, for example, had bad marks and said it was because her
teachers ``don't like Arabs.'' But Merieme argues that the cousin
simply does not do her work.
</P>
<P>
   The book has been widely praised, but some critics have mocked
Ben Jelloun as naive. The monthly Civilization called him a
``merchant of sweetness,'' and one television station said his book
was ``like a Band-Aid on a wooden leg.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ben Jelloun insists on the redeeming value of education. So
he continues to visit schools. Children often ask things he had not
thought of, and in his next edition he will include means to
respond to racism, giving his young readers a sense of what laws
exist to fight racial hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he concedes, he has no ready answer. At one high
school near Paris, a white French girl recently asked him: ``Have
you ever converted a racist?''
</P>
<P>
   And after his talk, the only black student in the class came to
ask for his autograph. Then he said shyly, ``Sir, can you tell me
what is the purpose of racism?'' &QL;

   Early Sunday, torrential rains flooded sections of I-70 in
northern Kansas as a cluster of recurrent thunderstorms deluged the
region. Monday, a steady flow of humid air from the Gulf of Mexico
will fuel another complex of thunderstorms over the lower
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys, possibly causing flooding in a
few locations.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, a stationary front stretching from Tennessee to the
Atlantic coast will aid in producing showers and thunderstorms with
heavy rain from northern Alabama to South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ample sunshine will cover the Florida peninsula. As
moist air in contact with the hot ground rises, puffy cumulus
clouds will develop by late morning. A few of these clouds will
yield afternoon thunderstorms. Farther west, searing heat will
continue over much of Texas with Dallas expected to reach 100
degrees for the 22nd consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly sunny skies will cover the Northeast coast Monday as a
small area of high pressure slides east of Cape Cod. Sunshine will
yield to scattered afternoon clouds over interior sections as a
weak cool front approaches from Ontario. As the front draws closer,
isolated thunderstorms will erupt Monday afternoon near the Great
Lakes and over upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms will also ignite in sections of the southern
Rockies on Monday afternoon. A few of these storms will lead to
local flooding, especially in New Mexico, where moist air ascending
the sloping terrain enhances the precipitation. Dry and warm
conditions will embrace the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: QUIET TIMES
</P>
<P>
   It's been a quiet time over the tropical waters of the Atlantic
this year. There has not been a single named tropical storm since
the official start of the hurricane season on June 1st. On average,
the Atlantic basin is christened with a tropical storm about 75
percent of the time before August 1st. The heart of the hurricane
season runs from the middle of August to the middle of October when
tropical waters reach a peak in temperature. The last year to have
zero named tropical storms or hurricanes in June and July was 1988,
the year that Gilbert became the most powerful Atlantic hurricane
of record. &QL;

FORGET BANG: FALL TV LINEUP BARELY MUSTERS A WHIMPER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ At a time when the television networks are
ever more battered by viewer defections, with ratings this summer
hitting unexpected new lows, the need for exciting new shows to
bring the audience back has never been greater. But few broadcast
executives expect the new fall season to produce the comeback the
networks need.
</P>
<P>
   That was evident despite the annual two-week summer binge of
interviews and news conferences here promoting the networks' new
prime-time lineups. Indeed, one network executive in charge of
entertainment programming offered a candid assessment of this
fall's crop of weekly comedy and drama series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of the new shows this year is absolutely
horrible,'' the executive said, speaking on the condition of
anonymity in part because he pointedly included programs that he
had decided to put on the air. ``There is exactly one outstanding
pilot that got made, and that was on the WB'' network.
</P>
<P>
   That program is ``Felicity,'' a drama about the adventures of a
woman after college graduation that has won widespread praise.
</P>
<P>
   There was scattered support among television executives for
other new shows, but most came with reservations and the rest with
serious doubts.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the networks to generate much excitement for the
fall lineup, even among some of their executives, is increasingly
being attributed to a program-development system that many consider
antiquated and counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carter, the creator and executive producer of one of
television's biggest hits, ``The X-Files'' on Fox, said in an
interview that nothing less than a reinvention of the business was
needed, focusing specifically on the pilot system, that intense
three-month period in the spring when hundreds of program pilots _
essentially tryout shows _ are ordered, written, cast and filmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody seems to do business at the same time,'' Carter
said. ``You're competing against yourselves at those times of year
when we're all making pilots and we're all casting, and it becomes
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Fox is pushing for a system that would encourage
developing new programs year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, all the producing, writing and acting talent in
Hollywood is called to arms at once in a headlong dash toward the
May schedule announcements made to the advertising industry in New
York. The advertisers then check out these hastily _ and often
sloppily _ assembled shows and decide how much money to commit for
almost the entire nine-month season to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very dysfunctional system'' said Peter Roth, the
president of entertainment for Fox. ``We're all fighting for the
same talent pool. And the result, at a time when we can least
afford for it to happen, is lesser-quality fare.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Shukovsky, the former producer of ``Murphy Brown,'' noted
that casting directors were forced to fill pilots with actors they
are not totally satisfied with every spring because every network
is casting dozens of shows at the same time. ``We see the cost of
talent escalate from one week to the next because they've been on
five different auditions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the majority of the pilots are rejected and scores of
actors suddenly are out of work, Shukovsky said. The same goes for
writers.
</P>
<P>
   Roth _ who noted that this system generated just four hits out
of 61 new series introduced last fall _ is pushing Fox, and he
hopes the rest of the business, to reshape the program-development
system. He announced a plan for Fox to move toward what he called a
52-week development program, with three separate pilot seasons _
one that begins in June and goes to October; another between
November and February, and the third, traditional period from
February through April.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he was committed to making more pilots each year
and that he would keep shows in development year-round so that a
new crop of shows could go on the air in January, another between
April and August and a third in the traditional fall season
starting in September.
</P>
<P>
   One key to Roth's plan is to move much more original programming
into the summer months, which have increasingly become a pit of
disappearing ratings for the networks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several of Roth's competitors reacted to the announcement of
year-round program development first by agreeing that the spring
pilot crunch was a disaster and then by questioning the originality
of Roth's idea. Full-year development has been suggested before,
notably by Kim LeMasters when he headed CBS Entertainment more than
a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything revolutionary about what
they're trying to do,'' said Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS
Television.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed that the program makers ``want the system to change.''
But he added, ``About 80 percent of the money in television is
committed by advertisers during the upfront.''
</P>
<P>
   The so-called upfront buying season takes place in June when
advertisers buy the bulk of the commercials on network television
for the year. Despite the continuously declining shares of the
television audience, the broadcast networks have managed to keep
winning increases in advertisers' spending in recent upfront
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In June, however, the money committed to the four big networks
leveled off at about $6.1 billion, the same taken in a year earlier
_ a sign, many industry executives have said, that the networks may
begin to pay a much heavier price for going hitless.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Moonves said, ``Until they change the system, with the
schedule announcements coming on a certain date in May, I don't
know how you set up a system that's totally different.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth suggested that with the ground moving so rapidly under the
television business, even the upfront buying process might be
altered in the next few years. But before anything like that
happens, he said, he wants to ``change the mindset of the
producers'' by spreading development throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves said that this proposal was also not new and that all
networks had tried to put shows into production after the initial
pilot season.
</P>
<P>
   But Roth said there was one principal change he was bringing to
the development equation: ``I'm telling the studios: `We're not
looking for shows; we're buying.'''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of taking in money for shows throughout the course
of the year is already drawing response, Roth said. ``I've spoken
to every studio head,'' he said. ``They all say it will be
difficult to change the system, but nobody is saying, `Don't do
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   As one enticement, Roth said he was emphasizing to the studio
executives that writers and producers on their staffs, many of whom
are paid millions of dollars a year to create new series, might get
to develop more than just one project a year by putting more pilots
into development in the summer and in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling them, `You get more return for your investment
this way,''' Roth said. ``That they like.''

 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The 31-year friendship between the writers V.S. Naipaul
and Paul Theroux began in an academic outpost in Uganda in 1966,
when Theroux was 25 and Naipaul was 34. It ended in the spring of
last year, when a spurned Theroux confronted Naipaul on a street in
Kensington and asked why his last note had gone unanswered, and
Naipaul coldly told him to ``take it on the chin and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Theroux, the celebrated author of almost three dozen novels and
travel books, including ``Mosquito Coast'' and ``The Great Railway
Bazaar,'' did more than take it on the chin. He wrote a book, ``Sir
Vidia's Shadow: A Friendship Across Five Continents,'' to be
published in a few months, which describes, in Theroux's
novelistically reportorial style, his intense and complex
relationship with the man he says taught him how to be a writer.
The portrait is not always a pleasant one, painting Naipaul as a
deeply flawed man _ neurotic, cheap, misogynistic, horribly rude
and often outrageously offensive _ if a brilliant writer and
enthralling companion.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Theroux said in an interview, he wanted to record the
whole of his relationship with Naipaul, a larger-than-life literary
figure who for many is one of the world's greatest living writers
of English, with the unflinching honesty that Naipaul had always
demanded of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always the one who said you have to tell the truth,''
Theroux said from Cape Cod, where he spends half his time each
year. (He spends the other half in Hawaii.) ``My feeling _ and
Naipaul might say the same thing _ is that it's not your nobility
that makes you a writer, not your magnanimity, not your
compassionate moments. It's the totality of all your moments.
People are complex. People are flawed; they're difficult; they're
needy. At times they say unfortunate things but regret them later.
If you write an unsparing portrait of a writer, you understand why
that person writes the way they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Theroux has always plundered his life for his work, freely
mixing elements of autobiography, fiction and reportage. In the
process, he has upset his ex-wife, Anne; his brother, Alexander;
and friends of writer Bruce Chatwin, who have all accused him at
various points of abusing the trust of those close to him for the
sake of his writing. And friends of Naipaul, who is known as Vidia,
say that Theroux has done it again, betraying his onetime mentor
because of his own hurt and for the sake of a good story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul Theroux is a very successful writer, yet he seems to be
so full of anger,'' said one friend, who has read parts of ``Sir
Vidia's Shadow'' and who, like other intimates of Naipaul, would
speak only on condition of anonymity, saying that Naipaul had not
authorized anyone to discuss the book. ``Wouldn't he do better to
write his own imaginative book instead of obsessing about Vidia,
being a sort of anti-Boswell?''
</P>
<P>
   Another friend, who has read an advance copy of the book, said
it was malicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he felt hurt and decided to spill it all out, and I
think he thinks writing is about that,'' the friend said of
Theroux. ``To some degree it is. But some ordinary restraint is
required. And a more adult approach would have been to put this
drama away somewhere and maybe write in a more controlled way at
some point later.''
</P>
<P>
   Naipaul's literary agent in London, Gillon Aitken, said his
client would not comment on ``Sir Vidia's Shadow,'' which is to be
published in the United States in November by Houghton Mifflin and
in Britain in January. Indeed, friends of Naipaul said he hadn't
and most likely wouldn't read it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't think he would spend any time thinking about it,
even in his private reflection,'' one friend said. That might be
the cruelest blow of all for Theroux. ``This is a book I would love
him to read,'' he said, ``because it's generous and funny and a
record of 31 years that I've remembered and he may have
forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   News that Theroux was planning a book about Naipaul, the author
of numerous books exploring to remarkable effect themes like
colonialism, exile and religion, transfixed literary London in May,
when The Sunday Times of London published an account of the book's
final chapters. Friends of Naipaul said they were particularly
unhappy to read of Theroux's depiction of the friendship's painful
breakdown, a spiral of events that begins in ``Sir Vidia's Shadow''
when the author sees first-edition copies of three of his books _
two of them inscribed as gifts to Naipaul and his first wife, Pat _
listed in a rare-book catalogue, and realizes that Naipaul, newly
married to his second wife, Nadira, is trying to sell them.
</P>
<P>
   After he asks Naipaul for an explanation, Theroux writes, he is
startled to receive a note over the fax machine from Nadira.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its obsessional style and bad grammar and clumsy handwriting
were proof that Vidia had not seen it before she sent it,'' Theroux
writes. ``I had seen him scream at such an ill-conceived thing,
like a man howling at a filthy rag.''
</P>
<P>
   He then sends a copy of the ``weird, shame-making letter'' to
Naipaul with a note but receives no reply. Theroux grows
increasingly hurt and angry. Everything deteriorates to the point
where Naipaul, ``fearful'' and ``in a hurry,'' disappears down
Gloucester Road until he becomes, in effect, a shadow. ``The word
`scuttled' came to mind as he moved,'' Theroux writes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear why the friendship actually ended. In the book,
Theroux seems to lay the blame on Nadira. But one person who is
close to Naipaul said that though the elder writer had cared enough
about Theroux to ask him to write the obituary of Naipaul's first
wife, he had long been irked by Theroux's obsessive attitude toward
him, and by the way Theroux wrote about him in such works as
``Sunrise With Sea Monsters,'' a collection of essays.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was actually quite fed up over some years,'' the friend
said, ``with the sense that Theroux did treat him and what he said
in a fairly cheap sort of way, and used the friendship for
laughs.'' Nor, the friend said, was Naipaul the type of person
likely to let his wife dictate his choice of friends.
</P>
<P>
   People who have seen Theroux and Naipaul together say that in
recent years at least, Theroux appeared to treat Naipaul better
than Naipaul treated him. In 1996 the two appeared at the
Hay-on-Wye literary festival in Wales when Theroux _ who was
supposed to appear in conversation with Bill Buford, The New
Yorker's literary editor _ asked festival organizers, at Buford's
request, if Naipaul could join them.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people who had bought tickets to hear Theroux were
appalled to see Naipaul deliver what was in effect a rant at the
other writer's expense, said Peter Florence, the festival director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had over 100 people demanding their money back,'' Florence
said, ``because they had to sit through the man they had come to
see being insulted, demeaned and dismissed by someone who gave no
intimation of being worthy to sit on the same stage. People who saw
Naipaul leave the stage said they heard him make disparaging
remarks not only about Theroux and Buford, but also about a
distinguished writer who had approached Naipaul to praise his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He treated Theroux as if he was an idiot, with contempt and
disdain,'' Florence said. Buford did not return telephone calls
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Did Theroux write the book because he was upset, because he was
on the wrong end of a relationship so intense it seemed almost like
a failed love affair? He says he did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a betrayal,'' he said. ``This is not Tina Turner
writing about Ike.'' He was not, he said, bitter, hurt or angry,
but liberated: free to write about Naipaul, something he says he
always wanted to do. (In 1972 he did write a laudatory critical
work about Naipaul, and may have felt rejected even then, friends
of Naipaul surmised, because Naipaul seemed so indifferent to it.)
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time I met him, I was mentally writing a book in my
head about him,'' Theroux said. ``There was an element of being an
eyewitness to a great character.'' That is why, he said, he was
able to remember so faithfully the conversations he had with
Naipaul over the years.
</P>
<P>
   And it was his writerly eye, Theroux explained, that brought him
back for more when, as he describes in the book, Naipaul repeatedly
insisted on going to expensive restaurants and snobbishly ordering
fancy bottles of wine, and then inevitably stuck the younger and
poorer Theroux with the check.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time he was sticking me with a bill in a restaurant, I
would think of a story by Somerset Maugham in which this young man
uses his last penny to buy lunch for a beautiful society woman,''
he said. ``The next time he sees her, years later, she's huge, 350
pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is, of course, as much about Theroux as it is about
Naipaul. As the friendship unravels and Naipaul's rejection becomes
unambiguous, he begins to revise his earlier opinions of his
mentor, writing, ``He was mistaken about so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, he concludes, Naipaul is hypocritical,
denouncing Britain's honors system while accepting a knighthood; he
is childish and needy, while disliking children; he is rude to
``underlings'' like secretaries; he is a sometime racist and
misogynist who treated not only his wife, Pat, with disdain and
cruelty, but then abandoned his longtime lover, Margaret, for
Nadira.
</P>
<P>
   ``To maintain my self-respect and to defend Vidia, I often
called him generous when he was mean, and said he was eccentric
when he was cruel,'' he writes. He begins to re-think even
Naipaul's talent, dismissing some of his work as ``unreadable and
silly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He lost his humor,'' Theroux writes. ``But like the soothsayer
who sees only evil because he is a miserable grouch, Vidia was not
to be taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The friend who has seen parts of the book said passages like
those came as a particular shock. ``What a nasty piece of work,''
the friend said.
</P>
<P>
   But Theroux insisted in the interview that it was a misreading
of the book to focus on its ending. ``This book is about the
progress of a friendship and about the passage of time, not about
the end of a friendship,'' he said. ``This book is Naipaul riding
down a road going to Rwanda. It's Naipaul in Beirut writing a
letter to me. It's Naipaul in New York going through the snow.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last paragraph, he tries to explain how he felt when he
saw Naipaul disappear down the street. ``I was liberated at last,''
he writes. ``I saw how the end of a friendship was the start of an
understanding. He had made me his by choosing me; his rejection of
me meant I was on my own, out of his shadow. He had freed me, he
had opened my eyes, he had given me a subject.''

RUINS OF BYZANTINE PALACE MAY HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Nearly a thousand years after it was lost to
history, Turkish archaeologists have apparently found ruins of the
Great Palace from which Byzantine emperors ruled much of the known
world.
</P>
<P>
   The archaeologists were cleaning an underground Ottoman chamber
one day in April when they noticed a narrow corridor filled with
dirt and debris. Crawling through it with mounting excitement they
quickly realized that they were looking not at Ottoman ruins but at
something much older.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is wonderful, one of the most important finds in many
years,'' Erendiz Ozbayoglu, a professor of classical languages at
Istanbul University, said last week. ``We knew the palace existed,
and we have hundreds of books and manuscripts describing it. Now,
after all this time, we are actually going to be able to see it.
It's very, very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists involved in the excavation are not certain which
part of the sprawling palace complex they have uncovered, but
believe that one room they found may have served as a library or
archive. Its arching wall is decorated with floral and geometric
patterns. A thousand years have not dimmed the vivid green, yellow
and red pigment.
</P>
<P>
   The palace may become a major tourist attraction when it is
fully excavated, but that is likely to take several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have found is most probably the Great Palace,'' said
Alpay Pasinli, director of the Istanbul Archaeological Museum, who
is overseeing the excavation. ``We would like to have taken more
time before reporting this, but it was impossible to keep the
secret.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we reached the room with the fresco, we stared at it for
a long time,'' he said. ``To see something that no one has laid
eyes on for so many centuries is quite an emotional experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Constantine the Great built the core of the Great Palace after
he made this city the capital of the Roman Empire in 330 A.D., and
work continued intermittently for eight centuries. The palace was
home to more than 50 Byzantine emperors and the stage for countless
intrigues, some of which decided the fate of nations. It was filled
with wondrous furnishings, among them a tree of gilded bronze and
matching gilded lions equipped with machines that enabled them to
roar and beat the ground with their tails.
</P>
<P>
   ``The throne itself was so contrived that at one moment it stood
low on the ground and the next moment it would suddenly be raised
high in the air,'' an Italian ambassador reported in 949.
</P>
<P>
   Constantinople was devastated by fires in the 12th century and
then plundered by Crusaders in 1204. Later, after it was captured
by the Ottoman Turks, a new palace called Topkapi was built for the
emperor, his harem, family members and advisers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The newly discovered ruins are just outside the Topkapi walls
and across the street from the majestic Hagia Sophia, which for
centuries was the largest and most important church in Christendom,
but after 1453 a mosque and now a museum.
</P>
<P>
   Security guards protect the site from visitors who have read
breathless accounts of the discovery on the front pages of Turkish
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen stone steps lead down to the excavation. The corridor
leading to the newly discovered rooms is about 4 feet wide and 100
feet long. Halfway down its length, delicate red bricks typical of
the Ottoman period give way to the large marble blocks and swirling
masonry patterns associated with Byzantine architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as curious as anyone to know what we've found, not to
mention what else is down here,'' said Halil Ozek, an archaeologist
involved in the dig, as he toured the site on Friday. ``My first
guess is that this part of the palace dates from the ninth century.
Our great hope is that we'll find artifacts or inscriptions that
will help us date it and identify it more precisely.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he expected to find in what was once a complex
covering several square miles and embracing many buildings, Ozek
replied: ``We didn't expect to find this fresco. In fact, we didn't
expect to find the palace at all. So how can I say what we expect
next?'' &QL;

MOROCCAN POET'S BOOK ON RACISM STRIKES CHORD IN FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Tahar Ben Jelloun knew he was touching a delicate
subject when he recently wrote a book on racism. But the Moroccan
poet and novelist, who lives in Paris, never imagined how much his
life would be changed by his latest work, a slim volume called
``Racism, as Explained to My Daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   The prize-winning author set out to answer questions about
racism posed by his 10-year-old daughter, Merieme. In doing so, Ben
Jelloun purposefully described racism as a universal phenomenon and
not one limited to France. He certainly did not expect the book to
become a runaway best seller in France, selling more than 250,000
copies since its publication in January.
</P>
<P>
   He views the book's success as an encouraging sign. That France
has a racism problem is no secret here. In a recent government
survey, 58 percent of those questioned described themselves as
racist or somewhat racist. Some 56 percent said there were too many
Arabs in France, 27 percent said there were too many blacks and
almost half said they no longer felt at home in their own country.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the rush to buy Ben Jelloun's book also suggested that many
French people were not only aware of this problem, but were also
eager to find ways of addressing it. And the book itself has helped
feed public discussion of the topic.
</P>
<P>
   The response has baffled Ben Jelloun and pulled him into the
vortex of the debate on race relations. He is now called on to
offer advice, to appear on panels and above all to visit schools.
Being with schoolchildren, he said, has made him aware how much
they talk and worry about racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find there is an enormous debate among young people,'' Ben
Jelloun, 54, said in an interview in his attic studio overlooking
the roofs of the Left Bank. ``Students have lots of questions about
dealing with kids from different cultures. And the questions come
from both sides, from the French and the immigrants.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book he tells his daughter that being a racist depends
largely on one's upbringing, on what someone hears at home or at
school. ``You are not born a racist, you become one,'' he writes, a
phrase that is perhaps the book's main axiom.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Jelloun believes that the interest among children springs
from the growing racial mix in the schools. More than ever before,
schools that were used to mostly white, Christian students now have
children of legal and clandestine immigrants _ Arabic-speaking
Muslims from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, and French-speaking
blacks from France's former West African colonies.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers here say that it is easier for adults to hide behind
their masks or stay in their own worlds, but that children in class
face differences more directly and act out prejudices they learn at
home. It is above all the teachers and students in France, blacks
and whites alike, who have seized on Ben Jelloun's book.
</P>
<P>
   Outside France, sales are also soaring. The book has sold more
than 200,000 copies across Europe, appearing in a dozen languages.
(Published here by Seuil, the book is due out in North America next
year from The New Press with the probable title ``Daddy, What Is
Racism?'')
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But in France in particular, the book's success is being watched
as a kind of barometer of the turmoil over immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Racism and immigration are constantly close to the surface. They
have fueled the rise of Jean-Marie Le Pen and his anti-immigrant
National Front party, which routinely wins 15 percent of the
national vote.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, as the French soccer team won the World Cup,
the government used the victory as a way to celebrate a
multi-ethnic France, one whose team included French blacks from the
Antilles and others of Arab and African descent.
</P>
<P>
   The little book on racism has now shattered the peace of Ben
Jelloun's life, which normally plays out amid a jumble of books and
art in his studio high above the Boulevard St.-Germain. A
psychologist by training, the author has a fine sense for the
cruelties even the most civilized people can inflict on one
another.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``The Sacred Night,'' his novel that won the
prestigious Goncourt prize in 1987, and its forerunner, ``The Sand
Child,'' tell the story of a young Muslim girl whose father feels
humiliated because he has no son. When the girl is born, he
announces that the child is a boy and to save his honor he raises
her to become a man.
</P>
<P>
   His book on racism is written as a long and deceptively simple
dialogue between the author and his daughter. Ben Jelloun said he
got the idea one Saturday afternoon last year when he took Merieme,
who was 10 at the time, to a street protest against anti-immigrant
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Metro, Merieme began to ask: `What is a law? What is an
immigrant? What is discrimination?''' Ben Jelloun said. ``At first
I gave her some sketchy answers. Then I thought I would write it
all down, so she could absorb it better.''
</P>
<P>
   That led to more questions and answers. Then Merieme's friends
became involved. The writer said that many questions in the book
came from the children; others are his. But his daughter and her
friends were always the arbiters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept giving them the texts and asking them to underline all
the difficult words in my answers,'' he said. ``That's how we got
to a point where the writing became entirely clear and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   He begins by explaining notions like ``stranger,'' ``culture,''
``prejudice.'' About prejudice, he says: ``It's a way of judging
others before knowing anything about them. Often we make mistakes.
Prejudice can make us afraid.'' He includes physical facts, like
the meaning of race, skin pigment, and genetic traits, and words
like ``cloning'' and ``hereditary.''
</P>
<P>
   Merieme poses disarming and moving questions. At one point she
asks if it is possible for her to give blood to Abdou, a black boy
in her class. Would that work? Her father explains that, yes, the
human race is one and the variable is in the blood group. He
reminds Merieme that her mother, who is Moroccan, donated blood to
a Vietnamese friend.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Jelloun at times looks through the prism of a North African
who knows about discrimination in France, yet he often explains
that racism has many faces. And there is also racism as a pretext,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A cousin, for example, had bad marks and said it was because her
teachers ``don't like Arabs.'' But Merieme argues that the cousin
simply does not do her work.
</P>
<P>
   The book has been widely praised, but some critics have mocked
Ben Jelloun as naive. The monthly Civilization called him a
``merchant of sweetness,'' and one television station said his book
was ``like a Band-Aid on a wooden leg.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ben Jelloun insists on the redeeming value of education. So
he continues to visit schools. Children often ask things he had not
thought of, and in his next edition he will include means to
respond to racism, giving his young readers a sense of what laws
exist to fight racial hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he concedes, he has no ready answer. At one high
school near Paris, a white French girl recently asked him: ``Have
you ever converted a racist?''
</P>
<P>
   And after his talk, the only black student in the class came to
ask for his autograph. Then he said shyly, ``Sir, can you tell me
what is the purpose of racism?'' &QL;

SENATE'S INTERNET LEGISLATION UNDER FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Ind., N.C., Pa.)  (js) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By the beginning of July, a number of Internet
bills had been languishing in Congress for months, their sponsors
unable to muster the necessary support for floor debates on what
could become precedent-setting laws covering free speech and
content in the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   Then one-by-one, in a three-day period last week, the proposals
were quietly attached to Senate appropriations bills, in most cases
without debate. Although the bills must still pass the House and
make it through a conference committee to become law, civil
liberties groups are crying foul, questioning whether senators
understand or gave responsible consideration to complicated issues
that could have long-term impacts on the global network.
</P>
<P>
   It started on Tuesday when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is
chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee,
offered as an amendment to the $33 billion spending plan for the
Commerce, State and Justice departments a bill requiring filtering
software on computers in schools and libraries that get federal
funds for Internet hookups.
</P>
<P>
   Attached to that was a measure that has been dubbed the
Communications Decency Act II, a bill by Sen. Daniel Coats, R-Ind.,
that would make it a crime for commercial Web sites to distribute
or display to minors any material that could be ``harmful'' to
children. The original Communications Decency Act, which outlawed
the general distribution of material harmful to minors, was struck
down last year as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Wednesday came an amendment by Sen. Lauch Faircloth,
R-N.C., to give the FBI access to the customer records of Internet
service providers in investigations of pedophilia without an order
from a court or grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Thursday, Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., added a bill that
would ban gambling on the Internet, in part, Kyl argued, because
Internet gambling is ``accessible by minors.''
</P>
<P>
   While all the bills are presented as measures for protecting
children, opponents argue that they raise complicated free speech,
privacy, censorship and regulatory questions that could have
long-term impacts on civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is racing ahead of policy makers, and the
policy makers are stumbling to catch up,'' said Ron Weich,
legislative consultant to the American Civil Liberties Union. ``The
Congress has not begun to consider the important constitutional and
practical considerations of these bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyl's gambling bill was the only Internet bill debated on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Although Weich criticized the process as sloppy legislating,
Mark Buse, policy director for the Commerce Committee, defended the
procedure. McCain, he said, had been working for weeks to get his
bill scheduled for floor debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were certain Democrats fronting for the ACLU who would
not allow us to bring the bill up for debate,'' Buse said. ``We had
no choice but to offer it as an amendment.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lisa Dean, director of the Center for Technology Policy at the
Free Congress Foundation, said Republican lawmakers were ``dealing
with a medium here that defies control, and they are trying to
control it.'' She said of the gambling bill, for example: ``It sets
a precedent to restrict other habits later on. Whether or not you
are in favor of gambling is immaterial.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties advocates have vowed a court fight, if
necessary, over the constitutionality of both the Coats and the
McCain bills. The Coats bill, they say, would unconstitutionally
restrict free speech on the Internet. They oppose filtering
mandates because the software often blocks Web pages that provide
information on subjects like AIDS, breast cancer, even debates on
free-speech issues.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Farber, a professor of computer science at the University
of Pennsylvania and a board member of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, said that Congress was in a panic, passing bills on
issues they did not understand or that they know will eventually be
struck down as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an election year coming up, and let's be kind and say
they like to put on a good face to their community, even if they do
things that damage their community in the long run, which these
do,'' he said. ``But there are nicer ways to protect our childrenthan doing things that take away their rights when they grow up.''

 &HT;    Californian wins triathlon at Lake Lanier
 &HT;    By Tracey Thomson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFORD, Ga. _ Ten years ago, triathlete Mike Pigg was on top of
the world. Winning six out of ten races during the 1988 U.S.
Triathlon Series (USTS), the then 24-year-old Pigg became known as
the ``King'' of the USTS. After a short leave of absence, Pigg made
a slow return at the beginning of this season. Placing ninth in the
St. Croix triathlon, it appeared Pigg's best days were behind him.
</P>
<P>
   However, on Sunday, the Californian with his first place finish
at Georgia's Lake Lanier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a primo day, I finally felt good,'' said Pigg about his
first win of the season.
</P>
<P>
   With a slow start in the 1.5K swim leg, Pigg made the transition
to the bike in fourth place, behind Victor Perini of Tenn. and
fellow Californians Greg Thompson and Eric Burgan. Despite a near
crash in the middle of the race, Pigg forged a substantial lead on
the most challenging 40K bike course of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to crash .. .I knew I was going to lose some skin, but
somehow I recovered. I got pretty lucky today,'' said Pigg.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning the 10K run, Perini closed the gap behind Pigg to a
mere 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping Pigg in sight really kept me going out there, but
after two miles he slowly pulled away,'' said Perini.
</P>
<P>
   That last effort secured the win with a time of 1:56:18. Perini
finished second in 1:57:04, followed by Burgan.
</P>
<P>
   Beginner Denise McLaughlin of Atlanta upset the women's
competition. McLaughlin, who turned pro last year after competing
in one triathlon, won the race by over two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was my kind of course, my strength is the bike and that's
what challenged most people,'' said McLaughlin.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing the swim in fifth, McLaughlin worked her way to
the front eventually leading the pack on the bike. Starting the
run, McLaughlin was followed by Lauren Maule of Texas with Lauren
Jensen of Wis. and Laurie Abrams of New Mexico trailing behind.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went out really hard at the beginning of the bike, then went
easier toward the end to get my legs ready for the run,'' said
McLaughlin.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin claimed her first USTS victory in 2:09.20. Maule
finished second in 2:11.00 with Jensen bringing up third.
</P>
<P>
   In the wheelchair competition, Julia Wallace of Roswell, Ga.
dominated the swim making the transition to the hand bike ahead of
Atlantans David Bailey and Scot Hollonbeck. Bailey made up the
difference and finished first out of the three.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did the swim in 28 minutes, I felt like I had the brakes on.
Then around five miles into the bike I started feeling good,'' said
Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who lost a lung and kidney to bone cancer after a hit
and run left her with only one leg, is the first female wheelchair
athlete to ever compete in the USTS.
</P>
<P>
   ''My swim was good but I felt like crap on the bike and the
run,'' said Wallace who finished second ahead of Hollonbeck.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop on the Bally Total Fitness U.S. Triathlon series
is New York on Sept. 20 followed by the National Series
Championship at Oceanside, Calif. on Oct 25.

   Cell phone junkies, beware. A wake-up call is coming from Gary
Hustwit, the 33-year-old founder of Incommunicado Press, who wants
``to bring danger back into books.''
</P>
<P>
   In a world where popular music dances much closer to the edge
than popular fiction, Hustwit is attempting to meld the two into a
kind of hip performance-art publishing that defies conventional
boundaries. This fall, one of his books may defy a legal boundary,
as well, by showing that telephone privacy is an outdated concept
in the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Big Brother. Think instead of a quiet-spoken 29-year-old
who identifies himself only by his first initial, V., and doubles
as the Spacewurm, a self-styled technomusic artist. For the last
five years, he has used specially modified scanning equipment ``to
secretly (and illegally) record the cellular and portable phone
calls of everyday people all over the country,'' as the catalog for
Incommunicado, which is based in San Diego, puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the Spacewurm incorporated parts of those recordings
into his performances and compact disks. But when Hustwit came
across them, he ``saw hundreds of little short stories'' and
proposed putting them between covers. The result, ``The Spacewurm:
I Listen _ A Document of Digital Voyeurism,'' will be available at
bookstores in November. The ``stories'' concern everything from
sexual encounters to nervous breakdowns, and are highly explicit.
</P>
<P>
   Has Hustwit consulted a lawyer, given the avowed illegality?
``We don't even have one,'' he responded, amused.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from California, the Spacewurm said he
learned the tricks of the scanning trade from his cousin, who is an
insurance adjuster, and became ``infatuated'' with mixing ``real
voices'' with his music. He said that mixing illegally scanned
phone conversations and music had been done by others, and he
added, ``There's a big underground community that listens into
phones.''
</P>
<P>
   As for illegality, the Spacewurm said: ``It doesn't worry me.
Who's going to call in and say, `That's me?'''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it worry Julie Schaper, marketing director of
Consortium Book Sales, the St. Paul-based company that distributes
Incommunicado titles in stores nationwide. ``I'm very excited about
this book,'' she said. ``It's not like you know who he's recorded.
It's well known if you use a cell phone, this kind of thing can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center, a privacy-rights group in Washington, said it was important
to consider both technological and legal aspects of the situation.
Technologically, he said, ``people think they're sending sealed
envelopes'' when they make a call on a cellular phone. But in fact,
``they're sending the electronic equivalent of open postcards.''
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental legal question, he said, is ``what is the
relationship of the privacy rights of the phone user and the First
Amendment rights of the person who publishes information that may
have been illegally obtained?''
</P>
<P>
   Rotenberg's view is that the publisher ``has the right to
publish, but whoever intercepted the conversations could be
prosecuted for violating wiretap laws.''
</P>
<P>
   But given the strong claims of the First Amendment, Rotenberg
said, ``the likelihood of prosecution is not high.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one other possibility exists, of course. With fiction
and fabrication having been passed off as fact lately, even in the
pages of respected magazines and newspapers, the question needs to
be raised: Did the Spacewurm record real cell phone conversations,
or are the ``hundreds of little short stories'' just that, fiction?
</P>
<P>
   Hustwit and his author insist on their veracity. The Spacewurm
said, ``it is real, 100 percent real.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   What is beyond doubt is that this is not publishing as usual.
Nor does Hustwit want it to be. A native Californian, he dropped
out of college to market for an alternative rock label, and in 1991
devised a manual, ``How to Start Your Own Record Label.'' He quit
his job, traded his car for $1,500 seed money, and founded Rock
Press to publish ``how to'' books for musicians. His original title
now has 30,000 copies in print.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Hustwit decided he wanted to publish fiction
aimed at younger readers, the so-called Generation X, and began to
plow profits from the music reference books into a new imprint,
Incommunicado. ``In past generations,'' he said, ``people had Henry
Miller, the Beat writers, even James Joyce. Books were the main
outlet for rebellion. There weren't all these other media
fulfilling that role of pushing the cultural mores.''
</P>
<P>
   Incommunicado is run like an independent record label, slim and
fast-moving. Paring down the usual nine months that most publishers
need to turn manuscripts into books, Hustwit, with one other staff
member and a couple of Macintosh computers, does it in six or eight
weeks, designing everything himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like him in the East,'' said Juris Jurjevics,
publisher of the literary Soho Press. ``He hasn't accepted the
book-publishing process. In fact, he's ignored it, bringing
freshness and originality.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the book business is trying to digest
Bertelsmann's recent purchase of Random House, Hustwit jokingly
calls his company ``the last hope for American _ German? _
publishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Spacewurm is listening. Maybe to you.

<P>
   BOENG KAEK, Cambodia _ The crush at the door of the tiny
schoolhouse here was so thick Sunday that when the voters burst in,
one by one, they were sweating and laughing from the exertion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't talk to you now: I've got to go vote!'' cried a
74-year-old woman named Tem as she pushed at the back of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The parched, yellow rice fields here, like rice fields all
around Cambodia Sunday, were empty and silent as the nation paused
from its toil and violence to cast ballots in its first
Parliamentary election in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, at crowded temples and schoolhouses like
this one, millions of Cambodians seemed eager to cast a vote not
only for their choice of leaders but also for their right to
determine their own future, free of the coups and warfare that have
battered them for generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a new leader who can unify the nation and bring
peace,'' said a 54-year-old farmer named Som Phon, who voted in the
nearby village of Trapaeng Sva. ``What we need is peace.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, there were few reports of irregularities
around the country and only one report of serious violence. This
was an attack by remnants of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla movement
near a remote northern village that had once been a rebel
stronghold. Ten people were killed in the attack but voting went
on, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   The counting of ballots was to begin only on Monday, and with
the political future of Cambodia's strongman, Hun Sen, at stake,
foreign and local election monitors warned that extensive
manipulation of the results was still a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party, the former Communist Party,
has dominated the campaign through its control of the media and of
the levers of government, from the army and the police down though
provincial governorships to the administration of tiny villages
like this one, with its 335 registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank goodness, I have not had any problems,'' said Som Phon,
who said he is in the minority in his outspoken support of the
Funcinpec royalist party of Hun Sen's chief rival, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh. ``But I am under pressure. I am afraid of what may
happen to me if Funcinpec loses.''
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen has shown his willingness to use force against his
rivals. After losing the last election, in 1993, he forced his way,
through threats of violence, into a coalition with Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one year ago, when the prince seemed to be increasing his
political and military strength in preparation for the election,
Hun Sen ousted him in a coup.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen said this month that he would honor the results of
Sunday's vote if it was ``free and fair.'' That statement appeared
to open the possibility that he might challenge an outcome that did
not favor him.
</P>
<P>
   With two-thirds of the seats in the 122-seat Parliament needed
to form a government, no single party, of the 39 in contention, is
expected to win outright. The coming days and weeks are likely to
see a complex _ and possibly dangerous _ campaign of political
maneuvers as mutually antagonistic parties seek their share of
power.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Sunday was a day for the ballot, a day when the country's
farmers and fishermen and shop owners and clerks gave their answer
to the foreign diplomats and analysts who have in recent weeks
suggested that Cambodia was not ``ready for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted early,'' said Sem Sak, 54, a farmer who had joined the
crush outside the schoolhouse here before the polls opened at 7
a.m. ``This election is for the future of my children, and for
myself. I want a new leader who can develop the country.''
</P>
<P>
   He said no one had told him how to cast his ballot. ``Ten people
have 10 minds,'' he said. ``No one can predict how they will
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Tem, the 74-year-old voter, was quite ready to say how she would
vote. Finally agreeing to talk as she stood outside the schoolhouse
door, she said, ``I'm old and nearly blind, but I can see who is
best for president. I'm not afraid to say I'm going to vote for our
father, the king.''
</P>
<P>
   King Norodom Sihanouk ruled Cambodia in what many people now see
as its golden age in the 1960s, before the country was torn apart
by war and mass killings. As a constitutional monarch, he is now
barred from political activity, but many people said Sunday they
were casting their votes for him by voting for his son, Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the king ruled Cambodia, everybody had enough clothes and
enough money and we didn't have all these soldiers doing anything
they want,'' Tem said. ``I remember the time when I was happy, and
I want a leader who will bring me happiness like before. I want
food and I want the price of rice and fish to go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Like almost all Cambodians, her life since then has been harsh,
crushed by the four years of Khmer Rouge rule from 1975 to 1979,
when more than one million people died, and by more than a decade
of civil war that followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life has been so difficult that I can't even tell you,''
she said. ``I have no children left. Two died in the Khmer Rouge
time and one died afterwards. He was a soldier but I don't know who
he was fighting against.''
</P>
<P>
   The whitewashed schoolhouse, set among bamboo trees, was a
foreign place for the mostly illiterate villagers. Three pairs of
glasses were available on a desk and some of the villagers tried
them on with the aid of an election official.
</P>
<P>
   The official in his sandals and patched shirt ushered the voters
solemnly from the registration desk to the two cardboard voting
stalls to the glittering aluminum voting box to the table with
indelible ink, where each voter dipped an index finger to show that
he had cast his ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The voters then exited through a back window of the schoolroom,
stepping up onto a green plastic chair to climb through it.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the aid of their borrowed glasses, some voters
found the large, multiple-choice ballot a challenge. One squatted
on the floor, spreading his ballot with his hands as he studied its
rows of party symbols. One held it above his head, turning it from
side to side. One carried it to the ballot box unmarked and had to
be guided back to the voting stall to make his mark on it.
</P>
<P>
   When the polls closed, at 4 p.m., all but three of the 335
voters registered in Boeng Kaek had cast their ballots. Of those
missing, one had died, one was at a clinic giving birth and one was
an election observer traveling elsewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a problem. After 301 voters had passed through the
schoolhouse, it was discovered that a stamp used to validate the
ballots was defective and was not leaving a proper mark.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, the ballot box was triple locked, sealed
and bound inside two plastic bags for safekeeping until Monday's
count. But it will be up to election officials to decide whether
those 301 votes _ including the votes of Tem and Sem Sak _ will be
counted. &QL;

PUBLISHING INDUSTRY'S FOCUS SHIFTS TO LIMITING DISTRIBUTOR
RETURNS

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After three years of rising returns of unsold books,
the tidal wave of hard-cover flops and paperback rejects that
washed over the publishing indstry is finally showing signs of
easing.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers who once boasted about million-copy print runs as a
way to promote the potential for books by pricey authors are now
bragging about unglamorous efficiencies that are reducing their
returns, which in the worst cases soared as high as 80 percent of
the value of books shipped to bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the number of books that had to be returned unsold to
publishers reached such a high level that a nonprofit industry
group called it a ``crisis'' for the publishing industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the year's first five months, when returns are typically
heavier, the hard-cover books sent back by bookstores dropped by
almost 19 percent, to $204 million, from the comparable period in
1997, according to the Association of American Publishers, the
industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the large trade publishers in New York confirm that
significant reductions are starting to take place _ largely because
of cautious new attitudes in a flat market that has prompted
executives to reconsider the old convention that simply pumping out
more copies increases excitement and sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems pretty clear that everyone is being more
conservative,'' said Lou Aronica, the publisher of Hearst Corp.'s
Avon Books, who noted that the number of books returned to his
company had dropped by several percentage points this year because
the company chose to ship fewer books and to print more modest
runs, which are replenished frequently based on new orders. ``This
is an industry that feeds on mass hysteria, and at the moment there
doesn't seem to be one,'' he said. ``There seems to be a calming
sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
   For HarperCollins, a unit of News Corp. that has been striving
to remake itself after its parent took a $270 million charge in
1997, the drop has been sizable this year. The costs of its returns
have dropped to 25 percent of the value of copies shipped to
booksellers from 35 percent _ a difference of $50 million,
according to Jo Kiener, the chief operating officer of News America
Publishing Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than blindly front-load books into the marketplace,''
he said, ``what you do is ship out a more reasonable number.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiener said HarperCollins was basing its sales projections for
various books on computerized tracking of how similar titles in a
genre have fared in the first critical four to eight weeks of shelf
life.
</P>
<P>
   The monthly sales figures compiled by the publishers association
indicates that other companies are also shipping fewer newly
published titles, with gross sales of hard covers down by more than
1 percent this year, to $566 million.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, contemporary publishers have accepted returns of
unsold books as a ritual of the business, an enticement that dates
back to the Depression to persuade booksellers to take risks on
titles.
</P>
<P>
   But publishers are starting to question this custom,
particularly as the value of returns of critical hard-cover titles
soared by more than 27 percent in 1995 and continued to rise until
the Book Industry Study Group, a nonprofit organization, declared
the record rates last year a ``crisis.'' Publishers quietly pulped
or shredded the returned books.
</P>
<P>
   The forces driving the trend reflect the changing dynamics of
publishing and bookselling, according to Jean Srnecz, a
merchandising vice president for Baker &AMP; Taylor Books, one of the
largest distributors.
</P>
<P>
   She said publishing houses tried to meet corporate demand for
profits by betting advance money on what they thought were sure
winners _ a limited number of star authors or celebrities who
commanded top pay. To earn back that money, they inflated print
runs to justify the advances. At the same time, they were shipping
more books to fill the expanding shelves of new superstores _ space
that grew faster than the expansion in consumer sales. And they
were making decisions to pump out books with incomplete information
about sales and demand from booksellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the focus,'' she said, ``is on hard unglamorous work,''
with more data shared between booksellers and publishers about
sales trends and demand along with a shift in the traditional
philosophy that a giant first print run was needed no matter how
much the author was paid.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was that kind of practical realism that prompted Pearson
PLC's Penguin Putnam last year to reduce by half the announced
million-copy print run for a 1997 book about the O.J. Simpson trial
by the former prosecutor Marcia Clark, who was paid an advance of
more than $4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner Inc.'s two publishing companies, Warner Books and
Little Brown, were two of the more daring gamblers, losing a big
bet on a $3 million advance for a book by Simpson's girlfriend,
Paula Barbieri, that was compounded by sales of only 20 percent of
the 300,000 printed copies.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Kirshbaum, the chief executive of Warner Books, who
presides over the trade group, said the competition was such that
it was difficult to make rational decisions about printing books.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were always afraid to cut back because if you're the only
one and everybody else tended to pour out books, you would suffer
and your books would get crowded out in the stores,'' he said. The
temptation of betting on a celebrity book, with its potential to
become a best seller along with its risks, was almost addictive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's salacious,'' he said. ``It's like being on drugs. It's
great in the short term because you get a lot of copies out, but
it's bad in the long term because you ultimately get hooked on a
system that is unprofitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other large companies, Warner Books has started to reduce
the volume of books it is shipping. In the mass-market paperback
category, Kirshbaum said, the company reduced shipments by between
10 percent and 20 percent. The company, he said, is starting to
achieve small gains because of dropping returns.
</P>
<P>
   It is these sorts of modest gains that prompted Patricia
Schroeder, the president of the publishers association, to brag
about something that has historically not been the stuff of boasts:
returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very encouraged by the numbers,'' she said. ``People
started paying attention and figuring out that their profit margin
was more affected by the amount of returns. And that's when
conventional wisdom shifted.''

TECHNOLOGY COLUMN: FROM WEB-SEARCH ENGINES TO PORTAL SITES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet business models, like the technologies that drive them,
mutate faster than a flu virus. A case in point: the ``portal,'' a
scheme whereby a handful of mostly money-losing enterprises band
together to form a mega-Web site that combines searching, content,
e-mail, chat and other services.
</P>
<P>
   The portal, its defenders insist, is a whole greater than the
sum of its parts, because people who come for one service will
discover another and stick around. Advertisers and investors have
demonstrated that they love this sort of reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the logic of the portal concept is lost on some.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there are amusing contradictions to the portal
fad. Not the least of these is the spectacle of hundreds of
new-media geeks who spent years painting America Online as the
trailer park of cyberspace now scrambling desperately to be ...
well, America Online _ the original, and some would say, only
authentic _ portal.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond simply creating a hip version of America Online, the idea
is to make the portal site so enticing that World Wide Web users
will make it their first stop, and so seductive that they will not
want to stray elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first to be seduced were Wall Street and a few big
media companies. All told, many billions of dollars have been
invested in enterprises that with two notable exceptions have yet
to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because advertisers have been drawn to portals at a level
that defies all reason.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``The Great Portal Shakeout,'' a recent report by
Forrester Research, the top nine portals _ those of Alta Vista,
America Online, Excite, Infoseek, Lycos, Microsoft, Netscape, Snap
and Yahoo _ account for a mere 15 percent of all Internet traffic.
Yet they attract 59 percent of all advertising revenue on the
Internet, an extraordinary 293 percent premium.
</P>
<P>
   Network television, in contrast, attracts 67 percent of all
viewers and 84 percent of advertising, for a 25 percent premium.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite this enormous bonus, only the two largest portals,
America Online and Yahoo, have so far managed to eke out a net
income. This reality, said Chris Charron, the analyst who was the
lead author of the Forrester report, makes the infant portal
industry ripe for a shakeout that will leave only three or four
winners dividing at most 20 percent of Internet traffic by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something has to give,'' Charron said. ``The pie is
advertising, and the pie that's available, we think, will be $8
billion in five years, with 30 percent of that going to portals _
about $2.4 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   And of that $2.4 billion, he added, ``AOL and Yahoo will grab
half.''
</P>
<P>
   The business concept is simple on its face: If you can stuff
enough services and content into a single Web address, you will, in
the ugly parlance of the industry, ``aggregate eyeballs'' _ that
is, bring a lot of people with disparate interests and needs to the
same place so that the owners of the portal site can sell
advertising priced on a certain dollar amount for every 1,000 pages
viewed.
</P>
<P>
   If this algorithm seems vaguely familiar, it may be because it
is the basic programming plan of network television.
</P>
<P>
   And that is precisely the problem, said Michael Wolff, whose
book ``Burn Rate'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1998) chronicles the origins
and quixotic meanderings of many of the companies that are now
either portals or the anchor tenants of portals.
</P>
<P>
   While a television audience is attracted to a network by the
program playing at any given moment, when it comes to a portal,
Wolff argues, ``there really is no natural reason why the audience
is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, to get somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience isn't there for unique content or for a
partiality to the experience or really for any self-selected
reason,'' he said. ``You are there for the same reason you might
find yourself on a highway interchange or in an airport.''
</P>
<P>
   How would the same people who have enthusiastically invested in
a portal react if the Department of Transportation were to design a
huge federal highway interchange with the sole objective of having
drivers continuously circle a row of billboards? Yet such a
comparison is not all that far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   Cyberspace is its own reality. Even so, following the
why-am-I-here question to its logical answer suggests that the true
essence of a portal is a sort of parlor-trick illusion.
</P>
<P>
   The anchor tenant of each of the portals is what used to be
known as a search engine or Internet directory service. These
services _ Yahoo, Excite, Infoseek, etc. _ were designed to do one
thing: help people find what they are looking for on the Web. To
various degrees and in different ways, they all do this well.
</P>
<P>
   But the metamorphosis from search engine to portal is something
of a paradox, since one is the antithesis of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Search engines are intended to point you to your desired
destination in the increasingly complex terrain of cyberspace. Now
they are becoming tools in a scheme to keep you in one place. If
you actually go where they point you, some other site may get your
attention _ and the few micro-cents your attention is worth.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of another Forrester analyst, Kate Delhayn, ``Most
portals have transitioned from intersections on the Internet to
sticking points.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, most consumers will not appreciate the discovery that
someone has lined the hallway with flypaper. So the portal has to
keep up at least the illusion of movement. It continues to send
users to a destination just as before. Only now the deck is stacked
in favor of destinations that are owned by the portal itself or by
its partners or advertisers _ at least, there is very real danger
that consumers will perceive things that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a portal becomes captive to any one source of content, or
is perceived to be captive _ Snap, for example, being seen simply
as an outlet for NBC to the exclusion of other content _ it runs
the risk of turning away consumers who are looking for an open
gateway to the Internet,'' Charron warned.
</P>
<P>
   Which, he is quick to point out, is just about everyone.

 &HT;    New face on `Ally' filling in tics as she goes
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ A competent lawyer on ``Ally McBeal''? What's
this show coming to?
</P>
<P>
   But that's how Portia de Rossi, who joins the firm of Cage, Fish
and Associates when ``Ally'' returns for its second season Sept.
14, describes her character, lawyer Nell Porter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's good at her job. She's a competent, strong woman,'' says
de Rossi, who had a bit part in ``Scream 2'' _ and survived all the
slashings as ditsy sorority babe Murphy. ``Fish (`Ally's' founding
law partner superbly played by Greg Germann), being as greedy as he
is, wants to enhance the possibility of making a lot of money, so
he brings her in.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress, who chatted at a Fox party here to promote the fall
season, is the first new regular added to Fox's breakout hit since
it debuted last season and became one of the most talked-about
shows on TV. ``Ally'' was nominated for 10 Emmys last week,
including best comedy, a rarity for an hourlong series.
</P>
<P>
   Cast members have warned de Rossi that her life is about to
change enormously as she goes from being little-known to watched,
somewhat obsessively, by millions. She says they told her: ``It's
nuts out there. Lock your doors. Don't even go outside.''
</P>
<P>
   De Rossi has completed filming the season opener, but says she
still doesn't know much about her character, including what quirks
the show's creator, David E. Kelley, will saddle her with. She says
the cast told her Kelley likes to watch the actors and then pick up
and magnify their tics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg Germann said the other day, `Maybe you'll be blind. Maybe
you'll have really thick glasses.' I said, `Maybe I won't.'''
</P>
<P>
   One reason Kelley may have hired her, though, is her height.
She's 5-foot-8, easily 5-10 in high heels. Star Calista Flockhart
and most of the other cast members are considerably shorter, and de
Rossi's height may be used to intimidate them. Or, knowing
``Ally,'' to cut Nell Porter down to size.
</P>
<P>
   De Rossi was born in Australia but has lived in Los Angeles for
four years and has no trace of an Australian accent. In addition to
``Scream 2'' (``There may be some possibility of doing `Scream 3,'
she says), she had a small role in the 1994 film ``Sirens'' with
Hugh Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Although actors frequently say they don't have time to watch
much television, de Rossi says she was ``a huge, huge fan'' of
``Ally'' all through last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing,'' she says of her first week of filming, ``to
have these characters that I love so much right in front of me.''

 &HT;    WB's best: `Felicity' and `Buffy' spinoff
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The WB technically stands for Warner
Brothers, but these days it might as well mean ``whatta buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   The little network, although it still isn't turning a profit,
launched ``Dawson's Creek'' in the spring and watched it rocket to
the No. 1 show for teenagers among all networks (although half the
show's viewers are adults).
</P>
<P>
   And the WB has the new fall series with the best word-of-mouth
at this point _ ``Felicity,'' which has been dubbed ``Ally McBeal:
The College Years,'' a not completely accurate depiction, but a
nice ballpark to be playing in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity,'' which debuts Sept. 29 after the season premiere of
yet another WB hit, ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' is the saga of
Felicity Porter, a bright but almost painfully naive 17-year-old
who scraps her parents' plans for her to go to Stanford University
and study pre-med, and on an impulse, runs off to New York to study
art, find herself, make new friends, fall in love and all that.
</P>
<P>
   ``People compare things they don't know to things they do
know,'' says ``Felicity'' creator J.J. Abrams, who also wrote the
feature film ``Armageddon'' (the two could not be more dissimilar).
He says he's flattered by the comparisons to ``Ally,'' but
``Felicity'' will be quite different, with much less quirkiness and
comedy than the Fox hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity'' probably won't become the instant phenomenon that
``Dawson'' did, but the quality is there. And the WB soon will
launch a huge promotion campaign, including trailers in movie
theaters, where scenes from the show will run with Madonna's new
single, ``Power of Goodbye.'' (Madonna has nothing to do with the
TV series; that's just the way savvy marketing is done.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Dawson,'' meanwhile, will move to 8 p.m. Wednesdays in the
fall, where it has a good chance of knocking off time slot
competitor ``Beverly Hills 90210'' when it debuts Oct. 7.
``Dawson'' will add three new characters to its core cast of four
this season: trash-mouthed Abby Morgan (Monica Keena), who appeared
once last season in the ``Breakfast Club'' episode, and siblings
Andie and Jack McPhee (Meredith Monroe and Kerr Smith), who'll move
into the town of Capeside and doubtless be as good-looking and
emotionally conflicted as everyone else who lives there.
</P>
<P>
   And WB isn't overlooking ``Buffy,'' either. Seth Green, who's
appeared several times as the guitar-playing character Oz, will
become a series regular. Of even more interest to ``Buffy'' fans,
some of whom are prone to get almost as obsessive on the Internet
as ``X-Files'' followers, is the news that WB is creating a spinoff
titled ``Angel,'' based on the character (played by David Boreanaz)
who's been Buffy's on-and-off vampire love interest. Joss Whedon,
``Buffy's'' creator, is developing the spinoff, which the WB says
will be ready for fall of 1999.

 &HT;    Future arrives Tuesday at children's cancer unit
 &HT;    By Ellen Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three years in the making, the largest pediatric
cancer center in the Southeast, and the only one in Georgia that
specializes in bone marrow transplantation, will make its debut
Tuesday with an open house.
</P>
<P>
   Egleston Children's Hospital will show off its newly renovated
and expanded AFLAC Cancer Center, named after the American Family
Life Assurance Co. of Columbus, Ga., from 4 p.m. to 6. The
insurance company gave $3 million of the nearly $5 million needed
to fund the project and continues to contribute to the center; the
rest was raised by community contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The center treats young patients with cancer and blood-related
disorders, seeing an average of 50 patients a day. Each year, the
center treats nearly 140 newly diagnosed cancer patients and about
400 patients already on therapy, while observing 1,200 long-term
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The entire 26,000-square-foot center includes a pharmacy,
outpatient treatment and an inpatient unit that includes a
transplant unit. It's based on a theme of travel and exploration,
with four television screens playing images of the land, sea, sky
and space in each entryway.
</P>
<P>
   Before expansion, doctors had to move some patients to other
floors in the hospital because the center did not have the room to
accommodate all of them, said Tricia Benson, a registered nurse who
is the center's administrator director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the complaint was, `We want to be with other (young)
patients and family,''' Benson said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the inpatient unit holds 25 beds, up from 17. Ten of those
beds are used for patients needing bone marrow transplant services,
up from three. The inpatient wing, converted from an old office
unit, opened last September.
</P>
<P>
   The outpatient clinic still needs a few finishing touches, but
will begin operation next Monday. Once located separately from the
inpatient unit, the two wings now are connected to ensure
continuity.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everything in the center is new, including a monitoring
system in each room. The monitoring equipment alone cost $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first week I was here I felt like I was on the Enterprise.
It's an incredible environment to work in,'' said Dr. Roger Vega,
one of the cancer center's physicians. ``It's a future view of what
a medical facility should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with focus groups made up of staff and family members,
the center also developed a family room where patients and their
family can sit around and watch television, cook a meal in an
adjacent kitchen, do their laundry and exercise in a small
equipment room.
</P>
<P>
   Children can entertain themselves in a playroom and watch movies
in a large-screen, enclosed mini-theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``The length of stay for patients can be up to 30 or 40 days, so
we wanted to make it comfortable not only for the child, but also
for the family,'' said Benson.
</P>
<P>
   The state-of-the-art center has earned its own nicknames. At the
center of the inpatient unit is a spacious nurse's station _ often
called the ``Mother Ship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of the hospital sees us as the Taj Mahal,'' Benson
said. ``But children with cancer deserve an environment that
supports them through their treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   In planning, Benson and other staff members visited other
pediatric cancer centers across the United States, but found
nothing like the center they have now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't trade this for anything I've seen,'' Benson said.
``How many hospitals can you walk into with a big-screen movie
theater? It creates a very healing environment.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ Negotiators from General Motors and the United
Automobile Workers union worked around the clock Sunday to settle
strikes at two GM auto parts factories here, struggling over a few
final details of GM's future investments in the factories.
</P>
<P>
   Bargainers took a break only to watch the arrival of 18 flat-bed
trucks at one of the factories. As more than 100 striking workers
cheered and waved green strike placards, the trucks brought back
parts-making equipment that GM had removed from an auto body parts
factory here over Memorial Day weekend, triggering the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood Jewell, the chairman of the UAW unit at the auto body
parts factory, tried Sunday afternoon to temper workers'
expectations for an immediate settlement. ``We've still got a way
to go,'' he told reporters during the brief break.
</P>
<P>
   But other UAW officials said that a deal was likely as soon as
Monday or Tuesday. Most of the issues in the strike have already
been settled, they said, including health and safety disputes and
the minimum number of auto parts that some workers have to produce
each day.
</P>
<P>
   All but two of 29 GM assembly plants in North America have
closed for lack of parts from the struck factories here, and more
than 100 GM parts factories have also shut down partly or entirely
because the assembly plants are closed. GM has temporarily laid off
192,000 workers, braking growth in the entire American economy this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   GM abruptly agreed Saturday evening to return dies used in
making parts, and the UAW agreed to have up to 160 workers cross
picket lines to clean the dies, make any needed repairs and install
them in huge mechanical presses.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell said Sunday that the workers would actually run the
presses and produce a few parts to make sure that the dies were
functioning properly, but would return then to the picket lines if
a settlement still had not been reached.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have been under pressure to settle the strikes. GM
dealerships are running short of popular pickup trucks and sport
utility vehicles, raising the risk that customers might start
shopping elsewhere and never return.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Standard and Poor's warned last week that it might start a
formal review of GM's credit rating, and any reduction in that
credit rating would raise the company's borrowing costs and make it
more expensive for GM to offer auto loans. The duration of the
strikes here has also put in danger GM's schedule for the
introduction of 1999 models, including a new line of highly
profitable, full-sized pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW has been alarmed by a federal lawsuit that GM filed and
by arbitration hearings that ended here on Saturday evening. In the
lawsuit and in arbitration, GM has contended that the strikes here
violate its national agreement with the UAW, and has sought rulings
that would limit the UAW's ability to stage crippling,
factory-level strikes in the future. GM would likely withdraw its
lawsuit and arbitration grievance if a settlement is reached here.
</P>
<P>
   The national agreement allows strikes over assembly line speed
increases, subcontracting and health and safety grievances. The UAW
has raised all of these issues in the strike but its main demand
has been that GM invest in more modern equipment for the factories
here, even though the factories have high costs and low
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   A UAW official who insisted on anonymity acknowledged in an
interview Sunday that some of these same investment issues were now
among the final sticking points, but refused to provide details,
saying, ``I can't say that because we can't strike over that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts have been calling for GM to use the strikes
as an excuse to close inefficient factories and stop production of
money-losing car models like the Buick Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   But while GM has threatened publicly to do both, Richard
Shoemaker, the UAW's vice president for GM issues, said at a news
conference on Saturday evening that GM had not mentioned to him any
plans to close factories. The UAW has expressed no objection to the
elimination of some models provided that the factories are
converted to other production instead of being closed.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the flat-bed trucks arriving here carried one to three
stamping dies. The dies resemble gigantic metal molds, a dozen feet
long and weighing almost 10 tons. The dies are used to stamp auto
body parts from galvanized steel sheets.
</P>
<P>
   The first die to return was for pickup truck hoods and had the
nickname ``Bob'' scrawled on the side with yellow chalk. After the
trucks had passed through the factory gates, the workers loudly
sang ``Solidarity Forever,'' the UAW's anthem.
</P>
<P>
   GM removed the dies over Memorial Day weekend for fear of a
strike by workers here angry about the company's decision last
spring to cancel plans to install the latest equipment here. But
the removal of the dies ended up triggering a walkout by the 3,400
workers here on June 5.
</P>
<P>
   Another 5,800 workers at a speedometer and spark plug factory
several miles away then went on strike on June 11, partly to show
support for the auto body parts workers and partly because of
worries that GM would continue to winnow their work force through
attrition while buying more parts from non-union outside suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   GM moved the dies over Memorial Day weekend to a stamping
factory in Mansfield, Ohio, but never used them there. Canadian
auto workers, who will be building the first of the new pickups,
declared that they would refuse to accept any parts from the moved
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   UAW officials have also said that the dies were damaged
accidentally during the trip to Mansfield, but GM officials have
refused to confirm or deny this.
</P>
<P>
   For all their size and weight, stamping dies are remarkably
fragile, and will produce defective parts unless mounted with great
precision in huge mechanical presses. Striking workers here were
dismayed to see that some of the dies arriving here were stacked on
each other, which can cause damage.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Miller, a 49-year-old pipe fitter who has been working
with dies here for 31 years, said that it could take anywhere from
two days to two weeks to put the dies back in service, depending on
how much damage they have suffered. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASTELLETO, Italy _ If there is a Lost Tribe of Silicon Valley,
it resides here on a broad industrial plain on the outskirts of
suburban Milan.
</P>
<P>
   And the tribe's leader is 62-year-old Bruno Murari, head of a
semiconductor research laboratory for one of the world's leading
chip makers, ST Microelectronics.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the company was known as SGS-Thomson
Microelectronics. And, like many of Silicon Valley's most legendary
chip makers, it is one of the ``Fairchildren,'' a descendant of
Fairchild Semiconductor Corp., the California company that helped
ignite the global semiconductor revolution more than 30 years ago _
by, among other things, owning an early stake in Murari's company.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the culture here isn't like the restless one in the American
chip companies that can trace their lineage to Fairchild, the
Intels, Advanced Micro Devices and National Semiconductors. There
engineers frequently change jobs to work on the latest chip. Here
at the ST Microelectronics lab the folkways are more akin to those
in a Renaissance craftsmen's guild.
</P>
<P>
   Murari has passed up many offers to leave Italy and go to the
United States. He explained, ``We had a team, and I found I was
committed to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet traditional does not mean old-fashioned. Indeed, Murari is
considered the grandmaster of analog circuit design, a subordinate
field of electronics in which ST Microelectronics is the world
leader _ and which is about to enter a new and potentially more
important era.
</P>
<P>
   Analog chips translate real-world phenomena _ like motion,
sound, temperature, pressure and light _ into analogous electronic
or mechanical patterns.
</P>
<P>
   And compared with digital chips, which define the world in black
or white absolutes, understanding only a binary code of ones and
zeros, analog chips function as the eyes, ears and muscle that
connect the clinically precise world of digital computing to the
subtler, more textured world that is perceived by human beings.
</P>
<P>
   It is analog circuitry, for example, that converts the human
voice entering a microphone into an electronic signal that a
digital chip can reduce to the binary code stored on an audio CD.
And it is analog circuitry in the CD player that turns the digital
code back into an electronic speaker signal that a human ear can
hear.
</P>
<P>
   It is also analog chips that tell an automobile's transmission
when to shift, signal a car's air bags to inflate during a crash,
and handle numerous other automotive tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between designing analog and digital electronic
devices has long been viewed by many engineers as the difference
between an art and a science.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital design is like building with Lego blocks,'' said
Richard Chesson, a Canadian engineer who works under Murari in the
Castelleto laboratory. ``Analog design is more like wood carving.''
</P>
<P>
   And certainly Murari, as the soft-spoken leader of this effort,
has carved out his niche. In his 37-year career, he has designed 10
major analog integrated circuits and has supervised the design of
1,000 more.
</P>
<P>
   And he has helped create a series of unique semiconductor
processes that have made ST Microelectronics, which last year had
revenue of more than $4 billion and was the world's 12th-largest
semiconductor company, the No. 1 analog chip maker in the world,
surpassing such U.S. competitors as National Semiconductor and
Analog Devices.
</P>
<P>
   Now Murari is preparing his laboratory for what he considers the
final challenge of his long career. Later this year ST Microsystems
will announce that the company plans to become a major player in
the emerging market for micro-electro-mechanical systems, or MEMS
chips.
</P>
<P>
   These are perhaps the ultimate analog circuits, consisting of
microscopic mechanical structures that are etched into the surface
of silicon chips.
</P>
<P>
   Already the MEMS market is a multibillion dollar business, based
largely on use of the chips in silicon accelerometers that are now
standard equipment used as sensors for air-bag collision systems in
cars.
</P>
<P>
   But the MEMS market, in which ST Microsystems is already
moderately active, is expected to become an even larger business in
the next century with the birth of a remarkable new class of chips
_ those covered with millions of microscopic mirrors that are the
heart of projection display systems, or those that have the ability
to detect gases and liquids that serve as chemical or biomedical
sensors.
</P>
<P>
   ST Microelectronics is already the leading supplier to
Hewlett-Packard Co., the world's dominant manufacturer of ink-jet
printers. At the heart of an ink-jet printer are MEMS chips with
arrays of microscopic nozzles that shoot tiny drops of ink onto
paper.
</P>
<P>
   Now the MEMS market is expanding rapidly as intelligent sensors
are being added to more and more consumer electronics products. For
example, as disk drives are being added to mobile products like
laptop computers, designers have begun adding accelerometers _ tiny
MEMS chips that sense motion and can automatically lift the head
from the surface of a disk drive to avoid damage.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The shift toward MEMS at ST Microelectronics has been made with
the blessing of Pasquale Pistorio, the company's president and
chief executive, for whom Murari has worked for much of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the freedom from Pasquale to do what I want to do,''
Murari said during a recent interview as construction workers
nearby completed a new MEMS research wing of the Castelleto center.
</P>
<P>
   ST Microelectronics does maintain a satellite laboratory in San
Jose, Calif., in the heart of Silicon Valley. And Murari, who
visits that lab about four times a year, acknowledges that in many
ways chip design is easier in the Valley, with its network of
support services and ready availability of specialized talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end it made it more difficult by staying here,'' he
said. ``We would have been able to achieve the same results in half
the time in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, part of the recipe for the success of this Italian
laboratory may be Murari's own homegrown independent style as a
researcher and a leader, a combination of ardor and insight. It is
what one of his customers, Thomas Froeschle, an engineer at Bose,
the U.S. audio company, refers to as ``management by enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruno is a remarkably creative person,'' Froeschle said. Bose
designed several of its most popular circuits with the help of
Murari's team, and Froeschle remembers that while other engineering
firms are frequently proprietary about their work, he was struck by
the willingness of the ST Microelectronics engineers to discuss
design ideas freely, without concern for ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Here at Castelleto, Murari makes certain that each of his 300 or
so designers has time for what he calls ``play'' _ the 10 percent
to 15 percent of their time that is set aside for them to use
thinking about and working on their own ideas.
</P>
<P>
   That sense of play frequently spills into his own design work.
</P>
<P>
   Murari is a former world champion designer of model glider
planes built with carbon fiber and Kevlar. Chesson, the Canadian
engineer, remembers a discussion of mechanical design with a large
American customer in which engineers from the two companies were
becoming frustrated. Each side was having trouble understanding the
other's notion of how the product's mechanical and electronics
systems would interact.
</P>
<P>
   One morning, to illustrate his point, Murari took in a
carbon-fiber glider wing he had designed.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Chesson remembers, ``the Americans were looking at
each other with expressions that said, `This guy's off the wall.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then,'' he said, ``a light went off in their eyes. Bruno had
come out of left field, but his idea bridged the gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Murari doesn't reserve his left-field flourishes for outsiders.
Several years ago, when he was pushing his team to come up with a
new design for packaging its circuitry onto chip surfaces, no one
seemed to be grasping the concept.
</P>
<P>
   Then one morning Murari burst in to the laboratory and threw a
compact and elegant chip package onto the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' he said. ``This is what the competition is doing, and
it's a shame we're not doing the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Only after he had left the room did one of the engineers venture
over to examine the ``competitor's'' system.
</P>
<P>
   The device was not really a rival's _ and not even a real chip.
Instead, it was a tiny block of painted wood onto which Murari,
equal parts engineer and artisan, had painstakingly carved his
circuitry design.

RIDERS TRY TO PUT DRUG SCANDAL BEHIND THEM 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   GRENOBLE, France _ If teams had psychologists instead of sports
doctors, they might say the Tour de France was in a state of denial
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The 147 riders still in the race continued rolling toward the
Alps, stalwart in their vow not to further discuss the doping
problems that have become the focus of this year's event _ at least
not until they sit down with officials of the Tour and the
International Cycling Union this autumn.
</P>
<P>
   As any good psychologist might point out, though, not talking
about it will not make the problem go away.
</P>
<P>
   Two jailed officials of the TVM team from the Netherlands are
scheduled to be transferred Monday to the French city of Rheims for
questioning about the police seizure in March of a team car
carrying illegal performance-enhancing drugs. If the officials
implicate the team, Tour officials have said, it will be expelled.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, perhaps the riders will change their tune, but
for Sunday Frankie Andreu, a U.S. Postal Service rider from
Dearborn, Mich., summed up the general position: ``I understand the
drug story is part of the Tour but it's been more than a week. It's
time the drug story stops and the Tour de France gets going.''
</P>
<P>
   In that spirit, Andreu, who has completed all six of his
previous Tours and finished fourth in the Olympic road race in
Atlanta in 1996, offered an assessment of the leaders a day before
the race enters the Alps for three testing stages.
</P>
<P>
   Of Jan Ullrich, the German leader of Telekom, the wearer of the
overall leader's yellow jersey and the defending Tour champion,
Andreu said, ``He looks good, maybe not as good as last year, but
he's going to be hard to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Bobby Julich, of Glenwood Springs, Colo., who is the leader
of the Cofidis team and ranks second over all, Andreu said: ``He's
just waiting for the Alps to try to do something. Like Ullrich, he
looks very comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Andreu was also enthusiastic about Marco Pantani, the Italian
leader of Mercatone Uno, fourth-ranked and the acknowledged king of
the mountains. But Andreu noted that Pantani is not the time-trial
rider that Ullrich and Julich are. A long race against the clock on
Saturday, a day before the three-week race ends in Paris, may
decide the final result.
</P>
<P>
   All three leaders kept their positions Sunday as a six-man
breakaway by low-ranked riders was allowed to gather steam at
Kilometer 56 of 186.5 (116 miles) and roll unhindered over a big
climb and then into Grenoble, the doorstep to the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   In a sprint finish, the winner was Stuart O'Grady, an Australian
with Gan and the wearer of the yellow jersey for three days a week
ago. He had since sunk to 91st position, more than 58 minutes
behind Ullrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does it all,'' he said, exuberantly, afterward. ``For me,
this Tour is Disneyland.''
</P>
<P>
   He was timed in 4 hours 30 minutes 53 seconds, a speed of 41
kilometers an hour (25 mph) in this 14th stage of the 85th Tour.
The first six finished 10:05 ahead of the main pack and O'Grady
rose to 78th place.
</P>
<P>
   Giuseppe Calcaterra, an Italian with Saeco, was second in the
sprint but was set back to sixth for interference. That put Orlando
Rodrigues, a Portuguese with Banesto, in second place with Leon Van
Bon, a Dutchman with Rabobank, third.
</P>
<P>
   For the second successive day, the U.S. Postal Service team had
a rider in the breakaway, but again came up a little short. Peter
Meinert-Nielsen, a Dane, was impressively strong, as Marty Jemison
of Park City, Utah, was Saturday, but, like Jemison, he got beat in
the final dash, finishing fifth until he was elevated to fourth. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ For a good view of New York this week, the West is
best. On Tuesday the J. Paul Getty Museum opens the first in-depth
exhibition devoted to Walker Evans' vision of New York City.
Although the photographer was well known for his Depression-era
images of the South, he lived and worked for more than 40 years in
New York, where his subjects ranged from subway portraits and
skyscrapers to short-order cooks, Coney Island and fashion. The
Getty is home to the largest museum collection of Evans' prints,
and 400 will be shown through Oct. 11 in ``Walker Evans: New
York.'' Information: (310) 440-7300.

 &HT;    Maddux sticks out 14th win, beats Pirates 2-1
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH - Though Greg Maddux could own this town - 5-0 in
Three Rivers with a 1.12 ERA the last five years - he feared to
throw one more pitch Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a one-run game. Even just four outs away from his 14th
win. Even when he hadn't allowed an earned run all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're starting to tire but you know, it's the fourth time
around (the batting order), it's their best hitter (Pirate Kevin
Young), he's got 20 home runs, it's just a good move,'' said
Maddux. ''The guy's swinging the bat well and any of our relievers,
I would think, would be tougher than facing me again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves beat Pittsburgh 2-1 Sunday and Maddux's thinking held
up, Springer and Kerry Ligtenberg preserving his win while Atlanta
pushed its record to 4-1 on this trip before moving on to
Cincinnati. Now 14-4 with a 1.59 ERA, Maddux watched Springer walk
Young and saw Eddie Perez throw him out attempting to steal before
Ligtenberg recorded his 13th save in a 1-2-3 ninth.
</P>
<P>
   And what of Maddux's theory?
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't have nothing that inning,'' said manager Bobby Cox.
''Didn't have nothing coming out.''
</P>
<P>
   Au contraire.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd rather see someone else,'' said Young, who drove in
Pittsburgh's only run with a sixth-inning sacrifice fly. ''They're
more apt to make a mistake or throw a home run ball.''
</P>
<P>
   But when you're going good, you're going good. Andres Galarraga
knows. He made the day's most important defensive play in the first
inning, when Maddux loaded the bases. Shortstop Ozzie Guillen
attempted to throw out Al Martin to end the inning but bounced a
poor throw far to the right of the base, only to have Galarraga
glove it while on his stomach and still holding the base.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hey, you get paid $8 million,'' Guillen said laughing, ''you
should make that play.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga then won the game in the eighth, when Pirates starter
Jason Schmidt finally wavered and allowed one-out singles to Keith
Lockhart and Chipper Jones. Galarraga, who had lined into a double
play and struck out twice, wore Schmidt into a full count.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like to look for a breaking ball in that situation,''
Galarraga said. ''I'd rather look for a fastball but he struck me
out a couple times with the breaking ball so I looked for it. He
threw me one low.''
</P>
<P>
   So low, it was six inches off the ground when Galarraga lifted
it into left to bring in Lockhart with the game winner. After he
helped drop the Pirates with a two-run homer Friday night, this
time he did it with a soft single.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, he was missing 'em everywhere else today,'' said Cox.
''But you get lured into thinking you can strike him out, sort of
like (St. Louis' Mark) McGwire. You get him once or twice but then,
boom.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, in this case, boink.

 &HT;    Braves on deck: Cincinnati Reds
 &HT;    By Tom Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ When: Tonight, Tuesday and Wednesday night at 7:05 p.m.
Thursday at 12:35 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where: Cynergy Field.
</P>
<P>
   _ TV: Fox Sports South will telecast tonight, Tuesday and
Wednesday night and TBS will telecast Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Probable starting pitchers: Tonight, LHP Tom Glavine (14-4,
2.70; 20-7, 3.25 lifetime vs. Reds) vs. LHP Mike Remlinger (6-11,
4.41; 2-1, 4.54 lifetime vs. Braves). Tuesday, RHP Kevin Millwood
(11-5, 4.19; first appearance vs. Reds) vs. RHP Pete Harnisch (7-5,
3.32; 6-8, 3.11 lifetime vs. Braves). Wednesday, RHP John Smoltz
(9-2, 3.20; 14-10, 2.08 lifetime vs. Reds) vs. TBA. Thursday, LHP
Denny Neagle (10-9, 3.60; 7-3, 4.67 lifetime vs. Reds) vs. RHP
Steve Parris (1-1, 4.40; first appearance vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   _ Series history: Atlanta trails the all-time series 247-293 but
is 18-7 against the Reds over the last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Past meetings: The Braves swept a two-game series at
Cincinnati May 11-12, when Greg Maddux and John Smoltz allowed the
Reds two runs in 14 innings. Andres Galarraga and Andruw Jones both
homered twice in those two games.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reds leaders: Avg.: Dimitri Young (.315); HR _ Bret Boone and
Willie Greene (12); RBI _ Boone (54); SB _ Barry Larkin and Chris
Stynes (15). W _ Brett Tomko (9); ERA _ John Hudek (2.87). Saves _
Danny Graves (2). Strikeouts _ Pete Harnisch (104).
</P>
<P>
   _ Quickly: The Reds have been on two streaks this month _ a
season-high 10-game win string sandwiched around the All-Star break
and an eight-game losing streak that just ended Saturday night. The
Reds had already gone through an 11-game losing streak June 14-24.
The club has been no higher than fourth place since the third game
of the season. ... The Reds' 20 home wins are fewest in the league
after Arizona's 19. Reds pitchers allow a .264 batting average,
sixth highest in the NL and 20 points more than the Braves. They
have also given up 112 homers, second most in the NL. They are
accustomed to coming from behind, 26 percent of their wins occuring
when the club trailed as late as the seventh inning. ... Dimitri
Young leads the league with 35 doubles, followed closedly by Bret
Boone's 30. A sign of the times; they are the only two Reds found
anywhere among league leaders in 15 catagories. Boone, who leads
the team with 54 RBI, would rank fourth on the Braves with that
total. ... Remlinger, tonight's starter, has lost 11 times in 20
starts, the most losses in the league after Arizona's Willie Blair
(14) and Colorado's Darryl Kile (12). He has lost four times in his
last six decisions but in his first start after the All-Star break,
he pitched the second shutout of his career at Arizona. The Braves
defeated him 8-1 on May 11, when he lasted just five innings after
giving up seven runs. Four of those were unearned. ... Cincinnati
had planned to start Scott Winchester on Wednesday but instead
decided to demote him to Class AAA Indianapolis after he gave up 20
runs in his last three starts. His replacement his yet to be
announced. ... On the DL: C Brook Fordyce (bruised left shoulder),
LHP Steve Cooke (left elbow tendinitis), RHP Keith Glauber (right
shoulder surgery).
</P>
<P>
   _ Who's hot: First baseman Sean Casey went into Sunday hitting
.340 since the All-Star break. Shortstop Barry Larkin is hitting
.331 since June 17.
</P>
<P>
   _ Who's not: OF Paul Konerko was 10-for-50 in his first 15 games
since coming over from Los Angeles. Infielder Pokey Reese is
batting .321 with runners in scoring position but has four hits in
his last 22 at-bats (.181).

PANEL WILL URGE MAJOR SPENDING FOR COMPUTER RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A presidential advisory commission made up of
some of the nation's leading computer scientists plans to deliver a
report Monday to the White House, calling for a significant
increase in federal spending on advanced computer research in order
to create ``expeditions to the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, a draft of which was given to The New York Times by
someone close to the committee, calls current federal support for
research in information technology ``dangerously inadequate,'' and
too narrowly focused on ``near-term problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel, known as the Presidential Advisory Committee on High
Performance Computing and Communications, Information Technology
and the Next Generation Internet, has as its co-chairmen William
Joy, a founder of Sun Microsystems, and Ken Kennedy, a computer
scientist at Rice University.
</P>
<P>
   The draft report calls on the federal government to finance
research centers that will pursue broad-ranging computer research
in the spirit of the early explorers of North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much like Lewis and Clark opened the West,'' it says,
``virtual centers focused on future technologies and applications
can, by making bold assumptions about the future, give us key
research insights into the manifold possibilities of the 21st
century technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Such new research centers might build upon, but move beyond work
done at today's federally financed supercomputer research centers
and their attempts to advance scientific computing.
</P>
<P>
   Computer research with such government backing has resulted in
some of the most significant new industries created since World War
II, including personal computing and the Internet. Almost all of
those advances came from basic exploratory research, rather than
research and development efforts aimed at solving specific
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although total federal spending for R &AMP; D has remained steady,
there has been a marked shift toward support for applied R &AMP; D,''
the report says.
</P>
<P>
   It also stresses the need for new emphasis on software research,
saying that the nation has become too dependent on outmoded
software, like systems long used by the Federal Aviation
Administration and the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FAA and IRS systems have proved to be amazingly difficult
to upgrade,'' the authors write, maintaining that while there have
been dramatic improvements in computer hardware in the last 40
years, the ability to develop software has not kept pace.
</P>
<P>
   The report also warns that federal funds for supercomputing have
largely collapsed since the breakup of the Soviet Union. The
authors argue that failing to support high-performance computing is
a national security risk that the nation cannot afford to take.
</P>
<P>
   In order to keep the United States leading in building the
world's fastest computers, the nation should set a goal of creating
machines capable of reaching the speed of a petaflop _ one thousand
trillion mathematical operations a second _ by the year 2010, the
report says. &QL;

   Turn-of-century shortstop inducted
</P>
<P>
   By I.J Rosenberg
</P>
<P>
   STAFF WRITER
</P>
<P>
   Cooperstown, N.Y. - Perhaps the strangest part of the Hall of
Fame ceremonies was when turn-of-the-century shortstop George Davis
was inducted.
</P>
<P>
   Davis had no family in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, according to the Hall of Fame research staff, Davis has
no family.
</P>
<P>
   So accepting his plaque was National League president Leonard
Coleman, who called baseball Davis' family.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Idelson, the public relations director for the Hall, said
``Usually people come out of the woodwork when a 19th century
person gets in.''
</P>
<P>
   But not for Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who collected 2,660 in a time known as the Dead Ball
Era,'' spent most of his career with the New York Giants and
Chicago White Stockings/White Sox. But after his retirement in
1909, he wasn't heard from much. According to the Albany
Union-Tribune which did an extensive story on his life, Davis, born
in the small town of Cohoes, N.Y., was married in 1918 and died in
1940 after spending six years in a mental hospital suffering from
syphilis. In fact, his wife had him buried in a $41 pine box and
there is no tombstone on his grave in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis will have a plaque hanging in the Hall, the 20th
shortstop to receive induction into Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   This time Braves look good
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year when the Braves did an embarrassing job
representing themselves for Phil Niekro's induction, they were here
in full force for Don Sutton. From Time-Warner management was Terry
McGuirk and from the front office was general manager John
Schuerholz and his assistant Dean Taylor. Also making the trip were
announcers Skip Carey, Joe Simpson, Pete Van Wiren and WSB radio
producer Dave Baker. Said Caray, ``I am not usually a company man
but it was awully nice of TBS and WSB to make this happen for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the grounds
</P>
<P>
   As has become a custom at the ceremonies, Stan Musial pulled his
harmonica and played ``Take Me Out To The Ballgame.'' ... One of
the best lines of the day came from writer Sam Lacy, who was
inducted. Lacy said he was going to thank everyone from ``his great
grandmother to his pet canary.'' ... In his first formal act as
permanent commissioner, Bud Selig read each of the inductee's
plaques. ... Larry Doby is the 18th center fielder to be inducted
while Lee MacPhail is only the second executive to get the call in
the last 15 years. ... Former Evander Holyfield trainer Lou Duva
was on hand for Doby, the two growing up in the same neighborhood
in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The 33 former Hall of Famers that returned for the ceremony were
Luis Aparcio, Yogi Berra, Lou Brock, Jim Bunning, Steve Carlton,
Bobby Dooer, Bob Feller, Rollie Fingers, Bob Gibson, Fergie
Jenkins, George Kell, Harmon Killebrew, Ralph Kiner, Sandy Koufax,
Tommy Lasorda, Bob Lemon, Al Lopez, Juan Marichal, Eddie Mathews,
Musial, Niekro, Gaylord Perry, Pee Wee Reese, Robin Roberts, Brooks
Robinson, Frank Robinson, Red Schoendienst, Tom Seaver, Enos
Slaughter, Warren Spahn, Earl Weaver, Hoyt Wilhelm and Billy
Williams.

TOUGH FIGHT IN SAN FERNANDO VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Another one is at it.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Valdez, an upstart boxing promoter from Oxnard, is the
latest to venture into the boxing abyss that is the San Fernando
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   He has a show scheduled for Aug. 29 at L.A. Fitness Center's
outdoor tennis arena on Canoga Avenue in the Warner Center. He
hopes it will evolve into a series of monthly cards during the warm
months and possibly regular shows after that.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck.
</P>
<P>
   So many have tried it before. So many have failed. It's an
incredibly tough sell. Only the most clever, persistent and wealthy
have a chance. And even they aren't likely to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough road to haul, that's for sure,'' said Don
Chargin, a longtime promoter in California.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Goossen, whose family started now-defunct Ten Goose Boxing,
was perhaps the most successful promoter in the Valley. His shows
at the Country Club featuring future champions Frankie Duarte,
Michael Nunn and Gabriel and Rafael Ruelas, drew reasonably large,
enthusiastic crowds to the Reseda venue. And even Ten Goose
struggled there.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Broudy staged entertaining cards at the Country Club and
Woodland Hills Marriott but also struggled. Former heavyweight
champion Gerrie Coetzee tried it at the same hotel, but he, too,
gave up.
</P>
<P>
   The most successful club cards are at the Irvine Marriott, which
will be doing its 150th show on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Englebrecht and Don Fraser were the first to promote boxing
in Orange County, 14 years ago, and have built and maintained a
loyal clientele since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about people getting into the business,''
Englebrecht said. ``A case in point: There was a promotion in Long
Beach a few weeks ago. It sold (a reported) 162 tickets. I have a
feeling that promoter lost fifty, sixty thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``...I wish anyone who wants to get into the business luck, but
in the same breath I say, `Don't do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The odds are stacked heavily against Valdez and others with the
gumption to try it.
</P>
<P>
   Unless a Mike Tyson or Oscar De La Hoya climbs through the
ropes, the typical sports fan isn't likely to attend a fight card.
It's the loyal regulars who keep club fights going. Of Irvine's
average attendance of roughly 800, 400 are season-ticket holders.
</P>
<P>
   And to keep the regulars, Englebrecht and Goossen agreed, it's
important to build young fighters who the fans want to see month
after month.
</P>
<P>
   It takes time _ and money _ to do all this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing is a word-of-mouth business,'' Englebrecht said. ``You
come to the first show, then you tell a friend and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have deep enough pockets to sustain losses (in
the beginning), you can't be in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdez, who promoted a show that drew only 328 fans in July of
last year in Oxnard, is a beginner. He said he's promoted four
shows the past two years and admits none has been a financial
success.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said he's learned from each experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has said they were dissatisfied with the actual
competition,'' said Valdez, who has yet to finalize a main event
for Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem is that we haven't been able to get a permanent
venue. I'm hoping this works out so we can do a regular series of
fights at the Warner Center.''
</P>
<P>
   The tennis arena, which seems to be a wonderful venue for
boxing, has about 1,500 permanent seats. Valdez said about 500
floor seats will be added, for a capacity of about 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Valdez said a realistic goal is 1,200 paid spectators, a figure
that would cause those in the business to roll their eyes. And how
does he expect to ring up such numbers when so many others
couldn't?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to criticize other promoters, but a lot has to do
with ticket prices and advertising,'' said Valdez, whose tickets
run from $20 to $100.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Valdez is optimistic and appears to be hustling
in an attempt to secure advertising and get the word out. However,
will it all be for naught?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing ever really surprises me,'' Goossen said. ``But it's
going to be very, very, very tough to do.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Rising star?: Trainer Freddie Roach believes he has a winner

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ At a time when the television networks are
ever more battered by viewer defections, with ratings this summer
hitting unexpected new lows, the need for exciting new shows to
bring the audience back has never been greater. But few broadcast
executives expect the new fall season to produce the comeback the
networks need.
</P>
<P>
   That was evident despite the annual two-week summer binge of
interviews and news conferences here promoting the networks' new
prime-time lineups. Indeed, one network executive in charge of
entertainment programming offered a candid assessment of this
fall's crop of weekly comedy and drama series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of the new shows this year is absolutely
horrible,'' the executive said, speaking on the condition of
anonymity in part because he pointedly included programs that he
had decided to put on the air. ``There is exactly one outstanding
pilot that got made, and that was on the WB'' network.
</P>
<P>
   That program is ``Felicity,'' a drama about the adventures of a
woman after college graduation that has won widespread praise.
</P>
<P>
   There was scattered support among television executives for
other new shows, but most came with reservations and the rest with
serious doubts.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the networks to generate much excitement for the
fall lineup, even among some of their executives, is increasingly
being attributed to a program-development system that many consider
antiquated and counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carter, the creator and executive producer of one of
television's biggest hits, ``The X-Files'' on Fox, said in an
interview that nothing less than a reinvention of the business was
needed, focusing specifically on the pilot system, that intense
three-month period in the spring when hundreds of program pilots _
essentially tryout shows _ are ordered, written, cast and filmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody seems to do business at the same time,'' Carter
said. ``You're competing against yourselves at those times of year
when we're all making pilots and we're all casting, and it becomes
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Fox is pushing for a system that would encourage
developing new programs year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, all the producing, writing and acting talent in
Hollywood is called to arms at once in a headlong dash toward the
May schedule announcements made to the advertising industry in New
York. The advertisers then check out these hastily _ and often
sloppily _ assembled shows and decide how much money to commit for
almost the entire nine-month season to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very dysfunctional system'' said Peter Roth, the
president of entertainment for Fox. ``We're all fighting for the
same talent pool. And the result, at a time when we can least
afford for it to happen, is lesser-quality fare.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Shukovsky, the former producer of ``Murphy Brown,'' noted
that casting directors were forced to fill pilots with actors they
are not totally satisfied with every spring because every network
is casting dozens of shows at the same time. ``We see the cost of
talent escalate from one week to the next because they've been on
five different auditions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the majority of the pilots are rejected and scores of
actors suddenly are out of work, Shukovsky said. The same goes for
writers.
</P>
<P>
   Roth _ who noted that this system generated just four hits out
of 61 new series introduced last fall _ is pushing Fox, and he
hopes the rest of the business, to reshape the program-development
system. He announced a plan for Fox to move toward what he called a
52-week development program, with three separate pilot seasons _
one that begins in June and goes to October; another between
November and February, and the third, traditional period from
February through April.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he was committed to making more pilots each year
and that he would keep shows in development year-round so that a
new crop of shows could go on the air in January, another between
April and August and a third in the traditional fall season
starting in September.
</P>
<P>
   One key to Roth's plan is to move much more original programming
into the summer months, which have increasingly become a pit of
disappearing ratings for the networks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several of Roth's competitors reacted to the announcement of
year-round program development first by agreeing that the spring
pilot crunch was a disaster and then by questioning the originality
of Roth's idea. Full-year development has been suggested before,
notably by Kim LeMasters when he headed CBS Entertainment more than
a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything revolutionary about what
they're trying to do,'' said Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS
Television.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed that the program makers ``want the system to change.''
But he added, ``About 80 percent of the money in television is
committed by advertisers during the upfront.''
</P>
<P>
   The so-called upfront buying season takes place in June when
advertisers buy the bulk of the commercials on network television
for the year. Despite the continuously declining shares of the
television audience, the broadcast networks have managed to keep
winning increases in advertisers' spending in recent upfront
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In June, however, the money committed to the four big networks
leveled off at about $6.1 billion, the same taken in a year earlier
_ a sign, many industry executives have said, that the networks may
begin to pay a much heavier price for going hitless.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Moonves said, ``Until they change the system, with the
schedule announcements coming on a certain date in May, I don't
know how you set up a system that's totally different.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth suggested that with the ground moving so rapidly under the
television business, even the upfront buying process might be
altered in the next few years. But before anything like that
happens, he said, he wants to ``change the mindset of the
producers'' by spreading development throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves said that this proposal was also not new and that all
networks had tried to put shows into production after the initial
pilot season.
</P>
<P>
   But Roth said there was one principal change he was bringing to
the development equation: ``I'm telling the studios: `We're not
looking for shows; we're buying.'''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of taking in money for shows throughout the course
of the year is already drawing response, Roth said. ``I've spoken
to every studio head,'' he said. ``They all say it will be
difficult to change the system, but nobody is saying, `Don't do
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   As one enticement, Roth said he was emphasizing to the studio
executives that writers and producers on their staffs, many of whom
are paid millions of dollars a year to create new series, might get
to develop more than just one project a year by putting more pilots
into development in the summer and in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling them, `You get more return for your investment
this way,''' Roth said. ``That they like.''

WELFARE ROLLS SHOW GROWING RACIAL AND URBAN IMBALANCE

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the welfare rolls continue to plunge, white
recipients are leaving the system much faster than black and
Hispanic recipients, pushing the minority share of the caseload to
the highest level on record.
</P>
<P>
   White, black and Hispanic recipients are all leaving welfare at
unprecedented rates. But the disproportionately large exodus of
whites has altered the racial balance in a program long rife with
racial conflict and stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of those stereotypes makes the discussion of race and
welfare an unusually sensitive one. In the past, advocates and
scholars have taken pains to note there were more white families on
welfare than blacks. But that is no longer the case.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks now outnumber whites. The Hispanic share of the rolls is
growing the fastest. And black and Hispanic recipients combined
outnumber whites by about 2-1. In addition, the remaining caseload
is increasingly concentrated in large cities.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts warn that the growing racial and urban imbalance
could erode political support for welfare, especially when times
turn tight. More immediately, the changing demographics suggest
that states may need new strategies as they serve those left
behind, like recipients who do not speak English.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the changing nature of the New York City caseload,
which is larger than that of every state but California. Since the
city's rolls peaked in March 1995, the number of whites on welfare
has fallen 57 percent. That is nearly twice the 30 percent rate of
decline for blacks. And it is nearly eight times the decline for
Hispanic recipients, which is just 7 percent, lagging the declines
for blacks and whites as it has nationwide. The city's welfare
rolls are now 5 percent white, 33 percent black and 59 percent
Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan _ most of the
states with large welfare populations like these have seen the
number of whites on welfare declining faster than those of
minorities. So have other states with marked caseload declines,
like Wisconsin, Massachusetts and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The growing minority domination of the rolls is new,
little-noticed and as yet largely unexplained. Most officials
reacted with surprise when presented with the figures, which were
compiled in an analysis of recent state data by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good grief!'' said Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., who served
as the primary author of the 1996 federal law that imposed time
limits and work requirements. ``That's definitely something we
should look at. We don't want to leave one or two ethnic groups
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stunned,'' said Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., who is among
the legislators most knowledgeable about the program. Matsui counts
himself among those who have fought ``a perception that welfare was
a minority program. We tried to show that wasn't the case.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of potential explanations for the changing
racial demographics. They include possible discrimination by
employers or by landlords in neighborhoods near jobs. In addition,
unpublished data from the Census Bureau, prepared for The New York
Times, suggest that minority recipients were significantly more
disadvantaged than their white counterparts when the rolls peaked
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   On average, they had less education, lower incomes and more
children. They were less likely to have ever been married, a
statistic that predicts lower rates of child support and lessened
chances of leaving the rolls through a subsequent marriage. Perhaps
most important, minority recipients were much more likely to live
in poor, central city neighborhoods, far from the job growth that
rings many cities.
</P>
<P>
   Race is intertwined with place. Only 31 percent of white welfare
families lived in central cities, the Census data showed. But 63
percent of Hispanic welfare families lived in those job-scarce
areas, as did 71 percent of blacks. This may also mean minorities
have faced less programmatic pressure to leave the rolls. Most
states instituted their tough new rules outside the big cities, in
regions with stronger economies and more responsive bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
   While the minority domination of the rolls could revive negative
stereotypes, it comes at a time of unusual goodwill toward
recipients of all races. With caseloads falling at a startling pace
_ for minorities as well as whites _ taxpayers seem well-satisfied
with the new ethos of time limits and work demands.
</P>
<P>
   Flush with federal funds, states are investing in a variety of
new employment services. And facing labor shortages, many
corporations are courting a welfare population they once took care
to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Citing that optimistic climate, some minority leaders say they
do not expect welfare programs to attract new racial hostility.
``If we had had this conversation six or seven years ago, it would
have been a real concern,'' said Dennis Archer, the mayor of
Detroit, who is black. But as jobs increase and poverty declines,
even in the inner cities, Archer said, a racial backlash is
unlikely. ``Even those insensitive to minorities aren't willing to
just turn their back and withdraw services just because of race,''
Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   Others were less sanguine. Rep. Donald Payne, D-N.J., warned
that the growing minority share of the rolls could erode support
for welfare spending and reinforce racial bias in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wedge-issue politicians always use welfare as an issue,'' said
Payne, who served as chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus
from 1994 to 1996. ``There's no question that stereotyping will
expand. Before, it was misinformation. It might even now go to
codify the stereotyping.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent national figures on welfare and race are 17
months old. They showed that the number of white families on
welfare had declined 25 percent since the rolls peaked in 1994. By
contrast, the number of blacks families fell 17 percent and that of
Hispanic families, 9 percent. But those differences appear to have
widened in recent months, as the caseload declines have
accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times surveyed 15 programs _ 14 states and New York
City _ which account for nearly 70 percent of the nation's welfare
population. Among them, only California had a sharper decline among
blacks than whites _ 40 percent for blacks versus 31 percent for
whites. The Hispanic decline in California was slower, 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In all other programs, the number of whites on welfare declined
faster than those of black or Hispanic recipients. And in more than
two-thirds of the programs studied, the white rate of decline
outpaced both the black and Hispanic rates by at least 10
percentage points. In Wisconsin, where the caseload declines have
been most dramatic, an astonishing 96 percent of white recipients
have left the rolls. (Black recipients declined 74 percent and
Hispanic recipients, 78 percent.)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The result is an added imbalance in a program that already had a
disproportionate share of minorities. By early 1997, blacks
accounted for 37 percent of the nation's welfare caseload, though
they are just 13 percent of the general population. Hispanics
accounted for 22 percent of the welfare rolls, though they
represent 11 percent of the general population. Whites, by
contrast, accounted for just 35 percent of the welfare rolls,
though they are 73 percent of the general population. That is the
smallest white percentage of the rolls since the federal government
began compiling annual figures in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   As the rolls grow more dominated by minorities, they are also
more concentrated in large cities. Detroit, Miami, St. Louis,
Cleveland, Baltimore, Milwaukee and Philadelphia all saw their
caseloads fall. But in each of those cities, the declines lagged
the state average.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, 48 percent of Pennsylvania's recipients now live in
Philadelphia, up from 38 percent four years ago. In Wisconsin,
virtually all the state's welfare recipients _ 85 percent _ now
live in Milwaukee, up from 39 percent a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the urban lag has not been universal. Atlanta, Boston, Los
Angeles and Bridgeport, Conn., have all cut their rolls at a pace
that matches the rest of their respective states. And the declines
in New York City, Chicago and Newark have lagged the state average
by only a small percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most striking trends is the growing Hispanic share of
the caseloads. As recently as 1983, Hispanic recipients accounted
for just 12 percent of the nation's caseload, about half their
current share. Some of that rise is due to the growing Hispanic
share of the general population, but Hispanic recipients have also
been leaving the welfare rolls at lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   There are several possible explanations. Hispanic recipients lag
blacks and whites in education levels and language skills. In
addition, they tend to have larger families than white recipients.
And some analysts suggest that Hispanic women face greater cultural
pressures to stay at home with their children.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the prevalence of language barriers, some advocates have
argued that Hispanic recipients need more training, especially in
basic language skills. ``I would view this as a wake-up call, that
the system is not working as it is supposed to,'' said Charles
Kamasaki, vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a
Hispanic civil rights group. ``We had actually predicted that there
would be a less smooth transition for Hispanics.''
</P>
<P>
   But most states have adopted a ``work first'' approach that
emphasizes immediate job placements. ``We don't recognize a
language barrier as something that should keep someone from working
in this economy,'' said Dick Powers, a spokesman for the
Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance.
``Non-English-speaking people have been coming to this country and
finding work for years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census data cast new light on the obstacles that minority
recipients face. The data are based on interviews with 5,400
welfare recipients in March 1994. One racial difference involves
education. Among Hispanic recipients, 64 percent lacked a high
school degree, as did 40 percent of the blacks. By contrast, only
33 percent of the white recipients lacked a high school degree. And
those differences may understate the actual disparities in skills,
since whites on average attend better schools than minorities.
</P>
<P>
   A second difference is that minority women are less likely to
get married. About 61 percent of the black women on welfare had
never been married. About 40 percent of the Hispanic women had
never been married and 31 percent of the whites.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are uncertain why black women marry at lower rates,
but economics may play a role. William Julius Wilson, a Harvard
sociologist, has argued that high rates of unemployment among black
men makes them less appealing as potential spouses. Shaw, the
Florida Republican, has proposed spending $2 billion over the next
five years to raise the employment and marriage rates of welfare
fathers.
</P>
<P>
   A third difference is that minority women have larger families.
Just 20 percent of white welfare recipients had more than two
children, the Census data show. But the figure for blacks and
Hispanics was nearly twice as high, 38 percent. Large families make
it harder to find child care and reduce the economic rewards of
working, since baby-sitting bills are higher.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth explanation focuses on geography. The Census data show
64 percent of black recipients lived in Census tracts where at
least a fifth of the population was poor. The figure for Hispanic
recipients was also very high, 55 percent. But for whites it was
just 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That not only suggests that black and Hispanic people live
farther from jobs. It may also mean they are less likely to have
accumulated the work experience that many employers prize. ``A lot
of the people who have been on the rolls for the longest period of
time have no one to vouch for them,'' said Bruce Katz, an expert on
central cities at the Brookings Institution, a Washington research
organization.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth disadvantage can be seen in the Census data. Minority
recipients started out poorer. About 74 percent of black and 72
percent of Hispanic recipients spent the entire year in poverty,
compared with 63 percent of whites. Given broader income trends, it
follows that white recipients may also find it easier to turn to
more prosperous relatives for help.
</P>
<P>
   Among the unknowns is whether the racial imbalance will grow or
diminish. ``The big question is whether this is who leaves first,
or who leaves ever,'' said Christopher Jencks, a Harvard
sociologist. Like some others, Jencks warns that ``the more black
and Hispanic the program becomes, the more political pressure there
is to cut back.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he notes, ``most people already thought that it was
all black and Hispanic. So it may not make as much difference as
you might at first think.''

   NEW YORK _ Calvin Coolidge once said that the business of
America is business. Along Madison Avenue late last week, the
business of the agency business was business, as in acquisitions
and start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent acquisition involved Leap Group in Chicago
and Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. in New York. Y&AMP;R will expand its presence
in the fast-growing field of ethnic marketing by agreeing to
acquire part of Leap's multicultural advertising operations,
including an agency bought by Leap only eight months ago. The
financial terms of the deal, which is expected to close in the
third quarter, were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick A. Smith, chairman and chief executive at Leap, said
that proceeds from the divestiture would provide capital to
``redirect our resources'' to operations devoted to interactive
advertising, which include Quantum Leap Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Leap had once been a Wall Street darling because of its Internet
interests, but red ink on quarterly earnings reports subsequently
dimmed its stature. Leap has recently reversed that skein of
losses, posting two consecutive profitable quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Under a letter of intent signed by the two agency companies, Y&AMP;R
will acquire operations of One World Communications, the Leap unit
specializing in multicultural marketing. One World was formed in
November when Leap bought Kang &AMP; Lee Advertising in Los Angeles and
New York, which creates campaigns aimed at Asian-Americans, and
combined it with YAR Communications, which produces
Spanish-language ads as well as ads for consumers from Eastern and
Western Europe and the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
   Y&AMP;R will acquire Kang &AMP; Lee and merge it with Mosaica, a Y&AMP;R
shop in New York devoted to Asian-American and ethnic advertising.
Eliot Kang, president and chief executive at Kang &AMP; Lee, is
expected to head the merged agency.
</P>
<P>
   Y&AMP;R will also acquire from One World additional multicultural
accounts like assignments for AT&AMP;T Corp.; Y&AMP;R already handles
duties for AT&AMP;T like corporate image and brand advertising. YAR
Communications, with offices in New York and San Francisco, is not
part of the deal and will still be owned by Leap.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is the first by Y&AMP;R since an initial public
offering of stock in May. It ``further establishes us as a leader
in the multicultural arena,'' said Edward Vick, chief operating
officer at Y&AMP;R, referring to Mosaica and Bravo Group in New York,
which specializes in Hispanic advertising.
</P>
<P>
   In another acquisition, Bozell Worldwide, part of True North
Communications, bought McDougall Associates Marketing, Advertising
and Public Relations in Boston, which becomes part of the Bozell
Kamstra unit of Bozell. Financial terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   McDougall has 40 employees and billings estimated at $44 million
from clients including Tyco International Ltd., to be added to the
160 employees of Bozell Kamstra in offices in Cleveland,
Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, and Austin, Texas, handling accounts with
billings estimated at $156 million for clients like Canon and Dow
Chemical.
</P>
<P>
   Dan McDougall, 61, president at McDougall, becomes senior vice
president and general manager of the Boston office of Bozell
Kamstra. His brother, Michael McDougall, 62, chairman at McDougall,
becomes senior partner. They both will report to Dean Buresh, the
president of Bozell Kamstra in Minneapolis.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As for the start-ups, one involved the Rapp Collins Worldwide
unit of Omnicom Group, which specializes in direct marketing. Rapp
Collins formed Acuity Health Group, a health-care consultancy in
New York that will work with pharmaceutical companies to create
advertising to help market prescription drugs directly to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Acuity will be based in the Rapp Collins office and share
resources of the Diversified Agency Services division of Omnicom.
Rob Dhoble, 37, was named president and chief operating officer at
Acuity. He had been executive vice president and chief operating
officer at Torre Lazur Health Care Group in Parsippany, N.J., part
of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of Interpublic Group of
Cos.
</P>
<P>
   Another start-up involved four executives with backgrounds in
advertising, management consulting and cultural anthropology. They
have teamed up to open If, a company in Portland, Ore., that will
enter the growing field of brand consulting.
</P>
<P>
   The four executives have all been named partners at If. One is
Christine Densmore, 29, who had been strategic planning director at
Youth Intelligence in New York. A second is Maggie Konner, 33, who
had been planning and research director at the Sapient Health
Network in Portland, Ore., and a consultant at Booz-Allen &AMP;
Hamilton in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   A third partner at If is Joannides Lanahan, 34, who ran her own
strategy and research company in Portland, RJ Consulting, and held
various posts at the offices of Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in Portland and
Amsterdam, the Netherlands. A fourth is Kathleen Spraitz, 35, who
had been general manager and account services director at Fallon
McElligott Berlin in New York and a group director at Fallon
McElligott in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the origin of the name If, Ms. Konner said it
symbolized the fact that ``too often we get caught up in the
answers _ we need to take a step back and ask the right
questions.''

JAPAN'S LEADER-TO-BE PROMISES TAX, BANKING REFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, the Philippines _ The man almost certain to be Japan's
next prime minister pledged to U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on Sunday that he would revive Japan's stagnant economy
through large tax cuts and banking changes, senior Clinton
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An American official said that the most likely choice for prime
minister, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, ``went out of his way to
express his determination to implement these reforms, even saying
that _ although he has a reputation for not necessarily being
decisive _ he would do whatever it took to make the economy work.''
</P>
<P>
   The official quoted Obuchi as having told Albright: ``I can and
I will act. I will act promptly.''
</P>
<P>
   The American officials said Obuchi had told Albright that he
would live up to his campaign promise to cut taxes by $43 billion
and to spend $71 billion on a package of measures to stimulate the
economy. Obuchi was elected on Friday as president of the governing
Liberal Democratic Party, a post that virtually guarantees that he
will become prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went out of his way to say he would be very decisive and
dynamic in dealing with the economic problems,'' a senior
administration official said after a meeting between Obuchi and
Albright. They were in the Philippines to attend a meeting of
foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and
other countries with interests in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials who are traveling with Albright, all of
whom insisted on anonymity, said they were relieved by what they
described as Obuchi's confident, take-charge tone in the meeting
and by the early details of his plan for dealing with Japan's worst
financial crisis in decades. It was Obuchi's first meeting with a
high-level American official since his election as party leader.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi has no record of bold political leadership, and there is
concern in Tokyo and Washington that the 61-year-old foreign
minister might backtrack on the campaign promises to maintain
consensus in the Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi would replace Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who
resigned after a crushing defeat for the party in Upper House
parliamentary elections this month. The electoral rout was largely
ascribed to his failure to revive the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no evidence of any backtracking, reductions, scaling
back,'' the senior American official said of Obuchi. ``He's several
times indicated his determination to revitalize _ that's the word
he used _ the Japanese economy.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials said Obuchi had offered figures for the scope
of the recovery plan, six trillion yen in tax cuts, or $43 billion,
and 10 trillion yen for an economic stimulus package, or $71
billion. Those sums were virtually identical to those offered in
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The American officials said there was no need for Albright to
offer a detailed warning to Obuchi about the dangers of a delay in
carrying out the sweeping changes of Japan's economy, the second
largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spoke first and he basically laid out a fairly
comprehensive agenda and said he was going to move on it very
quickly,'' an administration official said. ``It wasn't necessary
for her to give him a long laundry list. But she, of course,
emphasized the importance for all of Asia that Japanese economic
recovery take place expeditiously.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials said Obuchi had made it clear that he was
well aware, perhaps painfully, of his reputation among Japanese
voters as a timid politician who had moved inconspicuously up the
ladder of power and was unfit to be prime minister. He seemed
eager, the Americans said, to put an end to that perception.
</P>
<P>
   An American official said that in the meeting Sunday, Obuchi
reminded Albright that he had been accused of having the leadership
style of cold pizza. The description led the foreign minister to
provide Japanese reporters staked out at his house in the election
battle last week with boxes of warm pizza.
</P>
<P>
   In congratulating Obuchi on Sunday on his victory, the official
said, Albright assured him ``that she likes cold pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   The Asian economic crisis is widely expected to dominate the
meeting this week of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
Albright will have a series of one-on-one meetings with her
counterparts, including Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan of China and
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that in the wake of President
Clinton's visit to China last month Albright would press Tang to
step up the release of imprisoned political dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be an opportunity to remind them of our
expectations,'' an American official said. &QL;

Sutton's agenda never was hidden
<TEXT>
<P>
   BY MICKEY HERSKOWITZ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL; 
Nolan Ryan never will forget the first game he pitched in a Houston
uniform, in front of his neighbors and home folks. The date, April
12, 1980, is remembered not because he pitched well _ he lasted six
innings against the Dodgers and had no decision _ but because he
batted well.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan hit the first home run of his major-league career, a
three-run smash off an unfortunate fellow named Don Sutton. The
confidence of Sutton was so shaken he left Los Angeles and moved to
Houston to be near Ryan, hoping to learn from him the secret of
longevity.
</P>
<P>
   They were teammates for not quite two seasons, but Sutton, with
his Harpo Marx hair and his slashing wit, made a permanent
impression on Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the first pitcher I had ever met,'' said the rancher
from Alvin, ``who had set as his goal winning 300 games. Me, my
goal was to pitch four years and qualify for the pension plan.''
</P>
<P>
   These memories came trickling back to us Sunday as Sutton was
inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame, in a class that included
Larry Doby. Don earned his admission after a career that spanned
23''SJsons and 324 victories _ the exact number won by Ryan. They
share 12th place on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   If that isn't a sweet coincidence, what in the world is? No two
pitchers, no two people, were less alike. Ryan was all power and
in-your-face. No tricks. Sutton was guile and up-your-sleeve. A man
of illusion.
</P>
<P>
   The strikeout king will join his old chum next year, Ryan's
first year of eligibility. Is Cooperstown big enough? We will tr &UR; E
1 that thought later. This is the time of Don Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   He seldom was what he appeared to be. It was fun to listen to
Sutton, although sometimes one person could not do it alone. This
is true today, in his role as a broadcaster for the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   He could win with four pitches, but he didn't have a great
anything. In p~D%9Ustry where 20 is a magic number, he won that
many games only once. But he rarely missed a start. Don had another
edge. He knew himself so well it was like being his own therapist.
He might con a batter or a teammate, but he never deceived himself.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to be typecast, even in Los Angeles, where
typecasting is an art form. As his managers were quick to discover,
Sutton was never one of those trained pigs who would roll around in
the slop for you. He was glib, quick and California smooth _
although he came off a farm in Alabama. There was no hay in his
hair.
</P>
<P>
   When he joined the Astros in 1981, his hair had been permed. He
had tight, golden-brown curls with a little gray creeping up the
sides. He did it because he had figured out how many minutes he
would save by not having to comb or brush his hair every morning.
</P>
<P>
   There were contradictions in Sutton's nature. He was one of the
first players the media sought out and his instincts in this area
were sharp. He seemed to know exactly what he wanted to say, but he
could be dangerously undiplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   When Walter Alston retired after his long run as the manager of
the Dodgers, Sutton was asked if there was anyone he wanted to see
get the job. Yes, there was. Jeff Torborg, a former catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the position went to Tommy Lasorda and Don had a fairly
vivid reminder of why the secret ballot is so popular. His
encounters with Lasorda were few, but tended to be loud and
colorful.
</P>
<P>
   Once, after he had been yanked from a game in Pittsburgh with a
1-0 lead in the fifth inning, he tore up the clubhouse and
muttered, ``If I was one of Lasorda's bobos, this would never
happen.'' His words got back to the manager, but Sutton thought he
had been wronged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said it to the trash can,'' he explained, ``while I flung my
uniform at it.'' (If only that trash can could talk.)
</P>
<P>
   Don needed time to adjust to Lasorda's style, but they became
friends and Tommy brought him back to the Dodgers to end his
career. He served with four other clubs, but you knew where his
heart was. It was said he had a love-hate relationship with the
fans in LA. The fans loved Sutton; they simply loved him less than
Sandy Koufax or Don Drysdale, whose records he broke.
</P>
<P>
   In his rookie year, Drysdale would take him aside and go over
the hitters. Even better, he told him what to wear and how much to
tip. On his first road trip, Sutton remembers eating alone in the
hotel dining room. On two occasions, the waitress leaned over and
said, ``Your check has been taken care of,'' and she pointed once
to Drysdale and another time to Koufax.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton was shrewd. When rivals accused him of using sandpaper on
the ball, he let it work for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this keeps up,'' he said, ``I might get a Black &AMP; Decker
commercial out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he gained much more. He won a spot on forever's
team.

   PREKAZ, Yugoslavia _ In the biggest offensive of the conflict in
the Serbian province of Kosovo, Yugoslav army and paramilitary
police units have attacked rebel positions across the province,
apparently trying to free large sections of major roads that have
been under rebel control for months.
</P>
<P>
   In some places the rebels, ethnic Albanians who call themselves
the Kosovo Liberation Army, are reported to be resisting. But
generally, government forces are reported to be clearing roadblocks
and advancing.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of refugees from the last six months of
fighting are now in a rebel-controlled area, with combat taking
place on several sides. Relief workers say the refugees may be in
danger if the government troops continue to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   Where government forces will stop was a matter of intense
diplomatic speculation and concern Sunday because it was feared
that the government would renege on commitments to limit military
actions while diplomats try to arrange for negotiations between the
government and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago NATO threatened to use force against Yugoslavia
because Western governments said the Yugoslav forces had behaved so
brutally against civilians during a crackdown on the rebels that
they were enhancing the rebels' standing.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia, the larger of the two republics that make up Yugoslavia,
has rescinded the autonomy once enjoyed by the province, 90 percent
of whose residents are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on civilian casualties now,'' said a European
diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``You can't really
blame a government for wanting to reclaim its main roads, and if
that's all that happens, well, no one will say much. But if they
start killing a lot of civilians, then that's going to be a problem
for us and for the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said the fighting was on roads leading from
the provincial capital, Pristina, to the cities of Pec and Prizren,
and on the road from Mitrovica to Srbica as well as the road to
Decani.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon Sunday the military action in the villages of
Srednja Klina and Gornja Klina, near Srbica, left two elderly
people shot to death and two more wounded, one by a sniper and the
rest from the shelling, villagers said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the houses and cottages from which the villagers had
fled were being blown up one at a time by soldiers in tanks. The
turrets swiveled in a leisurely way from target to target, giving
gunners time to reload casually and shoot.
</P>
<P>
   The attack began on Saturday, villagers said, when soldiers and
police officers arrived suddenly. ``Our watchmen warned us the
tanks were coming, but there was no time,'' said a resident who
would not give his name. ``Then soldiers were lighting the
haystacks on fire, and the people were in panic. Most of us ran
away, some up this mountain and some up the other one.''
</P>
<P>
   No resistance was evident. The guerrillas, outgunned, withdrew
to safety on the back slope of a mountain overlooking what amounted
to target practice on people's homes.
</P>
<P>
   Sweating as he tried to get up the last stretch of the mountain
so he could look down on his village with the rebels, Hajzer
Jashari said: ``We had to leave my mother down there when we ran.
She's old. Maybe they will kill her.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jashari is a lawyer who works in a nearby town. The threads of
his life have been twisted in the same way as those of many ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo. Like them, he has gone from being a citizen of
Yugoslavia to considering himself a citizen of something called the
Republic of Kosovo, which the government and the West say cannot be
allowed to secede.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yugoslavia was my country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was part of it; I was in the army,'' he added, as tanks of
that same army fired a shell into his village about every 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good country,'' he went on. ``All right, Albanians in
Yugoslavia did not have the same rights as Serbs, but we thought we
had a future.'' He crouched down in a tire rut alongside a hill
that gave minimal protection from snipers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when Milosevic came to power, it was clear that this would
be a place for Serbs only. He told them to support him and he would
protect their interests.'' Jashari referred to President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia, who built his power base as the leader of
Serbia, whose presidency he assumed in 1990. ``Since then, there is
no place for us here. Now, we will make a country for Albanians
here, and we have decided to fight until we get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Western countries have criticized Milosevic for policies that
they contend systematically deny ethnic Albanians their civil
rights, but the West insists that the Albanians negotiate some kind
of autonomy within Serbia. For their part, most of the Albanians in
the province appear to want nothing less than an independent
country.
</P>
<P>
   Under a walnut tree, away from the sniper fire from the new
government positions in the valley, a group of men were sitting at
midday Sunday, some on the patches of browning grass, others on
brightly colored foam mats brought from home.
</P>
<P>
   It was the clan conference that ethnic Albanians call in times
of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Adult males from this village and a few from the villages just
taken by the government were consoling one another and the family
members of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Voices were quiet. There was discussion, but no appearance of
dispute, because it seemed that the big question _ what to do next
_ has been long resolved. The said they would take the reversal in
stride and continue to fight.
</P>
<P>
   To the traditional leaders at conferences like this, one more
category has been added these days.
</P>
<P>
   The clan elder, in a dark suit and a vest from which a keychain
was suspended, had the place of honor. Next to him was one of the
best-educated men, an economist, whose learning gave him stature
here. But also in the front rank was a man with a thick red beard,
in camouflage uniform. As this clan and others in Kosovo discuss
how to proceed, the counsel of warriors has become as important as
that of the wise and the educated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs may want to take the roads back, but they will
massacre people to do it,'' said Ferat Imeri, the economist. ``That
is the essence of the Serb tactics. They kill and then they talk
and then they kill again. It was the same in Bosnia, but in Kosovo
we will fight until we win.''

 &HT;    Spectacular Gordon takes Pennsylvania 500
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG POND, Pa. _ Jeff Gordon is never bad, but he's never been
better than he was Sunday, dominating the field by leading 164 of
the 200 laps on the way to winning the Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono
Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was Gordon's fifth of the year, 34th in his career
and third at Pocono, increasing his Winston Cup points lead to 62
over race runnerup Mark Martin.
</P>
<P>
   There were five cautions for 25 laps, the most lengthy caused
when pole sitter Ward Burton was caught in the middle of a close
encounter of Chad Little and Dale Earnhardt. Burton crashed, Little
and Earnhardt drove on.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon had no close calls of that sort.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to savour this one,'' said Gordon, who was pestered
early and often by Dale Earnhardt. ''Dale made it interesting, like
I expected he would. It got pretty close there a couple of times,
but we were able to bring it back to Victory Lane, and that's what
it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Gordon broke away from the pack, led by Earnhardt and
reinforced by Martin and the Burton's - Jeff and Ward, he had a
clean track for 74 laps.
</P>
<P>
   Then Dave Marcis hit the wall, bringing out a caution, bunching
up the field.
</P>
<P>
   Again Gordon was forced to play tag with Earnhardt, and again
got away with it.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point for Gordon came following the day's third
caution on lap 164, caused when Bill Elliott blew a tire, leaving
debris in his wake on the way top pit road.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no game of tag this time. Gordon's crew chief,
Ray Evernham, bypassed a four tire change for only two. That got
Gordon out first, just ahead of Martin, giving him a two second
lead and eventual 1.153 second victory over Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know where that 24 bunch has found all that
horsepower,'' Martin said. '' But, man, do they have the straight
away speed. They were the class of the field today. We couldn't
contend with them, so I'm pleased to run second. When I got in
front of Jeff that one time, I was totally in his way. I couldn't
get out of his way fast enough.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   KADUNA, Nigeria _ As book publication parties go, it was a
singular occasion _ held in a soccer stadium, attended by several
former heads of state, backed by the army's top brass, and
amounting to perhaps the first act in the looming battle for
political control of Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nigerian army has contributed one million naira!'' a guest
speaker from the northern city of Kano boomed. He did not specify
how many copies of the book the army would receive for this sum of
about $125,000, but he continued on to announce payments from the
inspector-general of police, and from the air force, the military
governor of the northern Kaduna state and, not least, the Kaduna
Polo Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the head of state,'' the speaker said, referring to
Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, Nigeria's recently installed military
ruler, ``we will not, out of respect, announce the size of his
contribution.'' In all, more than $1 million was raised.
</P>
<P>
   The book, published by a Kaduna company, is a biography of Gen.
Hassan Katsina, a former military governor of the northern region
of Nigeria. But that was scarcely the point. For this was clearly a
show of force by the northern Muslim elite of military officers,
traditional rulers or emirs, and businessmen whose coalition has
retained control of Nigeria for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gen. Abubakar has said the military government will no longer
fund political parties, but he said nothing about funding a book,''
a Western diplomat present in the stadium said. ``What you have
here is a political project built around a book.''
</P>
<P>
   The precise form of that project is as yet unclear, but it seems
certain to involve the formation of a northern, conservative
political party, close to the armed forces. The man described as
the ``chief launcher'' of the book was Aminu Dantata, the director
of a powerful northern group of companies, and the ``chief
sponsor'' was the former military ruler, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida.
</P>
<P>
   Among the others present were other former northern military
rulers, including Maj. Gen. Mohammed Buhari _ who seized power in
1983 and was deposed by Babangida in a coup in 1985, and Gen.
Yakubu Gowon, who seized power in 1966 and ceded it in a coup in
1975.
</P>
<P>
   It is from this coalition, often referred to as ``the Kaduna
mafia,'' that southern Nigerians are determined to wrest power in
presidential elections now set for next year.
</P>
<P>
   They thought they had done so in the 1993 presidential election,
with the apparent victory of the late Moshood Abiola, a man of the
Yoruba people of the south. But Babangida annulled the vote,
sharpening the north-south divide that has plagued Nigeria since
independence in 1960. Abiola died in detention this month.
</P>
<P>
   The area known as northern Nigeria, but embracing much of the
center of the country, is ethnically mixed. But it has been largely
united by its Hausa language, its overwhelmingly Muslim character,
and its fear of ceding political control to the mainly Christian
south. It is in the south that economic and commercial power _
essentially the country's oil _ are concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office last month, after the unexpected death of
Gen. Sani Abacha, Abubakar has been at pains not to fan these
divisions. He has appointed Yoruba officers to the key military
posts, and he has promised to hand power to a civilian on May 29
next year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although he was billed as the star speaker in the stadium,
Abubakar did not attend, apparently out of concern that he might
polarize the country further by identifying too closely with the
northern military elite from which he has emerged. But his
financial contribution made his sympathies clear enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have here is a group of conservative people who
regard power as their heritage,'' said Bashir Ikara, a Kaduna-based
political scientist. ``But the fact is that ordinary northerners
have nothing to show for this long domination and are simply
clamoring, like the rest of the country, for honest government.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the domination by a northern elite of military men
and the emirs appears to have perpetuated elements of the old
colonial system. Kaduna, home to Nigeria's military academy, was
founded by Frederick Lugard, the British governor general who
created Nigeria in 1914 and who favored the north because it was
less unruly and more conservative than the south.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bastions of northern society joined forces with the
British to plunder our resources,'' Ikara said. ``Then the Nigerian
armed forces replaced British soldiers. But elements of the system
_ and the plundering _ have continued.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord Lugard once described the people of the southern city of
Lagos as ``the most seditious and disloyal, the most purely
prompted by self-seeking money motives of any people I have met.''
In Kaduna, the regional assembly meets in a building still known as
``Lugard House,'' and the polo club _ Nigeria's best _ and the
rugby club are situated on Waff Road _ named after Britain's former
West African Frontier Force.
</P>
<P>
   Many Yoruba seem determined to overcome this legacy, referring
in Lagos newspapers to the ``internal colonialism'' to which they
see themselves subjugated. But, as the turnout at the meeting in
Kaduna showed, the battle to shift Nigeria's political gravity
promises to be a bitter one.

 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In February 1989, the last Soviet troops wearily
crossed the Amu Darya River bridge out of Afghanistan, a defeated
army walking home to an empire on the verge of disintegration.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly a decade later, the Russians are back, secretly
engaged in the new Afghan war, according to U.S. and foreign
officials.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, the Russians are after oil, as well as
protection of their borders. In what senior U.S. officials believe
may be part of a larger Russian strategy to reassert influence over
Central Asia and its vast oil reserves, Moscow has begun to play a
major supporting role on the side of a rebel coalition fighting a
civil war against the Taliban, the militant Islamic group that
controls most of the country.
</P>
<P>
   While it has not committed troops to a country where at least
13,000 of its soldiers died during a nine-year occupation, Russia
is supplying heavy weapons, training and logistical support to the
Northern Alliance, the rebel group that is hanging on to the
mountainous northern tier of Afghanistan. The Russians find
themselves in loose collaboration with Iran in countering the
growing power of the Taliban. U.S. officials and other experts say
Iran is now supplying even more arms, fuel and other resources to
the anti-Taliban rebels than is Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Squared off against Russia and Iran in this post-Cold-War
confrontation are Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, both of which are
backing the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   And in a land of constantly shifting and often murderous
alliances, the Russians are supporting rebel factions controlled by
former leaders of the Afghan mujahedeen, the Islamic guerrillas who
fought the Soviet Army in the 1980s with the backing of the CIA. A
prime beneficiary of Russian support is the rebel group led by
Ahmad Shah Massoud, who was once one of the most aggressive and
effective mujahedeen figures in the CIA's covert program against
the Soviets in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of the situation has not been lost on Massoud's
one-time U.S. backers. ``Massoud was the pointed end of the stick,
the man we went to when we really wanted something done against the
Russians,'' a U.S. intelligence official said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the Russians move back into Afghanistan, the United
States' role in the country seems to be diminishing. The United
States, which took such an intense interest in Afghanistan in the
1980s when the Reagan administration viewed it as a crucial
Cold-War battleground, is only a marginal player in the country
today, overshadowed by the more direct involvement of U.S. oil
companies, according to independent experts and officials from
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration supports neither side in the war. It
has harshly criticized the Taliban for its militant policies,
especially its treatment of women, and refuses to recognize it as
the government of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's involvement has been limited to support for
international negotiations to end the war, which has intensified
since the Taliban captured Kabul, the capital, in 1996. In May,
Bill Richardson, then U.S. representative to the United Nations,
visited Afghanistan to try to jump-start the peace talks. Yet
Western analysts say the United States has not made an aggressive
effort to curb foreign intervention.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official disagreed, saying the issue had been
raised during U.S. efforts to mediate a peace accord. ``We have
been very clear that arms shipments must stop,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has decided to develop a broad, strategic relationship
with Iran, partly because of their overlapping oil interests in
Central Asia, U.S. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the Afghan rebels serves Iranian and Russian
economic and political interests. The Northern Alliance acts as a
buffer between the Taliban and the Afghan border with the former
Soviet republics, while the continuation of civil war in the
country prevents Western oil companies from building pipelines
across Afghan territory.
</P>
<P>
   Both Russia and Iran fear the potential spread of the radicalism
of the Taliban. Moscow wants to insure that Islamic fundamentalism
does not spill into the former Soviet republics to the north, while
the ruling Shiite Muslims of Iran see the Sunni Muslims of the
Taliban as bitter rivals. ``The Russians and the Iranians are very
concerned by the possibility of victory by the Taliban,'' a State
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Russia and Iran would like to influence how
the oil and gas riches of the Caspian Sea region are channeled and
exploited. In fact, U.S. officials believe that Russia has decided
it must curb the influence of the United States and of U.S. oil
companies in the Caspian oil basin.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials also say they believe Iran and Russia want to
insure that many of the planned Caspian oil pipelines traverse
Iranian or Russian territory. As a result, the Iranians, and to a
lesser extent the Russians, have an incentive to block efforts to
build pipelines across Afghanistan to the Indian subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
   With peace talks stalled and the two sides gearing up for more
war, frustrated executives from Western oil companies appear to be
playing a more active role as mediators than the Clinton
administration is. Unocal Corp., which leads a consortium that
hopes to build a pipeline to transport natural gas and oil from
Turkmenistan through Afghanistan to Pakistan, is financing a
University of Nebraska program to train Afghan workers and teachers
in regions controlled by both sides, and has paid for Taliban
members to visit the United States. Bridas Corp., an Argentine
company that is a Unocal rival and has its own plans for an Afghan
pipeline, also has representatives in the country trying to
cultivate both Northern Alliance and Taliban leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet both Unocal and Bridas executives have said they cannot
proceed until the fighting ends and an internationally recognized
government is established.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow denies that it is arming the Afghan rebels, and Massoud
has said in interviews that he receives much of his equipment from
the Russian mafia, not the Russian government. U.S. officials
believe the rebels do acquire equipment on the international arms
market, but are still convinced that both the Russian and Iranian
governments are directly involved.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials say both the Northern Alliance and
the Taliban now field such impressive arsenals that they could not
acquire, maintain and operate them without foreign assistance. Both
sides have hundreds of T-54 and T-62 Russian-designed tanks, along
with towed artillery, multiple-rocket launchers and MIG-21 and
SU-17 fighter aircraft, according to U.S. intelligence estimates.
</P>
<P>
   While the abundance of surplus weaponry left over from the
Soviet-supplied Afghan army is being used by both the rebels and
the Taliban, the demands for spare parts, regular maintenance and
training have forced the two sides to seek outside support.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials and others say Masood's rebel faction, perhaps
the most formidable single group opposing the Taliban, now has a
major supply center at an air base in neighboring Tajikistan, a
former Soviet republic where some 20,000 Russian troops are
stationed and where Moscow retains enormous influence.
</P>
<P>
   From the air base, which they said was in Kulob, weapons and
other supplies are airlifted into Massoud's forces in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russia and Uzbekistan, another former Soviet
republic, are supporting a rebel group led by Abdul Rashid Dostum,
a former Afghan army general who has switched sides several times
in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military instructors are also said to be working with
the rebels, and one U.S. official said Iranian personnel are also
on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   A former Russian intelligence officer said in an interview that
Russia's intelligence services are also playing a covert role in
Afghanistan on behalf of the rebels. The former officer, who has
defected to the United States and has been resettled by the CIA,
said Russia's foreign intelligence arm and the military
intelligence service have operatives working in northern
Afghanistan with Masood and Dostum. The military intelligence
service is responsible for at least some of the clandestine
shipments to the rebels, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Massoud was one of the bitterest enemies of the Soviet Union,
but the situation is now very clear,'' the Russian said. ``He is
the lesser of two evils. The real fear of Moscow is that the fall
of the Northern Alliance would boost fundamentalism into Central
Asia and even into Russia itself.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing support to Masood, Iran is also
providing weapons, equipment and fuel to a Shiite Muslim rebel
faction known as the Hezb-I-Wahdat, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iranians have an ideological commitment to the Shias, but
their broader strategic goal is to support anybody but the
Taliban,'' said Barnett Rubin, an Afghan expert at the Council on
Foreign Relations in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin and other Western analysts believe the Iranian and Russian
support for the Northern Alliance was prompted by the backing given
to the Taliban by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, with its base among the Pathans, Afghanistan's
majority ethnic group, wase formed in 1994 in rural southern
Afghanistan. The Taliban finally took Kabul in September 1996,
ousting the Massoud forces and the government of Burhanuddin
Rabbani, part of the guerrilla coalition that had ousted the
Soviet-backed government in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani and Saudi support have been crucial to the Taliban's
success. U.S. officials say Pakistan is providing arms and other
military assistance, while the Saudis have offered fuel and
financial backing. In one recent sign of Saudi support, Prince
Turki al-Faisal, the chief of Saudi Arabia's intelligence service,
visited Afghanistan for talks with the Taliban, according to
Taliban officials.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy commitment by their foreign sponsors has led to a
military stalemate between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance,
especially in the last year, during which the Taliban have been
unable to dislodge the rebels from their northern strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flow of arms, money and other supplies into Afghanistan
from outside has continued unabated,'' a new U.N. report on the
situation states. U.N. officials, the report adds, have evidence of
large arms shipments to both sides. The officials have witnessed
air deliveries of weapons and ammunition by unmarked aircraft to
the northern alliance, which are arriving at a rate of at least
four to five a week.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, the U.N. report said the Taliban were getting
foreign arms shipments that include the delivery of tanks and
armored personnel carriers. A 200-truck convoy of military
equipment recently arrived for Taliban forces, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials in Afghanistan also reported seeing foreign
military advisers aiding both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the Afghans still see that the solution to
their problems come from fighting,'' said a U.S. official.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress prepared Sunday to pay tribute to two
slain police officers with an honor usually reserved for former
presidents and heroes of grand military campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The flag-draped caskets of the two officers, Detective John M.
Gibson and Officer Jacob J. Chestnut, will be displayed in the
Capitol Rotunda on Tuesday, and the public will be allowed to pay
its respects.
</P>
<P>
   Only 26 times before has Congress conferred such an honor. The
names of the officers killed in a shootout on Friday will join a
short list that includes Lincoln, MacArthur, Eisenhower and
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The tribute underscores the dramatic evolution of the U.S.
Capitol Police from its early days as a two-man constabulary,
through its period as a patronage force of the political party in
power in the 1960s, to today's professional unit, 1,295 strong,
that is trained alongside FBI agents and other elite
law-enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been here, but now we've been noticed,'' said one
11-year Capitol Police veteran, who asked not to be identified, her
badge banded in black in mourning for the first Capitol police
officers to die in the line of duty. Another officer died in a
training accident in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders said they planned to pass a resolution in the
next few days commending Chestnut and Gibson, hailed as heroes for
shielding congressional aides and scores of tourists imperiled by
the revolver-wielding suspect, Russell Eugene Weston Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has created a memorial fund for the slain officers'
families. Donations can be sent to U.S. Capitol Police Memorial
Fund, Washington, D.C. 20515.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and the leaders of the
House and Senate are to attend the memorial service Tuesday in the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of the Capitol Police, Gary Abrecht, said Sunday that
the funeral for Gibson, 42, will be held Thursday in Lake Ridge,
Va. Services for Chestnut, 58, will be held Friday in Fort
Washington, Md., and he will be buried at Arlington National
Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were well-known among the lawmakers, aides, police,
staff and other workers on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, an 18-year veteran, was a plainclothes agent assigned to
guard Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the third-ranking Republican in the
House leadership. Gibson was killed after exchanging point-blank
fire with the gunman, who burst into DeLay's suite of offices.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, a Massachusetts native who lived in Woodbridge, Va.,
married the niece of Rep. Joseph Moakley, D-Mass. He had three
children, a 17-year-old daughter and two boys, ages 15 and 14.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson was known around his neighborhood as a handyman, and was
often doing projects or helping others with them. Last summer, he
built a patio behind his house, but he ordered too much gravel for
the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a big huge load of gravel dumped at his house, but he
ordered too much, so he supplied just about the whole
neighborhood,'' said one neighbor, Kevin Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Quick with a joke and a hearty hello to colleagues, Gibson was
an ardent Boston sports fan. Aides said he would make a beeline for
the newspapers each morning to scan the box scores for the fate of
his beloved Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut, also an 18-year veteran, had two children from his
current marriage, and three others from a previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-year Air Force veteran who served in Vietnam, Chestnut
brought a blend of military bearing and down-home friendliness to
monitoring the Document Door entrance to the Capitol, through which
thousands of tourists, lawmakers and aides stream each day. With no
warning, Weston allegedly shot Chestnut in the head as the officer
helped two tourists.
</P>
<P>
   J.J., as colleagues called Chestnut, ``loved his job,'' said
Officer Danny McElroy, a nine-year veteran. ``He went by the book
and led by example.''
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut was known to his neighbors in Fort Washington, Md., as
a gardener who generously shared his latest crop of cucumbers or
Chinese cabbage and was active in his civic association.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and neighbors said Chestnut, who met his wife,
Wenling, in Taiwan in 1974 while stationed there with the Air
Force, was planning to retire as early as this fall. ``He loved to
play golf and he was looking forward to traveling,'' said one
neighbor, Jerome Goldring.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut and Gibson belonged to a force that President John
Quincy Adams established in 1827, reportedly after his son was
assaulted in the Capitol by a journalist.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Creating a powerful new player in the fast-growing market for
global communications, AT&AMP;T Corp. and British Telecommunications
PLC announced a deal Sunday to merge most of their international
operations into a jointly owned company that would have $10 billion
in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance between AT&AMP;T, the United States' largest
communications company, and British Telecom, Britain's leading
communications provider, is a stark demonstration that even the
brawniest communications giants no longer feel big enough to take
on the global marketplace on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said the new venture would focus on serving
multinational corporations and aim to let workers in New York
communicate as easily with computer systems in New Delhi, say, as
with colleagues in New Jersey. The new venture is the latest in a
frenzied spate of industry deal-making as communications companies
compete to meet the business world's growing demand for advanced
data networks that can seamlessly connect far-flung offices.
</P>
<P>
   Both AT&AMP;T and British Telecom have tried in recent years to
expand their presence outside their home markets, and each has
stumbled in creating strong partnerships overseas. But in agreeing
to actually transfer assets and customers to the new company
instead of signing a vague marketing pact, AT&AMP;T on Sunday made its
biggest commitment yet to a comprehensive global strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about following our customers into a world that is
opening its markets,'' C. Michael Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's chairman, said
Sunday in an interview. ``This puts meat underneath the concept
that we would be doing everything that we could to enable a global
universal service.''
</P>
<P>
   As communications companies have scrambled in recent years to
achieve the size believed necessary to compete on a global scale,
the seven Baby Bell local phone companies have agreed to merge into
four.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T itself pursued a megamerger last year with SBC
Communications, the big local phone company, before regulators
blasted the idea, and just last month agreed to acquire the cable
television giant Tele-Communications Inc. for $31.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And in a combined company that could perhaps feel the most
direct competition from AT&AMP;T's new venture, MCI Communications
Corp., the United States' No. 2 long-distance carrier, is nearing
completion of a $37 billion merger with Worldcom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and British Telecom insisted Sunday that their new venture
was not a prelude to their own merger. But even as a joint venture,
the newly created company would be a telecommunications titan. Its
headquarters would be in the Eastern United States, the companies
said, though they have not yet specified the location.
</P>
<P>
   Although a spokeswoman for the Federal Communications Commission
said Sunday that it was unclear whether the commission would
examine the deal, AT&AMP;T and British Telecom seem to anticipate a
thorough regulatory review, saying they do not expect to complete
the deal for about a year. Other organizations that may want to
have a say include the U.S. Department of Justice and the European
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Though the companies tried to project the move as a bold stroke,
for both AT&AMP;T and British Telecom, Sunday's announcement was in
some ways an expression of humility. Each of the companies had a
long reign as a monopolist in its home market before giving way to
the deregulatory impulses in Britain and the United States in the
1980s. And since then, each has struggled to lose an ingrained
culture of arrogance that made the company underestimate the might
of nimbler upstarts.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the AT&AMP;T of old would probably never have agreed to such
an alliance, believing it could compete even globally by itself.
</P>
<P>
   But with the continuing deregulation of communications markets
around the world under the auspices of the World Trade
Organization, the looming market opportunity _ and the competitive
stakes _ are simply too large for any one company. AT&AMP;T and British
Telecom estimated on Sunday that the market for providing
international communications services to large and medium-sized
business customers would expand from $36 billion this year to $180
billion in 2007.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the cultural shift that allowed Sunday's deal to
happen, Sir Iain Vallance, the chairman of British Telecom, said in
an interview Sunday: ``Both AT&AMP;T and BT in our domestic markets
have had to deal with greater competition than we thought of
before. We both recognize that it isn't given to us as of right,
where I think historically both BT and AT&AMP;T thought that much of
their business came of right. You've got two companies that are now
more experienced and have come through and can operate extremely
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, AT&AMP;T was not British Telecom's first choice for an
American partner. In late 1996 the British company announced a deal
to acquire the 80 percent of MCI that it did not already own for
$24 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But that deal began to unravel after British Telecom insisted on
renegotiating the price down to $19 billion last summer, which gave
Worldcom an opening to acquire MCI.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, MCI is still a partner in an international alliance
with British Telecom called Concert, which includes the Canadian
company Stentor and Singapore Telecom. But it was clear Sunday that
this relationship has little future. Vallance said Sunday afternoon
that he had not even spoken with Bert Roberts, MCI's chairman,
about the AT&AMP;T deal.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T said the British Telecom deal meant it would end two of its
own loose overseas alliances by 2000: Unisource, which includes big
Dutch, Swiss and Swedish phone companies, and World Partners, which
is a loose confederation of more than a dozen international
communications carriers, including KDD of Japan. It was unclear
whether any of these current AT&AMP;T partners might play a role with
the AT&AMP;T-British Telecom venture.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the other large U.S. telecommunications carriers are
active on the global front. MCI and Worldcom are working with
Telefonica of Spain, which is also Latin America's biggest
communications carrier. And Sprint Corp., the No. 3 long-distance
carrier in the United States, is partly owned by Deutsche Telekom,
Germany's main phone company, and by France Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and British Telecom said Sunday that the branding strategy
for their new venture had not yet been defined. Armstrong said that
at least for a transitional period AT&AMP;T would sell some
international services under the brand AT&AMP;T Concert.
</P>
<P>
   Each company would own half of the new venture, which would
initially employ 5,000 people. The companies said they expected no
job cuts from combining their international operations, although
some employees would move to the new venture.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong and Vallance said they had not yet decided on a chief
executive for the new company.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the 50-50 ownership, AT&AMP;T would be contributing $2
billion worth of assets to the new venture, while British Telecom
would contribute assets worth only $1.4 billion. The units that
AT&AMP;T would fold into the new company generated revenue last year of
$3.1 billion while the British Telecom operations had revenue of
$2.1 billion, for a total of $5.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The companies projected revenue for the new company growing to
$10 billion in 2000, the venture's first full year of operation.
The new company will offer communications services to a wide range
of multinational institutions, but will begin with a focus on the
financial services, petroleum and information technology
industries.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T said the deal would not dilute its earnings and would not
require any additional capital investment. AT&AMP;T predicted that the
venture would add between 5 and 10 cents to the company's per-share
earnings in 2000. Before this deal, analysts polled by Ibes Inc.
had estimated that AT&AMP;T would earn $3.81 a share in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T was advised in the negotiations by J.P. Morgan and by the
law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &AMP; Katz. British Telecom was
advised by N.M. Rothschild and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.

IRAQ MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO END `OIL FOR FOOD' PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``oil for food'' program intended to soften the effects of
economic sanctions on the Iraqi people is reaching a level of
success that could, paradoxically, tempt President Saddam Hussein
to try to end it, officials and diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam, who has demanded an end to the international sanctions
imposed after his troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990, has used
the genuine suffering of Iraqis as a propaganda tool, encouraging
opponents of the sanctions to visit Iraq. Funerals of children are
conducted whenever foreign dignitaries are in Bagdad.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, Saddam decided he would no longer allow
private foreign delegations to go to Iraq with donations and offers
of help. As the United Nations compiles reports of rising nutrition
rates, better health care, additional medicines and increasing
agricultural production, the Iraqis are telling foreigners,
especially Americans, to stay home and lobby their governments to
lift the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   A vigil and fast in front of the U.S. Mission to the United
Nations by 12 members of Voices in the Wilderness, a group opposed
to sanctions, began on Saturday and is expected to run through Aug.
13. In that period Richard Butler, the chief U.N. arms inspector
for Iraq, will be in Bagdad for talks, from Aug. 2 to 5.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions are to remain in place until Iraq complies with
terms that ended the Persian Gulf War in 1991, including
eliminating all weapons of mass destruction. Under the sanctions,
Iraq is barred from selling oil on the open market. But the
oil-for-food program, which began last year, allows it to sell
limited amounts of oil to obtain certain necessities like food and
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis ended their rationing system as supplies from the oil
sales began to arrive. But, more recently, it vetoed a proposed
increase of caloric level in an expanded U.N. ``food basket'' given
to every Iraqi family in the form of vouchers. Iraqis say they
cannot pump enough oil to pay for the extra food until spare parts
approved by the U.N. Security Council have been installed.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has no intention of scaling back the oil-for-food program,
said Nizar Hamdoon, the Iraqi representative to the United Nations.
But the country reserves the right to end it at any time and
certainly expects it to be an interim project and not a long-term
development or rehabilitation plan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a temporary measure that should end up as soon as
sanctions are lifted,'' Hamdoon said in an interview. ``Scaling
down the project is not an issue. It either continues or it
stops.''
</P>
<P>
   The next few months are critical. With U.N. arms inspectors
meeting continued resistance from Iraq as they try to close in on
remaining questions about missile programs and biological and
chemical weapons, it is increasingly unlikely that the sanctions,
especially the embargo on unfettered oil sales, will be lifted at
the next major review, in October.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``At this point we see no compelling reason to lift sanctions,
either on the disarmament side or any other,'' said Bill
Richardson, the U.S.representative to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   If the effects of sanctions on ordinary Iraqis are seen to be
ameliorating, some officials now say Iraq will lose its strongest
argument for ending the embargo on humanitarian grounds. Although
Iraq's supporters on the Security Council, particularly Russia and
France, have been primarily motivated by commercial and political
interests, their task has been made easier by the human crisis in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Iraqis are allowed to sell up to $5.2 billion in
oil every six months, a target they say they cannot meet because of
derelict oil-pumping equipment, and the expanding budget can be
spent on large projects like water purification, electricity
generation and the construction of schools, the original
oil-for-food program has grown into a mammoth operation for the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations' entire annual budget is less than half the
money that the world body, which controls Iraqi spending, is
handling every six months on the oil-sales program, the executive
director of the program, Benon V.evan, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam has never liked the oil-for-food program. He waited more
than four years after having lost the war to accept the Security
Council offer to sell limited oil for emergency needs. An
additional two years went by before the program began, early last
year, pressed by a Security Council increasingly uncomfortable with
reports of malnourished Iraqi children, broken-down hospitals with
empty pharmacies and thousands of unnecessary deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The program began in fits and starts. It still has problems.
</P>
<P>
   In September the Iraqis will also lose a sympathetic coordinator
of the program in Bagdad, Denis Halliday, who often clashed with
harder-line officials and was critical of some Security Council
restrictions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Sevan, who recently returned from touring areas of northern Iraq
where Kurds are given special protection and a guaranteed
percentage of the oil income, said he was furious when he found
that almost no work on two hydroelectric dams there had been
completed since he ordered it done in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem is the issue of electricity,'' Sevan said
after briefing the Security Council early this month. He said the
situation was ``unacceptable, even by U.N. standards.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials, not Iraqis, are in charge of the work in Kurdish
territories. Sevan said the United Nations was having trouble
recruiting people to work in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But Sevan said that as of July 5 nearly six million tons of food
had arrived in Iraq under the oil-sales program. The program has
nearly doubled the daily caloric intake of an average Iraqi, from a
below-sustenance level of 1,275 before the program to more than
2,000. The United Nations had tried to raise the total to 2,700
recently, but the Iraqis objected.

DAY SIX, AND TIMES SQUARE PETS STILL TRAPPED BEHIND POLICE
BARRICADES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Sidebar with NY-COLLAPSE)

 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The score or so of pets _ including fowl, fish,
felines and ferrets _ left behind in apartments near the Conde Nast
building after the scaffolding collapse last Tuesday were expected
to be retrieved by Monday morning, city officials said Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   All but the two ferrets, which are banned in New York City, will
be returned to their owners Monday, said Jerome M. Hauer, director
of the mayor's Office of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   But while other pet owners were enduring a sixth day of worry
and frustration Sunday, James Kibel was cuddling his 3-year-old
cat, Go-Go, who was shedding furiously _ ``He's just nervous,''
Kibel said _ and recounting how he dodged the police to rescue him.
</P>
<P>
   Kibel, 43, said he had grown increasingly concerned about the
cat, a large Maine coon, and called his veterinarian on Friday.
``He told me the fifth day was the critical day,'' Kibel said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, he said, after it became clear that the authorities
still would not allow pet owners into their apartments, he resolved
to try sneaking past the police lines.
</P>
<P>
   After learning when police officers were changing shifts, he
said, he showed up at 4 p.m. and ``nonchalantly'' walked past a
barricade on Avenue of the Americas. ``Everybody was looking the
other way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once past, no one questioned him as he walked most of the block
toward Seventh Avenue to his building, at 156 W. 44th St., and went
inside.
</P>
<P>
   From the lobby, he could hear Go-Go wailing in his second-floor
apartment, he said. The cat immediately devoured three and a half
cans of food and a bowl of water.
</P>
<P>
   Kibel said he had intended to go right back outside with his
pet. ``But I sat down, and I shut my eyes, and the next thing, I
woke up and it was 2 a.m.,'' he said. Go-Go was asleep next to him.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he emerged Sunday at 4 p.m. to tell his tale, he had
collected a small entourage of friends and fellow pet lovers, as
well as a lawyer, Mel A. Sachs, who appeared eager for the chance
to defend him against trespassing charges. None materialized,
although the group was briefly mobbed by reporters and tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Less intrepid pet owners, meanwhile, were forced to wait one
more night to be reunited with their charges. Hauer, of the Office
of Emergency Management, said that a police officer and a
firefighter would be sent in overnight to retrieve the animals as
soon as it was safe to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Veterinarians from the American Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals and the Center for Animal Care and Control were
to be on hand to care for any animals in need of medical treatment,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two ferrets will be turned over to the ASPCA, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other creatures still cooped up, said Sunny Mindel,
Hauer's spokeswoman, were 10 cats, a cockatiel, a guinea pig,
several fish and two hamster-like rodents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might be gerbils,'' she said. ``We're not sure.''

   ENTERPRISE, Ala. _ Sometimes, tourists whizzing south to the
Florida beaches through the deep green, gently rolling countryside
of South Alabama will make a slight detour through the downtown of
the small place of Enterprise, and gaze upon the weevil.
</P>
<P>
   Generations have seen it, a boll weevil cast in bronze and big
as a tomcat, and held lovingly aloft by what appears to be a
life-size Greek goddess made from virginal white stone.
</P>
<P>
   The statue, surrounded by a tinkling fountain, rises smack-dab
out of the middle of the main street. Never mind that the
proportions are a little off _ the weevil is impossibly large, and
most people, confronted with an insect that huge, would probably
turn and run, or try to stomp it (if they had really big feet) _
and that no one dressed like a Greek goddess has probably ever been
anywhere near a boll weevil, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But the boll weevil monument is precious here, or at least it
was, until one night last month when someone hacked the Greek
goddess' hands off and stole the insect.
</P>
<P>
   Daylight found her pointing what was left of her arms forlornly
into the dawn, and the weevil bandit appears to have gotten clean
away. Dejected city officials have taken down the damaged statue,
leaving an empty place in the street and, people here say, their
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is, indeed, still gone,'' said Capt. Tom Braun of the
Enterprise Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of older people, especially, miss it, said Braun, who does
not make light of the theft. The state of Alabama has offered a
$3,000 reward for information leading to the weevil's recovery and
that, he hopes, will shake loose some clues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a sacred thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This involves a little explaining.
</P>
<P>
   In 1892, historians say, the boll weevil crossed over from
Mexico into Texas and began eating its way eastward and northward
through the cotton fields of the South, leaving devastation behind.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton was already hurting, because it so saps the soil of
nutrients, and in Enterprise and other southern Alabama towns, the
weevil all but destroyed the cotton crops.
</P>
<P>
   But, it also forced people to diversify _ mostly into peanuts _
and the new crops did well, well enough to save the town. In 1919,
grateful residents of Coffee County erected the monument to the
pest, the first statue dedicated to such an insect in the world,
according to Bernarr Bowdoin, a volunteer at the Pea River
Historical Society in Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enterprise is often called Boll Weevil City,'' said Bowdoin,
known as Buck, who has lived in the Enterprise area for about 70
years.
</P>
<P>
   But the monument to the pest did not include the pest itself
until later, said Roy Shaffner, the retired editor and publisher of
the Enterprise Ledger and a local historian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, the statue was holding a fountain, not a boll
weevil,'' Shaffner said. ``That was fashioned in 1928, because
somebody decided, `Well, after all, if it is a statue to a boll
weevil, we ought to have a weevil up there.'''
</P>
<P>
   The first insect had only four legs, but that was later
corrected to six, after the first time the boll weevil was stolen
in 1953, or maybe 1954, Shaffner said. When the new weevil was
unveiled, he said, between 5,000 and 8,000 people came for the
dedication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, in 1974, somebody up and took the whole statue,''
Shaffner said. ``They couldn't find her for a week to 10 days.
Then, on a Saturday night, two officers were coming in on the road
from Fort Rucker and found her on the side of the road, practically
destroyed, her arms broken and everything else. They reconstructed
the monument and there was another dedication, and she was back on
duty again.''
</P>
<P>
   She was stolen again in 1981, but reappeared on the steps of
City Hall a few days later, Shaffner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, they fashioned three new boll weevils to fall
back on, in an emergency,'' he said. The city also fashioned
another statue to hold it, which means the monument will probably
not be missing for long from Enterprise's main drag.
</P>
<P>
   But residents are angry over the principle of the thing. This is
a local icon, part of history, and it gets stolen more often than
second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really beyond a practical joke,'' said Mayor Johnny
Henderson, a lifelong resident of Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Not that practical jokes aren't common, too. ``People have
vandalized it time and time again, especially in football season,''
said Patti Weiland, news director at WKMX in Enterprise. ``They'll
put suds, basketballs, alligators in the fountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh Ann Maddox, who works at the bridal shop across the street
from the statue _ or would, if it was still there _ believes that
``if kids learned in school what it represented, they wouldn't make
an effort to steal it.''
</P>
<P>
   For generations, Alabama schoolchildren learned about the boll
weevil in their dark green Alabama history books. They learned
about the scientist, George Washington Carver, who pioneered new
uses for the peanut, which made the large crops produced by places
like Enterprise worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   There is no monument to Carver, though he was invited to the
first unveiling of the statue and would have come. ``But the train
tracks were washed out and he couldn't make it,'' Shaffner said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people look at the thing and just see a bug, a really big
bug. Others see a town's salvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It represents overcoming obstacles,'' Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The thieves who ripped the weevil from the loving hands of the
statue, at least, had to earn it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took some doing to get it off,'' Braun said. ``It was on
there pretty good.''

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Nearly a thousand years after it was lost to
history, Turkish archaeologists have apparently found ruins of the
Great Palace from which Byzantine emperors ruled much of the known
world.
</P>
<P>
   The archaeologists were cleaning an underground Ottoman chamber
one day in April when they noticed a narrow corridor filled with
dirt and debris. Crawling through it with mounting excitement they
quickly realized that they were looking not at Ottoman ruins but at
something much older.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is wonderful, one of the most important finds in many
years,'' Erendiz Ozbayoglu, a professor of classical languages at
Istanbul University, said last week. ``We knew the palace existed,
and we have hundreds of books and manuscripts describing it. Now,
after all this time, we are actually going to be able to see it.
It's very, very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists involved in the excavation are not certain which
part of the sprawling palace complex they have uncovered, but
believe that one room they found may have served as a library or
archive. Its arching wall is decorated with floral and geometric
patterns. A thousand years have not dimmed the vivid green, yellow
and red pigment.
</P>
<P>
   The palace may become a major tourist attraction when it is
fully excavated, but that is likely to take several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have found is most probably the Great Palace,'' said
Alpay Pasinli, director of the Istanbul Archaeological Museum, who
is overseeing the excavation. ``We would like to have taken more
time before reporting this, but it was impossible to keep the
secret.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we reached the room with the fresco, we stared at it for
a long time,'' he said. ``To see something that no one has laid
eyes on for so many centuries is quite an emotional experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Constantine the Great built the core of the Great Palace after
he made this city the capital of the Roman Empire in 330 A.D., and
work continued intermittently for eight centuries. The palace was
home to more than 50 Byzantine emperors and the stage for countless
intrigues, some of which decided the fate of nations. It was filled
with wondrous furnishings, among them a tree of gilded bronze and
matching gilded lions equipped with machines that enabled them to
roar and beat the ground with their tails.
</P>
<P>
   ``The throne itself was so contrived that at one moment it stood
low on the ground and the next moment it would suddenly be raised
high in the air,'' an Italian ambassador reported in 949.
</P>
<P>
   Constantinople was devastated by fires in the 12th century and
then plundered by Crusaders in 1204. Later, after it was captured
by the Ottoman Turks, a new palace called Topkapi was built for the
emperor, his harem, family members and advisers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The newly discovered ruins are just outside the Topkapi walls
and across the street from the majestic Hagia Sophia, which for
centuries was the largest and most important church in Christendom,
but after 1453 a mosque and now a museum.
</P>
<P>
   Security guards protect the site from visitors who have read
breathless accounts of the discovery on the front pages of Turkish
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen stone steps lead down to the excavation. The corridor
leading to the newly discovered rooms is about 4 feet wide and 100
feet long. Halfway down its length, delicate red bricks typical of
the Ottoman period give way to the large marble blocks and swirling
masonry patterns associated with Byzantine architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as curious as anyone to know what we've found, not to
mention what else is down here,'' said Halil Ozek, an archaeologist
involved in the dig, as he toured the site on Friday. ``My first
guess is that this part of the palace dates from the ninth century.
Our great hope is that we'll find artifacts or inscriptions that
will help us date it and identify it more precisely.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he expected to find in what was once a complex
covering several square miles and embracing many buildings, Ozek
replied: ``We didn't expect to find this fresco. In fact, we didn't
expect to find the palace at all. So how can I say what we expect
next?'' &QL;

Langdon returns to U.S. team
<TEXT>
<P>
   Duke standout replaces Cleaves
</P>
<P>
   By EDDIE SEFKO &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece _ It wouldn't be a Rudy Tomjanovich team if the
U.S. squad didn't have some intrigue to spice up its life going
into the FIBA World Championship of Basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is easy for the man charged with guiding replacement
players who have been together less than three weeks to a gold
medal starting Wednesday. This is the same coach who has traded
players with the Rockets, only to welcome them back days later when
the deal was rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   Mending fences is part of his business.
</P>
<P>
   The situation with the U.S. team isn't so emotionally volatile.
But Tomjanovich nonetheless will have to work at making Trajan
Langdon feel like part of the family again as he was summoned back
to Europe after being cut by the USA Basketball selection committee
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Langdon, a Duke University standout, will join the rest of the
Americans in Athens early today. He was recalled when evaluations
Sunday on Mateen Cleaves' left ankle made it clear Cleaves would be
unable to contribute during the 12-day tournament. Langdon was on
the 24-man eligibility list USA Basketball gave to FIBA.
</P>
<P>
   The official 12-man roster must be submitted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is standard operating procedure for Tomjanovich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel terrible for Mateen,'' Tomjanovich said. ``He is such a
fiery competitor and he always picks up the intensity for us when
he gets in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in Trajan, we're getting a guy back who really didn't
deserve to be cut. He was real close (to making the team before it
was trimmed from 15 to 12 players). I'm completely comfortable with
having him back and I think he understands how we feel about him.''
</P>
<P>
   For Langdon, just getting over the jet lag will be a challenge.
He was cut in Monte Carlo, Monaco, on Wednesday and flew back to
the United States on Thursday. He was there for barely 48 hours
before getting the call after the 80-75 exhibition victory over
Italy on Saturday that his services would be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he organized his affairs and took an overnight flight to
arrive in Athens this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves' injury leaves Tomjanovich short-handed at point guard.
Michael Hawkins is the starter, but Cleaves was the backup. Now,
Kiwane Garris will fill that role, although Langdon and Jimmy King
can handle the ball at times.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich likes to keep three point guards on his teams at all
times, specifically because injuries like the one to Cleaves can
pop up at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the reasons we tried to have a lot of players on
this team who can play more than one position,'' he said. ``We want
to be a diverse team and have guys who can fill more than one
role.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich said Cleaves' injury will alter the rotation,
although because of the makeup of the team, it shouldn't be a big
hurdle. All 12 players on the team figure to see prominent playing
time depending on the situation they face in a given game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to play a lot of players,'' Tomjanovich said. ``But
the games will dictate the playing time. Right now, I feel I have
12 hard-working guys who have really picked up the system. And this
is not my system. This is their system. This is how we feel they
can be successful. I'd like to play them all. But I can't make any
promises.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensively is where the United States will miss Cleaves the
most.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked the way we started games with Hawkins on the floor,
applying the pressure,'' Tomjanovich said. ``And then Mateen would
come in and really make sure the intensity went up instead of down.
He had that youthful energy that you need and we're going to miss
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Langdon, Tomjanovich's club will get a stronger shooting
threat.
</P>
<P>
   With Langdon aboard, the United States will have two days of
preparation before the tournament begins Wednesday at two arenas,
Olympic Stadium and the Peace and Friendship Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Cleaves' injury, there has been little not to like
about the Americans, who have taken on the look of their coach.
They have become a close-knit group since arriving in Europe 12
days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't make any predictions and I would never do that,''
Tomjanovich said. ``But I have a very good feeling about this team.
These guys really have worked hard and I know we're going to do our
best to represent our country with class and do the best we
possibly can.''

<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ Negotiators from General Motors and the United
Automobile Workers union worked around the clock Sunday to settle
strikes at two GM auto parts factories here, struggling over a few
final details of GM's future investments in the factories.
</P>
<P>
   Bargainers took a break only to watch the arrival of 18 flat-bed
trucks at one of the factories. As more than 100 striking workers
cheered and waved green strike placards, the trucks brought back
parts-making equipment that GM had removed from an auto body parts
factory here over Memorial Day weekend, triggering the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood Jewell, the chairman of the UAW unit at the auto body
parts factory, tried Sunday afternoon to temper workers'
expectations for an immediate settlement. ``We've still got a way
to go,'' he told reporters during the brief break.
</P>
<P>
   But other UAW officials said that a deal was likely as soon as
Monday or Tuesday. Most of the issues in the strike have already
been settled, they said, including health and safety disputes and
the minimum number of auto parts that some workers have to produce
each day.
</P>
<P>
   All but two of 29 GM assembly plants in North America have
closed for lack of parts from the struck factories here, and more
than 100 GM parts factories have also shut down partly or entirely
because the assembly plants are closed. GM has temporarily laid off
192,000 workers, braking growth in the entire American economy this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   GM abruptly agreed Saturday evening to return dies used in
making parts, and the UAW agreed to have up to 160 workers cross
picket lines to clean the dies, make any needed repairs and install
them in huge mechanical presses.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell said Sunday that the workers would actually run the
presses and produce a few parts to make sure that the dies were
functioning properly, but would return then to the picket lines if
a settlement still had not been reached.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have been under pressure to settle the strikes. GM
dealerships are running short of popular pickup trucks and sport
utility vehicles, raising the risk that customers might start
shopping elsewhere and never return.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Standard and Poor's warned last week that it might start a
formal review of GM's credit rating, and any reduction in that
credit rating would raise the company's borrowing costs and make it
more expensive for GM to offer auto loans. The duration of the
strikes here has also put in danger GM's schedule for the
introduction of 1999 models, including a new line of highly
profitable, full-sized pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW has been alarmed by a federal lawsuit that GM filed and
by arbitration hearings that ended here on Saturday evening. In the
lawsuit and in arbitration, GM has contended that the strikes here
violate its national agreement with the UAW, and has sought rulings
that would limit the UAW's ability to stage crippling,
factory-level strikes in the future. GM would likely withdraw its
lawsuit and arbitration grievance if a settlement is reached here.
</P>
<P>
   The national agreement allows strikes over assembly line speed
increases, subcontracting and health and safety grievances. The UAW
has raised all of these issues in the strike but its main demand
has been that GM invest in more modern equipment for the factories
here, even though the factories have high costs and low
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   A UAW official who insisted on anonymity acknowledged in an
interview Sunday that some of these same investment issues were now
among the final sticking points, but refused to provide details,
saying, ``I can't say that because we can't strike over that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts have been calling for GM to use the strikes
as an excuse to close inefficient factories and stop production of
money-losing car models like the Buick Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   But while GM has threatened publicly to do both, Richard
Shoemaker, the UAW's vice president for GM issues, said at a news
conference on Saturday evening that GM had not mentioned to him any
plans to close factories. The UAW has expressed no objection to the
elimination of some models provided that the factories are
converted to other production instead of being closed.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the flat-bed trucks arriving here carried one to three
stamping dies. The dies resemble gigantic metal molds, a dozen feet
long and weighing almost 10 tons. The dies are used to stamp auto
body parts from galvanized steel sheets.
</P>
<P>
   The first die to return was for pickup truck hoods and had the
nickname ``Bob'' scrawled on the side with yellow chalk. After the
trucks had passed through the factory gates, the workers loudly
sang ``Solidarity Forever,'' the UAW's anthem.
</P>
<P>
   GM removed the dies over Memorial Day weekend for fear of a
strike by workers here angry about the company's decision last
spring to cancel plans to install the latest equipment here. But
the removal of the dies ended up triggering a walkout by the 3,400
workers here on June 5.
</P>
<P>
   Another 5,800 workers at a speedometer and spark plug factory
several miles away then went on strike on June 11, partly to show
support for the auto body parts workers and partly because of
worries that GM would continue to winnow their work force through
attrition while buying more parts from non-union outside suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   GM moved the dies over Memorial Day weekend to a stamping
factory in Mansfield, Ohio, but never used them there. Canadian
auto workers, who will be building the first of the new pickups,
declared that they would refuse to accept any parts from the moved
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   UAW officials have also said that the dies were damaged
accidentally during the trip to Mansfield, but GM officials have
refused to confirm or deny this.
</P>
<P>
   For all their size and weight, stamping dies are remarkably
fragile, and will produce defective parts unless mounted with great
precision in huge mechanical presses. Striking workers here were
dismayed to see that some of the dies arriving here were stacked on
each other, which can cause damage.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Miller, a 49-year-old pipe fitter who has been working
with dies here for 31 years, said that it could take anywhere from
two days to two weeks to put the dies back in service, depending on
how much damage they have suffered. &QL;

WOMAN INJURED IN SHOOTING IS RECOVERING AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Angela M. Dickerson, the woman wounded in the
shooting at the Capitol last Friday, was recovering quietly at her
home in Chantilly, Va., Sunday, well enough to talk to family and
friends but determined to guard her privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old woman, who is the lead designer at the Ethan
Allen furniture outlet at a mall in nearby Springfield, was
visiting the Capitol on her day off with some of her husband's
relatives when she was shot in the face and shoulder in the gunfire
that took the lives of two Capitol Police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dickerson was treated at George Washington Medical Center in
the hospital's trauma unit, the same place former President Ronald
Reagan was taken after he was shot in 1981. She was released on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke to her this morning and I think she's doing fine,''
said Ms. Dickerson's design partner at Ethan Allen, who gave her
name as Susan. ``She knows people want to see her and know she's
OK. But she's not ready to talk yet about what happened. And she
asked us not to talk about her.''
</P>
<P>
   People have come to the store to leave cards, gifts and flowers
for her. ``We've had people come in who have never met her before
with gifts,'' Ms. Dickerson's co-worker said. ``We're getting tons
and tons of flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dickerson's sister-in-law, who declined to give her name,
said in a telephone interview that Ms. Dickerson was surrounded by
family members and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's doing well, she's up and around, resting at home and
recovering as well as can be expected,'' said the woman, who is
married to Ms. Dickerson's older brother, Frank Dobscha Jr. ``I
mean, this is traumatic for all of us. We need time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dickerson's sister-in-law said the family was annoyed by the
media spotlight that was trained on Ms. Dickerson after the
shooting and by the reporters and photographers who have knocked on
the door of her house and pleaded for family photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we're being descended upon,'' she said. ``All of us
are in a state of shock. We understand the public wants to know
about her. Our priority right now is to make sure she is protected
and gets well. At this point the family is not ready to make a
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dickerson was described by neighbors and friends as an
outgoing young woman who studied design at college before she went
to work for Ethan Allen, a traditional furniture maker, two years
ago. She baby-sat for her neighbors' children, taught one young
neighbor how to skate down her driveway, and has most often been
seen around the neighborhood in the morning and evening walking her
dog, a yellow Labrador retriever.
</P>
<P>
   She married her husband, a store manager, 14 months ago. The
couple live in Chantilly, a quiet suburban Washington neighborhood,
in the house where Ms. Dickerson was born. They have been making
plans to move.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dickerson and her family left the hospital on Saturday
without making any statement to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Saturday, Phillip Schaengold, the chief
executive officer of George Washington University, described Ms.
Dickerson as ``still in a bit of shock,'' adding: ``I think she is
quite somber. This has been quite traumatic for her.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Ms. Dickerson's sister-in-law said, the medical
reports are positive and the family has been told that there is no
need for plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   She added that Ms. Dickerson will be celebrating her 24th
birthday at home on Friday. &QL;

CLINTON SAID TO JEOPARDIZE DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT IF HE FIGHTS
SUBPOENA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JAMES BENNET and DON VAN NATTA JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senior advisers to President Clinton have warned
that he would jeopardize support from congressional Democrats if he
fights a subpoena to testify in the Lewinsky investigation, even as
outlines emerged on Sunday of a possible, unconventional compromise
with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, is negotiating with
Clinton's lawyers over his demand that Clinton become the first
sitting president to appear before a grand jury, according to a
lawyer knowledgeable about the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with a deadline of Thursday, and perhaps as soon as
Tuesday, for Clinton's testimony, there was no deal on Sunday in
the dispute, which last week abruptly brought Starr's seemingly
meandering, six-month-old investigation to a precipice.
</P>
<P>
   A major obstacle to an agreement is the president's request that
his lawyer, David Kendall, sit in on his testimony. Grand jury
witnesses appear alone, and Starr is unwilling to make an
exception.
</P>
<P>
   Starr might give ground on a request by the president's lawyers
that Clinton not be required to testify at the Federal Courthouse.
But Starr is so intent on having the 23 grand jurors hear the
president's testimony in person and question him themselves that he
is exploring creative compromises. One is to bus the jurors to the
White House, and another is to have Clinton testify via live
closed-circuit television.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Kendall and Starr have been periodically negotiating
over whether Clinton would testify about his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern. Starr's decision to
subpoena the president reflected frustration over the pace of the
negotiations, and heightened the political and legal stakes for the
White House. .
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who is chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, warned on Sunday that a refusal by Clinton to
testify could be grounds to begin an impeachment proceeding. But
Hatch also suggested that Starr should compromise, calling the
president ``a very busy man,'' and saying ``We should do everything
we can to accommodate him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, the House minority leader, said that he
expected that Clinton would testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always believed that Bill Clinton will do as he has
said he would do _ he would get all the necessary information to
the independent counsel,'' Gephardt said, speaking, like Hatch, on
the CBS program ``Face the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what he's done,'' Gephardt said, ``and I believe that's
what he's going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar comments by Gephardt on Friday rang alarm bells at the
White House, persuading the president's top political advisers that
he would have to testify. ``Most of the political folks have said,
`Look, don't think we can sustain any political support for the
position of resisting a subpoena,''' one senior administration
official said on Sunday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But it was unclear what course Clinton would take, because the
president's lawyers and the White House counsel's office are
controlling the response to the investigation. Some of the
president's allies have begun to chafe at the tight control over
information exerted by Kendall and the counsel's office _ which
still has not informed some of the highest-ranking White House
aides that Clinton has been subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ignored reporters' questions on Sunday about the
subpoena. In Aspen, Colo., to raise more than $1 million for his
party, he tried in several appearances to portray the Democrats as
a font of ideas and the Republicans as a sewer of invective,
keeping conservatives happy ``just by banging on me and doing a few
other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a brunch for donors on Sunday morning, Clinton said
that if voters elect more Democrats in this fall's congressional
elections ``they can have more of the progress they like, instead
of the partisanship they deplore in Washington day in and day
out.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Paula Jones sexual misconduct case, Clinton answered
dozens of questions about Ms. Lewinsky under oath. The White House
argues that he has already denied the chief accusations against
him, that he lied in a deposition about having an affair with Ms.
Lewinsky and then tried to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Starr wants to go over some of the same ground with Clinton that
Mrs. Jones' lawyers covered. He also wants to ask about matters
that have arisen since that deposition, including the so-called
talking points that Ms. Lewinsky apparently gave to Linda Tripp,
who tape-recorded 20 hours of their conversations. The talking
points, which seemed intended to coach Ms. Tripp in possible
testimony about Clinton, are central to Starr's effort to determine
whether there was obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers and Starr were negotiating over several
other issues, including whether Starr will limit his questioning to
specific issues. Clinton's team also raised the possibility of his
responding to written questions, although Starr is said by allies
to be unwilling to agree to that.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In describing Clinton's request to have a lawyer present for his
testimony, one lawyer familiar with the negotiations recalled a
prosecutors' maxim: ``You come into the world alone, and you go
into the grand jury room alone.''
</P>
<P>
   As he weighs testifying, Clinton has several options open to
him, all with political downsides and some with severe legal risks:
He could agree to testify; he could file a motion to quash the
subpoena on constitutional grounds, or he could invoke the Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination. The last option _
raised this weekend by James Carville, a Clinton ally _ might put
the president on firm ground legally, but it would certainly place
him in a perilous position politically.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton sought to quash the subpoena, some of his supporters
believe, the president could win in court. Jack Quinn, a former
White House counsel under Clinton, argued that such a subpoena
violates the constitutional separation of powers, and would open
the way for any state or local prosecutor to summon a president
before a grand jury. He argued that a president must be impeached
before facing a criminal proceeding, and that Starr is improperly
usurping congressional powers.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton and other presidents have given videotaped
testimony in past criminal investigations, none has done so under
subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who is a member of the Judiciary
Committee, said Sunday on the CNN program ``Inside Edition'' that
ignoring a subpoena would not be an impeachable offense. He called
on Starr to share the material he has gathered with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Hatch said that Clinton was duty-bound to testify: ``He has
an obligation as the highest official in this government, sworn to
uphold the Constitution and the laws of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a legal fight could drag out the investigation for months,
which is one reason Starr may bend in negotiations. But, Clinton's
advisers believe a lengthy battle in court would also alienate some
of the president's Democratic supporters in Congress, who would
have trouble explaining to voters why he would not simply tell his
side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton does testify, he might not substantially change his
legal situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have forgotten that the president has already
responded under oath from hostile questioning in the Jones
deposition,'' said Lanny Davis, a former White House deputy counsel
under Clinton. ``I don't know what he gets out of this deposition
from Clinton other than a repeat of the Paula Jones deposition,
with a couple of updates.''
</P>
<P>
   But, if Starr can prove that Clinton lied in the Jones
deposition, then the president may increase his legal jeopardy by
giving grand jury testimony. Legislators weighing impeachment would
certainly argue that perjury before a grand jury was a more serious
offense than perjury in the Jones civil suit, which was dismissed
on April 1, less than two months before trial.

 U.S. DEBATES INVESTING IN STOCK FOR SOCIAL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ As Congress and the Clinton administration
debate how best to secure Social Security's long-term viability,
the answer increasingly seems to involve taking advantage of the
potentially robust investment returns available on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   But while conservatives and some Democrats have been pushing
plans that would allow individuals to invest some of their Social
Security taxes in the financial markets, liberal Democrats, labor
unions and other groups are rallying around proposals under which
the federal government would invest some of the retirement system's
reserves in stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of turning the government into the world's largest
investor _ with far-reaching effects on the markets _ is likely to
be vigorously debated here on Monday, when President Clinton plays
host to a forum and town meeting on Social Security. If it is not
altered in some way, Social Security will run short of the money it
needs to pay beneficiaries as the vast baby-boom generation
retires.
</P>
<P>
   To proponents, making the government a shareholder is a way to
capture the power of the markets on behalf of Social Security
recipients without exposing them directly to the risks or seeing
the gains eaten up by the high costs of administering 150 million
private accounts. Currently, Social Security's reserves are
invested in safe but relatively low-yielding Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, proponents say, proposals built on having the
government invest up to half of Social Security's reserves on Wall
Street would require fewer benefit cuts and other changes to the
system than those built on diverting part of payroll taxes into
private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investing as a system allows you to preserve current benefits,
avoid raising the retirement age to 70, and deal with most of
Social Security's solvency shortfall over the next 75 years,'' said
Rep. Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota, who is developing a Social
Security proposal for House Democrats. ``And who's better
positioned to take the risk of a market downturn, the United States
of America or an individual Social Security recipient?''
</P>
<P>
   Pomeroy said that investing half of the system's reserves in an
index fund that earned a 7 percent annual return on its investment
_ the market averaged 7.56 percent from 1926 to 1996 and has done
considerably better the last few years _ would take care of 95
percent of Social Security's financial problems, when combined with
technical reductions in the Consumer Price Index that are being
implemented by the Labor Department. The price index is used to set
cost-of-living increases each year.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates of private accounts said government investment in
the markets would be economically and politically unwise, if not
treacherous or unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most influential opponents of government investment
is Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, who last
week called the idea ``very dangerous'' and said it would
inevitably lead to politicians interfering in the workings of free
markets.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any way you can essentially insulate
government decision-makers from having access to what will amount
to very large investments in American private industry,'' Greenspan
said. Implementing the idea, he said, ``has very far-reaching
potential dangers for a free American economy and a free American
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reischauer, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, said
that Greenspan's concerns are legitimate, but that they could be
addressed by the establishment of an independent investment board,
appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, that would
have a legal responsibility to seek the best possible returns for
Social Security recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The board would hire professional investment managers who would
invest the money to mimic as closely as possible the aggregate
performance of all traded securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't think you could insulate the system from the risks
of meddling, I'd be opposed, too,'' Reischauer said.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of government investment said politicians would
find some way around any safeguards. Consider, for example, the
potential for political pressure to exclude tobacco companies from
acceptable investments, or nonunion companies, or companies
involved in some kind of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of the government as owner is anathema to the way
business is run and in fact the way the country is run,'' said
Donald Marron, the chairman of Paine Webber, the brokerage firm.
``Ownership confers certain rights, and these rights should belong
to the normal shareholder base.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists said any decision to have the government invest
hundreds of billions of dollars in the markets would have complex
effects. To the degree that Social Security reserves were invested
in stocks and corporate bonds instead of the Treasury securities
they are invested in now, the federal government might have to pay
higher interest rates on its debt _ ultimately costing taxpayers
more.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of Social Security money into the markets would also
be a huge pool of new capital for U.S. business, potentially
helping to stimulate the formation of companies. Or, economists
said, it could create such a glut of capital that companies with
little potential could get off the ground or unpromising
technologies could soak up money, eventually harming the nation's
overall economic health.

POWERBALL FRENZY GROWS EVEN WILDER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.Y., Iowa, Fla.)   (lh) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWICH, Conn. _ Interstate highways were backed up for hours
and blocks-long lines choked small towns as hopeful hordes flocked
across state lines to Connecticut, the District of Columbia and the
19 other states where Powerball tickets are sold.
</P>
<P>
   Jay K. Patel of Forest Hills, N.Y., shelled out $3,000 at
Greenwich Cigar and Stationery, where police had set up pylons,
barricades and yellow ``Caution'' tape to control the crowds.
``Dollar and dream _ that's all you think,'' Patel said as the
shop's single lottery machine chugged out his pink and orange
slips. ``Now, I have 3,000 dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   And this was only Day 1. The latest and largest installment of
lottomania was born at 3 a.m. Sunday, when a computer in West Des
Moines, Iowa, determined that no one had bought a winning ticket in
Saturday night's Powerball drawing. So that jackpot, itself close
to a record, rolled into Wednesday night's drawing, when the right
six numbers will be worth seven zeros _ an estimated $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery officials and experts said that eclipses the previous
record for a jackpot, $195 million, which was set in May on another
Powerball drawing. Powerball officials said they would not know
until Monday how many tickets were sold Sunday, but they said it
was more than the 4.5 million that were sold last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the greed factor. Bigger is better,'' said Douglas A.
Orr, the marketing director of the Multi-State Lottery Association,
a group in West Des Moines that runs the game. He said officials
expect to sell at least 150 million tickets before the drawing at
10:59 p.m. on Wednesday. For the record-breaking pot in May, 138
million were sold. A ticket costs $1. The chance of winning is 1 in
80 million.
</P>
<P>
   The huge prizes have served as a swift vindication for the
multi-state lottery, which was formed in 1988 as Lotto America by
smaller states, mostly in the Midwest. They could not compete with
the jackpots of the larger states, so they decided to pool their
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Barry A. Miller, the editor of Lotto World, a monthly magazine
published in Maples, Fla., predicted that the mammoth Powerball
prize will lure droves of first-time players of all incomes, shades
and classes. ``Most people know it's a fantasy,'' he said. ``But
someone wins, and it could be you.'' Miller plans to have a friend
in Bridgeport, buy him one ticket. ``I never overspend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the tickets are not sold in New York or New Jersey,
Powerball fever has brought a fleeting democracy to Greenwich,
where Escorts jockeyed with Jaguars as the bridge-and-tunnel crowd
queued up on streets lined with shops sporting elegant awnings and
offering pricey merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Kovic, 28, a waiter from the Bronx who said he was
studying aircraft design at a trade school, bought 3,000 tickets
with money he said he had saved for tuition. ``If I win, I won't
have to go to school,'' he explained. ``Heck, I can buy my own
aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, the frenzy is frightening. Gerald Guerrier, who works
for a lottery machine service firm in Rocky Hill, nursed printers
and motherboards Sunday with the urgency of a heart surgeon. Crowds
outside his various stops cursed as he went in and cheered as he
left. ``At one deli, the owner told the crowd, `If he doesn't fix
the machine, kill him,''' Guerrier said with wide eyes. ``One lady
said, `There'd be no witnesses.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gail Howard, owner of a publishing company in White Plains,
N.Y., expects Powerball to propel sales of her lottery books and
software which for up to $79.95 help players eliminate combinations
that she says are unlikely to win. But Ms. Howard said that all
that expertise might improve the odds from 1 in 80 million to 1 in
50 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is your time, God will pick you,'' she said. ``It's
still luck.''

LITTLE GUYS CARRY U.S. IN WRESTLING

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ That the American wrestlers beat the Russians on
Sunday to win the Goodwill Games gold medal was no surprise. But
how they did it was: on the strength of the lighter wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   Coach John Smith's concern over the inexperience of his smaller
charges faded when the first four _ Sam Henson, Tony Purler, Cary
Kolat and Lincoln McIlravy _ forged a 13-3 lead to set up a 16-14
victory at the Theater in Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something the team will build from going into the
world championships,'' Smith said, referring to the September meet
in Tehran, Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey defeated Iran by 16-13 for the bronze medal in a quiet
afternoon match. On Saturday night, a protest by an Iranian exile
group had disrupted the U.S.-Iran bout.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, in front of 4,443 fans, the United States clinched the
gold with two matches left when Les Gutches, the 187-pound world
champion from Corvallis, Ore., defeated the 1996 Olympic champion,
Khadijmorad Magomedov.
</P>
<P>
   Gutches, warned for passivity, summoned enough aggression to
trip Magomedov onto his stomach for a takedown with a minute
remaining to win by 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out to win, but I wasn't ready for a battle yet,''
Gutches said. `'I was like old McGwire taking the first pitch
before he's ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutches' confrontation was supposed to be the featured bout, but
it played a supporting role to his smaller teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was curious to see how they performed,'' Gutches said.
`'I've got some catching up to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The smaller Americans had no need for suspense, especially
Purler, a 128-pound Oklahoman. He recorded the day's only pin,
driving Murat Ramazanov's right leg into his torso and flipping him
onto his back.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry McCoy, of Middle Island, N.Y., dropped his 286-pound bout
to Andrei Shumulin after Shumulin dropped him. Shumulin bearhugged
the former Penn State and Longwood High School star, lifted him and
slammed him to the mat on his back for a 5-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the few down moments during a promising
performance by the Americans. &QL;

BRAZIL TOPS U.S. IN GOLD MEDAL MATCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ED GUZMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This was not your typical Sunday in the park. The
men's beach volleyball competition in the Goodwill Games wrapped in
Central Park on Sunday with the gold medal match featuring the
United States duo of Adam Johnson and Karch Kiraly against Para and
Guilherme of Brazil, the world's top-ranked tandem.
</P>
<P>
   With the Manhattan skyline as the backdrop and a raucous
Brazilian and American crowd on hand _ the event was the first
sellout of the Games _ Para and Guilherme used a late surge in Game
1 and cruised to a 12-11, 12-4 victory. The defending world
champions had routed the American duo, 15-3, on Thursday on their
way to becoming the tournament's only unbeaten team.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that first game, I thought we were in good shape,''
Kiraly said. ``We chose a much different strategy today in trying
to tire out Para because he had been blocking well much of the
tournament. We actually took them out of their game to where
Guilherme was doing most of the blocking. Even though we forced
them into a new and different game, they still played well and beat
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's service game was a key to victory. Of Brazil's 84
serves, Johnson was on the receiving end for 71, as Para and
Guilherme tried to play away from Kiraly. It worked, as Kiraly
finished with a match-low 29 attack attempts.
</P>
<P>
   With Sunday's temperature at 81 degrees, 102 on the sand, the
playing and viewing conditions were an improvement from the
tournament's first day, when the on-court temperature reached 109
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is by far the best crowds we've had this week,'' said Tim
Simmons, the press officer for volleyball. ``The Brazilian fans are
crazy at these things, which makes things a little livelier.''
</P>
<P>
   After Game 1 was tied at 9-9, the Brazilian contingent, many
waving flags and wearing Brazilian soccer jerseys, began a loud
``Bra-zil! Bra-zil!'' chant. The support seemed to energize Para
and Guilherme, who rallied for an 11-9 lead.
</P>
<P>
   They had tied the score at 9-9 when the referee, Darryl Friesen
of Canada, called Kiraly for a carry. Kiraly walked away and
slammed the net in disgust and was slapped with a yellow card for
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Kiraly, however, rallied the United States to an 11-11 tie when
he snuffed Para's kill attempt, bringing the American crowd to its
feet. But Para doused the American enthusiasm by blocking Johnson
to win Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 was never in doubt as Para and Guilherme jumped out to a
7-1 advantage. It was only a matter of time, and when Johnson hit a
kill just beyond the back line, the celebration began. The
Brazilian duo ran toward the stands to celebrate with their fans.
Guilherme, beaming, draped himself in his country's flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd was great.'' Guilherme said. ``I think everybody was
worried at the beginning, but the crowds started to come. We had
some good Brazilian fans.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bronze medal game Martin Conde and Esteban Martinez of
Argentina defeated Julien Prosser and Lee Zahner of Australia by
12-11, 12-9. &QL;

 &HT;    Hometown residents react Weston's infamy
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALMEYER, Ill. _ The thing Harold Baum remembers about Rusty
Weston is how ordinary he was, how he tried to fit in and go along.
</P>
<P>
   Baum, who retired last year as superintendent of Valmeyer
Community Unit School District 3, knew Weston from the time he
entered elementary school until the time he left high school.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was just a pretty ordinary kid,'' Baum said Saturday. ''He
was a happy, polite kid, never got into any trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Weston earned average grades, though, like so many kids, he
could have done better, Baum said. He belonged to the Future
Farmers of America and was a member of the Great Books reading
club. He was a reporter for the Booster, the high school newspaper.
He was the kind of kid who would greet you in the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Baum has trouble reconciling those memories of Weston with the
image of an angry, deranged man trying to shoot his way into the
the Capitol of the United States, killing two police officers and
wounding a tourist.
</P>
<P>
   But that is what Russell Eugene Weston is accused of doing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never really thought he had those capabilities,'' Baum said.
''But when the mind snaps, you never know what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Rusty Weston's life sems to have gone horribly wrong.
Now 41 years old, he lies in a Washington, D.C., hospital, gravely
injured in Friday's shootout in the Capitol corridors. His family
spent the weekend in seclusion as sheriff's deputies blocked the
road leading to their homes _ his parents and his grandmother live
next to each other _ in an unicorporated area of western Illinois
called Warnock, 10 miles north of the little town of Valmeyer. The
Westons have lived here for generations. Rusty's grandfather,
Luther Weston, was section forman for the Missouri Pacific
Railroad, responsible for maintaining the tracks through the area.
His father, Russell Sr., worked in a grocery warehouse until
retiring about 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And they may live here several generations more. This area was
flooded so badly in 1993 that the entire town of Valmeyer was
relocated several miles eastward on higher ground, a remarkable
feat.
</P>
<P>
   But some people on B Road rebuilt, despite water six or eight
feet deep. The Westons, whether because of determiniation or fierce
attachment to their family homes, were among them. And their
daughter, April, Rusty's older sister, has married and settled in
the area, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Farmland stretches for miles along the flat terrain. On the way
to the Westons' houses, fields of corn hem in a road so narrow
that, in some spots, when two cars approach each other in opposited
directions, one must pull over so the other can pass.
</P>
<P>
   Houses are separated from each other by more than a mile. Most
neighbors interviewed Saturday said they didn't know the Westons.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't see them coming out their front door,'' said one,
noting the distance between homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never even heard the name until it was on the news,'' said
another.
</P>
<P>
   It's a quiet area, far removed fromthe hubub of St. Louis, on
the other side of the Mississippi River and a bit to the north.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the type of community I wanted to raise my kids in,''
said Dave Marquardt, who moved here from St. Louis. Marquardt said
he understood that the elder Weston was democratic precinct captain
of the area, but he knew little more about the family.
</P>
<P>
   But, despite the family's roots in the area, Rusty Weston left,
heading for Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ''He kind of dropped out of the world after he left high
school,'' Baum said. In Montana, ''he kind of got into that
subculture _ I guess years ago, we would have called it hippies,''
Baum said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, whenever he came back, he was the kind of guy who took
the time to look up his old school superintendent and drop in for a
visit.
</P>
<P>
   Baum would ask him what he was up to, but the answer was never
clear. He was never doing anything, it seemed; he was always going
to do something. He always seems to have a plan in mind, rather
than a current occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty's sister told Baum at one point that Rusty had a gold mine
in Montana that he was going to reopen.
</P>
<P>
   Baum last saw Weston about five years ago. And, for all the
interest in subculture and for for all the dreaming, he never saw
any sign that Weston suffered mental illness or was capable of
violence. There was no hint of what was to come.
</P>
<P>
   ''His family is such a nice family,'' Baum said. ''You try to
raise your kids right ... I have a great deal of sympathy for the
family.''

COMMENTARY: GRAND OBSTRUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A prosecutor must have a ``theory of the case'' _ a theme that
ties together the disparate evidence of a conspiracy to obstruct
justice _ to give coherent meaning to all the strands of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, our attention has been narrowly focused on the Tripp
appearances before a grand jury, the deal-making for Lewinsky
testimony, the presidential subpoena to testify again under oath.
</P>
<P>
   And as of now, the Clinton defenders are saying: everybody lies
about sexual liaisons, and if one took place here, the cover-up is
trivial, certainly no ``high crime'' providing the basis for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom has it that the scandals of the first term _
Whitewater and the concealment of files, power abuse in the travel
office firings, Filegate _ all turned out to be dry holes, with the
Little Rock grand jury shut down, leaving the independent counsel
with little to show but the improper inducement to lie about some
tawdry hanky-panky.
</P>
<P>
   But what if we're all mistaken? What if the seemingly obsessive
pursuit of false denial in the Lewinsky-Tripp-Willey matter turns
out to illuminate a much broader landscape of witness-tampering and
suppression of evidence? Then we would be talking about a serious
abuse of executive power.
</P>
<P>
   Assume for unconventional argument's sake that a distinct
pattern can be shown _ both in the cast of characters and the
technique of payoff employed _ of possibly hushing up Webster
Hubbell on Whitewater and possibly buying Monica Lewinsky's
cooperation in giving a witness ``talking points'' to mislead a
jury.
</P>
<P>
   Assume that dots can be connected among the use of the office of
White House counsel to transmit false information to a grand jury
about the first lady's involvement in Travelgate firings, the
removal and concealment of Rose Law Firm files long under subpoena
and the improper use of White House counsel to coordinate and
influence the testimony of witnesses and avoid subpoenas in
subsequent criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   And assume that the independent counsel has a witness tying a
cover-up of bank fraud directly to President Clinton himself. That
John Dean-like accuser might be Jim Guy Tucker, Clinton's successor
as Arkansas governor, who twice met privately with the president
and has reportedly been turning state's evidence since his plea
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   If my pure speculation about Ken Starr's ``theory of the case''
is correct, and his intent is to show a pervasive pattern of the
use of executive power to obstruct the administration of justice,
that would explain (a) the prosecutor's vain attempt to see the
notes of Vincent Foster's lawyer regarding Travelgate, (b) his
ongoing effort to deny privilege to taxpayer-paid White House
lawyers and (c) the prosecutor's appeal of a recent court decision
taking the pressure off the well-compensated Hubbell to talk.
</P>
<P>
   This approach also suggests that the demand by Clinton Justice
for total Secret Service privilege in the Lewinsky matter was a
classic and perhaps fatal blunder. Resulting sweeping court
decisions emboldened Starr to bring a parade of agents before grand
juries. Why assume, as most do, that the line of questioning is
limited to sexual encounters? Agents may have witnessed obstruction
in other matters. Every bit of corroboration counts.
</P>
<P>
   We already know that Starr sought the services of a professional
writer to draft his report to the courts and Congress. We can
logically conclude that he found a writer whose summary of the
criminal information, running a couple of hundred pages, is now
well under way. Space has surely been left for the insertion of the
upcoming testimony of Ms. Lewinsky and of Secret Service witnesses
on the full range of investigations, and for the coming addition to
previous testimony given under oath by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   When will we get this report? My guess is, in Clinton's phrase,
sooner rather than later: Starr need not wait for all appeals to
end or trials to be held before reporting on the presidential
obstruction he encountered over three years. Public reaction to its
startling contents should be ``if we had only known ...''
</P>
<P>
   More profound question: what conclusions about abuse of power
will the report reach, or lead a reluctant Congress to act upon?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, if I am right, may come more quickly and be more
far-reaching than most imagine. &QL;

 &HT;    324 game-winner Sutton inducted into Hall
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Moments before the Hall of Fame ceremony was
to start Sunday afternoon where her husband Don would be inducted
into baseball's greatest shrine, tears rolled off the cheeks of
Mary Sutton, a few even dropping on to the cute white hat of
daughter Jacqueline.
</P>
<P>
   They quickly disappeared in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' said Mary while whipping her eyes for what seem like
the umpteeth time, ``she is here to join us is overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   It was two November's ago that doctors had told the Sutton's
that Jacqueline, born 16 weeks premature, had about a 100-to-1
chance to live.
</P>
<P>
   Those same type of odds faced Don when he was the child of
tenant farmers back in south Alabama and had dreams of making it to
the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   They both made it Cooperstown Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And in the most touching part of Sutton's induction speech, he
looked at the little girl they call Jackie, dressed in white and
pink and said, his voice cracking all along, ``Thanks for sticking
around to be a part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a touching day for a family who has had to battle so hard
with their daughter and the disappointment of not making into the
Hall on four previous ballots.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that could be heard in Sutton's voice.
</P>
<P>
   His speech was not only beautifully written but masterfully
delivered and no one seemed to mind that he ended it by taking a
line from Lou Gehrig's farewell to the fans at Yankees Stadium,
Sutton saying, ``I'm the luckiest man alive.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite a small crowd of around 5,000, it was a ceremony to
remember. Going in with Sutton was Larry Doby, the first black
player in the American League. Doby, who played most of his career
in Cleveland and should have graced the Hall a long time ago, was
gracious as ever, concentrating on the good times of his career and
not the hard days of segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Also, executive Lee MacPhail, once the American League
president, joins his father Lee Sr. as the first father-son team in
the Hall. And Sam Lacey, who still writes a column at 94 and was
instrumental in helping baseball desegregate, was put in the
writers' wing of the Hall while Jaime Jarrin, the Spanish voice of
the Dodgers for 40 years, went into the broadcaster part.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Sutton that stole what was a beautiful, breezy
afternoon, opening his speech by saying, ``If it's true to my
career, (reliever) Rollie Fingers (sitting behind Sutton) will do
the last two parts for me.'' Sutton then added, ``I've been waiting
for this for 40 years, so why am I shaking like a leaf?''
</P>
<P>
   But the 324-game winner needed no help.
</P>
<P>
   He began by talking about growing up in Cilo (Ala.), where he
played with a bat that was full of nails, going on to talk about
how he listened to games on a small radio late at night and wanting
to be ``the Robin Roberts.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to thank his sixth grade teacher Henry Roper, who
first taught him how to pitch, and Dodgers manager Walter Alston,
who he said, ``was an extension of my relationship with my dad.''
There was also a mention of teammates Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale
and Dodgers pitcher coach Red Adams, who Sutton said had a bigger
impact than anyone on his pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sutton spoke of his family, beginning to cry as he
mentioned his brother and sister, saying, ``They ate a lot of
dinners in the car when big brother had a baseball game.'' Then
came his daughter Staci and his son Daron and father Howard, saying
of the latter, ``I have a dream come true and it is a validation of
what my dad taught me a long time ago. You can have a dream and if
you are willing to work for it, it can come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Next was Mary and Jacqueline, who waved at her father and is as
rambunctious as any 20-month-old child.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton also pointed to his Atlanta Braves broadcast partners -
Skip Caray, Joe Simpson and Pete Van Wiren. All three were thrilled
to be here, flown in on a company jet for the day, and perhaps no
one other than Mary knows Sutton better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he has been disappointed about the times he didn't get
in,'' Van Wiren said. ``But he has been so excited, I don't think
there has been a day go by where he hasn't brought it up and talked
about how proud he is to get into the Hall. And he has to be one of
the few guys who from the start set a goal of getting into the Hall
and did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Sutton's son Daron, ``Ever since he was called up to the
major leagues, this was his goal. I really believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, Sutton spoke to the media, ate dinner and returned
to the Hall where his plaque had just been hung. The inscription
starts ``A stalwart on the mound for 23 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sutton was more than that. He's an example that a player
doesn't have the best fastball or win 20 games year after year to
get here.
</P>
<P>
   Said Sutton, ``I'm blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Hall is certainly a better place with him.

ANALYSIS: STATE OFFICIALS FACE DILEMMA IN TOBACCO TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Mo., Md., Mich., N.M., Wis., S.C., Wash., Calif.,
Colo., N.Y., N.C., Minn., Ind.)  (mk) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a new round of tobacco settlement talks starts
Monday in New York, state attorneys general are more in agreement
about money than about public health goals.
</P>
<P>
   Well before the $368.5 billion proposed tobacco settlement was
reached last year between the industry and state officials, the 22
attorneys general who then had pending lawsuits issued a public
road map of their objectives. Those demands, largely incorporated
in last year's plan, required among other things that producers
restrict tobacco advertising and enforce controls over retailers
with the goal of reducing sales to minors; divulge information
about product hazards, place new warnings on packages and submit to
government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's plan unraveled in Congress. But while attorneys
general reached agreement in preliminary discussions last week in
Chicago that they would press for more money than the states would
have received under the earlier proposal, they have yet to issue a
clear statement about their specific public health goals.
</P>
<P>
   A part of the dilemma reflects the fact that state officials
were bargaining last year with an eye toward Congress. But their
ability to achieve broad changes now may be more limited because
the earlier concessions by the cigarette industry were made in the
belief that federal legislation would protect them from some
tobacco lawsuits. There is little prospect of such legislation now.
</P>
<P>
   There are other complications. While some attorneys general who
face elections this fall are eager to settle their cases so they
can reap the political benefits, others believe that they could
face attack if they settle for too little. And while most states
with pending lawsuits appear ready to strike a deal, some states,
like Iowa, Missouri, Maryland, Michigan and New Mexico, have taken
a harder line, and a few states, including Wisconsin, have refused
to participate in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to realize that when you talk about attorneys general
you are not talking about a monolithic group,'' said Frank Kelly,
the attorney general of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of talks began last month when Joe Rice, a
plaintiffs' lawyer in Charleston, S.C., who represents some 27
states, met with industry lawyers and Christine Gregoire, the
Washington attorney general, in a court-ordered bid to mediate
Washington's lawsuit, the next state tobacco action set for trial.
Those secret talks were then expanded to include the attorneys
generals of California, Colorado, New York and North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But the discussions, which one lawyer said came ``close'' to
reaching a proposed settlement, stalled over monetary and public
health issues, lawyers familiar with the discussions said. The
proposal was worth about $196 billion over 25 years and would have
raised the price of cigarettes about 32 cents a pack.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the states have decided to use the public concessions
gained by the state of Minnesota as part of its $6.5 billion
settlement this spring as a starting point. Under that deal,
producers agreed to take down tobacco billboards, finance
anti-smoking campaigns and refrain from making misleading
statements about product hazards.
</P>
<P>
   But how much further state officials are willing to push
cigarette makers is anybody's guess. Some lawyers familiar with the
talks said that the harder-line states have drawn up a number of
additional demands, including an end to all outdoor tobacco
advertising, sharp restrictions on the way cigarettes are marketed
and displayed in stores, and requirements that producers finance
both smoking-cessation programs and research into reducing underage
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   A few states are also seeking to persuade tobacco makers to drop
their lawsuit opposing federal regulation of tobacco, though a
similar demand by public health groups in last year's talks was
rejected by producers, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The new talks come three days after a state judge in Indiana
dismissed a lawsuit by state officials seeking to recover billions
of dollars in smoking-related health care costs. It marked the
biggest defeat suffered by a state since attorneys general began
filing actions against the industry in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana attorney general, Jeffrey Modisett, vowed to appeal
the ruling, in which the judge held that the state would have to
prove damage claims on a resident-by-resident basis.
</P>
<P>
   Modisett also said he believed the decision would have little
impact on the upcoming talks because producers are trying to
resolve cases with all the remaining states, including those that
have not filed lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this decision does show a need for a national
settlement,'' Modisett added. ``It would obviously make no sense if
the children of Illinois, Ohio and Michigan would receive
protection and the children of Indiana would not.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, some state officials like Mike Easley, the
North Carolina attorney general, have been working
behind-the-scenes in an effort to find a common ground among
various state positions.
</P>
<P>
   While North Carolina is one of only 10 states nationwide that
have not sued tobacco companies, Easley also played a key role in
helping to bring together negotiators in the talks that led to last
June's proposal. And Easley said in an interview that given the
failure of Congress, it was now up to state officials to strike the
best possible deal with producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to bring some resolution to this issue,'' said Easley,
a Democrat who has indicated his desire to run for governor of
North Carolina. ``There has been too much political rhetoric, too
much tough talk with little action.''
</P>
<P>
   Easley is not the only person that state officials have heard
from in recent weeks. State officials like Kelly said they have
received lists of suggested demands from anti-smoking advocates.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In addition, Matthew Myers, a lawyer for the Campaign for
Tobacco-Free Kids and a participant in last year's talks, has sent
out position papers to state officials arguing that industry
settlement talks represent the most significant pressure to produce
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that your leverage is not as great as it would be
if the package you were negotiating contained the types of benefits
that only Congress can give,'' he recently wrote. ``At the same
time, you should not underestimate your leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   For the industry, there are strong incentives to settle. The
state lawsuits represent the major regulatory and financial threat
they face. But lawyers familiar with the new talks said the
companies face their own negotiating dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   For example, while they were quick to give up advertising and
marketing concessions last year, they may be less willing to do so
this time, arguing that they need to retain such concessions as
bargaining chips in future negotiations with Congress over federal
regulation of nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   Also, going into this latest round of talks, producers sense
they may have the upper hand, said lawyers familiar with the
discussions. With so many states eager to settle, cigarette
producers believe that time and pressure may bring any hard-liners
back into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to put out something to get the majority of the
attorneys general behind it,'' said one industry consultant who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``And that could produce enough
momentum to get the rest of them to fall in line.''

 &HT;    Sutton enjoys pitcher-perfect day at induction
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Most days, it's good being Don Sutton. Golf
by day, talking baseball all night. A family bound by love and
gratitude. A gourmet's palate, along with enough money to amuse it.
More hair than any 53-year-old has a right to.
</P>
<P>
   Some days are even better than others.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, on an afternoon so perfect that it had to be auditioning
for a postcard, Sutton was given the last little bit of everything.
It's official now, he is the man who has it all.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've waited for this for more than 40 years,'' Sutton said
when accepting his place among the 237 artists-in-residence at
Baseball's Hall of Fame. The wait of a lifetime was so amply
rewarded, the warm blue of the day, the quaint charms of James
Fenimore Cooper's village, the sticky sentiment of the moment all
coming together to create a reality almost surpassing fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, kids, that curly-mopped guy sitting next to Skip in the
Braves broadcast booth could play a little baseball in his day. The
numbers _ 324 victories, 3,574 strikeouts _ may lose their sting
after awhile. But the title, Hall of Famer; that carries the big,
perpetual stick.
</P>
<P>
   ''(The Hall) was the only hole I had left in my work life. There
are no other holes left in my personal life,'' he said. That would
make Sutton the ultimate complete-game pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The mural of his life was spread out before him on the grassy
field here where they pledge the new members of fame's fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   There was his father, Howard Sutton, the one-time sharecropper
and construction worker who passed down the equation of
toil-equals-success. ''Pop, you never threw a single pitch, but you
were part of every one I threw,'' Sutton said
</P>
<P>
   Front row was his wife, Mary, and their 20-month-old daughter
Jacqueline, the imperiled preemie grown all bouncy and beautiful.
She happily munched on Cheerios whilst dad was getting fitted for
immortality. Once she learns to read, she'll just have to come back
and learn a little about the old man.
</P>
<P>
   The Turner Broadcasting family all gathered 'round one of its
own, leaving the descriptions of the day's Braves game to football
and basketball men. So be it. There will be a thousand and more
games for the regulars to call.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah, Don has a great life, he earned it,'' said his brother
in broadcasting, Skip Caray. ''Figure the odds were against him in
everything he accomplished. Think of the odds of just making it to
the major leagues, then to the Hall of Fame. They were against his
daughter, too, but she made it. Must run in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   No one would go unthanked Sunday. From the mythic players Sutton
chased in his childish imaginings, to every coach, teacher,
teammate, family member or co-worker who shared the trip, he
touched them all eloquently. His was an18-minute speech long on
remembrance and emotion, a ''six-month work in progress and I still
wasn't sure what I was going to say until I got up there,'' Sutton
said.
</P>
<P>
   When you are Don Sutton, there are not thanks enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a very blessed man,'' he said, ticking off the ways. ''I
have my health. . .my family. . .just the right number of friends.
. .I've had two of the best jobs in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have everything in life I ever wanted.''

A BALLET STAR'S EMOTIONAL JOURNEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Just seconds after Sylvie Guillem fell to the ground and
breathed her last in Kenneth MacMillan's ballet ``Manon,'' she was
taking her bow before the wine-red curtain of the Palais Garnier.
For a brief moment, still wearing the scruffy wig and tattered
clothes of the ill-fated Manon Lescaut, she looked tiny, even
vulnerable. Then a roar of bravos and applause filled the
auditorium, and she smiled shyly.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Guillem, the long-limbed French ballerina, is used to
ovations. Yet the occasion, early this month, was special. The
audience rose to its feet, flowers showered down on the stage, and
even the orchestra turned to applaud her. Laurent Hilaire, the
gifted French dancer who as De Grieux had just partnered Ms.
Guillem's exciting Manon, joined her, but he stood back modestly,
as if acknowledging that it was her evening.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, already a dancer of international renown, Ms.
Guillem walked out of the Paris Opera Ballet in a dispute with
Rudolf Nureyev, leaving her legion of hometown fans feeling
orphaned. Now, at the age of 33, she was back for just six
performances, and no one wanted her to leave again. The mysterious
synergy between performer and audience that creates the phenomenon
of stardom was again at work.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is not as if the Paris Opera Ballet is bereft of
fine dancers. Indeed, the company is going through one of its best
periods in many years. But occasionally dancers come along whose
artistry, stage presence, personality and fiery temperament make
them stand out from the crowd. In the world of opera, they are
known as divas. When Nureyev named Ms. Guillem an ``etoile,'' or
principal, in 1984, she was already such a dancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sylvie Guillem is a star in the best sense of the word,'' said
Hugues Gall, the general director of the Paris Opera, who is not
known for his tolerance of big-name tantrums. ``She brings a kind
of electricity to the stage. The orchestra plays better, the
dancers are better, the stage crew is better, even I am better. But
it's not only that she has star quality in her dancing. She also
sells. She's not just good, she's a good ticket seller. And that
excites everyone in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, her appearances here this summer _ twice in
Nureyev's ``Don Quixote,'' twice in his ``Romeo and Juliet'' and
twice in ``Manon'' _ were all sellouts. Many in the audience were
her fans from the 1980s who had remained loyal to her. But there
were also younger lovers of ballet _ and younger dancers _ who were
eager to see in flesh and blood someone who had become almost a
myth here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like coming home,'' Ms. Guillem said of the
19th-century opera house, which she first entered at the age of 11
when she joined the institution's famed ballet school. ``The Palais
Garnier was part of my childhood, my pseudo-adolescence, my life.
The response has been fabulous. When I come to Paris, people often
ask me: `When are you returning? We miss you.' I know people want
to see me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after the success of this visit, Paris may not have to wait
too long for her next return. Gall and Brigitte Lefevre, the
director of dance at the Paris Opera Ballet, have invited her to
appear as a guest artist for perhaps as many as a dozen
performances each season. And she may just do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems I had with the Paris Opera Ballet are a thing of
the past,'' Ms. Guillem said in an interview in her dressing room
at the Palais Garnier. ``I have no reason to avoid the Garnier
stage. I can return to the Paris Opera as a guest, just as I
perform at La Scala or Covent Garden, obviously under certain
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The conditions are not complicated: that she pick the ballet,
that she choose her partner and that her artistic views be taken
into account. They nonetheless represent the freedom she felt she
lacked in 1989 when she resigned from the Paris Opera Ballet and
moved to London to become principal guest artist at the Royal
Ballet at Covent Garden. Since then, she has also managed her own
career, frequently touring as a soloist and dancing as a guest with
other companies, including American Ballet Theater in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Rudolf Nureyev was happy to see me go,'' she offered,
``because I no longer conformed to the typical image of an etoile
at the opera. I couldn't stand it any longer. Every time I had an
opinion, I had to fight. And you know, when one person speaks out,
others follow. I think that's what they feared.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Royal Ballet, she was no less outspoken, having several
much-publicized confrontations with MacMillan, who, she recalled
with a mischievous smile, once called her ``such a boring French
star.'' And when other dancers at the Royal Ballet complained that
she did not join them in the cafeteria, she lived up to her
reputation for prickliness by retorting, ``If it's to talk about
the weather, why bother?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in person, she does not play the star. She is informal,
talkative and frank, and she laughs easily. But perhaps that is the
more mellowed Sylvie Guillem of the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still react violently to certain things, but less
systematically,'' she said, leaning back and resting her legs on
her crowded dressing room table. ``I now realize that you have to
learn to distinguish between fighting windmills and achieving
something. So perhaps I have acquired a bit of wisdom and
diplomacy. But, thank goodness, I can still react instinctively.''
</P>

<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, what some critics saw as the behavior of a diva a
decade ago is now viewed as evidence of character. ``She's a real
person,'' Gall said. ``She is what you expect from that kind of
artist. She is demanding, but in the right way, exactly like
Giorgio Strehler or Rudolf Nureyev or Callas. They have
professional demands, but they are not capricious.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Lefevre, who first persuaded Ms. Guillem to return here
to dance ``La Bayadere'' in 1994, the ballerina's main contribution
is artistic. ``She brings something very special,'' Ms. Lefevre
said. ``She has a vision. She is coherent. She has a strong idea of
what she dances. Her demands have never seemed unreasonable to me.
She makes much greater demands on herself. You get the impression
that she takes risks as an artist all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Ms. Guillem has changed, many dance critics say, is that
the young dancer who was accused of being coldly gymnastic now has
no fear of displaying her gaminelike sexiness and her raw emotions.
In ``Romeo and Juliet,'' for instance, she first appears as a
coquettish, self-conscious schoolgirl, her lively facial
expressions drawing the public's eye as much as her movements. By
the end of the ballet, she has become a tragic young woman tortured
by love and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, today she seems more interested in moving the audience
through her acting than amazing it through her legendary ultra-high
extensions. ``What you are looking for is for the public to hear
you, even if you are whispering,'' she explained. ``You sense the
response from the quality of the silence. You feel the tension; you
know when the audience holds its breath and when it breathes again,
when it is tense and when it relaxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Guillem credits the Royal Ballet for her more openly
expressive new style. ``I have learned a great deal from the
theatrical side of Covent Garden,'' she said. ``The Paris Opera
Ballet is more concerned with technique. It's perfect, it's
beautiful, it's well done. But it lacks the theatrical tradition
that is so important in England. At the Royal Ballet, absolutely
everyone on stage seems to be caught up in the plot.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, while she recently renewed her contract as principal
guest artist of the Royal Ballet, she continues to search for new
challenges. She has danced works by almost all the top
choreographers of the last 20 years, including younger creators
like William Forsythe, Mats Ek and Jonathan Burrows, but she keeps
looking, she said, ``because I have yet to find the person who
suits me 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   She is also careful to vary her repertory. ``There are some
ballets you can do for a long time,'' she said. ``With others, you
have to know when to stop. Some are very destructive. Forsythe's
choreography pushes dancers to the extreme. That's why it's best to
vary. That way you break your body a little bit in different
places, but not a lot in one place.''
</P>
<P>
   She has been lucky, she admits, suffering only minor injuries,
``a little back trouble, an occasional bad knee or ankle, nothing
serious.'' So she expects to be able to choose her moment of
retirement. But she also thinks about having children and wonders
whether she would then resume her career. ``I think you just have
to work on instinct,'' she said, ``to listen to your body.''
</P>
<P>
   So how would she like to be remembered?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was once on a plane with Rudolf Nureyev,'' she recalled,
``and the plane began to bounce around. I grabbed the seat
nervously, and Rudolf turned to me and said: `Ah, you're also
worried that the world will continue to turn without you.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inevitable. The world will still go round without me just
as it does without Rudolf. What's left of Rudolf? A few films, but
that doesn't tell the story. Dance is ephemeral. You have to be
there. You have to seize the moment. Then it's gone.''

WILLIAMS, WELLS COMBINE TO HELP YANKEES TO ANOTHER `W' 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JACK CURRY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bernie Williams is the epitome of gracefulness on a
baseball diamond. The center fielder wears the Yankee pinstripes
more than they wear him, he has an impeccable style and a
gentlemanly presence.
</P>
<P>
   David Wells is the epitome of sloppiness on a diamond. The
pitcher wears the illustrious pinstripes like an oversized $29
suit, he has a bouncer's style and a boorish image.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees needed something pretty from Williams and something
gritty from Wells to stymie the White Sox, 6-3, at Yankee Stadium
on Sunday and avoid losing a home series for the first time in this
special season.
</P>
<P>
   Because Williams homered, doubled and singled, and knocked in
two runs, and because Wells rumbled into the eighth inning and
struck out 10 despite having just two effective pitches, the
Yankees snared two of three from the weak Sox. The Yankees will
travel to the West Coast on Monday night with a glistening 73-26
record.
</P>
<P>
   The Bernie and Boomer show, which sounds more like two disk
jockeys during morning drive time than two millionaire baseball
players, satisfied Manager Joe Torre. Williams continued to display
how imposing he is in the middle of the lineup while Wells showed
that he will actually tussle, not collapse, if situations get
sticky. It was the same, reliable Williams and the new, reliable
Wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm aware of everything I'm doing,'' said Williams, who leads
the major leagues with a .355 average. ``I'm just trying not to be
complacent and start enjoying where I am. I don't want to sit back
and think about what I've done. Right now, I want to keep things
going.''
</P>
<P>
   So do the Yankees, who are one game behind the pace of the 1902
Pirates (74-25) for the best start of this century.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wells was not available to discuss a performance in which he
permitted three earned runs and seven hits over seven and
two-thirds innings because he breezed out of the clubhouse to grab
a flight to Florida to be home for Monday's off day. But other
Yankees spoke for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good day for all of us,'' Torre said. ``The story for
me was Wells fighting his way out of that one inning where they
tied it, and coming back to pitch the way he did.''
</P>
<P>
   That one inning was the top of the fifth, and it was ugly. Wells
had a 3-1 lead after Jorge Posada ripped a two-run homer in the
second and Williams singled in a run in the third, but it
evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   He issued a one-out walk to Mike Cameron and was lucky that
Posada nabbed the runner trying to steal second. But the usually
precise Wells walked the No. 9 batter, Robert Machado, and Ray
Durham slugged a 3-1 fastball over the center-field fence to even
the score.
</P>
<P>
   When Mike Caruso followed with a dribbler to first and Wells let
Tino Martinez's soft toss plop in and out of his glove, the signs
were aligned for a possible meltdown by the left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   Wells' gout-stricken right foot was annoying him, he needed to
put some padding in his cleat, the mound felt as hard as concrete
and the only pitches working were fastballs and curveballs.
</P>
<P>
   The old Wells might have vanished at this point. But this Wells
(12-2) rebounded to retire nine of the next 13 batters, including
getting the lifeless Frank Thomas to pop out to second base with
two on in the seventh. Thomas struck out twice and made the last
out in all four innings he batted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a different pitcher for me than he was last year,'' Torre
said. ``He's finding a way to adjust, to stay in the game and to do
good things. Last year he struggled and had problems getting back
to being effective.''
</P>
<P>
   But not Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have his best stuff and he still came out and
battled,'' Posada said. ``It was a good outing. He kept going after
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Williams helped Wells relax when he scorched Jamie
Navarro's first-pitch slider into the right-field seats to begin
the sixth, putting the Yanks ahead again, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius nicked Navarro for a bouncing single to score two
more important runs, but Williams, who also doubled and scored in
the second and fell a triple short of the cycle when he whiffed in
the seventh, was the batter who made and makes the Yankees fiercer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He drives in runs and does a lot of things you can't
replace,'' Martinez said. ``He's awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   An appreciative Torre said, ``He can pick us up on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were still a formidable team when Williams missed 31
games with a sprained right knee, but having Williams, the
switch-hitting cleanup man, between the left-handed hitters Paul
O'Neill and Martinez is a nice luxury because there is nowhere for
pitchers to hide.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is 13 for 35 (.371) since being activated on July 18
and is 47 for his last 107 (.439), the type of numbers that make
any player, graceful or sloppy, happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I can say is, I'm seeing the ball well,''
Williams said. ``I hope I keep it going into the post-season.''

GORDON CAPTURES PENNSYLVANIA 500 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG POND, Pa. _ Four tires or just two? That was pertinent
question at Sunday's Pennsylvania 500.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the race, Jeff Gordon saved valuable seconds in the pits
by taking on just two right side tires. Driving the fastest car on
the track, he had all the advantage he needed.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's rainbow-colored Chevrolet ran away from the field with
37 laps left and won the race, finishing 1.15 seconds ahead of Mark
Martin, who was second. Jeff Burton finished third.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gordon's fifth victory this season and his third career
victory at Pocono. It was, however, his first victory in the
Pennsylvania 500. His two previous victories here came in the
Pocono 500, in which he was second last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a great idea to take two tires,'' said
Gordon, whose lead in the NASCAR drivers' championship was extended
to 62 points over Martin. ``Until I got out on the track and found
out everyone else took four. Then I thought, `Uh oh.'''
</P>
<P>
   About his pit-lane gamble, Gordon's crew chief Ray Evernham
said: ``I really thought that more people would do two tires. I
didn't want to get the car back in traffic. It was running so much
better in clean air. I was concerned when Bobby Labonte and a few
other guys took on four.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon dominated Sunday's race, leading 164 of the 200 laps. His
Monte Carlo roared around the 2.5 mile tri-oval at an average speed
of 134.654 mph.
</P>
<P>
   When running in the clear, Gordon's car accelerated away from
the field, leading by as much as 5 seconds on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the car set up to run out front,'' said Gordon. ``When
other cars got close, it was really tight.''
</P>
<P>
   After a mostly uneventful first half to the race, a battle for
the lead between Gordon and Earnhardt on lap 136 made things
exciting. Gordon passed the black No. 3, and Earnhardt, who
finished seventh, ran into Gordon's rear bumper, not once, but
twice. Both cars slid to the top of the track, and were
subsequently passed.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Dale Earnhardt Jr. was penalized for the same
kind of aggressive driving on Saturday night in the Busch race in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes it interesting out there,'' said Gordon. ``I
was a little upset at the time, but I expect that from Dale. He
lives up to his nickname, `The Intimidator.' But I thought it was
going to be worse than it was.''
</P>
<P>
   After the skirmish with Earnhardt, Gordon fell to fifth place.
But a caution moments later on lap 145 saw all of the cars head for
pit lane. Quick work by Gordon's pit crew put him out front, and
the quick thinking of Evernham on the final stop _ a stop caused by
a crash _ put Gordon in the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   Having the best car on the track doesn't always mean victory,
especially in Winston Cup competition. But when a fast car is
backed up by a fast pit crew, winning is much easier. Gordon and
his team prove that regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's victory also moved Chevrolet into a tie with Ford,
128-128, in the manufacturers championship after 18 of the 33
events. Both automakers have eight victories this season.

DOBY AND SUTTON GET THEIR JUST REWARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLAIRE SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ In a little less than a year, major-league
baseball will gather again in this hamlet to salute its latest Hall
of Fame inductees. Nolan Ryan should stand out among them, not only
as the greatest strikeout pitcher ever, but the last of the
pitchers to win at least 300 games and strike out at least 3,000
batters.
</P>
<P>
   It is a small club, numbering only seven. Amazingly, all but
Walter Johnson are of Ryan's generation.
</P>
<P>
   Of Ryan's peers, Tom Seaver and Steve Carlton were equally as
celebrated, Gaylord Perry and Phil Niekro were considered more
crafty, wily and colorful. Then there was Don Sutton, the worker
bee of his generation, a pitcher who always seemed caught in the
slip stream of more glamorous peers but who nonetheless won 324
games and struck out 3,574 batters, the fifth highest total
all-time.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton's drive and the fires that fueled it were rewarded
Sunday. The pitcher who religiously punched the clock without fail
for 23 major-league seasons received his gold watch for a job well
done when Sutton he became the sixth member of the magnificent
seven to be installed in Baseball's Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander who pitched for the Los Angeles Dodgers,
Houston Astros, Milwaukee Brewers, Oakland A's and California
Angels, was inducted into the shrine at Cooperstown, sharing the
stage and honor with the barrier-breaking Larry Doby and Lee
MacPhail, an architect of seven Yankee World Series championship
teams and a former American League president.
</P>
<P>
   Also inducted were Negro League all-star pitcher Bullet Joe
Rogan and 19th century shortstop George Davis. Sam Lacy, 94, one of
the first African-American members of the Baseball Writers
Association of America was honored as the recipient of the Ford C.
Frick award. Jaime Jarrin, who has broadcast Dodgers games in
Spanish in Southern California and Latin America for 40 years, was
presented the J.G. Taylor Spink Award.
</P>
<P>
   Doby, the first African-American to play in the American League,
joining the Cleveland Indians 11 weeks after the Brooklyn Dodgers'
Jackie Robinson broke the major-league color barrier in April 1947,
spoke joyously of his place in history. ``I'll take second,'' Doby
said. ``Second ain't all that bad!''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton also knew how to graciously stand in the shadows of
giants. ``I always felt like I was never perceived that I was as
good as those guys, and I thought realistically that the skills I
possessed were not as good as those guys,'' said Sutton of the star
pitchers from his generation. ``That led me to believe that I had
to work harder, because I always wanted my end result to be in the
same neighborhood as those guys. So, was I pushed by them? You're
darned right that I was.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When the push ended in triumph Sunday, it not only moved Sutton,
one of the more eloquent and polished players and currently a
broadcaster, to tears. It also brought a satisfying end to a
lifelong labor of love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was driven, for a number of reasons,'' Sutton said after
delivering an emotional speech before a sun-drenched crowd. ``My
mom and dad were tenant farmers and sharecroppers when I was born,
so I've never known anything but work. I don't know if the hunger
would have been different, but I do know if I had grown up
different, I would not have had the blueprint or the work ethic.
Because that is all I knew, from day one.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, now 53, acknowledges having aimed for Cooperstown for
more than 40 years, because it's where his boyhood heroes resided.
He always understood that the best rewards could only be remain in
focus if viewed through the prism of hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton was blessed in that he had the best teachers, most of
whom were thanked Sunday. There were the greats, like Sandy Koufax
and Don Drysdale. But notably, also mentioned, were the 23 years'
worth of catchers, coaches, managers, peers, the Walter Alstons,
Red Adamses, Jeff Torborgs, and just as important, the original
architect of Sutton's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad,'' he said of the late Howard Sutton, ``went to work
every day. My dad never made excuses and never asked for anything
for nothing. He gave me a work plan I could have plugged in to any
business. If I hadn't been good at baseball I would have been good
at something.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a quarter of a century, Sutton went to work, never
missing a start due to injury or illness. Now, at last, the pitcher
whose collar was always bluer than his blood knows he can stand
down. ``I've had a validation that what my dad taught me long ago
is true: if you're willing to work for it you can earn a dream come
true,'' Sutton said. ``I now have everything in life I ever
wanted.''

MILLS COMPLEMENTS IRVIN, AND COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Soft-spoken and reserved, receiver Ernie
Mills has already proven to be the perfect complement to Michael
Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   He talks barely above a whisper and admits that he's ``not an
outgoing big-personality guy'' but rather a ``fit-in type'' _ both
stark contrasts to the exuberant Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys are trying to decide how Mills fits opposite
Irvin in the starting lineup. Mills, a seven-year veteran, is vying
with former special-teams star Billy Davis for the No. 2 receiver
spot.
</P>
<P>
   True to his persona, Mills views the position battle with little
fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   A year removed from thoughts of retirement during an forgettable
stint in Carolina, Mills said all he wants is an opportunity to
contribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being the No. 2 receiver was not my goal coming in,'' Mills
said. ``If it happens fine, but I learned my lesson last year. You
can start and not get the ball thrown your way. My thing is when I
get an opportunity. I want to make the most of it. I want to make
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills rarely played in Carolina last season. After opening the
season as the starter, he was made inactive for six games and
caught only 11 passes.
</P>
<P>
   The former Florida standout _ who caught 127 passes for 2,003
yards during the previous six seasons in Pittsburgh _ said he
thought about quitting during the middle of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost thought about not playing anymore,'' Mills said.
``The first time I was inactive, I just went home and didn't talk
to anybody. I turned the phone off. The only time I'd ever been
inactive before it was because I was hurt. I got real down.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of giving up, Mills turned to the film room. There
were questions about whether Mills had fully recovered from a knee
injury he sustained in the 1995 Super Bowl against the Cowboys, but
he came to the conclusion that he still had the ability to play.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said he went back and practiced as hard as he could. Even
though his playing time didn't increase, he said he wasn't going to
let the slights by the Carolina coaching staff affect his work
ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why I didn't play,'' Mills said. ``They just said
they were doing some things and trying some things. I could have
ranted and raved. But I'm not that type of player.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey, formerly the Steelers' wide receivers
coach and offensive coordinator, certainly remembered what type of
player Mills was in Pittsburgh. Gailey didn't hesitate in making
Mills the first significant addition of his tenure, signing the
free-agent receiver 15 days after being hired to coach the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Though not as fast as he used to be, Mills has done nothing to
change Gailey's impression the first two weeks of training camp. He
has been the most consistent receiver in practice and has shown
hands that rival Irvin's.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminds me exactly of what left Pittsburgh,'' Gailey said.
``He's come in and played well so far. That's good enough for me. I
don't know what happened there \RCarolina\S. But everybody probably
has a year in their life they'd like to forget.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernie and I have been through a lot of wars together,'' Gailey
added. ``I've seen him make a lot of big plays in big games.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's hiring made the Cowboys attractive to the receiver as
well. Mills had been contacted by a few teams after the season, but
this was the best fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have asked for a better situation,'' Mills said.
``It's hard changing teams. When you have knowledge of the offense,
you can go right in and give 100 percent effort. And however things
fall, they fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills has already made a significant contribution to the team
with his knowledge of the offense. Quarterback Troy Aikman said
Mills is like an extra coach on the field, proving helpful to the
receivers and the quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been helpful for the receivers and great for me,'' Aikman
said. ``There have been times when I've asked him what the
receivers are trying to get accomplished on certain things. Plus,
he's just a good guy. I've enjoyed the time I've played with him.''
</P>
<P>
   That knowledge, Gailey's faith in him, the growing comfort level
with Aikman and his superb practice performances have many
onlookers believing Mills will win the starting job opposite Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't expect any end-zone dances.

METROPOLITAN DIARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ENID NEMY with RON ALEXANDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A weekly column featuring readers' reports on life in the Big
Apple.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   One day recently, I left my office in the Empire State Building
to meet a friend in SoHo and I was running late. I hailed a cab,
but a couple of tourists immediately jumped in the back, and it
sped off. I flagged another one and again someone else got in
before I could even blink.
</P>
<P>
   Fuming, I hailed a third cab. When it stopped, I saw a little
old lady step off the curb and head for the rear door. I sprinted
toward the taxi, yelling, ``Don't you even think about it _ that's
my cab!''
</P>
<P>
   She very calmly whacked me with her handbag, got into my taxi
and sped off.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, I was seething. I gave up and started to walk
toward the subway, muttering obscenities under my breath. A very
nicely turned out woman came up and grabbed my elbow. I spun around
and snarled, ``Get your hands off me.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman explained that she had witnessed my taxi tribulations.
``I can't believe how rude they are,'' she said. ``Here, get in my
car.'' Her chauffeur drove me downtown in record time. My dining
companion was more than a little impressed when he opened the door
for me.
</P>
<P>
   _ DAPHNE MATALENE
</P>
<P>
   The woman was obviously out of patience with her dog, which was
on a leash but apparently had a mind of its own. Anne Tutnauer,
walking behind them, heard a plaintive plea: ``Susie, will you
please walk in my direction?''
</P>
<P>
   A sprained ankle and a broken bone sent Miriam Hecht to the
Hospital for Special Surgery. After paying her X-ray bill with a
credit card, she hobbled away from the cashier and looked at the
receipt. ``Thank you,'' it read. ``Please come again.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend reports that her favorite Italian deli, Jerry's on East
17th Street off Union Square, recently announced their price
increase with more than a dash of panache. No pathetic little sign
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Their notice read: ``Due to El Nino, the astrological
configuration, gentrification of the neighborhood, the new euro
dollar value, Prosecutor Kenneth Starr, tomato prices, rain, vendor
angst, the Spice Girls agenda, too many tattoos, and the cost of
tequila, there has been a slight raise in prices. Thank you for
understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   If that melange doesn't merit a raise, what does?
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   Reading about recent taxi experiences reminded me of the one I
had trying to hail a taxi to the hospital to deliver my son. It was
6 p.m. on a very rainy weekday and I was at my doctor's office at
Madison and 57th Street when my labor pains began. I was told to
meet the doctor at New York University Downtown Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I had a very difficult time hailing a cab and
after a half-hour we decided to walk on Park Avenue, thinking
someone might be returning home and we'd get the cab. With no luck
and my increasing discomfort, we remained on a street corner and a
cab finally stopped for a woman who was perhaps 50 feet ahead of
us. My husband ran up to her and explained why we needed the cab
and where we had to go, but she refused to give it up.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I waddled up, elbowed her aside and jumped in. The last
words we heard were ``At least you can drop me off at Penn
Station.''
</P>
<P>
   _ DEBORAH LEWIS
</P>
<P>
   Alex and Sally Bedrosian stopped off at a small East Village bar
recently where a handwritten sign on a large jar read, ``TIP-PING
IS NOT A CITY IN CHINA.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   I was at the corner of 80th Street and Lexington Avenue, waiting
for the light to change. Two well-dressed women standing beside me
watched in amazement as a pair of bicycle messengers came barreling
down Lexington at breakneck speed. As the bikers whizzed past and
careered onto 80th Street, ignoring the red traffic light, one
woman turned to the other. ``Isn't it awful,'' she said. ``And you
know, there's no one you can sue if they kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   _ CAROL W. HELMS
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   I was standing in a supermarket checkout line behind a woman and
her two young daughters. The girls offered a variety of reasons Mom
should give them 50 cents for a vending machine. Mom stood her
ground but finally cracked when the littlest one begged, ``Mommy,
please, I'll give you a dollar for 50 cents.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Susan Lyle and Lynn Hutchings were pleased with the window they
decorated for Frette, the Madison Avenue linen store. They invited
friends and clients to drop by the store for champagne and a
viewing. Clint Rodenberg, one of the guests at the gathering,
overheard this comment from a woman in the crowd: ``Isn't New York
wonderful? Where else would you be invited to the opening of a
window?''
</P>
<P>
   His question: Can an invitation to the closing of a door be far
behind?
</P>
<P>
   The scene: A flight from Atlanta to La Guardia Airport on its
final descent passing over Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   The players: Jerald T. Milanich, sitting in front of two
youngsters, about 9 and 10 years old, and a woman, probably their
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Woman: ``Look out the window. You might see the Statue of
Liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Child No. 1, excited and loud: ``Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, that's
it! There it is! The Statue of Liberty, on that little island!
Look! Look!''
</P>
<P>
   Child No. 2, louder: ``Take a picture! Take a picture!''
</P>
<P>
   Click, click.
</P>
<P>
   Child No. 1, even louder: ``There, there, there's the Empire
State Building! Gimme the camera! Get a picture!''
</P>
<P>
   Child No. 2, practically screaming: ``Oh my gosh! Look! Over
there! Take a picture! Take a picture! It's the Eiffel Tower!''
</P>
<P>
   The entire coach cabin breaks up laughing.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Saturday night at ``The Lion King'' and the children in
the audience were entranced and silent. At one point, the hero,
Simba, says, ``Sometimes I don't know who I am.'' John Hallow was
one of the adult audience who exploded with laughter when a sweet
little voice from the mezzanine called out helpfully, ``You're
Simba.''

   Laura Kiesewetter and Elby Schneidman had just seen Liam Neeson
as Oscar Wilde at a matinee of ``The Judas Kiss.'' They decided to
have a quick bite at John's Pizza, where the menu includes pasta
dishes with a choice of sauce. Ms. Schneidman asked the waiter,
``Would you tell me what I can have the sauce on?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything you like, madam,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that case, I'll have the bolognese sauce on Liam Neeson,''
she replied.

MILITANT ABORTION FOE SEEKS GOP NOMINATION FOR CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEPOSIT, N.Y. _ The day was sweltering and cloudless, perfect
for the annual lumberjack festival in this verdant hamlet west of
the Catskills. As burly men sawed thick logs and vendors hawked the
latest in chain saws, Randall Terry, militant abortion foe turned
Republican candidate for Congress, was working the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Lanky and intense, he cooed over children, kissed elderly women
and promised businessmen tax cuts. But when he came to the young
woman selling pizza, she looked past him with an icy gaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I do to make you like me?'' Terry asked, sounding
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' she replied. ``Our ideas are just too far apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry, the founder of Operation Rescue, is learning a thing or
two about the delicate art of winning votes. Gone are the days of
thrusting photographs of bloody fetuses into the faces of pregnant
women, chaining himself to operating tables, shouting down nurses,
harassing doctors and creating general mayhem outside abortion
clinics around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In are the endless hours of campaign tedium, shaking hands,
attending fund-raising events and asking a steady stream of
sometimes friendly, often hostile strangers to like him just enough
to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not running a protest candidacy; I'm not running a
candidacy to inspire people,'' he said at his campaign headquarters
in Windsor, near the Pennsylvania border. ``I'm running to win.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when prominent social conservatives like Gary Bauer of
the Family Research Council and Donald Hodel of the Christian
Coalition have been excoriating the Republican Party, saying it has
sold out Christian conservatives, Terry has gone one step further.
</P>
<P>
   He is running to transform from within a party that he says has
failed true conservatives too many times by tolerating abortion,
government financing for the arts, commerce with godless socialist
nations, excessive taxes and homosexuality. ``This terrifies the
Republican leadership,'' he said, waving an endorsement letter from
James Dobson, an influential social conservative. ``We are the hard
core of the Republican Party, as measured by primary voters:
pro-lifers, home schoolers, Second Amendmentists, antitax,
patriotic American activists. And if they keep offending us, and we
stay at home or go somewhere else, they have no party.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, his campaign has few fans among Republican
Party stalwarts. Most Republican organizations in the 26th
Congressional District _ which runs from Newburgh through
Binghamton to Ithaca _ and party leaders in Albany and Washington
are supporting his major rival in the Republican and Conservative
Party primaries, William Bud Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shudder when I read some of the hateful things that Bud's
opponent, Randall Terry, has said and written about people who
disagree with him,'' wrote Rep. Gerald Solomon, a conservative
Republican from Glens Falls, in a letter supporting Walker. ``I
will continue to fight for conservative principles and against the
Randall Terrys and David Dukes of this world.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream Republicans contend that Terry will pound a wedge
between the party's moderate and conservative wings, driving
centrists into the arms of Democrats. And they say that even if he
loses the primary on Sept. 15, Terry will continue to wreak havoc
on the party by running on small-party lines in November. Those
parties are likely to siphon votes from Walker, helping the
Democratic incumbent, Rep. Maurice Hinchey, who is considered one
of the most vulnerable incumbents in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Terry is running unopposed in the Right to Life Party primary
and has a strong chance of winning the Conservative Party primary,
said Michael Long, the Conservative Party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who would rather control their destiny, and
lose elections, than make accommodations to other people,'' said
Rep. Amo Houghton, a moderate Republican from Elmira, who is facing
a primary challenge from an ally of Terry's, the Rev. James Pierce,
a fundamentalist minister with a church near Corning.

</P>
<P>
   Pierce is one of six candidates Terry recruited to run for
Congress in 1998, calling them the ``Patrick Henry Men'' after the
patriot whose fiery speeches incited opposition to the British. (
Terry has vowed to field 25 Congressional candidates in 2000.)
</P>
<P>
   Three of the six have dropped out or lost primaries, and the
rest are considered long shots. But one, Joseph Slovenec, won a
Republican primary and will face Rep. Dennis Kucinich, a first-term
Democrat from Cleveland, in November.
</P>
<P>
   Though political analysts say Terry is clearly the underdog in
his race, they say he must be taken seriously because of his drive,
charisma and ability to raise money: at least $700,000 in the last
year, more than Hinchey and Walker combined. The vast majority of
those funds have flowed from outside the state through Terry's
connections to fundamentalist churches and anti-abortion groups.
</P>
<P>
   His large war chest has enabled him to broadcast radio or
television commercials fairly consistently since December, to
distribute thousands of slick promotional videos and to assemble an
inexperienced but devoted staff of 10, plus 50 volunteer workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a shot just because he has such celebrity status,''
said Kelli Conlin, executive director of the New York Chapter of
the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Rochester public school teachers, Terry formed
Operation Rescue in the Binghamton area in 1986. But he drifted
away from the group several years ago when the anti-abortion
movement began to fragment.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits brought by the National Organization for Women helped
hasten the group's demise: in 1991, Terry was ordered to pay the
group $16,000 in damages and to stop organizing clinic protests. He
still owes much of that money, prompting Terry to say, ``If I go to
Congress, I'll be working for NOW.''
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving Operation Rescue, Terry, 39, has made a living
giving speeches around the country. He is also the host of a
one-hour radio program, ``Randall Terry Live!,'' five days a week
and runs what is described as a ``Christian leadership'' school on
his 120-acre farm in Windsor, where he lives with his wife, Alice,
and three children.
</P>
<P>
   But while he has abandoned protest for politics _ a move he says
he has contemplated for many years _ Terry has not forsaken the
hard-right conservatism and fundamentalist Christian theology that
underpinned Operation Rescue. He would abolish federal income taxes
and local property taxes, end government's role in financing and
operating schools, phase out the Social Security system and return
America to what he calls Christian-based politics founded on
reverence for the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   His oratory matches his proposals. Property taxes are a form of
serfdom, he says. Government officials are ``a bunch of
well-dressed horse thieves.'' Homosexuality is destroying the
institution of marriage. ``government should be our quiet,
righteous servant,'' he says on his campaign video. ``It has become
an arrogant, often evil master.''
</P>
<P>
   But if he can still sound like a firebrand preacher, there are
also new, gentler wrinkles to Randall Terry, the politician. He has
hired a political pollster to help ``refine'' his message, though
he rarely seems to follow the advice. He talks about taxes far more
often than about abortion. And he points to Patrick Henry, Winston
Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt and Harry Truman as his heroes and
political inspirations, citing them almost as often as the Bible in
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roosevelt was a die-hard Christian who believed that
self-government under the fear of God was the foundation of the
Republic,'' Terry said in his office, where photocopies of the
Constitution, the Bill of Rights and a sepia-toned photograph of
Roosevelt hang from the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction in the district to Terry's campaign has been sharply
mixed. Many have sour memories of his early take-no-prisoners
abortion protests in Binghamton in the 1980s. ``He's softened up
his aggressiveness, but it's going to take a long time before
people forget his divisive ways,'' said Robert Moppert, a
Republican who ran against Hinchey in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But an elderly woman in Deposit remembered him as a hero. ``God
bless you for your abortion work,'' she told him.
</P>
<P>
   And a Deposit businessman who said he had not known anything
about Terry came away liking his antitax message. ``He's a small
businessman like me, which means he can relate to my problems,''
said the businessman, Dick Buffington, 62.
</P>
<P>
   Terry's critics say his softer style is just a new veneer for
his old extremism. To make their point, they have circulated quotes
from speeches in which Terry praised intolerance committed in the
name of God, endorsed executing doctors who perform abortions and
called Gov. George Pataki ``evil'' for supporting abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's supporters have also accused Terry of being a tax
protester because he failed to pay nearly $7,000 in state income
taxes from 1990 to 1994. Terry, who has paid those taxes with
penalties and interest, said he was late because of cash-flow
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, 42, is a genial, soft-spoken, fourth-generation apple
farmer from Ulster County who received a business degree from
Harvard. He calls himself a social moderate and fiscal
conservative, supporting abortion rights with restrictions, an
array of tax cuts and smaller government. But he has fiercely
attacked Terry's calls for ending Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a radical, extreme position that will drive people in
the other direction,'' Walker told a group of business owners and
Republican officials in Owego.
</P>
<P>
   A third candidate in the Republican primary, Douglas Walter
Drazen, 37, a lawyer from Binghamton, has tried to position himself
as the reform candidate. But he has raised almost no money and has
virtually no campaign organization.
</P>
<P>
   Terry dismisses Republican accusations that he is a wild-eyed
radical. He is mining for a vein of discontent in America that runs
deeper than party loyalty, he says. And if nothing else, he adds
with a wry smile, he will make Congress interesting.
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, Terry's spokesman, Gary McCullough, kicks into the
campaign's theme song, Billy Joel's ``You May Be Right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You may be right _ I may be crazy,'' McCullough growls. ``But
it just may be a lunatic you're looking for.''

TWO PITCHES, TWO LOSSES, TOO BAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In the end, two pitches turned out to be the
difference between a sweep and a four-game split, the difference
between the Mets trailing the Cubs by a half game in the National
League wild-card race or the three-and-a-half games the Mets find
themselves behind Chicago once again.
</P>
<P>
   Two pitches, and two extremely important walks that preceded
them.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, it was a one-out walk to Jose Hernandez and a two-run
sixth-inning blast by Sammy Sosa off Rick Reed that erased a 1-0
lead and sparked the Cubs to a 3-1 victory at Wrigley Field behind
20-year-old sensation Kerry Wood. It was Sosa's 38th home run. On
Saturday, it was a one-out walk to Kevin Orie and a pinch-hit
eighth-inning home run by Glenallen Hill that did the Mets in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were two pitches away from winning seven games on a road
trip that was supposed to put us in the coffin and throw dirt on
the grave,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said, after the Mets (54-48)
finished 5-2 over their five-day trip to Milwaukee and Chicago.
``But the season wasn't going to be over after this trip. We feel
good about the way we're playing. You don't win them all in a row,
you win them over time. We won five out of seven. We can build on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the Mets did not lose any ground during the trip, they
did not pick any up, either, despite sweeping a pair of
doubleheaders in the first three days. And had Bernard Gilkey been
able to do more than strike out on three pitches for the game's
final out with runners on second and third, the Mets might have had
a little more to build on coming into a 10-game homestand that
begins Tuesday night at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey, who took two sliders on the outside corner from Rod Beck
before flailing at a fast ball out of the strike zone, was not the
only one. The Mets finished 0-for-7 with runners in scoring
position, leaving runners on second and third in both the eighth
and the ninth. The only run they scored came on Brian McRae's
third-inning home run, as Wood (10-5), who struck out six, tossed
seven innings of four-hit ball.
</P>
<P>
   Reed (11-7), a first time All-Star, felt he had been slightly
outpitched by the rookie right-hander. But that was arguable. In
six innings, Reed allowed only five hits. What bothered Reed most
was the at-bat before he allowed Sosa's home run, when he walked
Hernandez on a full-count fastball. Coming into the game, Reed was
third in the league in fewest walks per nine innings at 1.3.
Sunday, he walked two Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The home run doesn't bother me,'' said Reed. ``It's the walk
that irritated the heck out of me. We might still be playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Sosa _ who said he was more patient Sunday _ took two
curveballs for strikes, a fastball outside that just missed,
another fastball outside that missed by more. Reed then hung a
curveball, something he rarely does, and Sosa launched it into the
shrubs in dead center field, not far from where Hill's game-winner
had landed on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say, I went to the well one too many times with the
curveball,'' Reed said. ``But we still had chances to win. It
wasn't like I gave up a 17-run home run.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It might as well have been, the way the Mets weren't hitting
this afternoon. And for the umpteenth time this season, Gilkey
simply could not come through in the clutch.
</P>
<P>
   The struggling left fielder was out of the starting lineup for
the sixth straight game, and has now come off the bench in seven of
the last eight. He missed a start in the second game of Friday's
doubleheader sweep because of a migraine. He spent all of Saturday
night feeling sick to his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   After striking out in each of the final two innings Sunday,
Gilkey, whose batting average has sunk to .227, all but admitted he
has become is a defensive replacement.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if his struggles over the last two seasons were
finally getting to him, Gilkey, who will make $4.8 million this
season and $5 million the next two, said, ``I'm not going to let
them. I just have to adjust and learn how to play in this
situation. How to come off the bench and help the team. I haven't
had to do this in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was angry with his new role as the team's fourth
outfielder, Gilkey said, ``I don't care to get upset. I was sick
all night. There isn't any sense in being mad. We're trying to win.
I'm trying to find another alternative _ like preparation. I have
to learn how to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like the rest of the Mets still must learn how to give
their starters more support. Had Reed had more of a cushion Sunday,
Sosa's home run _ and the walk that preceded it _ would not have
stung nearly so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel in this ball park, we've got to give him a few
more runs to work with,'' Mike Piazza said in Reed's defense.
``Pitching with a one-run lead here is tough to do. The offense
could have helped him out a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   Rey Ordonez played catch before the game for the first time
since pulling an oblique muscle Friday and said he might take
batting practice Tuesday. And it does not look like he will wind up
on the disabled list, after all. ``Rey was feeling much better,''
Manager Bobby Valentine said of his Gold Glove shortstop. ``It's
pretty unlikely that he will go on the DL.'' ... The 121,449 people
in attendance for the three-date series was the largest in Wrigley
Field history. ... After the game, Valentine said that the rotation
would remain intact and that Armando Reynoso would pitch out of the
bullpen. ... Todd Hundley, who struck out twice looking at backdoor
curve balls from Kerry Wood, said the hard-throwing rookie reminded
him of an old teammate. ``His fast ball reminds me a lot of Doc
Gooden,'' Hundley said. ``The rise and the way it explodes into the
zone.'' ... Wood was asked why he did not retaliate after Brian
McRae's demonstrative response to his third-inning home run. ``I'd
much rather get him out,'' said Wood, who retired McRae on flies to
left his next two times up.

FAMILY DESCRIBES SUSPECT AS TROUBLED MAN WITH PARANOID DELUSIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (See related stories: CAPITOL-VICTIM, CAPITOL-POLICE) 
(sw) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALMEYER, Ill. _ A few days before the shootings at the U.S.
Capitol, Russell Eugene Weston Jr.'s family noticed slight changes
in his behavior. Usually he stayed fairly close to his family's
property, on a rural road next to a railroad track, but on Tuesday
or Wednesday, he had ``a burst of coming out and seeing people,''
his sister, April Callahan, recalls.
</P>
<P>
   He ``was out digging day lilies on the bluff,'' said Ms.
Callahan, who lives about 15 miles away, ``and he came over to our
house and offered me some. He never came to see us very often.'' He
also went to visit a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Callahan said her brother, nicknamed Rusty, was ``not angry
or agitated.'' He was ``saying very delusional things'' about the
government being out to get him, she said, but they were the kinds
of things the family had heard from him for years, warning her, for
instance that ``the government will give you a drug that will make
you forget your real life.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, the day before the Capitol shootings, a
more unsettling incident occurred, the family said on Sunday in a
series of extraordinary, emotional interviews. Weston's father,
Russell E. Weston Sr., 66, discovered two of his cats, Little Bit
and Tiger, in a bucket, shot dead. He confronted his son, who
admitted that within the last day he had shot a total of 14 cats
with a .20 gauge single-barrel shotgun, and had buried 12 on the
property, where his parents and grandmother live.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it the great cat caper,'' said Weston's mother, Arbah
Jo. ``We had too many cats. His grandma had requested that he thin
the cats out, and that's what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Weston was angry. ``I was mad and hurt, both, and I
went over to my son and I said, `Rusty, I've got to give you 10
days to find another place to live. Because I would not put up with
that being cruel to animals. `Oh,' he said, `Dad, just calm
down.'''
</P>
<P>
   A short while later, Weston saw his son get into his 1983 red
Chevrolet S-10 pickup truck and head west down the narrow farm lane
lined on both sides with waist-high corn. The family thought he was
going to the nearby town of Waterloo to get a new fan belt for his
truck, with $50 that his grandmother, Lillie Weston, had given him.
</P>
<P>
   But roughly 30 hours later, law enforcement authorities say,
Weston, 41, walked into the Capitol building in Washington, shot
two police officers to death and wounded a tourist. The Westons
believe that their son may have used his father's .38 caliber Smith
and Wesson revolver, which is missing from its usual place under a
heating pad by his parents' bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had never said what I did,'' the elder Weston said on
Sunday, his voice riven with pain. ``Wishing, wishing, wishing. And
the one wish I had is that it's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell Weston Jr. was shot several times and was listed in
critical condition at a Washington hospital until Sunday, when
doctors said his condition was better, upgraded to serious. His
family said they had been told that his chest wound was
superficial, but that he had lost a lot of blood and an arm and leg
were badly damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors taking charge of the criminal case against
Weston are expected to seek to move the case on Monday into federal
court and out of District of Columbia courts. An FBI complaint
against Weston was filed on Sunday in District of Columbia Superior
Court, but the case was expected to be moved to U.S. District Court
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement authorities searched the family's home on
Saturday, taking two typewriters and the son's two filing cabinets
stuffed with papers he kept, the Westons said. But no one in the
family could tell investigators what they really wanted to know,
what could have been the motivation for Weston to commit such a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   In lengthy interviews on Sunday, Weston's parents, sister and
grandmother drew a portrait of a man who had held paranoid
delusions for nearly 20 years, as he shifted his life between a
cabin in Montana and the lime green frame house outside Valmeyer
that had been in his family for four generations.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, in his fantasies, he was either being pursued by
government agents, Navy Seals or snipers because he had top-secret
information, or he was working for the government on a mission to
help the Secret Service or the CIA protect the president. Sometimes
he said the fillings in his teeth were radio transmitters and the
government was sending him messages through them. And he said he
thought there were atomic bombs buried near his Montana cabin.
</P>
<P>
   One of his most bizarre fantasies revolved around a girl who had
apparently been kidnapped in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``He formulated the plan that this guy had abducted her and that
Clinton had bought her and raised her as his daughter,'' Mrs.
Weston said. And his father added, ``He never could get over the
fact that that little girl had disappeared. He worried and he
worried about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But another time, Ms. Callahan said, ``he came to us with a
story that somebody was after President Clinton and he was on a
secret mission to protect President Clinton. So, it went from one
thing to another.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Twice a few years ago, his family said, he went to Washington.
The first time, he bought a suit for the occasion at a local store.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went to the offices of the FBI, CIA, Secret Service,'' his
father said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was either on a secret mission or they were going to hire
him,'' Mrs. Weston said. But the Westons said they did not think
their son was especially obsessed with Washington and they said he
never mentioned Congress or any politicians besides Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The family and law enforcement officers in Illinois and Montana
say that Weston was never violent. But in recent years, his parents
and sister had become increasingly concerned as his mental problems
seemed to worsen.
</P>
<P>
   They were at a loss about Weston's illness, which they said was
diagnosed in his late 20s as paranoid schizophrenia. He received no
regular psychiatric treatment or medication over the last two
decades, and the family seemed to understand little about how to
seek help for him or what medical treatments were available for
someone with his symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Weston was institutionalized for 53 days in Montana in 1996 and
came back to Illinois with three medications, his family said (they
did not remember what kind), but after a week or so he refused to
take them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told him back in 1996 he could stay if he took his
medication,'' Mrs. Weston said, sitting at a table in her dining
room, near an old grandfather clock and a china cabinet. ``But he
stopped. What are you going to do with a 41-year-old man?''
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Weston's mental problems did not begin to show themselves
until he was in his early 20s, his family said on Sunday, as they
sat before a set of photographs spread out on the table: Rusty as a
youngster in a Boy Scout uniform, with members of the family, and
as an adult, in sunglasses and a plaid shirt, panning for gold in
Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Now they wonder if he suffered brain damage from a head injury
he suffered at the age of 6 or 7, when a woman at a miniature golf
course crashed her golf cart into him, but they noticed no problems
until sometime after he graduated from Valmeyer High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started when he was in his early 20s,'' said his father, a
white-haired man who leaned on a cane. ``We've been living on the
edge when he's here ever since. It's been building up, getting a
little worse, getting a little worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Weston said his first inkling that something was wrongcame when
Rusty told him he could have been class valedictorian. ``He said
another guy in the class said `My Dad was valedictorian. Would you
mind if I'd be the valedictorian instead of you?,''' Weston
recalled. ``That's when I said, `Rusty, you know your grades were
not that good.'''
</P>
<P>
   After high school, Rusty, his sister and several other young men
went to Montana, where the Westons have cousins. ``We were
adventuring,'' Ms. Callahan said. Rusty ended up staying in
Montana, off and on for years, typically staying there in the
warmer months and coming back to Illinois for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty's grandmother said on Sunday that he had a girlfriend at
that time who wanted to go to Montana with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I'll get a job, get a house and come back and get
you','' Lillie Weston said. ``That made her mad and they broke
up.''
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, Weston had a job as a hospital janitor and worked a
bit as a mechanic at a Harley-Davidson dealer. He liked to fix
broken machines and tools for neighbors, and he spent time panning
for gold and rock collecting.
</P>
<P>
   At home in Illinois, he busied himself in his blue-carpeted
bedroom with two televisions, two videocassette recorders and a
shortwave radio. Sometimes he puttered around in a garden until
late at night and enjoyed chopping wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was busy,'' said his father, pointing to stacks of
wood piled high on the side lawn, ``we ain't never had any problems
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985 or 1986, Weston applied for Supplemental Security
Income, apparently on the advice of a lawyer who said that Weston
could receive the support for his mental disabilities. He was
evaluated by a psychiatrist and diagnosed as paranoid
schizophrenic, his family said. Either that psychiatrist or another
doctor prescribed a tranquilizer, Valium, for Weston around that
time, but ``he wouldn't take it right,'' his father said. ``He'd
take four at a time and say, `Here April, you want some.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Monroe County sheriff, Daniel Kelley, said that Weston had
called sheriff's deputies to his home or flagged them down on
patrol about eight times in the last nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes he'd call about people trying to get him because he
had top secret information and would ask us to investigate,''
Kelley said. ``Sometimes he heard voices through the television.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, his parents say, his illness began to seem more
severe. In the spring of 1996, his mother said, his paranoia seemed
to accelerate. He accused his parents of putting a bomb in his
television cable system. One of his calls to the sheriff's
department brought not only deputies but the Secret Service to the
Valmeyer house.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought that the president had got a Navy SEAL to try and
kill him,'' his father said, ``because he new a lot of secrets
about the government and they had atomic bombs that were stored
around Helena.'' The Secret Service agents interviewed Weston for
several hours at home and at the sheriff's department, but let him
go, his father said, recalling that he was told, ``We don't feel
that he's any risk to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Rusty Weston got angry at the agents because he said they
had told him he was threatening the president, not the other way
around. His father said Russell Jr. threatened to sue the Secret
Service over the incident.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 11, 1996, Weston was involuntarily committed by court
order to Warm Springs State Mental Hospital in Montana. His family
said he initially went into a hospital because he thought he had an
infection or allergy, but psychiatric evaluations there led to his
institutionalization. When he was discharged in December and
returned home, his family said he seemed better for a time. But
then, apparently, the beneficial effects of the medication began to
decrease. He was afraid to go back to Montana, and he stayed with
his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in his own world,'' his mother said. ``He thought he
was a general in the Army. He thought they were spying on him from
a satellite, that the satellites were watching him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Weston said it was hard to confront him with his problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very indignant if you said that he was mentally ill,''
she said. ``I would say, if you don't get help, if you don't get
medication, you're going to go to a hospital, but I would never say
to him a mental hospital because that would have really put a
barrier, that would have surely ended the conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   One time, she called ``a psychiatrist, like a help-line thing. I
told them what we were doing and they said that was the right
thing. They said also that he probably won't take his medicine. And
even if you get him to start taking, as soon as they get better
they won't. Schizophrenics, very few of them will take their
medication.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, Weston returned to Montana for a few weeks, but came
back to Illinois in June, and seemed to spiral downward.
</P>
<P>
   His parents and sister, tear-stained and obviously shattered,
thrashed their way through the memories on Sunday and came up empty
of answers.
</P>
<P>
   If she could talk to her son, Mrs. Weston said, ``It would be
why in the world he did such a thing. That's what everyone wants to
know and that's what I want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he ever comes back, he can move in,'' his father said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll never happen,'' Mrs. Weston whispered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Russell Sr. said weakly, ``I want him to know that
he's welcome.''

RUSSIA'S SAUTIN CAPTURES GOLD IN 3-METER SPRINGBOARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST MEADOW, N.Y. _ Dmitri Sautin has said he wants to be the
best diver ever.
</P>
<P>
   He is not the equal of Greg Louganis, the retired American who
defined the sport, but he is close. Sautin acknowledges that he is
the Greg Louganis of this era.
</P>
<P>
   Sautin, a 24-year-old Russian, is the world champion off the
3-meter springboard and the 10-meter platform, and the 1996 Olympic
champion off the platform. Sunday, he easily won the 3-meter
springboard title in the Goodwill Games, as he did four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked my performance,'' he said through an interpreter. ``It
was good.''
</P>
<P>
   It was better than good. At the Nassau County Goodwill Games
Swimming and Diving Center in Eisenhower Park, Sautin had one big
dive after another. He received the highest score of the
competition, a 9.5, for a reverse dive in the pike position. His
lowest score was a 7.0 on his last dive, a reverse one-and-a-half
somersault with three and a half twists.
</P>
<P>
   Sautin finished with 696.99 points. Troy Dumais of Ventura,
Calif., who at 18 has won six U.S. senior titles, took the silver
medal with 648.15 points and Zhou Yilin of China the bronze with
636.78.
</P>
<P>
   Although Zhou said that competing against Sautin was
intimidating, the Russian has had the same positive effect on his
rivals as Louganis did in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to dive against him because he pushes you and makes
you do your best,'' Dumais said. ``And when I do that, I know I can
beat other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Gillooly of Kissimmee, Fla., who finished eighth, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so good that you can't try to beat him or you'll end up
killing yourself,'' Gillooly said of Sautin. ``You just try to do
the best you can. He trains harder than anybody else in the world.
He doesn't miss dives. Mentally, he's the toughest person I've ever
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sautin looks tough. At 5 feet 9 inches and 150 pounds, with
close-cropped sandy hair, he could double for a Marine recruit.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Sautin is in Louganis' league. Some divers, even
good ones, seem to work hard as they try to finish a dive. Sautin
finishes dives quickly and without apparent effort.
</P>
<P>
   Louganis did the same, and Sautin is an unabashed fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very elegant and fluid,'' Sautin said of his role
model. ``I dived against him twice when I was 13. I was fourth. He
was first. He was more of an artistic, beautiful diver. I am more
physical and structured. I am honored when people compare me to
him, but we are not so much alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Sautin began diving from the 10-meter platform at age 9, and his
body has taken a beating from the thousands of practice dives from
33 feet above the water. After the 1996 Olympics, he underwent
surgery to remove a painful cyst on his left wrist. Now his right
wrist aches, as does his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's not easier,'' he said. ``It's more difficult with the
trauma. At 15 or 18, I never felt trouble physically. Now. ...'' He
shrugged and said he would continue to dive at least through the
2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. After that?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' he said. ``Maybe if I'm lucky.''

NEW INDUCTEES SPEAK FROM HEART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Don Sutton's reputation as a big-game
pitcher was validated Sunday when he delivered a poignant and
emotional acceptance speech for his entry into baseball's Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Doby said he does not look back with bitterness over the
discrimination that delayed his major-league career or his standing
as the second, and often forgotten, African-American to integrate
the game.
</P>
<P>
   And Jaime Jarrin, who knew little about baseball when he came
from his native Ecuador, said he is proudest of the reach and
impact his job as the Dodgers' Spanish-language broadcaster has in
beaming the sport into Latin communities.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the essence of the game's hold on America came from
veteran journalist Sam Lacy, who thanked an old high school teacher
for steering him away from algebra and into baseball. ``If not for
her, today I might be a 94-year-old sophomore.''
</P>
<P>
   A surprisingly small crowd of five thousand came out on a
beautiful summer afternoon to honor five players, one front office
executive, a broadcaster and a sports writer.
</P>
<P>
   Next season, when Nolan Ryan, George Brett, Robin Yount and
Carlton Fisk are eligible, the numbers should be better. But it
will be difficult to match Sunday for a more heartfelt appreciation
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, who pitched the first 14 of his 23 seasons with the
Dodgers and won 324 games, remembered how insignificant his failure
to make the Hall seemed last year, when his wife Mary delivered
their daughter Jacqueline 16 weeks premature. The baby, now 20
months old, was seen frolicking in the crowd up on a large video
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton's words belied his image of a cold, stubborn right-hander
who never had much time for emotional types like former manager Tom
Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, all my work dreams came true,'' Sutton said. ``Having
the little one here is my greatest dream come true. I have waited
for this day my whole life, but I've been blessed to have the
people that help put it all in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Doby, who roomed with Lacy in Tucson, Ariz., during spring
training with the Cleveland Indians in 1948, said the hardest part
about segregation in the major leagues, ``was that at the end of
the game, (teammates) went one way and I went another.''
</P>
<P>
   But Doby, who entered the big leagues in July 1947, three months
after Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color barrier, said it was
better to live without the constant scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know second isn't always bad,'' he said. ``You get to
breathe a little more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those times were difficult racially, but I never try to look
at them negatively. I think we are getting closer as people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrin, who has been with the Dodgers for 40 years, thinks his
broadcasts have helped that process. He thanked the O'Malley
family, which sold the club in March, for having the vision to tap
into the Latin market.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrin, who had more than 150 friends and family members on
hand, is best known to English-speaking fans for serving as an
interpreter for Dodgers' rookie left-hander Fernando Valenzuela in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been so many great memories, but seeing and hearing
the response we get from the Latin community is the best,'' he
said. ``It is such a big part of people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the group did not have the name recognition of past
Hall of Fame entries, fans were introduced to important characters
in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   Lee MacPhail, Jr. acknowledged he never had the charisma of his
father Larry, the former Brooklyn Dodgers general manager who
introduced night baseball to the majors. And he took little credit
for building and maintaining powerful clubs like the New York
Yankees and Baltimore Orioles during the 1950s and `60s.
</P>
<P>
   MacPhail said he is proudest of his family's four generations in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had dinner here last night and there were 28 of us,'' said
MacPhail, whose son is Chicago Cubs' president Andy MacPhail.
``There is great pride there. Hard work can go a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the overall message of the group, which also included
Negro Leaguer Joe Rogan and turn-of-the-century outfielder George
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' career during the ``Dead Ball'' era included no home runs
and 80 RBI in 1906 for the World Series champion Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan played for the fabled Kansas City Monarchs and was a
teammate of Hall of Fame right-hander Satchel Paige, considered the
greatest pitcher in Negro League history.
</P>
<P>
   Lacy wrote his first column in 1918 and continues to work for a
weekly chain in his native Baltimore. He began the crusade to
integrate the major leagues in the mid-1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have a dream,'' Lacy said. ``And if you are willing to work
for it, it can come true.''

COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO TELL ALL ABOUT YOU 
</HEADLINE>
   By ILANA DEBARE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 Q:   My mortgage company contacted my former employer to verify my
employment. When asked why I left, the human resources person wrote
``misconduct.'' It's true that I was terminated for misconduct. But
I thought that companies couldn't give out this kind of
information, but could only confirm people's dates of employment.
What can I do so that this doesn't damage my credit or job
prospects?
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Many companies have decided not to give references about
former employees because they're afraid of being slapped with
lawsuits charging defamation or invasion of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   But that's a voluntary decision on their part. Companies have
the right to say whatever they want about their employees'
performance as long as it's true. And in some cases _ such as not
disclosing that a would-be schoolteacher was fired from his latest
job for child abuse _ employers have been hit with costly lawsuits
for not providing enough reference information.
</P>
<P>
   The big lesson here should be to make sure you don't get fired
again. That black mark has the potential to haunt you for the rest
of your life.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, you can try some damage control by having an attorney
write a letter to your former employer. ``Send a letter threatening
them with an invasion-of-privacy suit unless you know what their
future references about you will be,'' said San Francisco lawyer
Cliff Palefsky.
</P>
<P>
   You're very unlikely to win such a lawsuit, Palefsky added. But
the company probably won't want to risk a fight and might agree to
limit the information it provides to include only your dates of
employment.
</P>
<P>
   I have some mixed feeling about giving out this advice. This is
one of those situations where there's a definite clash between the
interests of the individual employee and those of society at large.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, you'll be better off if potential employers don't
know that you were fired for misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of us _ your future co-workers or customers _ may
suffer if employers can't find out whether applicants have big
black trouble marks in their work history.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; Q: &LR;   &LR; I'm a computer programmer working as an independent
contractor for a large, well-established company. I bill the
company regularly but haven't been paid since the end of April. Is
there anything I can do? My bills are piling up, and I'm on the
brink of financial disaster.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  If you were a regular employee, the company would be
legally required to pay you promptly. And if it didn't pay you, you
could file a claim with the state labor commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   But the wage-and-hour laws don't cover independent contractors.
Your bill is just another piece of paper in the company's
``Accounts Payable'' file, along with the bills for floral
arrangements in the front office or photocopier repair.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that your invoices have been misplaced or that the
company is trying to improve its cash flow by paying its bills as
slowly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Fishman, the Berkeley author of ``Wage Slave No More:
Law and Taxes for the Self-Employed,'' suggests &LR;   &LR; that you talk to
your supervisor and find out who's in charge of issuing your check.
Give them a call to find out what's going on. If that doesn't work,
send them a polite reminder letter.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan a long-term career as an independent contractor, you
need to build up enough savings to handle this kind of a delay in
payment.
</P>
<P>
   And make sure that your future contracts specify a payment
schedule. ``The written contract should say how long the company
has to pay you,'' Fishman said. ``Thirty days is typical, but it
could be longer.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;   &LR; My friend is an exempt salaried employee who is scheduled
to work Wednesdays through Sundays. Sometimes, her company
schedules mandatory meetings on her days off, forcing her to give
up her personal and family plans. Is this legal? And can they do it
on short notice without paying her anything extra?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  If your friend is truly an exempt employee, this is
completely legal, according to San Francisco attorney Richard
Green. She's required to do whatever it takes to get the job done,
including coming in at a moment's notice on her days off.
</P>
<P>
   Just because something's legal, though, doesn't make it wise.
</P>
<P>
   Asking exempt employees to come in occasionally on their days
off is completely reasonable, especially in an outfit like your
friend's where people don't all work the same schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But if the company is gobbling up most of your friend's time
off, it's likely to burn her out or force her to seek another job.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happens frequently, the employer would be advised to
give her those additional hours to tack on to her vacation time,''
Green said. ``They're not legally required to do so, but many
foresighted employers do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Have a question about your workplace or career, your boss or an
employee? Send it to Ilana DeBare, Workways, San Francisco
Chronicle, 901 Mission St., San Francisco 94103. Or send e-mail to
workways &LR; sfgate.com. Or call (415) 764-2815. We can't respond to
each query in person, but we will answer as many in print as we

HIGH TECH'S HIRING-FIRING PARADOX 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAN FOST  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Why do high-tech companies need new foreign workers when they're
laying off scores of people?
<TEXT>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators agreed late last week to nearly
double the number of foreign workers allowed to hold high-tech jobs
in the next four years _ even though more than 65,000 jobs have
been cut by just 11 high-tech firms since last December, according
to one congressman's count.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley pink slips seem to arrive on a daily basis. As
the congressional pact was unveiled, two more companies, Santa
Clara-based S3 and San Jose-based GaSonics, announced layoffs of
125 people and 80 people, respectively. Those cuts are only the
latest in a long line of workforce reductions especially in Silicon
Valley's microchip and chip equipment industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a prime example of what the apparent contradiction
is,'' said T.J. Rodgers, president and chief executive officer of
chipmaker Cypress Semiconductor Corp. of San Jose. Cypress has laid
off 200 U.S. manufacturing workers this year but still has about 25
open positions for engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers understands the seeming paradox: ``How am I hiring and
firing on the same day?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  He and other industry leaders said the answer is simple:
They're hiring skilled engineers to design the products that
represent their companies' futures, while laying off manufacturing
workers, support staff, administrators and employees who have
received poor performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers who have master's and doctorate degrees are
best-equipped to design cutting-edge technology, say high-tech
executives. The execs say there aren't enough Americans with those
credentials and that's why they need workers from overseas.
</P>
<P>
   As many as half the graduates of the most-prestigious
engineering schools in the country are natives of other lands,
industry officials say. ``Because the U.S. has the best science and
engineering education in the world, the people in doctoral and
master's programs aren't just from the U.S., but they're from
India, China, Europe, Russia'' and other countries, said Tom
Waldrop, a spokesman for Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers with advanced degrees ``are scarcer than hen's
teeth,'' Waldrop said. ``If we could hire only American nationals,
we would do it. It's cheaper. There's a whole lot less red tape. It
costs $12,000 per person in extra legal work.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Hutcheson, president of VLSI Research, which tracks the chip
industry, said young Americans see the high salaries that
electrical engineers with bachelor's degrees can command, and they
see no reason to pursue a doctorate. Even while the chip industry
contracts, other high-tech companies continue to grow phenomenally,
creating plenty of jobs to tempt new grads.
</P>
<P>
   ``They split to get a job,'' Hutcheson said. ``A lot of
foreigners come in and want to stay, so they continue to get
student visas. They get their master's and Ph.D. They have an
excellent education from Stanford or Berkeley, and American
companies need them _ but they happen to be foreign.''
</P>
<P>
   Even foes of the visas concede that point. ``Quite honestly,
it's a cultural difference,'' said Paul Kostek, president-elect of
the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. ``In the
U.S., it's `Show me the money.' We're not impressed by reams of
degrees. Other countries look at education as important.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Reed, president of the American Engineering Association,
said he'd like to see American universities accept fewer foreign
students. ``I think it's a terrible waste to educate one of those
people instead of taking some of ours, whether they meet the
highest standards or not, and educating them,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, President Clinton insists that any effort to import
more high-tech workers must be accompanied by increased education
and training for American workers.
</P>
<P>
   Industry leaders say they're working on long-term efforts to
improve science and engineering education to increase the pool of
future workers. ``We've got to find ways to beef up K-12
education,'' said Stan Myers, president of Semiconductor Equipment
and Materials International, the trade group for the chip equipment
companies.  &LR;   &LR;  But the fruits of those labors are a long way off,
and the companies need engineers now.
</P>
<P>
   National Semiconductor of Santa Clara said in April that it
would lay off 1,400 workers _ largely by closing two manufacturing
plants _ but it's still hiring engineers. ``The thing we run into
constantly is a plain shortage of electrical engineers,'' said Dick
Wilson, National's vice president of human resources.
</P>
<P>
   The chip industry is historically cyclical, going through
periods of boom and bust every few years. When the cycle ends is
anyone's guess _ and few executives or analysts think that the
business will improve dramatically this year.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the cost of training, companies are reluctant to lay
people off. ``Unless your back is to the wall with a gun to your
head, you never lay off your people,'' Cypress' Rodgers said.
</P>
<P>
   But this year's slump _ caused by Asia's economic woes, a glut
of computer chips and a slowdown in sales of personal computers _
has left chip companies no choice but to shed workers, executives
said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry giant Intel Corp. is cutting 3,000 jobs, Motorola laid
off 15,000, Applied Materials is seeking 1,000 employees to take
buyouts, and some companies such as Lam Research have announced
several rounds of layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The companies remain optimistic, however, that semiconductors
will continue to drive the technological revolution and that
profitability will return.
</P>
<P>
   And they say bright, talented _ and, yes, often foreign-born _
engineers will design the products that lead them to that promised
land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe our companies will grow and our industry will
grow,'' said Daryl Hatano, vice president of international trade
and government affairs for the Semiconductor Industry Association,
the chip industry's largest trade group. ``To accomplish that will
take better, faster products, and it will take highly educated
people to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a specialized knowledge of the latest research in
processing skills,'' Hatano said. ``You don't want to let somebody
go who's going to invent the next `killer app' that creates
hundreds of factory jobs.''

Three fans die in U.S. 500 crash
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BROOKLYN, Mich. _ Three spectators were killed and six others
injured during the U.S. 500 on Sunday at Michigan Speedway when a
wheel and tire off the car of Adrian Fernandez flew into the
grandstand outside of turn 4.
</P>
<P>
   All the dead and injured were adults, according to speedway
officials. None of the dead was immediately identified, pending
notification of family members.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, who was the pole-sitter in the Tecate Reynard Ford,
slammed into the wall in turn 4, causing the right front tire,
wheel and part of the right axle to break off the car and fly over
the debris fencing and into the grandstands.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gregory Baumann, medical director for Penske Motorsports and
the Michigan Speedway, said two people died instantly when hit by
the tire. A third person was taken to the track's medical care
center where resuscitation efforts were attempted, but the
individual later died.
</P>
<P>
   Six other people were airlifted by helicopter to Foote Memorial
Hospital in Jackson, Mich. The injured were identified as Doris
Shuman, 70, of West Bloomfield, Mich.; Joyce Thompson, 48, of
Spring Arbor, Mich.; Steve Dawson, 31, of Lansing, Mich.; David
Silva, 35, of Dearborn, Mich., Gerald Bramer, 31, of Livonia,
Mich.; and Richard Bramer, 20, of Livonia.
</P>
<P>
   Shuman and Dawson were listed in stable condition Sunday night.
Thompson, Silva, Gerald Bramer and Richard Bramer were treated and
released.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only express the deep sorrow felt by everyone within the
CART community,'' said Andrew Craig, chief executive officer of
Championship Auto Racing Teams. ``There is, of course, nothing we
can say or do that will reduce the sadness felt by the families and
friends of the victims. But on behalf of all of us at CART, I
extend our heartfelt sympathies.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez suffered a bruised right knee in the crash. Telemetry
data from his car showed it hit the wall with 92 times the force of
gravity, causing the wheel to pop off and and fly over the
four-foot retaining wall and 11-foot debris fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no control of the car,'' said Fernandez, who was running
third before the crash. ``Paul Tracy (driving the Kool Green
Reynard Honda) was behind me and got inside. He cut across and cut
off my air flow. I lost the car completely and there was nothing I
could do. I was just a passenger.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a 15-foot walkway between the fence and the first row
of the grandstands. The tire landed about 10 rows up in a crowded
section of the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very tragic accident,'' Baumann said. ``The deaths
were caused by blunt trauma from the tire, but there may have been
some other pieces of debris in the stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical personnel at the track were at the scene almost
immediately, and that section of the grandstand was evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a phenomenal race, but this tragedy puts a damper over
the entire weekend,'' Michigan Speedway president Gene Haskett
said. ``We are extremely saddened by this. It just leaves you with
a very sickening feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do everything we can to make the track and the facility as
safe as possible. But it's impossible to say how high a fence
should be to keep something from flying over it.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated crowd of 70,000 attended Sunday's race, which was
won by Greg Moore. The ticket each spectator buys to any CART race
has on the back of it a disclaimer that states each patron accepts
the risks of attending the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We inspect every track each year,'' Craig said. ``I will say
that this is one of the best racing facilities in America. It's far
too early to say if any changes will be necessary at the track.''
</P>
<P>
   Baumann said Michigan state regulations require a complete
medical evaluation of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Tim VanderMel, a racing fan from Waynesville, N.C., was sitting
a few feet away from the fans who were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just for a split second out of the corner of my eye, I saw
something flying,'' VanderMel said. ``I think the people it hit
didn't see it coming. It was completely a freak thing. The medical
people were there immediately. They did everything they could.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the second time in the 30-year history of the
Michigan Speedway that a death had occurred among the spectators,
but it was the first time in 29 years. A Lansing, Mich., man was
killed and 11 others injured during a Trans-Am road race in 1969
when a car veered off the track and hit people watching in the
infield.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1987 Indianapolis 500, a tire bounded off the track,
landed in the top row of the grandstand and killed a fan. There
have been other spectator deaths since at drag races and other
lesser-known motor sports events.

 &HT;    Pennsylvania 500 Notebook
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG POND, Pa. _ Dale Jarrett was forced to play the good news,
bad news game after climbing from his No. 88 Taurus Sunday
following his fifth place finish in the Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono
Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   The game was set up after Jarrett ran over something _ he has no
idea what _ knocking a hole in the oil pan.
</P>
<P>
   That was the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I had a car, before we ran over something and knocked
a hole in the oil pan, that could have won the race,'' Jarrett
said. ``We were on the move right then and, man, I liked my car
once we got a few changes done to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, after we ran over what ever we ran over, we knew we
didn't have enough time to win the race. At that point in time,
it's best to get back as far as you can and make up as many points
as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news was the oil didn't leak onto the track. If it had,
he would have been through for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have something like that, it's devastating,'' Jarrett
said. ``We could have been looking at finishing 35th or something.
To come back and finish fifth shows what this team is made of.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead he dodged a bullet and caught a caution.
</P>
<P>
   During that caution, his crew poured six quarts of oil into the
oil pan after plugging the hole with putty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys did a great job, kept their cool and did what they
had to do,'' Jarrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip's farewell
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Waltrip completed his obligation to Dale Earnhardt
Racing in style Sunday. He finished 13th. ``We revived a career
(his), a team (Steve Park's) and accomplished both,'' he said.
Waltrip was treated with a going away party Saturday night. Among
the parting gifts was the hood from the car that he drove in the
June Pocono 500, signed by all the team members, as well as an
expensive home entertainment center with video highlights of his
ride in the No. 1 this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Roush two, three
</P>
<P>
   It was a good day for Roush Racing with Mark Martin's runnerup
finish and the third place by Jeff Burton. ``Mark gave 'em fits and
the Exide Ford was good, not perfect, but I couldn't ask for
more,'' Burton said. Martin remained second in the points chase and
Burton moved up a notch to seventh.
</P>
<P>
   No luck
</P>
<P>
   Ward Burton had no luck after starting on the pole. He was
caught up in a wreck on lap 171, while running third and finished
34th. ``It was very disappointing to run that well and be in the
top five all day and have that happen so close to the finish. I was
right behind Earnhardt and went down to pass him low, and he pulled
down and I got into him. I was trying my best not top wreck him.''

INVESTORS MAY STILL GET SOME GREASE FROM OIL'S SQUEAKY WHEELS 
</HEADLINE>
   By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Investors searching for stocks to short in the middle of this bull
market may want to check out the oil patch.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The drillers, as they are called, have been tanking since spring
and their downward trend is likely to continue, says Doug
Fairclough, co-founder of ClearStation, a San Francisco financial
Web site that provides technical trading advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been a persistently straight-down, linear drop since
May,'' says Fairclough, who also is the startup company's chief
technology officer.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no end in sight for the drillers' dry hole,
Fairclough predicts. Many of the 25 or so oil companies in his
basket of stocks, which exclude the big multinationals such as
Chevron and Exxon, are likely to continue falling, he says. (The
basket excludes Big Oil because their businesses are highly
diversified and seldom involve drilling in the United States.)  &LR;   &LR; 
 &UR;  &LR; The slide in drillers' stock is due largely to an increase in oil
production worldwide and diminished demand from the Asian economic
meltdown; oil prices got hammered, and oil stocks, in turn, got
slammed.
</P>
<P>
   Fairclough's forecast illustrates how his company's Web site
(www.ClearStation.com) can make ``technical'' trading information
available to kitchen-table investors. Technical indicators are
trend lines of various historical measurements based on past
performance.
</P>
<P>
   And the site attempts to teach individual investors how to
identify and interpret stock trends just like the pros. In fact,
ClearStation is not just another aggregator of data and graphs. It
goes further by providing instruction on how to trade using the
various tools on the site, says chief executive Kris Skrinak, a
former program trader at Goldman Sachs in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew there wasn't a need for another financial Web site
unless it would help people make money. We want people to have a
money-making experience,'' Skrinak says.  &LR;   &LR;  Sounds good. Who
doesn't want to make a little more scratch?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps shorting the oil patch is a place to start. The current
downward trends ``are not showing any signs of abating,''
Fairclough, says.  &LR;   &LR;  ``There are a lot of people pounding the
table that the group has bottomed out, (but) I feel that there's
another 15 or 20 percent drop around the corner,'' Fairclough says.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Halliburton, a diversified energy services company
based in Dallas, hit its 52-week low on Friday before closing down
almost two points at $36.25.
</P>
<P>
   Schlumberger, which is based in New York, is another oil field
services firm on the skids. It also hit a 52-week low on Friday,
closing at $36.25 _ down $1.25.
</P>
<P>
   So, if the oil patch is already hitting historical lows for the
year, isn't it too late to sell them short?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not, Fairclough says.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of bullish analysts who are saying that the
market has bottomed. But that is what's interesting about using a
technical approach to trading, Fairclough says. The trends tend to
reward traders to a point where they trust them enough to place a
bet.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, stockpickers should not throw the baby out with the
bath water. While professional traders may rely solely on technical
data for their decisions, Fairclough warns that individual
investors should still perform with their usual due diligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to shut out other information. We're just
trying to teach price action and technical analysis without being
too mystical about it,'' Fairclough says.

GAME'S RELATIONS ARE SOLID

<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Lee MacPhail, a veteran of baseball's labor
wars who became the 14th front-office executive to reach the Hall
of Fame, said Sunday he sees a bright future between management and
the players' union.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more talking than ever between the two sides,'' said
MacPhail, now retired. ``Everybody knows the sport can't survive
another strike like we had in 1994. But we've got a lot of people
working to see that never happens.''
</P>
<P>
   MacPhail, who represented management in the 1994 negotiations
that led to the cancellation of the World Series, traces the
improvement to Bud Selig, who became full-time commissioner two
weeks ago. He also credits baseball's new president and CEO Paul
Beeston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a commissioner really helps the process,'' MacPhail
said. ``He is there to remind everyone what happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   __ An almost Athletic: Don Sutton remembered the night in 1964
when former Angels general manager Whitey Herzog sat in his living
room trying to sign him to a Kansas City A's contract.
</P>
<P>
   The money was great for the time, $17,000, but suddenly the
phone rang and it was the A's eccentric owner, Charlie Finley.
</P>
<P>
   Said Sutton, ``We were ready to sign, but the first thing he
asked me was, `Do you have a nickname?' I told him `No,' and he
said, `We have Blue Moon (Odom), Catfish (Hunter) and Jumbo Jim
(Nash) and hung up. Whitey was sitting there with his mouth open.
That's why I never played with the A's.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Rogan the hero: Joe Rogan became the 15th Negro League player
inducted into the Hall of Fame. He was a dominant pitcher who had a
lifetime 113-45 record and a .343 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me if my dad was better than Satchel Paige,'' said
Rogan's son, Wilbur, who spoke on behalf of his late father. ``I
don't know, but I do know that Satch needed a designated hitter.
When my father wasn't pitching, he batted cleanup.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE GIANTS ARE GOOD, SO JUST DEAL WITH IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Third, fourth or fifth.
</P>
<P>
   That is where the Giants will finish in their division this
season. Forget about that National Conference East championship
last year. It was an aberration. A joke. Who were those no-name
guys, anyway? Why, their second-leading receiver in the playoffs
was David Patten! Really, now, they simply did not belong in the
post-season.
</P>
<P>
   Any of this sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   It does to the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   There are whispers out there, all around the National Football
League, whispers exactly like these. It is growing louder and it is
not pretty for the Giants. The doubters say that the Giants will
land back squarely on earth this season. Flat on their faces.
Overachievers, they were. Lucky. A fluke.
</P>
<P>
   The unflattering analysis spreads and rolls. The Giants have
heard it and they are not happy.
</P>
<P>
   As they opened training camp at SUNY-Albany on Saturday, Corey
Miller, the linebacker as full of wisdom as much as football skill,
offered this assessment: ``We earned our respect last year but
people didn't want to give it to us then or now. We're going to do
just what we've been doing: win. I know the schedule is tougher.
We've got our division and successful teams like Green Bay and San
Francisco and Denver and Kansas City. But we love the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Danny Kanell offered: ``We are not a team of
superstars but that's one of the things that makes us a true team.
People think of us as a bunch of no-names. But the more you win,
the more they know your name.''
</P>
<P>
   The more you prove you belong.
</P>
<P>
   And, more important, the more you know you belong.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants will win because their front office is solid with
Ernie Accorsi at general manager. He knows the business. He knows
people and he knows players. They will win because Jim Fassel, the
head coach, is a leader, a strong man inside, a man with a wistful,
clean offensive mind who understands the critical importance of
defense.
</P>
<P>
   They will win because Kanell is the starter from the beginning
of the season. They will win because their running game will soar
and because their defense is a winning defense.
</P>
<P>
   And this is another of the primary reasons why the Giants will
win in 1998 _ those bunch of no-name players like receiver David
Patten. Patten is the kind of guy that gives a team heart and soul.
A winning edge. And big plays.
</P>
<P>
   His circuitous route to the Giants at only age 23 is
heartwarming: plays at Western Carolina, not drafted, cut by the
Canadian Football League, works odd jobs at Wal-Mart, in
landscaping, as an electrician and hauling 75-pound bags of coffee
beans, then plays in the Arena Football League. He shows up at an
NFL tryout in South Carolina and runs a 4.31 in the 40-yard sprint
(4.5 is considered fast). Scouts who had ignored him suddenly begin
to whisper among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe David Patten belongs.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants thought so. They flew him in one day late in March
1997 and Patten signed a contract that same day. Last season he
played in all 16 Giants games and started three. Then he started in
the playoff loss against Minnesota. During the season, he averaged
17.4 yards on his 13 catches and scored two touchdowns. In the
playoff game he averaged 17.2 yards gained on five catches.
</P>
<P>
   This is a speedster at only 5 feet 9 inches and 185 pounds, the
fastest Giant. He can stretch defenses, push them back on their
heels and open the entire offense for his teammates. The Giants
have not had that kind of player in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling around the NFL is that most players make their
biggest leap in production between their first and second seasons.
Accorsi agrees.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the rest of the NFL is in for a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been molded and made by my parents and by our religious
lives,'' said Patten, who was born in Hopkins, S.C. ``My family has
struggled all of our lives with a hard life, with hard work and by
having to do things the hard way.''
</P>
<P>
   Patten said his 50-year-old father works as a landscaper from 7
a.m. to 8 p.m. and routinely follows that by buffing floors at a
hospital from 11 at night to 6 in the morning before starting the
day over again at 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is hard work,'' Patten said. ``And he taught me that. I
worked with him starting at age 8. He didn't have all of the fine
tools. If there was a small tree that needed uprooting, he'd say,
`You grab one side and I'll grab the other.' And we'd pull the tree
out of the ground with our bare hands. He didn't pay me. He said he
was taking care of me and that was my pay. So, you see, I know hard
work. I know how blessed I am to be a New York Giant. The road I
took to get here, there were guys who quit who were close who
didn't go through half as much.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates say that initially Patten seemed unsure of
himself. Now, he walks among them knowing he belongs. A reporter
asked Patten recently if he thought the receiver could ``slip in''
and make the team at the No. 4 or No. 5 receiver slot. Patten was
insulted. Why not be a starter?
</P>
<P>
   And Jim Skipper, the Giants offensive coordinator, said of
Patten's chances to start: ``He's in the hunt. He's in the mix.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Galiena, is his inspiration. His deep religious
conviction is his fuel.
</P>
<P>
   An aberration. A joke. Lucky. A fluke. A no-name.
</P>
<P>
   David Patten has heard it all. And so have the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to remain humble and just thank God,'' Patten said.
``But I want to be the best and the Giants want to be the best.
That's where we both belong.'' &QL;

MICROSOFT'S HOMEADVISOR SITE PLAGUED WITH PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ARTHUR M. LOUIS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Microsoft Corp. has created a new Web site called HomeAdvisor,
which it claims will provide you all the help you need to buy a
house and find a mortgage loan.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the site, at www.homeadvisor.com, is bogged down by
technical glitches and information gaps during what Microsoft calls
a ``preview'' stage, which began about two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the promised features are missing, and the site is
plagued with technical problems that make it tough to use _
sometimes impossible, depending on your browser.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says it started with a preview version to iron out the
kinks and get consumer reaction. It says the site will be
``substantially modified'' over the coming weeks _ which would be a
good thing. Right now, it is about as useful as a house without a
roof.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; I asked Ian Morris, lead product manager for HomeAdvisor, why
Microsoft would jeopardize its world-class reputation by posting a
primitive, faulty Web site, even temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   He replied that ``you really can't predict every issue'' before
activating a site. He contends that despite the glitches, the site
has gotten ``tons of positive responses'' from users.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers point out that Microsoft has done this sort
of thing before _ putting out bug-ridden products to establish a
position in a market before gradually improving the quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sooner they get into a market and make everyone nervous _
so no one else will come in _ the better,'' says one veteran
Microsoft-watcher. ``It's like a dog marking its territory.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Microsoft, once HomeAdvisor progresses from
``preview'' to ``officially live,'' you will be able to use it to
tap into all 500-plus Multiple Listing Services nationwide and call
up data and photos for all the houses offered for sale in any
neighborhood you choose.
</P>
<P>
   You will be able to screen them by community, neighborhood,
price, size and amenities _ such as air conditioning, family rooms
and formal dining areas.
</P>
<P>
   If you find a house that seems appealing, you can enter data
about your finances to find a mortgage loan that suits you. And you
can contact a lender online, to see whether you qualify.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft makes good on all those promises, it should have
the most useful home-buying site on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, that distinction belongs to San Francisco-based
HomeShark, which operates a Web site at www.homeshark.com.
HomeShark has the edge now because it has a much more complete
database than HomeAdvisor.
</P>
<P>
   HomeAdvisor is woefully short of listings. Even where houses are
listed, the photos haven't materialized yet. And the choice of
mortgage lenders is slim _ just three institutions in the entire
United States.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Worst of all, the Web site is a technological nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   When I tried navigating with Netscape, I frequently got stymied
by blank white screens or error messages _ especially the dreaded,
fatal ``JavaScript'' error, from which there is no appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on it,'' says Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that the sly technicians at Microsoft built
incompatibility into the site to discredit arch-rival Netscape?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not. Morris says HomeAdvisor also doesn't work well
with Microsoft's own Internet Explorer, version 3.0.
</P>
<P>
   HomeAdvisor does work with Internet Explorer 4.0 but just
barely. After you bring up the site _ which can take several
minutes _ you encounter interminable delays as you move from page
to page. The experience is as frustrating as coaxing a lame mule up
Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   Morris says that's partly because the site has been handling
traffic ``many times higher than expected'' since it opened on
Bastille Day. ``We've added some servers, and the performance has
gotten better.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Microsoft, HomeAdvisor currently offers listings
for only about a fourth of the 1.2 million or so homes nationwide
that real estate agents list for sale at any given moment.
</P>
<P>
   There are big gaps in the Bay Area: few or no listings for San
Francisco, Mill Valley and Pleasanton, for example. On the other
hand, there are plenty of listings for San Mateo, Burlingame and
Montara.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know anything about Montara before using HomeAdvisor,
so I seized the opportunity to test the site's demographics
section, which offers background information on every community.
</P>
<P>
   HomeAdvisor says that Montara, located on the coast in San Mateo
County, has 2,832 residents and a median household income of
$83,555. It describes Montara as a place where people ``play
racquetball ... rent foreign videos ... own an Acura ... read
Rolling Stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Its students rack up good test scores, perhaps because the ratio
of students to teachers is less than 19. But if you want a more
complete report on the schools, you have to pay $34. There also is
an extra charge _ $20 _ for detailed crime statistics.
</P>
<P>
   That seems exorbitant. School information is available free from
the board of education in virtually every California community.
Crime statistics are available free from the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, among other sources.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Morris says Microsoft is still negotiating to get home data
from most of the Multiple Listing Services. It has signed up less
than half of them, and many of those still haven't been included
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the things that makes this project
challenging,'' Morris remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Each home listing is supposed to be accompanied by a color
photograph _ but I couldn't find any, despite numerous attempts.
Whenever I called up the data on a particular house, I found a
rectangular frame surrounding the legend ``No Photo Available.''
</P>
<P>
   Photos will be added soon, Morris promises.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft eventually plans to give HomeAdvisor users a broad
selection of mortgage lenders to choose from, but at the moment it
has lined up only American Finance and Investment, Principal
Residential Mortgage and Homeside Lending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a number of discussions,'' Morris says. ``But those
three give the average consumer a good starting point. They offer
broad coverage, good pricing and great service.''
</P>
<P>
   In reviewing HomeAdvisor, I compared it head to head with
HomeShark.
</P>
<P>
   I pretended to be a prospective buyer interested in houses in
San Mateo with at least three bedrooms and priced between $350,000
and $400,000. San Mateo is one of the more prominent Bay Area
communities already included in HomeAdvisor.
</P>
<P>
   HomeAdvisor came up with 16 houses that fit the parameters,
while HomeShark produced 13.
</P>
<P>
   It was impossible to tell how much the listings overlapped,
because HomeShark didn't disclose seven of the addresses.
HomeAdvisor disclosed them all.
</P>
<P>
   I focused on a house on 30th Avenue, with an asking price of
$399,000, that appeared on both lists. HomeShark showed a color
photo of the house, while HomeAdvisor didn't, but otherwise
HomeAdvisor's display was more useful.
</P>
<P>
   I learned from HomeAdvisor that the house has interior space of
1,247 square feet, three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a fireplace and a
two-car garage.
</P>
<P>
   HomeShark mentions the number of rooms and bathrooms, but
nothing else. It refers homebuyers who want more information to the
listing broker.
</P>
<P>
   The pages that display information on individual houses follow a
uniform format on HomeAdvisor. On HomeShark they differ greatly,
because the listing agents design them. Some agents don't include
photos.
</P>
<P>
   If you are ready to look for a mortgage loan, HomeShark directs
you to eight lenders, all with a large assortment of mortgages.
That gives it an edge over HomeAdvisor, with its three lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike HomeAdvisor, HomeShark doesn't provide demographic
information.
</P>
<P>
   There are several other Web sites designed for people who want
to find or finance homes. None of them offers the breadth of
information you get from HomeShark, or will get _ the gods of
technology willing _ from HomeAdvisor. Some of them provide only
loan information, with no home listings.
</P>
<P>
   The following sites deserve at least a look from prospective
homebuyers:
</P>
<P>
   _www.quicken.com, from Intuit, provides as much detailed
information on individual houses as HomeAdvisor intends to provide.
But it covers only about 40 percent of the United States. In the
Bay Area it is limited to Alameda and Contra Costa counties. You
can use the site to get prequalified for a loan.
</P>
<P>
   _www.realtor.com, sponsored by the National Association of
Realtors, purports to contain every real estate listing nationwide.
Yet I found only six in my control group _ San Mateo houses priced
in the $350,000 to $400,000 range. That's less than half the number
offered by HomeAdvisor and HomeShark. The listings don't include
square footage, addresses or photos.
</P>
<P>
   _www.bankrate.com, from Bank Rate Monitor, is the most
comprehensive of the mortgage-only sites, listing some 50 different
lenders and a huge variety of loans. You can apply for a loan
online.
</P>
<P>
   _www.eloan.com, from E-Loan Inc., provides a long list of
lenders and mortgages and lets you get the loan of your choice
preapproved online. However, you must pay a $9.95 preapproval fee.
</P>
<P>
   _www.homebynet.com, a joint venture of Banc One Mortgage and
NeoLogics Software, helps you find a loan and lender with minimal
fuss. You can get a prequalification verdict for free, without
disclosing your identity. The other Web sites won't let you stay
anonymous if you want to prequalify.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, once you actually apply for a loan, you have to tell
the lender who you are, and provide a lot of intimate details about
your finances.

U.S. TO PAY PEOPLE ELECTRONICALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMY DOAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Starting January 2, 1999, a new law will require that all federal
payments _ with the exception of tax refunds _ be made
electronically instead of the traditional check-in-the-mail method.
The change will affect disability payments, veterans benefits,
Social Security and federal employee survivor benefits.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The reasoning behind the change is that so-called electronic
fund transfers, or EFTs, are expected to be safer and more reliable
than sending checks by mail. They're also much less expensive for
the government to process.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a potential snag in this new delivery system: &UR;  &LR; An
estimated 10 million federal benefits recipients don't have bank
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The government is considering a limited purpose account called
an electronic transfer account that would be available at banks for
a low monthly fee. The details of this proposal are being thrashed
out. But this is a hotly debated issue, because some recipients
don't want to open a bank account.
</P>
<P>
   You can find out more about this change by going to the Treasury
Department's Financial Management Service site at
http://www.fms.treas.gov, and searching under ``EFT.''

   FREE DEBT SEMINAR: Consumer Credit Counseling Services of San
Francisco is offering a free money management seminar, entitled
``Money 101: The Basics of Balancing Your Budget.''
</P>
<P>
   At the seminar, Terry Savage, author of the book ``New Money
Strategies for the '90s,'' will discuss how to get out of debt.
It's a problem plaguing a record number of Americans, including 1.3
million who filed for personal bankruptcy last year.
</P>
<P>
   The seminar is scheduled for August 3 at 7 p.m. at the San

   SMALL BUSINESS: Vice President Gore has announced an expansion
of the Small Business Administration loan program that is designed
to increase lending to women, minorities and other groups. The
program lets target groups prequalify for a loan backed by the SBA
before approaching a lender.
</P>
<P>
   The SBA has been running pilot prequalification programs for
women and minorities in some offices since 1994. But now the
program has been expanded to include veterans, specialized
industries and rural small-business owners. It will be available in
district offices nationwide. You can find out more by calling the
SBA at (800) 488-5323 or by going to its Web site  &LR;   &LR; at

POWERBALL FRENZY GRIPS THE NATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs for inserts; contains new lede and 1200 more words. More
anecdotes from more states.)  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.H., Mass., N.Y., N.J., Ore., Wash., Ind., Ill.,
Iowa, Pa., W.Va., N.C.)  (lh) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWICH, Conn. _ In a stunning triumph of optimism over simple
arithmetic, Americans tapped their savings, choked sidewalks and
interstate highways and blissfully endured hours in the summer sun
Sunday as they lined up by the millions for a 1-in-80-million shot
at a quarter-billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   After the Powerball lottery game announced the biggest jackpot
in the nation's history, people flocked across state lines to
Connecticut, the District of Columbia and the 19 other states where
Powerball tickets are sold.
</P>
<P>
   Jay K. Patel of Forest Hills, N.Y., spent $3,000 at Greenwich
Cigar and Stationery, where police had set up pylons, barricades
and yellow ``Caution'' tape to control the crowds. ``Dollar and
dream _ that's all you think,'' Patel said as the shop's single
lottery machine chugged out his pink and orange slips. ``Now, I
have 3,000 dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Kovic, 28, a waiter from the Bronx who said he was
studying aircraft design at a trade school, bought 3,000 tickets
with money he said he had been saving for tuition. ``If I win, I
won't have to go to school,'' he explained. ``Heck, I can buy my
own aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   And this was only Day 1. The latest and largest installment of
lotto mania was born at 3 a.m. Sunday, when a computer in West Des
Moines, Iowa, determined that no one had bought a winning ticket in
the Powerball drawing on Saturday night. So that jackpot, itself
close to a record, rolled into Wednesday night's drawing, when the
right six numbers will be worth an estimated $250 million before
taxes, based on an annual payout over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery officials and experts said that eclipses the previous
record for a jackpot, $195 million, which was set in May on another
Powerball drawing. Powerball officials said they would not know
until Monday how many tickets were sold Sunday, but they were
certain that it was more than the 4.5 million that were sold a week
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the greed factor: Bigger is better,'' said Douglas A.
Orr, the marketing director of the Multi-State Lottery Association,
a group in West Des Moines that runs the game. He said officials
expect to sell at least 150 million tickets before the drawing at
10:59 p.m. on Wednesday. For the record-breaking pot in May, 138
million were sold. A ticket costs $1. The chance of winning is 1 in
80 million.
</P>
<P>
   The huge prizes have served as a swift vindication for the
multistate lottery, which was formed in 1988 as Lotto America by
smaller states, mostly in the Midwest. They could not compete with
the jackpots of the larger states and so decided to pool their
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Barry A. Miller, the editor of Lotto World, a monthly magazine
published in Naples, Fla., predicted that the Powerball prize would
lure droves of first-time players of all incomes, shades and
classes. ``Most people know it's a fantasy,'' he said. ``But
someone wins, and it could be you.'' Miller plans to have a friend
in Bridgeport, Conn., buy him one ticket. ``I never overspend,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their popularity, lotteries have long been a
controversial part of American history, said Dennis Rudd, who
teaches courses on gambling and lottery operations at Robert Morris
College in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, people would stage private lotteries to
finance schools, roads, churches and other institutions. The
Revolutionary War and Reconstruction, in particular, featured
numerous endeavors built largely with lottery-powered money, Rudd
said. But lotteries often had a mixed reputation, too, besmirched
by allegations of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, as states have become more involved in running
lotteries, the moral debate over them has subsided somewhat, Rudd
said. And the big question, it seems, is how much bigger the grand
prize can get _ and to what length people are willing to go to
pursue something that they have no realistic chance of snaring.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd should know. Sunday, he drove an hour from his home in
Pittsburgh to a gas station in Chester, W.Va., to purchase five
tickets. There were more than 200 people in line, he said,
including one couple who had driven nine hours from North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   There were dentists, truck drivers, the unemployed _ a
cross-section of economics, race and class. Some people bought a
single Powerball ticket, Rudd said. One person purchased 4,000. All
were talking the same language.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you realize you're not going to win,'' Rudd said.
``But you have a chance, and you have as good a chance as the next
guy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rudd's sentiments were echoed throughout the country, in gas
stations, convenience stores, anywhere that posted any variation of
the spell-inducing words: Yes, We Have Powerball Tickets.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Line Grocery in Fitzwilliam, N.H., Chuck Kiritsy
said that he had sold more than 24,000 Powerball tickets over the
past seven days, about 12 times higher than normal. Many buyers
were from Massachusetts, he said, and many seemed to have an extra
pep in their step.
</P>
<P>
   Powerball frenzy, in other words, was affecting behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are absolutely crazy,'' Kiritsy said. ``They don't know
anything about the game or even how to check their numbers. They're
just spending money.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Midwest, Eric Wold, an unrecorded singer and unpublished
songwriter, drove 90 minutes from his home in West Chicago, Ill. to
the Amoco Service Station in Hammond, Ind. for a chance to win _
again.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Wold, 33, won $117 after picking four of the six
numbers on a $1 investment. But instead of investing his winnings
in, say, the stock market, he purchased $100 worth of Powerball
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't put a price on a dream,'' Wold said. ``I'd buy a
small country and maybe donate enough to the Democrats to spend a
night in the White House. I'd love to sleep in that Lincoln
Bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   In several states, the demand was so intense Sunday that
additional workers and terminals were needed. As of July 23, at
least 76 television stations in 17 states and the District of
Columbia planned to broadcast the drawing live at 10:59 p.m. on
Wednesday, according to the Web site of the Multi-State Lottery
Association, in Des Moines, Iowa, which operates Powerball.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as busy as it was Sunday, Powerball sellers said that
Saturday was busier than Sunday, because of run-up to the Saturday
drawing, which, of course, had no winner.
</P>
<P>
   This description was typical, perhaps: ``You should have been
here yesterday,'' said Valera Alcala, a clerk at the Plaid Pantry
convenience store on Hadyen Island in north Portland, Ore., just
across the Washington state line. ``The line was to the back of the
store, into the subway, out the door, past the dumpster and into
the mobile home park next door.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was Saturday, when the jackpot was a relatively modest
$183 million. Try again on Wednesday, when it is up to $250 million
_ or almost one dollar per person in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they'll start going crazy here beginning Monday
night,'' said Barbara Bush, a clerk at the Amoco Station in
Hammond, Ind. ``That's when we'll start seeing paychecks, rent and
mortgage payments and the food money start to come across our
counter.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Powerball tickets are not sold in New York or New
Jersey, Powerball fever has brought a fleeting democracy to
Greenwich, where Escorts jockeyed with Jaguars on streets lined
with shops sporting elegant awnings and offering pricey
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the frenzy was frightening. Gerald Guerrier, who works
for a lottery machine service firm in Rocky Hill, Conn., nursed
printers and motherboards Sunday with the urgency of a heart
surgeon. Crowds outside his various stops cursed as he went in and
cheered as he left. ``At one deli, the owner told the crowd, `If he
doesn't fix the machine, kill him,''' Guerrier said with wide eyes.
``One lady said, `There'd be no witnesses.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gail Howard, owner of a publishing company in White Plains,
N.Y., said she expected Powerball to propel sales of her lottery
books and software which for up to $79.95 help players eliminate
combinations that she says are unlikely to win. But Ms. Howard said
that all that expertise might improve the odds from 1 in 80 million
to 1 in 50 million. ``If this is your time, God will pick you,''
she said. ``It's still luck.''
</P>
<P>
   At 8 Sunday night, 300 people were lined up at Putnam Shell
here. Anticipating even bigger crowds on Monday, the Greenwich
Police has doubled its day shift from 20 officers to 40, and set up
barricades at 10 stores, Lt. David C. Ridberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the rush, many stores told patrons they could not
play their carefully chosen numbers, and would sell only ``quick
picks'' chosen by the cash register sized lottery machines.
</P>
<P>
   Customers shaded themselves with umbrellas as people wended
through makeshift versions of the pens found at amusement parks.
Most stores let groups of about five in at a time and kept the rest
out on the sidewalk. Cheers erupted each time a group emerged and
the next lucky bunch moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as word spread about the $150 million jackpot, many
people slept in their cars in order to be in line when machines
went on at 6 a.m. This week, store managers said they expect even
larger slumber parties. At Greenwich Cigar and Stationery, which
sold about 30,000 tickets Sunday, the owner took appointments for
high rollers. ``I have a man who wants 10,000 tickets coming at 6,
a $2,400 order at 7 and a $3,000 at 7:30,'' said the owner, Ashok
J. Sheth.
</P>
<P>
   For retailers, every number is a lucky number: Stores keep 5 to
7 cents for each ticket they sell, according to the Powerball
spokesmen. But just the prospect of riches made some customers feel
flush. ``All I need is $2 million. I'd give away the rest,'' said
Elina Gomez, 56, of Elizabeth, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A Powerball riot nearly broke out at Zyn Stationery here when
Consuelo Sipsas of Queens, N.Y., tried to slip into the store ahead
of 100 people in a line presided over by three Greenwich police
officers. Cries of ``The woman in white!'' and ``Shoot her''
erupted from the crowd, and an officer removed her from the line.
``What can I say? I felt lucky,'' Mrs. Sipsas, 47, said as she
moved up the street toward another Powerball outlet.
</P>
<P>
   When the store closed at 6 p.m. after selling 15,000 tickets in
12 hours, some people shouted at Officer Terral A. Hardy as he
tried to disperse the scores who remained. ``Go 10 more miles up
the interstate, and you wouldn't have to wait,'' he said. David T.
Brown, 60, tried to get to the door to negotiate with the shop's
owner, and stalked off muttering when Hardy blocked his path.
</P>
<P>
   Peter B. Alter, an insurance broker from Rye Brook, N.Y., had
driven to Greenwich for dinner with no thought of lotto. As he
walked down Greenwich Avenue, strangers kept asking him where they
could play Powerball. Alter cheerfully played along, pointing them
to the main highway and saying, ``Just look for the lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Alter said he has never played Powerball. But he's thinking
about it.

PUSH TO OPEN MARKET FOR NATURAL GAS MAY STALL 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH HOWE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
The people who brought you electricity deregulation have another
idea _ deregulate the market for natural gas.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But public apathy and private antipathy could stall the movement
despite the enthusiasm of the California Public Utilities
Commission, the prime force pushing gas deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST STEP
</P>
<P>
   Just as with electricity deregulation, the theory is that
competition can spur innovation and push gas prices down by
allowing new players into the natural gas market, an arena long
controlled by the state's big public utilities.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the PUC took the first step in what is likely to be
a lengthy process toward gas deregulation. They issued a 122-page
report that outlined various deregulation scenarios and asked for
public comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is talking about laying new gas pipelines to your
home,'' explained William Meyer, head of the PUC's division of
strategic planning. The issue is whether to allow consumers the
right to choose their gas supplier as they can their electric power
company, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents, primarily out-of-state gas companies and free-market
advocates at the PUC, say lower gas bills aren't the only or even
the biggest benefit. They argue that when gas is deregulated, just
as electricity was on March 31, companies will be able to combine a
multitude of services _ gas, electricity, maybe even phone and
cable TV _ into one lower bill.
</P>
<P>
   SERIOUS CHALLENGERS
</P>
<P>
   But gas deregulation, which is only in the preliminary
discussion stages, faces serious challengers. The big utilities and
their unionized workers, who could lose their jobs to competition,
raise the safety issue. They argue that a pack of unregulated
companies may be ill-equipped to handle natural gas, which is
highly explosive.
</P>
<P>
   And consumer groups, who complain that customers are having to
pay $28 billion in so-called stranded costs from electricity
deregulation, are leery of the bill they'll be stuck with if gas
deregulation comes about. They fear that utilities will claim
billions in stranded costs from downsized billing and metering
departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants more consumer choice, but what's the price?''
said Theresa Mueller, an attorney and gas specialist at the Utility
Reform Network, a San Francisco consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, this is how consumers get their gas &UR; .  &LR; Natural gas is
pumped from the ground by producers, often big oil companies like
Chevron and Shell. They sell the gas to interstate pipeline
companies, who ship the gas to various states, where utilities buy
the gas and distribute it to their customers, usually at cost.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Gas Co.
dominate the residential side of California's $7 billion-a-year
natural gas business. Together, the two utilities have more than
80,000 miles of pipeline that serve 8.3 million residential and
commercial customers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, the federal Natural Gas Policy Act began a gradual
deregulation of not only the price of gas, but also its
transportation. However, the act basically applied only to
commercial and industrial customers, who were allowed to buy gas
from the supplier of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Now the PUC wants to bring residential customers the same
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've deregulated electricity and the commercial natural gas
business,'' said Richard Bilas, president of the PUC. ``Now we want
to do the same thing at the residential level.''
</P>
<P>
   Although lower prices are a possibility, Bilas says the real
issues are customer choice and the possibilities for innovation. He
sees the biggest advantages in what is called ``convergence.''
That's where customers can get a better deal on their total utility
needs from a company that will provide more than just one service.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious example of convergence is electricity and gas. Few
companies have jumped into California's new deregulated electricity
market, and fewer still would be interested in gas alone. But Meyer
believes that many new competitors might want the chance to offer
both.
</P>
<P>
   Enron Corp., the big Houston energy concern, exited California's
new home electricity market less than a month after it opened,
saying it couldn't make any money. But last week, a spokesman said,
``Yes, if there really were a viable market for both electricity
and gas, then we would be interested.''
</P>
<P>
   In another aspect of deregulation, the PUC wants to allow new
companies to compete with the utilities for billing and metering
services.
</P>
<P>
   Reading each meter and processing millions of utility bills is
expensive. Theoretically, a new company could specialize in billing
services for gas, electricity, maybe even cable and telephone
service, too.
</P>
<P>
   But critics argue that most of the benefits to gas deregulation
are less than meet the eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we'd really like to see, that hasn't been done, is a
cost-benefit analysis'' on gas deregulation, said Dede Hapner, vice
president of regulatory relations at PG&AMP;E. ``How much further in
deregulation do we need to go, and who is it for?''
</P>
<P>
   Critics point out that gas deregulation on the commercial side
has already brought consumers most of the economic benefits they're
likely to get. That's because businesses, bargaining hard for
better deals on natural gas, drove down the overall market prices.
They note that consumer prices for natural gas have declined about
14 percent during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most consumer gas bills are fairly small. PG&AMP;E customers
pay an average of 62 cents for a therm of gas. A therm equals the
energy content of 100 cubic feet of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E calculates the average residential gas bill at a little
more than $28 a month. And only one-third of that is money spent on
the actual gas. The rest goes for distribution, meter-reading and
billing. Even a big percentage savings could seem pretty small in
actual dollars.
</P>
<P>
   As for the benefits coming from convergence, these advantages
remain to be demonstrated, critics say.
</P>
<P>
   But the opposition isn't limited to skepticism about the
benefits of deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC is proposing ``dangerous solutions to problems that
don't exist,'' claims Donald Wightman, president of the Utility
Workers Union of America in a recent editorial sent to newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Wightman, concerned about the job security of more than 10,000
gas workers in the state, argues that `unbundling'' natural gas
services such as repairs, maintenance and appliance replacement is
a bad idea. Such services appear to be free now, though their costs
actually are wrapped up in a consumer's bill.
</P>
<P>
   But if services were sold separately, consumers might be forced
to deal with incompetent workers from unregulated companies. Or
worse yet, homeowners might be reluctant to call for a once-free
service because they would have to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to ask if there will be accidents as a result of
this,'' Wightman wrote. ``The only question is how many explosions,
fires and carbon monoxide poisonings will result.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond safety fears, some critics say that gas deregulation
could actually increase natural gas costs to consumers. That's
because, under one deregulation scenario, gas utility companies
would be prohibited from procuring gas. One reason gas prices have
declined is that they've been pushed down by the bargaining power
of the big utilities. If that power is eliminated, prices could
rise.
</P>
<P>
   Utilities such as PG&AMP;E and Southern California Gas Co. can be
expected to oppose deregulation because it would inject competition
into their profitable billing and metering services.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups such as TURN also worry that, faced with gas
deregulation, utilities will claim that the new, open market will
leave them stuck with big investments that no longer make economic
sense. The utilities will want ratepayers to pay off these
so-called stranded costs.
</P>
<P>
   With gas, the stranded costs are likely to come from the billing
and servicing departments, where utilities might have to write off
the costs of laying off large numbers of employees and selling
equipment and buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the utilities nor consumer groups have a clear fix on
how large the stranded cost bill could be, but it might be in the
billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   A final hurdle for proponents of gas deregulation is the state
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, who authored the bill to
deregulate electricity, is squarely against doing the same for the
consumer side of the natural gas industry.
</P>
<P>
   Peace, chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy, Utilities and
Communications, has been vitriolic in his criticism of the PUC,
which he believes has badly bungled aspects of electricity
deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the PUC's desire to deregulate gas, Peace said
last week: ``I have come to expect the stupid and inane from the
commission. This decision comes as no surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   One legislative source summed up the mood in Sacramento: ``Is
there a demonstrable problem here we're trying to fix with gas
deregulation, or is this really just an ideological exercise by the
PUC?''

   Witty equally at east on bike as on skates
</P>
<P>
   By Karen Rosen
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 COX NEWS SERVICE
</P>
<P>
   STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. _ Chris Witty stood outside the Goodwill
Games velodrome Sunday and patiently talked bikes with a volunteer.
He was more interested in the old bike she'd just borrowed for a
post-race ride than the speedskating medals she earned at the
Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't had many people say, 'Oh, there's Chris Witty the
cyclist,' '' she said after winning a team gold in the sport in
which she was an Olympic alternate in 1996. ''It's 'Oh, there's
Chris Witty from Nagano.' It's the little asterisk by my name.''
</P>
<P>
   But cycling is no longer a footnote to Witty's skating career;
it's a full partner. She's changed gears to spend a full season on
the pedals.
</P>
<P>
   Witty will compete in the World Championships in France next
month after gaining confidence here. The red-headed racer was
second in the match sprint Saturday, then tried the endurance
events Sunday. She was fifth in the 30-lap scratch race and also
competed in the elimination race.
</P>
<P>
   Witty called riding on the portable ''Vandedrome'' track, a
170-meter cypress oval with a 53-degree bank, ''the most fun I've
had on a track. Every corner you go into, you feel all these
G-forces.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressures of being world-class in two sports appealed to
Witty.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'd be easy to stay in speedskating and keep accelerating in
that sport, but I'm taking a chance by doing cycling,'' said Witty,
who won an Olympic silver medal in skating's 1,000 meters and a
bronze at 500. ''But if I can do that at the same level, that's a
goal of mine. I've always wanted to compete in the Summer Games.''
</P>
<P>
   But if she is not satisfied with her progress by the end of next
summer, she might skip the Sydney Games. ''Salt Lake City (2002
Winter Olympics) is what's really important to me because it's in
America, and I want to win a gold because I was so close last
time.'' She realizes her two-sport career could backfire. ''If I do
cycling too much, what if it hurts my speedskating?'' Witty asked.
</P>
<P>
   Although skaters routinely cross-train with cycling, the
positioning of the body and training are slightly different.
</P>
<P>
   ''Speedskating's a sport where you're supporting your own body
weight,'' Witty said. ''You're not sitting on a seat, so there's a
lot of little muscles that aren't being worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Witty also has to avoid injuries such as a broken collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   She reassures her coaches: ''Don't worrrrry. My mom always says
that I'm a very cautious person. I'll go out and I'll do these bold
things, but I know my limits. I don't usually get myself in
dangerous situations.''
</P>
<P>
   She has become reacquainted with how it feels too lose.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is an ego blow a little bit,'' she said, ''but it's
good to have, because it brings you back down to earth and it makes
you work. Now I'm the underdog again coming up, instead of being
the one on top. It's refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   Witty herself is refreshing. She has a navel ring and the Notre
Dame Fighting Irishman tattooed on her hip.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sports are meant to be fun,'' Witty said. ''Some people take
it way too seriously.''

IRWIN CAPTURES U.S. SENIOR OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MICHAEL ARKUSH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PACIFIC PALISADES, Calif. _ Hale Irwin proved again that he is
the best golfer in the world over the age of 50, capturing the U.S.
Senior Open on Sunday by dramatically converting a 12-foot birdie
putt on the 72nd hole to edge the charging Vicente Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, who won three U.S. Opens (1974, 1979, 1990), shot a
two-under 69 to cap a remarkable turnaround. He started the
tournament Thursday with a horrific 77 at historic Riviera Country
Club and appeared out of it as late as the middle of the third
round when he trailed by eight strokes.
</P>
<P>
   But Irwin rallied on Saturday's back nine and kept up the
momentum a day later to win his second senior major of the season.
</P>
<P>
   He finished at one-over 285, making it the third straight USGA
event _ the others were the U.S. Open and the U.S. Women's Open _
in which no competitor has finished under par.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming back from where I was to win, the manner in which I
did, I am very proud of that,'' said Irwin, who has finished among
the top five in all 14 of his official 1998 starts. ``You can dig
your way out of a hole if you just have the belief in it and have a
plan of going about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin became the seventh player ever to win the U.S. Open and
U.S. Senior Open tournaments, and set a Senior Tour record for
poorest first round by a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, who trailed Raymond Floyd by three entering the final
round, caught him for the first time with a birdie at the seventh.
Irwin and Floyd then matched scores hole after hole until Irwin
birdied the par-3 16th.
</P>
<P>
   He needed it. Fernandez, five back when the day began, was
making birdies. By the time Irwin reached the 18th tee, Fernandez
was in the clubhouse with a four-day total of two-over 286.
Considering the difficulty of the final hole, which had yielded
only 17 birdies all week, a Monday 18-hole playoff seemed almost
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Not to Irwin. He placed his tee shot perfectly in the right
portion of the fairway, which allowed him to hit a 4-iron from 196
yards to within 12 feet. Irwin read no break in the putt and that's
exactly how it rolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what scared me. I wanted to see a break,'' said Irwin
who captured his fifth title of the year. ``You just can't believe
greens around here have straight putts.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin pocketed $267,500, raising his season earnings to
$2,002,750, the second year in a row he has earned more than $2
million. He also stands an excellent chance of matching the nine
victories he posted in 1997. He has finished no worse than a tie
for fifth in 14 senior tournaments this year.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, on the other hand, couldn't do anything on the greens.
For the second straight day, Floyd, who had led after the first
three rounds, made only one birdie, and that was at the par-5
opening hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't win anything with a birdie a round,'' said Floyd,
who finished alone in third at three-over 287. ``It seemed like
when I hit a good shot or hit a good putt, I didn't get rewarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Floyd did not sound too disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud of what I did and the way I endured,'' said Floyd,
who, like everyone else, had to battle Riviera's treacherous kikuyu
grass. ``I kept plugging along and I think it boils down to Hale is
the best senior player out here. I have never seen a tour dominated
the way he has done in the last two years. It is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Barnes, however, was very disappointed. Barnes had mounted
a stirring rally Sunday, closing to within just two shots of the
lead after a birdie at the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   But after teeing off at 13, he found out he had incurred a
two-stroke penalty on the 11th green for playing his ball from the
wrong place. He had marked his ball one putter-head length away to
get out of the line of his playing partner, Jose Maria Canizares.
But he failed to replace his ball in the correct spot. Instead of a
5, Barnes took a 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was, I suppose, in my own world,'' said Barnes, who finished
in a tie for fourth, three behind Irwin. ``I have never done
anything this idiotic in a tournament the stature of the U.S.
Senior Open.''
</P>
<P>
   The best round of the tournament, 67, was recorded Sunday and it
came from Jack Nicklaus. Nicklaus, who had shot a 79 Saturday to
take himself out of contention, has played his last tournament
round of the year. He will now concentrate on rehabilitating his
ailing left hip.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Morgan, Irwin's main rival on the senior tour, finished in a
tie for seventh, five shots back. Morgan had hoped to become the
first senior since Nicklaus in 1991 to win three majors in a
season. &QL;

EDITORIAL: NEGOTIATING THE SUBPOENA CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, July 27:
</P>
<P>
   In this republic, history gets made _ or unnecessary crises
averted _ when important principles seem headed toward collision.
Lawyers for President Clinton and the independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, must figure out whether to have a negotiated settlement or a
portentous constitutional clash, now that Starr has subpoenaed
Clinton to testify before a grand jury about whether he
participated in perjury or a cover-up as part of his dealings with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   One of the important principles at issue is that which holds our
citizen president equal with every other citizen before the law.
That principle was upheld, rightly in our view, in the Supreme
Court's decision forcing President Nixon to surrender Watergate
tapes and its ruling affirming Paula Jones' right to pursue a civil
suit against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But another principle brought into focus by Starr's subpoena is
an important one, too. That is the constitutional separation
between the executive and judicial branches. In the tapes case, it
was the delivery of physical evidence, not the president's
testimony, that was compelled. In the Lewinsky case, the Supreme
Court would have to decide if the court, part of the judiciary
branch, can order the president to comply with a prosecutor's
subpoena. If the Supreme Court said yes and Clinton then defied the
ruling, that could, in turn, lead to a debate on whether that
refusal was grounds for impeachment, the way of charging a
president that is indisputably permissible under the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   We would prefer to see a negotiated settlement that met certain
minimal requirements. First and foremost, there could be no
limitation on the range and subject of questions Starr is allowed
to put to the president. The answers would have to be sworn. If
those conditions are met, Starr should bend on the location of the
questioning. The debate over whether Clinton should have his lawyer
present seems contrived since Clinton himself has a legal education
and other citizens give grand jury testimony without their lawyers
in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the usual White House bashing of Starr, this fraught
situation is mainly Clinton's creation. Back in January, he said
that it was reasonable to ask about his contacts with Ms. Lewinsky
and that he would provide fuller answers. Then he reverted to his
old pattern of refusing to give information about his finances,
campaign fund-raising or distinctive personal relationships. The
importance of the office of the presidency means that the law
should be flexible in avoiding confrontations _ up to a point. But
it cannot be junked because of the odd and stubborn choices Clinton
has made. &QL;

COMMENTARY: DOING BATTLE ON STIFF RULES FOR WATERSHED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ELIZABETH KOLBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ed Heelan is not an unreasonable man. He may be suing
New York City for more than $11 billion, but not in a mean-spirited
sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not taken a radical position at all,'' he asserted
during a recent trip to Manhattan to promote his cause. ``I'm
trying to be middle of the road. I say, `Let's work together!'''
</P>
<P>
   In a series of lawsuits filed over the last few years, Heelan, a
Putnam County real-estate developer, consultant, broker and
investor _ ``I wear a number of different hats,'' he explained _
argues that the city has deprived him, as well as countless
colleagues and neighbors, of much of the value of their land. Under
the tighter watershed regulations that the city began to enforce
last year, Heelan maintains that development in Putnam County has
all but ground to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that by all objective measures, the county remains one
of the fastest-growing and richest in the state, in no way, he
insists, refutes his claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``All over the place, projects are being stopped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Heelan and his fellow plaintiffs have brought their
multibillion-dollar lawsuits against the city under an obscure,
century-old provision of the state's public-health law, written
when the city was flooding upstate valleys to build its reservoir
system.
</P>
<P>
   The law stipulates that any property owner who is forced to
remove a building because of watershed regulations or finds his
``rights of property are injuriously affected by the enforcement of
any such rule or regulation'' can sue the offending party.
</P>
<P>
   The law has rarely, if ever, been invoked, and it has never been
tested in court. The city has contended that the law cannot
possibly mean what Heelan says it does, because if it did, it would
contradict the very premise of watershed regulation.
</P>
<P>
   But that argument has not had much effect in court. Though the
city has pressed for Heelan's potentially catastrophic lawsuit to
be summarily dismissed, it has had to watch the suit grind forward.
</P>
<P>
   In Justice Barrett Hickman, the same judge who has presided over
the Tawana Brawley defamation case, Heelan and his fellow
plaintiffs have apparently found a sympathetic ear. The Putnam
County judge has issued a lengthy decision in support of the
plaintiffs' claim that they have a case and that the suit ought to
go to trial in Putnam County.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, New York City and the counties in its watershed reached
an agreement that was supposed to resolve decades of
upstate-downstate wrangling. The city promised to make payments to
the counties totaling about $75 million and, in return, the
counties promised to accept stricter environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   All the politicians involved, from Gov. George Pataki to Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani to the leaders of the watershed counties, appeared
smiling together, labeling the agreement a victory for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   But if the scene made for a good photo op, the agreement has
not, by any stretch of the imagination, resolved the basic problem
facing New York City's watershed, which is that the city does not
own it or control it. Much of the land is in the hands of
developers like Heelan whose enthusiasm for building office parks
and subdivisions has, in the intervening years, not abated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who forecast a quick and easy victory were unfortunately
overoptimistic,'' said Eric Goldstein, a senior attorney at the
Natural Resources Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
   Among Heelan's many projects is a 500,000-square-foot outlet
mall that he hopes to build smack in the middle of the the Croton
watershed. In keeping with the new watershed agreement, the city
has told Heelan that he must modify his plans before it will allow
the project to go forward. He says he plans to comply but insists
that this kind of interference _ at once costly and annoying _
discourages development and thereby effectively cheats landowners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We accept the concept of the common good,'' he said. ``We're
simply saying, `You are taking our property values _ pay us.'''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the city was not, for obvious reasons,
about to concede this point, which would _ take your choice _
either bankrupt it or drive water bills through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will probably drag this out for years,'' he said somewhat
philosophically. ``But as long as I'm alive, I'll keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked exactly how old he was, Heelan merely laughed.

</P>
<P>
   Kroft is, of course, the computer-generated character whose
popularity in the game Tomb Raider has made her the first fictional
cyberbabe.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garnett is president and chief executive of the start-up
company Crossworlds Software in Burlingame, Calif., which creates
software that links disparate programs for tasks like inventory
management and payroll systems. Ms. Garnett, 36, has been
attracting Kroft-type attention for a print advertisement that
promotes Crossworlds in an unusual manner.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the ad has been appearing in mainstream magazines
like Business Week, Fortune, Vanity Fair and W rather than in
computer publications. For another, the ad, created in-house, shows
Ms. Garnett wearing a low-cut black cocktail dress and a Mona Lisa
smile; the photograph was shot by Richard Avedon of fashion-world
fame.
</P>
<P>
   Another unconventional aspect of the ad is the text, which
resembles a Playboy Playmate's biography crossed with an old
``Dewar's Profile'' ad for Dewar's Scotch whisky. Ms. Garnett is
described as a ``trail blazer'' whose credo is presented as ``Aim
high _ then deliver''; under her ``recent thrill,'' the ad lists
``flying 360-degree inverted loops in a SF260 Marchetti.''
</P>
<P>
   There is increasing interest in Silicon Valley along Madison
Avenue; for instance, Kim Polese, president and chief executive of
the software company Marimba Inc., and Esther Dyson, the technology
newsletter editor, appear with women like Reba McEntire and Bebe
Neuwirth in a 32-page ad supplement for Anne Klein sportswear.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Crossworlds ad is different enough to have turned Ms.
Garnett into a media darling, the subject of coverage from CNBC to
The New York Post to The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   As for complaints about using her femininity to sell software,
Ms. Garnett replied: ``I'm a woman. What should I do, dress like a
nerd? If I'd felt compromised, I'd have never done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garnett looks good in a little black dress, but can she
write and ship code? The answer seems to be yes; though prices for
software sold by the fledgling company start at a hefty $250,000,
the Crossworlds client list already includes accounts like Bay
Networks Inc. and Siemens Corp. The company, whose investors
include Intel and Compaq, is expected to go public next year.

</P>
<P>
   Free Stock Shares From the Internet
</P>
<P>
   As one of Gypsy Rose Lee's colleagues told her, ``You gotta get
a gimmick.'' And the fledgling Internet entrepreneur Ralph Bartel
knows it, too.
</P>
<P>
   When this 32-year-old from Hamburg, Germany, started the travel
Web site Travelzoo.com in April, he had no money and no original
content. What he did have was a dream of his own media company, and
the knowledge that traffic equals power on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   So he concocted a strategy: give away three free shares of stock
to Web surfers who signed up on the site, allowing him to amass a
database that he claims now has more than 450,000 names. (He
promises not to sell the list.) Upon signing up on the site, the
person receives an e-mail with serial numbers for the stock and the
message ``Your shares will be kept in the electronic share register
at our offices in the Bahamas.''
</P>
<P>
   As with many other things Internet, practicality appears to have
taken a back seat to frenzy. News of the offer has spread via
e-mail, in a sort of digital-age pyramid scheme: If you get a
friend to sign up, you get another share.
</P>
<P>
   Bartel said he is not behind an e-mail now circulating that
claims _ inaccurately _ that the Web-search company Yahoo made a
similar offer in its early days. But he is thankful for the number
of visitors the buzz has generated, which he just a week ago
translated into a deal with the eyeball-hungry ad-sales company
Doubleclick, which will place its clients' advertisements on the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Anderson, editor in chief of Hoovers Online, a financial
news and database service, likened the scheme to the ``Publisher's
Clearing House school of corporate finance.''
</P>
<P>
   He questioned Travelzoo's promise to pay shareholders dividends.
``There is not an Internet company on the planet with the
wherewithal to pay dividends,'' he said. ``Microsoft, with $12
billion in cash, doesn't cut dividend checks. The chance of
Travelzoo ever paying dividends is _ optimistically _ nil.''

   Band of Angels Invests in Sendmail
</P>
<P>
   It is a 20-year-old software program that has never generated
revenue, but it has now grabbed the attention of 40 of Silicon
Valley's most powerful investors. Last week the software, Sendmail,
drew $6 million in financing for its owner, Sendmail Inc. of
Emeryville, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the money came from the prestigious Band of
Angels, a loosely organized group of investors that includes Mark
Porat, the founder of Avanti Capital, and Dean Morton, the retired
chief operating officer of Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Sendmail is the software responsible for routing and delivering
more than three-quarters of the Internet's e-mail _ hundreds of
millions of messages a day. But until late last year, one of its
developers, Eric Allman, had maintained Sendmail mainly as a hobby,
giving it away.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, as some Internet start-up companies are going
public with little more revenue and less product demand than
Sendmail's, Allman is intent on turning his ``freeware'' program
into a for-profit enterprise.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lucille first noticed that her husband, Sonny, was
slipping when he wrote checks. He would fill in the amount on the
line for the date, and vice versa. But he did not want her to see
him do it. And he denied that anything was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Bill collectors called, complaining checks were late or
unsigned. Then Sonny started to confuse the days of the week and
had trouble telling time. Lucille, who agreed to an interview on
the condition that her last name not be used, took him to a doctor
more than a year ago, where she first heard the word
``Alzheimer's.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did she have to cope with her husband's failing health
on top of ordinary household responsibilities, but she also had to
do it while exhausted. Caring for her husband has occupied her
around the clock. Because Alzheimer's is a degenerative brain
disease that leads to dementia, many patients confuse day and
night, and experts say sleep deprivation among caregivers is one of
the leading reasons that patients are institutionalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walks a lot at night and I don't get much sleep,'' Lucille
said of her husband. ``He'd get up in the middle of the night and
put his clothes on. The last year's been pretty rough. I'm so
tired. I need a break.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she gets one a few times a week, when she sends her husband
to an unusual program introduced in June at the Hebrew Home for the
Aged in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The program, Elderserve at Night, is just like the center's
daytime program, offering horticulture, art and music therapy,
games and puzzles, walking groups and meals. But it takes place
overnight, from 7 P.M. to 7 A.M., Wednesdays through Sundays. The
Alzheimer's Association, a national nonprofit group based in
Chicago, says it knows of no other program like it in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Lucille, 69, enrolled Sonny in the day program at the Hebrew
Home last year. A daughter, their only child, lives in Central
Islip, on Long Island, and helps when she can. A grandson used to
take Sonny for the weekends, until Tony's condition grew worse and
the grandson could not handle Sonny on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all fallen in my lap,'' she said during an interview in
her scrupulously neat Bronx home, her 80-year-old husband sitting
in a chair across the room, oblivious to the conversation. ``I have
to take care of everything, he's so turned around now.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Reingold, executive vice president of the Hebrew Home,
which serves about 1,000 clients, said Elderserve at Night was
conceived with people like Sonny and Lucille in mind. ``We have 400
people in the home who are in various stages of dementia,'' he said
during an interview. ``We sat around this table and asked, `What's
the next program we feel this population needs?'''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Lewis, director of Elderserve at Night, said the night
program fills a need other Alzheimer's care providers should
notice.
</P>
<P>
   Patients ``get agitated if you try to force them to sleep,''
said Mrs. Lewis, who has worked with Alzheimer's patients for
almost 20 years. During an interview at the home at about 2 A.M.,
Mrs. Lewis was nothing if not perky. ``I felt that people were
demeaning this population. They're not crazy, they're not weirdos.
They have special needs and we are here to provide for those
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost, $75 per night, is covered by Medicaid for patients who
qualify for long-term home health care. No reservations are
necessary and it can serve up to 25 clients a night.
</P>
<P>
   On a warm summer night in late june, 11 clients were
participating in the program. At about 1 a.m., three of them were
sleeping, and three others were listening to Dan Manjovi, a music
consultant, as he played the piano and sang a medley of pop tunes.
Two were walking the halls and three were repotting wandering Jews
in Jo Ann Stern's horticulture therapy workshop while Sarah
Vaughan's voice floated out of a portable cassette player.
</P>
<P>
   Horticulture therapy benefits Alzheimer's patients in a number
of ways, Ms. Stern said, including lowering blood pressure,
stimulating the senses of smell and touch, giving patients a sense
of control over their lives, and aiding in memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they can't remember their children's names but they
can remember their mother's garden,'' Ms. Stern said as she packed
up plants for her clients to take home.
</P>
<P>
   Manjovi believes music triggers vivid memories in Alzheimer's
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is a very powerful tool for people who are
memory-impaired. They remember where they were the first time they
heard Al Jolson, they might remember seeing Frank Sinatra at the
Paramount.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that day, Manjovi said, a woman who had stopped talking
and was confined to a wheelchair became animated when he mentioned
Kate Smith. ``I played `God Bless America' and she sang the whole
thing and she hadn't spoken for weeks. When I finished she said,
`That was beautiful.'''
</P>
<P>
   Care providers say the need for programs like Elderserve at
Night will grow as people live longer. About four million Americans
have the disease, according to the Alzheimer's Association. The
number of Alzheimer's patients is expected to grow to 14 million
nationwide by 2050 _ anywhere from 1 in 20 to 1 in 30 Americans,
according to census projections.

CLINTON, STARR IN SHOWDOWN OVER PRESIDENT'S TESTIMONY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and independent counsel Kenneth
W. Starr are poised to engage in either a historic confrontation or
a legal compromise as early as this week, as lawyers for the two
men prepare to negotiate the president's likely testimony before a
federal grand jury, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoena served on Clinton a couple of weeks ago had an
appearance date of early this week, according to officials familiar
with the proceedings, creating a sense of imminence in Starr's
six-month investigation into whether Clinton engaged in a sexual
relationship with former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky and
pressured her to lie about it.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials continued to indicate Sunday that Clinton
was willing to provide testimony to the federal grand jury hearing
the Lewinsky case, but that he would staunchly refuse to appear in
person before the panel at the US District Court. Rather, aides
said, he would insist on answering questions in writing or
providing videotaped testimony from the White House that could be
aired to the grand jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, White House officials refused even to confirm the
existence of a subpoena, beyond Friday's statements from press
secretary Michael McCurry that Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall,
would negotiate with Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has changed,'' said Jim Kennedy, a White House
spokesman on legal issues.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, however, there was a sense of anxiety as officials
and lawyers came to the realization that Clinton could be severely
damaged politically by exercising all his legal rights and fighting
the subpoena to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Despite telling reporters in January that ``I'd like for you to
have more rather than less, sooner rather than later,'' Clinton has
provided few details on his relationship with Lewinsky, and now
answers virtually all questions on the case with a blanket denial
or silence.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday, the subpoena had triggered a series of divisive
political and legal debates around Washington, the most pointed of
them being whether a president can be compelled to testify in a
criminal trial or before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   There is no clear, legal precedent for the subpoena, and legal
scholars appeared split. In 1973, federal prosecutors subpoenaed
President Nixon's White House tapes, but not his personal
testimony. When Nixon refused to turn the tapes over, the
prosecutors won a unanimous Supreme Court decision in 1974, and
Nixon resigned about a month later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an open question,'' said Paul Rothstein, a Georgetown
University Law Center professor. ``The Constitution provides for a
separation of powers and there is a good argument that the
president cannot be forced to appear before the judicial branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least the question is, `What can you do if he refuses?'''
Rothstein said. ``Would you imprison the president? That would be a
constitutional crisis. This is not crystal clear and it's never
been tested. All the testimony in the past has been voluntary.''
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers have wondered whether a grand jury is the proper
venue for presidential testimony, and whether a president could
even be indicted. One argument among constitutional scholars is
that only Congress can remove a president, and thus the only place
a president should testify is before lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr's spokesman, Charles Bakaly, has said that the
independent counsel's office believes a president can be indicted .
</P>
<P>
   Said Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law
professor who has filed court briefs on behalf of Starr, ``The
argument that the president stands beyond the subpoena power of a
prosecutor is historically and legally misplaced. The judicial
branch has the ultimate authority to enforce the laws through court
orders, if necessary. Even the president of the United States is
subject to the authority of the judicial branch.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, said if Clinton refuses to provide testimony,
the House may then seek his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he would ignore and violate a subpoena would
certainly be grounds to file articles of impeachment,'' said Hatch,
appearing on the CBS show ``Face the Nation'' Sunday. ``If Kenneth
Starr does have additional information, I think it could snowball
into a real impeachment problem for the president. I personally
hope that doesn't happen. I hope that none of this is true. I hope
the president can get through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's former chief of staff, Leon Panetta, said Sunday that
Starr would agree to allow Clinton to videotape testimony from the
White House. Clinton has provided videotaped testimony in
Whitewater-related cases in which he has not been presumed to be
the target of the investigation. Clinton also gave a deposition to
Paula Jones's lawyers at his attorney's office in January.
</P>
<P>
   Other presidents and prosecutors have reached various
arrangements that have precluded any court or grand jury appearance
and sidestepped the need for a subpoena. President Reagan gave
written answers in the Iran-Conta investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that it's in the interest of either the special
prosecutor or the president to have a constitutional crisis here
that forces this decision to the Supreme Court,'' said Panetta,
speaking on the ABC show ``This Week'' Sunday. ``I don't see any
reason, very frankly, why both parties cannot agree on a format
here that allows the president to present his testimony, provides
certain limitations, but at the same time goes to the heart of the
issue that's under investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Sunday that they do not believe a showdown will occur today because
neither Clinton nor Kendall will be in Washington until late in the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Said Rahm Emanuel, Clinton's senior adviser on policy and
strategy, on NBC's ``Meet the Press'': ``The president wants to get
the information that the grand jury needs and has instructed Mr.
Kendall to talk to Mr. Starr to do exactly that.''

BELICHICK HELPS BUILD FOR JETS' FUTURE AND HIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The man who figures to be the New York Jets'
next head coach presided over his beloved defense Sunday, his usual
quiet demeanor punctuated occasionally by a high-pitched voice
trying to fuse a mostly ordinary bunch into a group making
extraordinary plays.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Belichick helped create the defensive schemes that were so
critical in last year's spectacular turnaround: the club pared 167
points from the total it had given up in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He is viewed as the cerebral part of the Parcells-Belichick
brain trust that has been together so long that Bill Parcells has
already nominated him as successor.
</P>
<P>
   To distinguish between the pair in conversation, people in the
front office simply call them Big Bill and Little Bill.
</P>
<P>
   To Parcells, his alter ego is a powerful ally. So much so that
Parcells has made Belichick _ the assistant head coach and
defensive backs tutor _ the highest-paid assistant in pro football
at a salary reported to be more than $750,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   And when Parcells talks of not having a set number of years
remaining to coach, as he did in response to a question Sunday
morning, then Belichick again becomes a focus of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells promised Sunday that he would at least finish this
season, if not more. ``I coach year to year,'' Parcells reiterated.
``Some people don't like to hear that. But at this stage of my
life, that's just the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells signed a six-year contract as head of the team last
season, which included at least four as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   And is Belichick his heir apparent?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he likes it here,'' Parcells said. ``He's had his
share of overtures. He knows what I'm thinking. But a lot can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing extraordinary happens to change the long-term plan,
though, it is obvious that Belichick is in line for the job.
</P>
<P>
   He was the head coach last year in that bizarre week when
Parcells was named a ``consultant'' until the league could sort out
a conflict between him and the Patriots, whom he was leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the head coach,'' Belichick said Sunday when asked about
the moves he made then. ``I hired Scott Pioli and Eric Mangini. I
spoke to Mike Tannenbaum, I spoke to John Lott, I hired Linda.''
</P>
<P>
   Pioli is the club's pro personnel director, Mangini a defensive
assistant. Tannenbaum became the contract director, Lott the
strength coach. Linda Leoni is Parcells' secretary. In other words,
in that week's work, Belichick helped alter the direction of the
front office and the way it operated.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning, Belichick and Parcells had what Parcells
describes as a water-cooler conversation. It concerned whether to
convert the club's top draft pick, Dorian Boose, to right end from
left end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the relationship,'' Parcells explained. ``It's a kind
of water-cooler deal _ you know, at the office when you meet at the
water cooler to discuss business. It only lasted two minutes today,
but we'll both think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells concedes that he and Belichick do not associate
socially. ``But when I look back on my coaching career, I'll think
of him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick's father, Steve, was a longtime coach at Navy and
scouted Army every Saturday in preparation for their annual game.
In the late 1960s, Parcells was an assistant at West Point, where
he met Steve. Eventually, he met young Bill.
</P>
<P>
   When they finally hooked up in the pros, with the Giants,
Parcells and Belichick were assistants under Ray Perkins. Parcells
recalled that he asked to borrow Belichick for help calling
defensive plays during games. That was in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   They went on separate paths between 1991 and 1995, when
Belichick was the Browns' head coach, and got back together in 1996
at New England.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the 1997 Jets, who were trying to erase the memory of
the 1-15 season in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year's was a hard team to evaluate off the film because
the style of defense was so dramatically different from what we
wanted,'' Belichick said. ``We had no defensive linemen to speak
of.''
</P>
<P>
   But several free agents had performed for him at Cleveland,
including Ernie Logan and Rick Lyle, and they became Jets. This
year, another former Browns player, Anthony Pleasant, joined the
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year and at this summer camp, the Jets have become
more of a zone team with a defense designed to avoid giving up big
plays. They will show a 4-3 defense. They are unlikely to generate
many sacks but have, Belichick said, ``all very consistent players
on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   If the defense is even better now with Pleasant on the right
side instead of the inconsistent Hugh Douglas, and if the
second-year linebacker James Farrior improves from a solid rookie
season, the defense will continue to be stingy. Last year, it
yielded the fewest points of any team in the American Football
Conference East and tied for fourth in the conference with 18
interceptions. &QL;

EDITORIAL: A WEAK INTERNATIONAL COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, July 27:
</P>
<P>
   Even though his crimes were invoked by many who worked to create
an international criminal court, it is doubtful that Saddam Hussein
lost any sleep when it came into being in Rome on July 17. It was
an important moment for those who longed to put some teeth into
international law. More than 100 nations have now created an
institution to prosecute people who commit international crimes.
But the court's weaknesses will allow many of the worst criminals
to escape trial.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty creating the court still needs ratification by 60
nations. That could be a long process. The United States _ along
with six other nations, including China, Israel and India _ refused
to sign the treaty. Washington did its best to sabotage the court,
and largely succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   The court will allow prosecutors to collect information,
bringing public attention to international crimes. In some cases,
especially when the U.N. Security Council wishes, there will be
trials. But the treaty contains important loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious provides that before someone can be prosecuted
either his government or the country where the abuse took place
must consent. This will grant state-sponsored criminals impunity
when their victims are their own countrymen, which is the case with
most conflicts today. They can even travel freely. Only someone who
commits genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes on foreign
soil should fear the court _ and even then the court may lack
adequate power to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty, which was finished in a mad scramble, must still be
refined. It is important to keep trying to make the court as strong
as possible. Unfortunately Washington seems poised to continue its
sabotage of the court. President Clinton has made some eloquent
speeches about the importance of punishing and deterring genocide
and other international crimes. Washington's shameful performance
in Rome belies his commitment. &QL;

EDITORIAL: CAMPAIGN REFORM SHOWDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, July 27:
</P>
<P>
   The drive to enact sweeping campaign finance reform legislation
is heading for a supreme test. In a devious plan, House Speaker
Newt Gingrich has scheduled votes on 38 amendments designed to
fracture bipartisan support for the Shays-Meehan legislation to
outlaw ``soft money.'' These votes were scheduled for Monday but
delayed because of the tributes to the two police officers slain in
Friday's shooting at the Capitol. The votes should be rescheduled
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   If reformers defeat the killer amendments this week, it will
clear the way for a final vote on the bill next week. This is a
decisive moment for Democrats and Republicans cooperating uneasily
to change the fund-raising system that in 1996 produced the worst
election scandals in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   On both sides, lawmakers will have to do distasteful things for
a higher good. Democrats will have to ignore several
Gingrich-inspired amendments aimed simply at rebuking President
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore for their fund-raising abuses.
Many Republicans are being asked to vote tactically against
amendments they might otherwise support. We will be watching to see
if Republican moderates, who are essential to the coalition, stand
firm against the Gingrich team's effort to save special-interest
politics.
</P>
<P>
   There were reasons to doubt that the Shays-Meehan bill would get
this far. Gingrich's promises of a fair vote were repeatedly
broken. But a subtle change has occurred in the dynamics of the
House. Rep. Dick Armey, the majority leader, pledged that the House
would complete consideration of campaign reform before the August
recess. His credibility is on the line.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that Gingrich and Rep. Tom DeLay, the main
antagonist of reform on the House floor, are feeling real heat.
Their original intention was to finish the Shays-Meehan vote this
week. Then suddenly they delayed to give the Senate time to adjourn
and get out of town by Friday. Their fear was that Senate reformers
might seize on a House-approved bill and immediately start
attaching it to legislation. The last thing Trent Lott wanted was
to have to filibuster reform, as he did last year.
</P>
<P>
   The sleazy tactics of the Gingrich-Lott anti-reform combine are
a bit of a mystery. The Democrats committed the most serious abuses
in 1996. Here is a chance for the Republicans to become the party
of clean politics by passing a ban on unlimited soft-money
donations to political parties. It is probably impossible to
convert Gingrich and Lott to the politics of clean money. But
unlike these GOP leaders, the American people would like to see
that principle triumph with House passage of the Shays-Meehan
bill. &QL;

NICKLAUS' BITTER_SWEET LAST ROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gimpy's goodbye sounded a lot like the growl of a
Golden Bear of old.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus, who limped around Riviera Country Club to a
career senior-tour high of 79 one day earlier, closed out his 1998
tour season Sunday with the best round of the U.S. Senior Open.
</P>
<P>
   The man who has won more majors than any golfer in history had
mixed emotions about his final-round 67.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus was pleased _ ``I played pretty well'' _ but he wanted
more _ ``I lipped out four putts.'' And what he !ital!really!off!
wanted was to take his Sunday health back in time to his staggering
third round on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I had to do was shoot 72 yesterday and I am sitting right
there,'' he said after finishing early.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, ``right there'' would have put him in an
18-hole playoff with Hale Irwin for the championship.
</P>
<P>
   But that's Jack Nicklaus golf these days. When's he's pain-free,
as he was Sunday, he can shoot with the best on this tour. When his
left hip starts hurting, as it has increasingly in recent years,
his scores can soar.
</P>
<P>
   It's the reason Nicklaus will play no more tournaments this year
and dedicate himself to regaining health.
</P>
<P>
   ``My priority is going to be one thing: That is to get
physically fit.''
</P>
<P>
   His ailing hip seemed markedly improved in his getaway round
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My body was great, no problems whatsoever,'' he said,
emphasizing the point by jumping up and down in front of a statue
of Riviera legend Ben Hogan. Nicklaus credits physical therapist
Pete Egoscue for Sunday's pain-free hip, saying Saturday-night
exercises left him feeling so good that he ran back to his hotel
room afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Egoscue's exercise therapy has Nicklaus optimistic he might be
able to avoid surgery _ even to the extent of hip replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He proved to me the last two days that I don't need one,''
Nicklaus said. ``Now, we are just going to find out how long it
works.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan now is to exercise conservatively.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you destroy the head of the femur through exercise and it
doesn't have any cushion there, then you make the operation
mandatory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus hopes to dodge that and be playing again next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't found anything that I really like to do better,'' he
said.

TIMES SQUARE STILL CLOSED DESPITE PROMISES TO REOPEN STREETS 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: See also NY-COLLAPSE-PETS) 
(js) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even as construction crews working around the clock
fell short of restoring some normalcy to Times Square Sunday, as
the mayor's office had predicted, city officials retreated to vague
but optimistic pronouncements about exactly when streets and
buildings would be reopened and remained tight-lipped about the
cause of last week's construction accident and the costs associated
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Among the denizens of Times Square, frustration has grown with
each new delay in making the area safe after the partial collapse
of scaffolding at the Conde Nast building on 43rd Street and
Broadway. Losses to some businesses have already been steep. And
those who had been rushed out of their homes last Tuesday _ some
without a change of clothes, many without their pets, at least one
man without plane tickets for his honeymoon _ said they were
running out of patience.
</P>
<P>
   But patience was the only counsel that city officials could
offer. Jerome Hauer, director of the mayor's Office of Emergency
Management, said Sunday evening that he hoped Broadway and Seventh
Avenue would be open by the Monday morning rush hour, but could not
be more specific. When pressed, the city's buildings commissioner,
Gaston Silva, would only say, ``Ideally, 6 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials would not say when they planned to reopen the
other streets that have been closed around Times Square. The
officials also said they planned to retrieve pets from the
evacuated buildings along 43rd and 44th streets Sunday night but
declined to say exactly when that could happen. ``We are having to
adjust the process and adjust the schedule as we go through this,''
Hauer said. ``It would be foolhardy at this point to rush people
in.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, they said, nothing would happen until construction
crews finished draping a giant charcoal-colored nylon net around
tottering scaffolding, particularly in the building's most
dangerous, upper reaches, from where a shower of steel beams could
do great damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like hanging a huge shower curtain in the sky with one
arm tied behind your back,'' said Richard Kieler, a senior vice
president with Tishman Realty and Construction, the construction
manager at the site.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since Saturday afternoon, the very construction workers who had
erected the 700-foot scaffolding along the gleaming tower tried to
save their handiwork _ an ominous sculpture that resembled a game
of pickup sticks _ from crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Working in the noonday sun and under fluorescent bulbs that
lighted the night sky, their job was as tedious as it was tense.
Two or three at a time, they climbed into an aluminum bucket
seemingly dangling from the clouds. Using wire ties, they fastened
the nylon mesh to a set of cables running along the length of the
scaffolding _ once every five feet, so the sheath would be
sufficiently taut. Another construction worker kept in constant
touch with the crane operator high above, asking for the bucket to
be lifted or lowered, pressed closer or pulled away from the
scaffolding.
</P>
<P>
   By late Sunday afternoon the workers had draped the net around
the first 300 feet of the building, down to roughly the 28th floor,
said J. Kidd, an ironworker who had been in and out of the bucket
all day. Two sides of the building, facing east and west, had
already been covered; they were working on the north side last
night. Sometimes, the wind swayed the aluminum bucket; sometimes,
the nylon sheath too.
</P>
<P>
   So when Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced on Saturday that the
sheath would be in place by Sunday, Kidd, 37, was skeptical. ``I
just laughed,'' he said, taking a lunch break Sunday afternoon in
the middle of a 12-hour shift. ``He doesn't have a clue about
what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Giuliani acknowledged that progress had been slower
than he had anticipated, and he set another, more flexible
timetable _ one construction workers ultimately failed to meet.
``Right now, the schedule that I foresee is that that curtain will
be sufficiently lowered to protect the area where people want to go
in, about sundown today,'' he said. ``If that slips, I'm not going
to pressure them to make a decision because people are yelling and
screaming at them about pets.''
</P>
<P>
   Some pet owners were not only screaming. They were marching in
the streets for the last several days, urging city workers to
rescue their animals. One man, the defiant owner of a cat named
Go-Go, even took matters into his own hands, walking right past a
police barricade and into his West 44th Street apartment.

NEW YORK KEEPS STREAK ALIVE WITH 78-62 WIN OVER DETROIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEVE POPPER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Liberty Coach Nancy Darsch recently exhorted her team
to stop thinking, have fun and just play. It worked, as the Liberty
won its fourth straight game Sunday, a 78-62 victory over the
Detroit Shock at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, there were varying theories to explain the
disparity in the Liberty's performance this season. The Liberty
(12-9) lost its first four games, then was inconsistent for a long
stretch and had lost four in a row before this latest winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Some said it was the defensive intensity. Others opted for the
decision four games ago to let Teresa Weatherspoon call all of the
team's offensive sets from the floor. But all agreed that Darsch's
decree made the difference on both ends.
</P>
<P>
   It has been fun these days for the Liberty, which moved into
second place in the Eastern Conference with the victory. And it was
more than just the score. It was that the Liberty players have
taken the speech to heart, smiling wider than the 15,114 fans in
the stands Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a lot of fun when you play like that,'' said Rebecca
Lobo, who scored 14 points and grabbed 10 rebounds. ``This is the
way basketball is fun to play, with everyone playing well, playing
with intensity, making the extra pass and running down the floor
with a smile on your face.''
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to smile on this day, the first game back home in
two weeks. Entering the game tied with the Shock and percentage
points behind Cleveland, the Liberty knew the importance of this
game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Liberty started slowly, trailing by 14-8 midway through
the first half. Then the Liberty got a pair of layups from Sophia
Witherspoon, and, after pulling within 16-12, it scored the next 8
points, pushing ahead of the Shock and then piling it on the rest
of the half.
</P>
<P>
   After the 6-point deficit, the Liberty outscored the Shock by
35-8 over the final 10 minutes 9 seconds of the half to take a
43-22 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been the shooting of Witherspoon _ who scored 11 of
her game-high 17 points in the first half _ and the play of Lobo
that got the Liberty started. But once the team began rolling,
every player contributed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a joy,'' said Weatherspoon, who had nine assists and four
steals. ``Everyone really smiles when you're winning. But we stayed
together through the adverse times. We're having fun, high-fiving,
bumping each other into the crowd. That's what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Korie Hlede, who led Detroit with 14 points, 8 rebounds and 6
assists, said: ``New York came out with a lot of intensity. They
are a great team, and they are playing really well right now,
especially with the crowd like that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, it continued, with Lobo intercepting a pass
meant for a teammate, taking a Kym Hampton bullet almost in the
nose and recovering to drop in a short jumper. Then, with the score
escalating out of reach, the bench was able to take over.
</P>
<P>
   Coquese Washington replaced Weatherspoon for 16 minutes, scoring
4 points, handing out 3 assists and getting a pair of steals, all
at the same frenetic pace that Weatherspoon set. Kisha Ford came
off the bench to hit 5 of 5 from the floor, finishing with a
career-best 12 points. &QL;

`PRIVATE RYAN' HAS BEACHHEAD AT THE BOX OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: In 8th graf, today refers to Monday) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan'' easily
won the box office war with an estimated $30.1 million at 2,463
theaters during its Friday-Sunday opening, studio sources said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The highly anticipated D-Day epic, starring Tom Hanks and
directed by Spielberg, dominated business with widespread sold-out
showings on Friday and Saturday nights.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend total would have probably been higher, but a
delivery glitch, blamed on Technicolor Film Services, resulted in
cancellation of several early shows Friday at theaters in the Los
Angeles and Phoenix areas. Industry tracker Robert Bucksbaum of
Reel Source estimated the box office shortfall could have been as
high as 10 percent of Friday's $9.7 million total.
</P>
<P>
   ``This opening really puts DreamWorks on the map as a top
studio,'' Bucksbaum said of the 4-year-old enterprise headed by
Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen. ``The numbers are
just phenomenal for a film that runs two hours and 45 minutes,
which limits most theaters to three showings a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum predicted ``Saving Private Ryan'' will take in between
$155 million and $170 million domestically, placing it among the
top 50 U.S. grossers of all time. He forecast $150 million
overseas, where co-financier Paramount is handling the $70 million
film.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Arthur Rockwell of Drake Capital Securities said, ``The
numbers are particularly impressive for a seriously themed movie
during the summer,'' noting that studios usually use summer for
``popcorn films'' without much intellectual underpinning.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell also credited Spielberg and Hanks with maximizing
public awareness of ``Saving Private Ryan'' in recent weeks.
Spielberg has warned that the first 25 minutes are particularly
violent and not suitable for children under 15.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks distribution chief James Tharp said the studio will
meet today with Technicolor representatives over the delivery
problem, the first to occur on a major release within memory.
</P>
<P>
   Tharp also said the studio plans to add theaters to the ``Saving
Private Ryan'' run in coming weeks, noting that the drama received
strong responses among all demographics and regions. ``Our exit
polling showed virtually everyone rating it excellent or very good,
with most rating it excellent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the slate produced generally solid returns, led by
Sony's second weekend of ``The Mask of Zorro'' with $13.7 million
at 2,515 theaters to push its 10-day total to $47.6 million. The
swashbuckler declined 39 percent from last weekend, when it topped
the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' third weekend of ``Lethal Weapon 4'' was a close
third with $12.9 million at 3,117 sites, edging 20th Century Fox's
second weekend of ``There's Something About Mary'' with $12.7
million at 2,216 screens. ``LW4'' has nearly $95 million in 17 days
and ``Mary'' lost a mere 7 percent from its opening, giving a
strong signal that the comedy _ made for less than the $41 million
it has grossed so far _ will eventually hit the $100 million
milestone despite its crude humor.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's fourth weekend of ``Armageddon'' delivered solid
returns with $10.9 million at 3,127 theaters to continue its
respectable performance after its opening fell short of
expectations. The asteroid spectacular has topped $149 million in
26 days to replace Paramount's ``Deep Impact'' as the top domestic
grosser among movies released this year. ``Armageddon'' now ranks
56th on the all-time domestic list behind ``Rambo: First Blood,
Part II.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's fifth weekend of ``Dr. Dolittle'' finished sixth with $7
million at 2,528 theaters to top $117 million overall. It edged
MGM's opening of teen screamfest ``Disturbing Behavior'' starring
Katie Holmes of ``Dawson Creek,'' with $6.9 million at 1,842 sites,
and Disney's debut of the gangster-movie spoof ``Mafia!'' with $6.4
million at 1,942 locations.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 were DreamWorks' third weekend of
``Small Soldiers'' with $5.1 million at 2,512 sites and Disney's
sixth weekend of ``Mulan'' with $3.4 million at 1,705 screens to
hit $108 million overall. Sony's third weekend of ``Madeline'' came
in 11th with $2.8 million at 1,733 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a strong overall weekend with a lot of good product in
different genres,'' Rockwell said, noting that the period had
easily topped the same weekend of 1997, led by the $37.1 million
opening of ``Air Force One.''
</P>
<P>
   Year-to-date business has topped $3.6 billion and is about 6
percent ahead of the same period last year. Much of that is due to
Paramount's ``Titanic,'' which posted a still-impressive $1.5
million at 1,155 theaters in its 32nd weekend to push its overall
domestic total to $593.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Trimark's limited opening of gay romantic comedy ``Billy's
Hollywood Screen Kiss'' posted respectable returns with $140,000 at
13 screens. New Line's fifth weekend of the revamped ``Gone With
the Wind'' took in $300,000 at 200 theaters to bring its all-time
domestic gross to $197 million, 25th on the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' is likely to lead the upcoming weekend
due to strong word of mouth among moviegoers. It will face
competition from four new entries _ Universal's slapstick comedy
``BASEketball,'' with ``South Park'' co-creators Trey Parker and
Matt Stone; Fox's ``Ever After'' with Drew Barrymore as a
Renaissance Cinderella; Warner's action-drama ``The Negotiator,''
with Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey; and Disney's updated
version of its 1961 hit ``The Parent Trap.''

BARNES LOSES TWO SHOTS AND HIS COOL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With his penchant for chain smoking and bulging
biceps, Brian Barnes seems better suited for working on a dock than
a golf course. And when you get a glimpse of his temper, well, than
you know he's not your typical bland pro golfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a dangerous man angry. I put two people in the hospital
when I was in school,'' Barnes said. ``I don't get angry often, but
when I do, watch out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was one of those days. In the final round of the U.S.
Senior Open at Riviera Country Club, Barnes' demeanor was even more
imposing than his 6-foot-3, 240-pound frame.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a miracle he didn't trash his locker, or take a few
whacks at cars in the parking lot with his clubs. He sure looked
ready for some destructive action Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Blame Barnes. Or his caddie, Phil Rimm. Or a nosy
spectator. Or all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, in the process of torching the difficult Riviera course
Sunday, was assessed a two-stroke penalty on the 11th hole for
playing his ball from the wrong spot. After his ball landed on the
green, Barnes marked the ball ``over'' one putter-head length,
because his marker was in the way of partner Jose Maria Canizares'
putt.
</P>
<P>
   But Barnes failed to place his ball back in its original spot
when he putted out, instead playing from the putter-length over.
The infraction was noticed by a spectator, but Barnes was not
notified until the 13th hole.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a par-5 on the 11th, Barnes took a 7. He also bogeyed
the 13th, immediately after hearing about the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   It was costly, to say the least. If Barnes had not given up two
strokes, he would have tied Vicente Fernandez for second place. If
Hale Irwin hadn't birdied the 18th hole, Barnes would have been in
a three-way playoff for first place today.
</P>
<P>
   He would have shot a 67 _ tied for best round of the tournament
_ if not for the penalty and felt he would have done even better on
the final five holes if he hadn't been so angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on a roll. One more birdie before the penalty and I
would have had all those (playing) behind me (bleeping) in their
pants,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes was so mad as he left the course, he stalked past the
gallery, blew through the locker room and straight into the parking
lot. He yelled at reporters to ``go away,'' but after a few
minutes, sat under a tree and collected his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes me a little bit of time to cool down. If I could have
somebody to punch in the bloody nose, he'd still be down now,''
Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the penalty?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just sheer stupidity, wasn't it?'' said Barnes, who was born
in England but plays for Scotland. ``I was, I suppose, in my own
world. I blame myself. It might have cost me the bloody Open. It
must be old age. To be that bloody stupid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need a shooter. I'll tell you... if there's one thing that
could drive me back to drink, it's that. Never have I done anything
this idiotic in my career. It must be old age. Moving the ball in
the most important tournament I've played is idiotic.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the intricate nature of golf etiquette, the blame
allegedly lied with Rimm. It is the caddie's responsibility to
alert a player before such mistakes are made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's both our faults. There are a few things a caddie should
do and that was one there,'' Barnes said. ``(But) it's up to me to
place the bloody ball in position.''
</P>
<P>
   Rimm was at a loss over the incident. ``I don't know how it
happened,'' he said. ``Other than Brian marked the ball and didn't
replace it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a shame that Barnes' tournament was marked _ no pun
intended _by the mishap. He is an oddity on the tour, constantly
smoking cigarettes during his round, often flicking his butts into
the fairway before taking a shot.
</P>
<P>
   But this has been a strange tournament. Two players _ Larry
Ziegler and Jerry Heard _ were disqualified for signing incorrect
scorecards. That hardly compared to the importance of Barnes'
indiscretion, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose I have done this before, hell, probably every golfer
has,'' Barnes said. ``But I have never done anything this idiotic
in a tournament the stature of the U.S. Senior Open. Satisfaction
is gone completely, once that happened.''

POWERBALL FRENZY GRIPS THE NATION

 (EDS: Subs to give more details on Powerball lottery game; grafs 5,
6 and 7 contain new material.)  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.H., Mass., N.Y., N.J., Ore., Wash., Ind., Ill.,
Iowa, Pa., W.Va., N.C.)  (lh) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   GREENWICH, Conn. _ In a stunning triumph of optimism over simple
arithmetic, Americans tapped their savings, choked sidewalks and
interstate highways and blissfully endured hours in the summer sun
Sunday as they lined up by the millions for a 1-in-80-million shot
at a quarter-billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   After the Powerball lottery game announced the biggest jackpot
in the nation's history, people flocked across state lines to
Connecticut, the District of Columbia and the 19 other states where
Powerball tickets are sold.
</P>
<P>
   Jay K. Patel of Forest Hills, N.Y., spent $3,000 at Greenwich
Cigar and Stationery, where police had set up pylons, barricades
and yellow ``Caution'' tape to control the crowds. ``Dollar and
dream _ that's all you think,'' Patel said as the shop's single
lottery machine chugged out his pink and orange slips. ``Now, I
have 3,000 dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Kovic, 28, a waiter from the Bronx who said he was
studying aircraft design at a trade school, bought 3,000 tickets
with money he said he had been saving for tuition. ``If I win, I
won't have to go to school,'' he explained. ``Heck, I can buy my
own aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   And this was only Day 1. The latest and largest installment of
lotto mania was born at 3 a.m. Sunday, when game officials in West
Des Moines, Iowa, determined that no one had bought a winning
ticket in the Powerball drawing on Saturday night. So that jackpot,
itself close to a record, rolled into Wednesday night's drawing,
when the right six numbers will be worth an estimated $250 million
before taxes, based on an annual payout for 20 years. Winners may
choose beforehand to get a lump sum, which is estimated at $150
million. Multiple winners would divide the prize.
</P>
<P>
   Powerball players select five numbers from a pool of 49 and a
sixth number from a separate pool of 42. Lottery officials and
experts said that if only one person correctly picks all six
numbers on Wednesday, the prize will eclipse the previous record
for a single winner's jackpot, $195 million, which was won in May
by a Wisconsin man on another Powerball drawing. Only one lottery
game has had a bigger purse. Last year's Christmas lottery drawing
in Spain had a $270 million purse, but the grand prize was only $2
million.
</P>
<P>
   Powerball officials said they would not know until Monday how
many tickets were sold Sunday, but they said it was more than the
4.5 million that were sold last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the greed factor: Bigger is better,'' said Douglas A.
Orr, the marketing coordinator of the Multi-State Lottery
Association, a group in West Des Moines that runs the game. He said
officials expect to sell at least 150 million tickets before the
drawing at 10:59 p.m. on Wednesday. For the record-breaking pot in
May, 138 million were sold. A ticket costs $1. The chance of
winning is 1 in 80 million.
</P>
<P>
   The huge prizes have served as a swift vindication for the
multistate lottery, which was formed in 1988 as Lotto America by
smaller states, mostly in the Midwest. They could not compete with
the jackpots of the larger states and so decided to pool their
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Barry A. Miller, the editor of Lotto World, a monthly magazine
published in Naples, Fla., predicted that the Powerball prize would
lure droves of first-time players of all incomes, shades and
classes. ``Most people know it's a fantasy,'' he said. ``But
someone wins, and it could be you.'' Miller plans to have a friend
in Bridgeport, Conn., buy him one ticket. ``I never overspend,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their popularity, lotteries have long been a
controversial part of American history, said Dennis Rudd, who
teaches courses on gambling and lottery operations at Robert Morris
College in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, people would stage private lotteries to
finance schools, roads, churches and other institutions. The
Revolutionary War and Reconstruction, in particular, featured
numerous endeavors built largely with lottery-powered money, Rudd
said. But lotteries often had a mixed reputation, too, besmirched
by allegations of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, as states have become more involved in running
lotteries, the moral debate over them has subsided somewhat, Rudd
said. And the big question, it seems, is how much bigger the grand
prize can get _ and to what length people are willing to go to
pursue something that they have no realistic chance of snaring.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd should know. Sunday, he drove an hour from his home in
Pittsburgh to a gas station in Chester, W.Va., to purchase five
tickets. There were more than 200 people in line, he said,
including one couple who had driven nine hours from North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   There were dentists, truck drivers, the unemployed _ a
cross-section of economics, race and class. Some people bought a
single Powerball ticket, Rudd said. One person purchased 4,000. All
were talking the same language.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you realize you're not going to win,'' Rudd said.
``But you have a chance, and you have as good a chance as the next
guy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rudd's sentiments were echoed throughout the country, in gas
stations, convenience stores, anywhere that posted any variation of
the spell-inducing words: Yes, We Have Powerball Tickets.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Line Grocery in Fitzwilliam, N.H., Chuck Kiritsy
said that he had sold more than 24,000 Powerball tickets over the
past seven days, about 12 times higher than normal. Many buyers
were from Massachusetts, he said, and many seemed to have an extra
pep in their step.
</P>
<P>
   Powerball frenzy, in other words, was affecting behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are absolutely crazy,'' Kiritsy said. ``They don't know
anything about the game or even how to check their numbers. They're
just spending money.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Midwest, Eric Wold, an unrecorded singer and unpublished
songwriter, drove 90 minutes from his home in West Chicago, Ill. to
the Amoco Service Station in Hammond, Ind. for a chance to win _
again.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Wold, 33, won $117 after picking four of the six
numbers on a $1 investment. But instead of investing his winnings
in, say, the stock market, he purchased $100 worth of Powerball
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't put a price on a dream,'' Wold said. ``I'd buy a
small country and maybe donate enough to the Democrats to spend a
night in the White House. I'd love to sleep in that Lincoln
Bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   In several states, the demand was so intense Sunday that
additional workers and terminals were needed. As of July 23, at
least 76 television stations in 17 states and the District of
Columbia planned to broadcast the drawing live at 10:59 p.m. on
Wednesday, according to the Web site of the Multi-State Lottery
Association, in West Des Moines, which operates Powerball.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as busy as it was Sunday, Powerball sellers said that
Saturday was busier than Sunday, because of run-up to the Saturday
drawing, which, of course, had no winner.
</P>
<P>
   This description was typical, perhaps: ``You should have been
here yesterday,'' said Valera Alcala, a clerk at the Plaid Pantry
convenience store on Hadyen Island in north Portland, Ore., just
across the Washington state line. ``The line was to the back of the
store, into the subway, out the door, past the dumpster and into
the mobile home park next door.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was Saturday, when the jackpot was a relatively modest
$183 million. Try again on Wednesday, when it is up to $250 million
_ or almost one dollar per person in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they'll start going crazy here beginning Monday
night,'' said Barbara Bush, a clerk at the Amoco Station in
Hammond, Ind. ``That's when we'll start seeing paychecks, rent and
mortgage payments and the food money start to come across our
counter.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Powerball tickets are not sold in New York or New
Jersey, Powerball fever has brought a fleeting democracy to
Greenwich, where Escorts jockeyed with Jaguars on streets lined
with shops sporting elegant awnings and offering pricey
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the frenzy was frightening. Gerald Guerrier, who works
for a lottery machine service firm in Rocky Hill, Conn., nursed
printers and motherboards Sunday with the urgency of a heart
surgeon. Crowds outside his various stops cursed as he went in and
cheered as he left. ``At one deli, the owner told the crowd, `If he
doesn't fix the machine, kill him,''' Guerrier said with wide eyes.
``One lady said, `There'd be no witnesses.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gail Howard, owner of a publishing company in White Plains,
N.Y., said she expected Powerball to propel sales of her lottery
books and software which for up to $79.95 help players eliminate
combinations that she says are unlikely to win. But Ms. Howard said
that all that expertise might improve the odds from 1 in 80 million
to 1 in 50 million. ``If this is your time, God will pick you,''
she said. ``It's still luck.''
</P>
<P>
   At 8 Sunday night, 300 people were lined up at Putnam Shell
here. Anticipating even bigger crowds on Monday, the Greenwich
Police has doubled its day shift from 20 officers to 40, and set up
barricades at 10 stores, Lt. David C. Ridberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the rush, many stores told patrons they could not
play their carefully chosen numbers, and would sell only ``quick
picks'' chosen by the cash register sized lottery machines.
</P>
<P>
   Customers shaded themselves with umbrellas as people wended
through makeshift versions of the pens found at amusement parks.
Most stores let groups of about five in at a time and kept the rest
out on the sidewalk. Cheers erupted each time a group emerged and
the next lucky bunch moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as word spread about the $150 million jackpot, many
people slept in their cars in order to be in line when machines
went on at 6 a.m. This week, store managers said they expect even
larger slumber parties. At Greenwich Cigar and Stationery, which
sold about 30,000 tickets Sunday, the owner took appointments for
high rollers. ``I have a man who wants 10,000 tickets coming at 6,
a $2,400 order at 7 and a $3,000 at 7:30,'' said the owner, Ashok
J. Sheth.
</P>
<P>
   For retailers, every number is a lucky number: Stores keep 5 to
7 cents for each ticket they sell, according to the Powerball
spokesmen. But just the prospect of riches made some customers feel
flush. ``All I need is $2 million. I'd give away the rest,'' said
Elina Gomez, 56, of Elizabeth, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A Powerball riot nearly broke out at Zyn Stationery here when
Consuelo Sipsas of Queens, N.Y., tried to slip into the store ahead
of 100 people in a line presided over by three Greenwich police
officers. Cries of ``The woman in white!'' and ``Shoot her''
erupted from the crowd, and an officer removed her from the line.
``What can I say? I felt lucky,'' Mrs. Sipsas, 47, said as she
moved up the street toward another Powerball outlet.
</P>
<P>
   When the store closed at 6 p.m. after selling 15,000 tickets in
12 hours, some people shouted at Officer Terral A. Hardy as he
tried to disperse the scores who remained. ``Go 10 more miles up
the interstate, and you wouldn't have to wait,'' he said. David T.
Brown, 60, tried to get to the door to negotiate with the shop's
owner, and stalked off muttering when Hardy blocked his path.
</P>
<P>
   Peter B. Alter, an insurance broker from Rye Brook, N.Y., had
driven to Greenwich for dinner with no thought of lotto. As he
walked down Greenwich Avenue, strangers kept asking him where they
could play Powerball. Alter cheerfully played along, pointing them
to the main highway and saying, ``Just look for the lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Alter said he has never played Powerball. But he's thinking
about it.

REX APPLEGATE, 84, COMBAT AND CROWD-CONTROL EXPERT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Calif., Ore.)  (js) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rex Applegate, a member of the storied OSS who taught fellow
intelligence officers how to kill an enemy quickly, and preferably
silently, in face-to-face combat during World War II, died on July
14 in the University of California at San Diego Medical Center. He
was 84 and lived in Scottsburg, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Applegate, who advised police agencies on riot control and
pistol-firing techniques in a second, peacetime career, suffered a
heart attack and stroke while at a conference of California
law-enforcement officers at which he was to be the keynote speaker,
his wife, Carole, said.
</P>
<P>
   When he joined the military police with a lieutenant's
commission after graduating from the University of Oregon in 1939,
Applegate was already a formidable presence. He was 6-feet-3-inches
tall, 230 pounds and an expert marksman, having been tutored by an
uncle who gave target-shooting exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   Col. William (Wild Bill) Donovan, head of the Office of
Strategic Services, the espionage and sabotage unit that preceded
the CIA, summoned him early in 1942 as he was putting the new
agency into place. As Applegate recalled it, Donovan ``reached in
his desk, pulled out $50,000 in cash and handed it to me.'' The
colonel sent him to a remote site near Thurmont, Md., where he was
to help build a training camp for intelligence officers.
</P>
<P>
   Applegate coordinated instruction at the camp in hand-to-hand
combat, knife fighting and pistol firing. He later went to England
to train with British commandos and he participated in their
reconnaissance missions into German-occupied Europe. When he
returned to the Maryland camp, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was
using it at times as a retreat. Applegate served as one of his
bodyguards, assisting the Secret Service. In an interview with The
Register-Guard of Eugene, Ore., in 1986, he described a heated
argument the president had had with Winston Churchill in a meeting
at the camp. ``I asked the Secret Service guys what I was supposed
to do if Churchill hit him,'' Applegate remembered. ``They told me
to let 'em duke it out.''
</P>
<P>
   That OSS camp, called simply Area B, became the presidential
retreat known first as Shangri-La and then as Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a lung ailment, Applegate could not be sent into
combat, so he was transferred to Camp Ritchie, Md., where he
developed close-quarter combat training for Army intelligence
officers and other kinds of training.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, he wrote a book about his techniques, ``Kill or Be
Killed'' (Military Service Publishing Company). This was a manual _
complete with how-to illustrations _ that drew on the philosophy
of, as he put it, ``Do unto others as they would do unto you, but
do it first.''
</P>
<P>
   In a review for The New York Times, S.T. Williamson wrote that
the book was ``certain to curl the hair, and delicate sensibilities
cannot remain delicate long.''
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing ``speed and ruthlessness,'' the author, now a major,
told how to dispose of an enemy with blows and kicks to vulnerable
areas, a thumb to the eye and a variety of strangling techniques.
In his section ``killing an enemy sentry,'' he advised: ``Approach
from the rear, grasp the nose and mouth with the left hand to
prevent outcry, and thrust the knife into the kidney area. After a
short interval, withdraw the knife and cut the throat.''
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from the Army as a lieutenant colonel at the end
of World War II, Applegate spent almost two decades in Mexico,
acting as a riot-control consultant to Latin American governments.
He returned to the United States in the 1960s, a time of widespread
urban riots, and began advising the armed forces and police
agencies on riot-control techniques and weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1964 edition of his book, retitled ``Crowd and Riot
Control'' (The Stackpole Company), Applegate added chapters on how
to deal with civil disturbances. He advised authorities to ``be
firm, yet friendly,'' to ``show impartiality by act and word,'' and
``always face the crowd and keep it at a distance.'' Only if those
tactics didn't work did he counsel aggressive measures.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters from
previous marriages, Shannon Applegate, of Yoncalla, and Lisha Allen
Garcia, of Yuma, Ariz.; a half-sister, Paula Hebard; and eight
grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Applegate _ a knife and gun collector _ marketed
the Applegate-Fairbairn Combat Knife, originally designed by a
British commando, W.E. Fairbairn, with whom he had trained.
Applegate said the knife became a personal weapon of choice for
many members of special forces units. He also patented a riot
baton. And well into what would be retirement years for others,
publishers of books with military themes often sent manuscripts to
him for evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   As he put it then: ``I plan to stay busy until it's time to go
to that big combat range in the sky.''

UNEDITED SENIOR GOLF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)(SLANG) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
Over the last two-plus years, no one has wielded more mastery of
the Senior PGA Tour than Hale Irwin, and in the U.S. Senior Open,
the tour's most important major tournament, he convened a clinic as
to why.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Irwin mounted a relentless charge and delivered a spectacular
finish Sunday at Riviera Country Club, obliterating the commanding
lead of Raymond Floyd, holding off the surprising surge of Vicente
Fernandez, and winning the championship the hard way _ by rolling
in a 12-foot, downhill birdie putt on the final hole, Riviera's
dastardly 18th.
</P>
<P>
   And then his celebration knew no bounds. Irwin pumped his right
fist into the air. Then both fists. Once he got his hands on the
great silver goblet that is this tournament's trophy, he wouldn't
let go, even sitting with it wedged between his knees when he later
met the press.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder this guy has been so testy this entire weekend:
Obviously, this championship meant much more to him than anyone
realized.
</P>
<P>
   It came on the strength of a 1-over-par total of 285, as he shot
a 2-under round of 69 on the final day. That was one stroke better
than Fernandez and two ahead of Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   It also completed an impressive weekend rally. Irwin was well
off the pace after opening with a 77 on Thursday. The previous
worst score a U.S. Senior Open champion had to overcome in the
first round was a 74.
</P>
<P>
   The title is not an end-all for his career, Irwin said, ``but it
kind of puts a stamp on where I've been trying to get to with at
least those Open championships. ... I guess it meant more to me
because I wanted to be one of those few who won both.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Open titles on both sides of age 50. Irwin took
the U.S. Open championship in 1974, '79 and '90, but the Senior
Open had eluded him in 3 { seasons on this tour, even though few
other titles had.
</P>
<P>
   Dominant? The adjective is almost inadequate to describe what
he's accomplished. Since the start of '96, Irwin has played in 60
events, and this marked his 53rd top-10 finish and 16th victory.
He's played 14 events this year and has finished in the top five in
each and every one of them (this was his fifth win).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it boils down to Hale's the best senior player out
there. He showed it to the world today,'' said Floyd, Irwin's
playing partner on the final day. ``He did what he needed to do. He
played beautifully all day. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a tour dominated the way he has done the last
two years. It's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   That might sound like awe. More likely, it was shellshock.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd began the day with a three-stroke lead, having put
together two outstanding rounds of 70, followed by a respectable 73
on Saturday. But Floyd, whose approach irons landed well short of
the green all day long, bogeyed two of the first five holes.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin caught him within seven holes.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime later came a surprise contender, Fernandez, an
Argentine in his third year among the seniors (he never played the
PGA Tour). Fernandez, with a blistering final round of 3-under 68,
created a three-way tie with a birdie on No. 16 and then took the
lead when he sank a 15-foot par putt on No. 17 as both Floyd and
Irwin were bogeying 13.
</P>
<P>
   But Irwin didn't get all those victories in all those
tournaments by being faint of heart. As he walked up the fairway at
15, he said, he told his caddie he would need a couple of birdies
down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Ordered, delivered. Irwin played left-right break to roll in a
25-foot birdie putt on 16, then averted what would have been an
18-hole playoff today by sinking that dead-straight 12-footer on
18.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin very nearly had three straight birdies to close out that
charge. On a 25-foot attempt from the edge of the 17th green, the
ball just caught the right lip, took a circle tour of the cup and
kicked out. Irwin, in disbelief, flopped dramatically onto his back
on the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt,'' he said of Open championships, ``that they
test your management and patience _ the mental part of your game.''
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, he certainly recovered quickly to mount his
assault on 18. It mirrored, in miniature, his recovery from that
dreadful start on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no talking about it,'' Irwin, who ducked the press
that day, said of his dismal first round, ``because I wanted it
flushed from my mind. I wasn't that far out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The way he's been playing this tour, it was a cinch he was fully
capable of playing his way back into the tournament. And winning
it.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin becomes the seventh player to couple a U.S. Open
championship with a U.S. Senior Open title (the latter event began
in '80). It's pretty select company. The others: Arnold Palmer,
Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Billy Casper, Lee Trevino, Orville
Moody.
</P>
<P>
   ``My timing was not quite on this week,'' said Irwin. ``Coupled
with my desire to win this event, that puts you on that edge of
maybe you are trying too hard, maybe you are pushing it just a
little bit. That's why I kept telling myself, `Back away from it.
Back away from it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Once he had collected himself and locked his relentlessly
precise game into place, the rest of the senior field probably had
no chance.
</P>
<P>
   As usual.

FEW JUMP AT THE CHANCE TO BECOME PART OF A CASHLESS SOCIETY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By LISA W. FODERARO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It has been 10 months since four of the nation's
leading financial institutions rolled out a brave new way to buy
stuff on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, issuing so-called smart
cards that promised a futuristic glimpse of a cashless society.
</P>
<P>
   But the affluent and with-it residents of the Upper West Side
seem to want to remain in the present.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors of the multimillion-dollar experiment _ Chase
Manhattan Bank, Citibank, Visa USA and MasterCard International _
have made few converts, residents and business owners say, despite
having issued tens of thousands of the new cards and installed card
readers in about 400 stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dud,'' said Lawrence Gomez, the owner of Stationery &AMP;
Toy World on West 72nd Street between Columbus and Amsterdam
avenues. ``I have maybe three steady customers who use it, and
they're in the Hamptons now.''
</P>
<P>
   The premise of the smart cards, which have computer chips
instead of magnetic strips and can be loaded with as much as $500,
is that people find paying with coins and bills cumbersome, risky,
even unhygienic. If consumers could use plastic cards to make
purchases as quickly as with cash _ without signing a slip or
waiting for telephone approval _ they would do so.
</P>
<P>
   Or so the thinking goes.
</P>
<P>
   But merchants in the program, the first general test of the
smart card in the United States, have complained of frequent
breakdowns in the machine that deducts the amount of the purchase
from the card's stored value. Especially in the early months, cards
got stuck in readers and error messages flashed, resulting in
transactions that not only took longer than payments with cash but
even, in some cases, considerably longer than those with credit
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Some stores were so frustrated by the mechanical problems, they
pulled out of the program, which is scheduled to continue at least
through the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   None of this, however, has led the sponsors to declare the
experiment a failure. Any effort to nudge the public into forming
new habits is bound to be fraught with challenges, officials say,
and the pilot program has taught the sponsors a great deal,
including that four tough competitors could cooperate on a joint
venture.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Darr, director of smart card programs at Citibank, said her
company's aim was ``to make sure we have a team of experts who know
everything about the card in terms of technology and marketing, and
in that sense we have certainly accomplished our goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Braco, a senior vice president in charge of Chase's
electronic commerce group, said he believed smart cards are here to
stay, and suggested the pilot program might be expanded to other
parts of the city next year. But he conceded that participation on
the Upper West Side had fallen short of hopes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Merchants have not had to pay for participation in the pilot
program, which stretches from 60th Street to 96th Street between
Central Park West and the Hudson River. The card readers were
installed and maintained without charge, and there are no
transaction fees. But smart cards, should they become pervasive,
could one day be subject to fees, sponsors say.
</P>
<P>
   As of late June, 94,800 smart cards had been issued to Upper
West Side residents. There have been 53,000 consumer loads on cards
_ the act of adding value to a card _ an indication that many of
the issued cards have not been used at all. And so far, merchants
have settled about $813,000 in transactions made with the smart
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in card technology expressed regret that the first major
smart card pilot program in the United States had such a weak
start. Although there are smart card programs on military bases and
university campuses, the Upper West Side program is the first
general introduction and is therefore being closely watched.

BELMONT MEET ENDS IN A SARATOGA MOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JENNY KELLNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ As racing fans sat on lawn chairs strategically
placed underneath television monitors, and children played among
picnic tables covered with coolers and racing programs, there was a
definite Saratoga feel in the tree-shaded back yard at Belmont Park
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But that was only appropriate, for Belmont's 55-day meet ended
Sunday, on a glorious summer day, and thoroughbred racing is set to
resume Wednesday when the gates open for the 130th season at
Saratoga Race Course.
</P>
<P>
   Hunch players in the closing-day crowd of 12,124 were rewarded
when Saratoga Sunrise, ridden by Robbie Davis, went wire to wire
and fought off the 7-year-old More to Tell to win the $50,000 Evan
Shipman Handicap for New York-breds.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Schosberg, trainer of Saratoga Sunrise, noted that More to
Tell ``is out there trying to get over $1 million earnings, and
he's a hard horse to shake off.''
</P>
<P>
   Schosberg added, ``It's bittersweet in a way, because I'd love
to see the older horse get over $1 million, just not at my
expense.''
</P>
<P>
   Saratoga Sunrise, who returned $5.70 on a $2 bet to win as the
slight favorite in a field of five, may have his next start at
Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could go in allowance conditions, or we may even try him on
the turf in the West Point,'' Schosberg said, referring to a race
on Aug. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bailey, who was out of town to ride in the Delaware
Handicap, won the Belmont riding title with 52 winners to Mike
Smith's 49, while Bill Mott beat John Kimmel, 20-16, for the
trainers' title. Their rivalries will be renewed Wednesday: Bailey
will be seeking his third straight title, and Kimmel, who tied Mott
last year, will try for an outright victory.
</P>
<P>
   The six-week Saratoga meet will open with the $100,000
Schuylerville for 2-year-old fillies. It will conclude on Sept. 7
with the $200,000 Forego, after 36 days of racing. After setting a
North American record for highest daily handle in 1996 with
$12,979,408, last year's meet averaged nearly $12.9 million, which
again led the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saratoga is an entertainment proposition,'' said Frank
Gabriel, the New York Racing Association's director of racing.
``It's an appealing, entertaining product that everyone wants to
simulcast and show off.''
</P>
<P>
   Attendance and handle figures for the Belmont spring meet, on
the other hand, were expected to continue to drift downward despite
the 80,162 fans who visited the track on June 6 to witness Real
Quiet's thrilling, but unsuccessful, attempt to become racing's
12th Triple Crown winner.
</P>
<P>
   In-home simulcasting, which began in 1995, has continued to have
a negative effect on on-track business, and NYRA estimated the
daily average attendance for the spring-summer meet to be down
about 3 percent _ about 9,000 _ with daily on-track handle down
about 7 percent, to about $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Daily total handle, which includes simulcasting, was estimated
to be off about 1 percent. Official figures will be released this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday NYRA withheld its simulcast television signal
from home cable viewers in New York City, and NYRA and New York
City Off-Track Betting Corp. remain far apart in reaching an
agreement over fees paid for the signal. Until an agreement is
reached, city OTB players will not be able to watch Saratoga racing
over cable Channel 71.
</P>
<P>
   The other OTB districts are not affected by the blackout.

ROLAND ROWLAND, 80, OUTSPOKEN BRITISH TYCOON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Roland ``Tiny'' Rowland, the British tycoon labeled
``the unacceptable face of capitalism'' by Prime Minister Edward
Heath in the 1970s but hailed by Nelson Mandela as a friend of
Africa, died on Saturday in London, The Observer reported Sunday.
He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland had been suffering from skin cancer. He became ill and
was taken to a hospital while on a vacation in the Mediterranean
with his family, the newspaper said. Friends were quoted as saying
he had been transferred to a London clinic, where he died.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland's fame in the business world began when, at the age of
30, he went to Rhodesia to run London and Rhodesian Mining Co. He
transformed the obscure colonial farming and mining company into a
vast empire, Lonhro Group, which controlled automobile franchises,
sugar plantations and oil pipelines across Africa.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in a British detention camp in India in 1917 to a
German father and an English mother. His parents were refused entry
to England and went to Hamburg, Germany, after World War I. As he
grew into a tall youth with an aggressive manner, he acquired the
nickname Tiny, and it stuck to him.
</P>
<P>
   The family returned to India in 1935, and his father, who
greatly admired Britain and loathed Hitler, sent his son to
boarding school in Britain. The family was eventually allowed into
the country. Rowland left school at age 18 to join an export
company and then the family's firm, which dealt in shipping
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The family remained split between Germany and Britain. His elder
brother, Raimund, served in the German army during World War II,
while Roland joined the British army.
</P>
<P>
   In the years after he went to Africa, he made friends with and
cultivated many of the men who eventually led their nations in the
era that followed the end of colonization. He reaped major benefits
in contracts and business because of his ties.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, he became embroiled in clashes with his
directors and other shareholders, over his management style and his
liberal use of slush funds. He survived several attempts to oust
him, which earned him Heath's unflattering description in 1973.
That year, during a boardroom revolt, eight directors took him to
court, saying he was unfit to run a public company.
</P>
<P>
   He prevailed time and again, continuing to run the international
trading group for three decades. He was finally toppled in another
fierce boardroom battle in March 1995 by the German financier
Dieter Bock.
</P>
<P>
   What got the best of him was a recession and the company's
mounting debts. Lonhro was forced to dispose of major holdings to
obtain cash and finally undertook a refinancing that led to the
appointment of Bock as co-chief executive and effectively sidelined
Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Rowland remained the company's largest private
shareholder and tormentor of its existing management.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Asked to comment on Rowland's death by The Observer, which
Rowland once owned, Lonhro's vice president, Nicholas Morrell,
said, ``We have been fighting Rowland for over five years now, but
of the dead, speak nothing but good.''
</P>
<P>
   It was apparently partly out of sensitivity to the fact that the
British establishment never accepted him as a full member despite
his enormous success in business that he purchased the weekly
Observer in 1981, which he owned for 13 years before selling it to
the Guardian Group. He used the paper to attack his enemies and
defend his views.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never have enough enemies'' was one of the many
memorable sayings of Rowland, a man who elevated feuds to an art
form. He took on _ among others _ journalists, individual
politicians, Conservative and Labor governments, businessmen and
large conglomerates, including Shell and British Petroleum. He
accused the two oil giants of violating the sanctions imposed on
the white minority government of Rhodesia after its unilateral
declaration of independence from Britain in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   He was married and had four children but protected the privacy
of his family life with as much vigor as he used to attack his
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   He never said why he was so contentious, or whether it was
related to his parents' internment during World War I. But he never
played by the British establishment's rules, constantly mocking its
traditions and manners. The feeling was mutual.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa he was viewed as a friend who was never part of the
colonizing British establishment. Rowland was hailed by Mandela
today for making ``an enormous contribution not only to South
Africa but the whole of Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Zambian president, Kenneth Kaunda, a longtime friend
of Rowland, was quoted by The Observer as saying Rowland ``was a
man full of compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   In Britain he will best be remembered for his long and bitter
feud with Mohamed Al Fayed over ownership of the prestigious
department store Harrods.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland coveted the store for many years and was infuriated when
Fayed and his brother outmaneuvered him in buying it. He accused
them of lying about the origin of their wealth, leading to an
investigation by the British government. But he was unable to wrest
control of Harrod's from the Fayeds, who continue to own and manage
it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a fleeting reconciliation five years ago, the mutual
recriminations continued virtually until Rowland's death. In the
14-year legal battle, he published several books of documents about
the case, one of them about Fayed titled ``A Hero From Zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Fayed has not commented on his death.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Six months ago it looked as if Paul Cellucci, who became acting
governor of Massachusetts when Gov. William Weld was nominated for
an ambassadorship, might win the job in his own right in this
fall's election.
</P>
<P>
   A liberal Republican running in a liberal Democratic state, he
was looking good in the polls, successfully working the incumbency
angle, raising plenty of money and seemingly headed for an easy
primary victory in September over State Treasurer Joseph Malone, a
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum he had built up had also put him comfortably ahead
in theoretical fall matchups with each of the three contestants in
the Democratic primary, including the favorite, Attorney General
Scott Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed.
</P>
<P>
   The midsummer polls still have Cellucci winning his party's
primary. But in theoretical matchups with Harshbarger, still the
Democratic primary favorite, the November contest now looks like a
tossup.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse for the acting governor, he runs no better in a
theoretical November matchup with Harshbarger's closest primary
competitor, former state Sen. Patricia McGovern.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci appears to have been politically weakened by steady
barrages of heavy criticism in recent months, some fired from
within his own party by his primary challenger, Malone, and others
fired by Harshbarger, who has focused mainly on the fall race from
the start.
</P>
<P>
   In a determined effort to pull out of his slump, Cellucci
recently ran a solid month's worth of campaign advertising.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   Now his political allies and advisers are urging him to shake up
his campaign and change the way he is running. They say his
above-the-fray tactic of talking about what a great job he is doing
as acting governor, with pro forma promises to cut taxes and
improve schools if elected governor, should be dumped in favor of a
tough, head-on assault on Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   Since even the primaries are more than a month away, there is
plenty of time for such an assault. And since Cellucci is an
exceptional fund-raiser, the money to make an assault will likely
be available.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, campaign cash could be Cellucci's political
salvation and Harshbarger's worst political nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger has the support of some major, wealthy Massachusetts
political groups, notably labor. But to get matching campaign funds
from the state, he pledged to abide by a cap on overall
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes taking that pledge can get a candidate all of the
money needed to run a good race _ and draw some extra votes to
boot. But not always. Sometimes it can hamstring a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci has refused to take it. He figures a better political
risk is to run on what money he can raise on his own, with no cap
on spending.
</P>
<P>
   If past is prologue, he will raise plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Sober Reality in Utah: Mormons Fulfill Roles
</P>
<P>
   Given the huge, conservative influence of the Mormon Church in
Utah, politics there sometimes seems to be more a morality play
than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   The Utah Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission has five members.
Their job is to oversee and regulate the state's $124 million
beverage industry, which includes more than a thousand licensed
stores, bars, restaurants and clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, three of the five members were teetotaling
Mormons, to the deep chagrin of the beverage industry. Its leaders
were pushing Gov. Michael Leavitt to put someone from the industry
on the commission, lest the interests and desires of those who sell
and drink booze be underrepresented, if not just plain
misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   But when a seat finally became vacant a few weeks ago, Leavitt,
a conservative Republican and himself a staunch member of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, filled the post with
still another Mormon, former state Rep. Ted Lewis. Now, four of the
five commission members are Mormons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the industry ought to be regulating itself,''
the governor said in defense of naming his choice rather than one
of the choices suggested by the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added, Utah law forbids beverage commission members
to have ties to the beverage industry.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate, whose membership is also heavily conservative,
Republican and Mormon, readily confirmed the governor's appointee.
</P>
<P>
   Beverage industry leaders say they will try to have the state
law changed so that board members can come from the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't have experience, the day-to-day workings of
licensees are lost to them,'' argues Sarah Fugate, a beverage
broker and leading industry official.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Believes GOP Should Steer to Center
</P>
<P>
   From his home deep in Colorado's Vail Valley, former President
Gerald Ford is keeping a wary eye on the way the Republican Party
is conducting itself these days, and he doesn't like a lot of what
he sees.
</P>
<P>
   Having just turned 85 and now out of office for almost a quarter
of a century, this eldest elder of the Grand Old Party is telling
visitors who make their way to his mountainside retreat that the
hard-right, family-values direction that many party members have
taken in recent years leads down the road to political disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The road to victory in Election 2000, he contends, runs through
the political center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our good Democratic friends have learned that lesson,'' he
told some callers recently. ``They had McGovern, Dukakis, Mondale,
all on the left wing of the Democratic Party. And they lost. If
Republicans are going to win, they're going to have to have a broad
enough umbrella.''
</P>
<P>
   As he sees it, having always been a political centrist (he lost
to a Democratic centrist, Jimmy Carter, in 1976), the ideological
welcome mat must be put out for those Republicans who support
abortion rights, gay rights, federal money for the arts and any
number of other hot-button issues that are abhorrent to party
members on the hard right.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he supports abortion rights, gay rights and
government money for the arts and that he doesn't want other
Republicans questioning his family values.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll put mine up to theirs any day,'' he declared.

 &HT;    King III makes first speech as head of SCLC
 &HT;    By Kimberly H. Byrd
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ Martin Luther King III stepped into the pulpit
of First Baptist Church Sunday and called on the saints to help him
move the Southern Christian Leadership Conference into the new
millennium as a ``viable, credible and accountable'' organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vision is to expand our efforts toward the education and
empowerment of our youth, the economic empowerment of our community
and the advancement of non-violent conflict resolution for our
society,'' King said. ``We need the experience and wisdom of the
old coupled with the energy and talent of the young. We are all in
this together.''
</P>
<P>
   Young people, the black church and the SCLC must become computer
literate, King said. The $450 billion a year black Americans spend
must be channelled back into the black communities. And the
mentoring and development of the youth is imperative.
</P>
<P>
   ``If SCLC doesn't utilize the energy of African-American youth,
then drug dealers, gang-bangers and thieves will use them for evil
rather than good,'' he said. ``Why? Because Andy Young has carried
the burden too long. Joe Lowery has carried the burden too long.
Rosa Parks has carried the burden too long. Now is the time for
young people to carry the burden and be accountable to our
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday morning, the second day of the 41st annual SCLC
convention, it was apparent the civil rights group is emerging with
new energy and a deep-seeded interest in embracing, empowering and
inspiring young people.
</P>
<P>
   With juvenile violence on the rise, prison systems busting at
the seams and the high school dropout rate climbing, Brenda
Davenport, director of Youth &AMP; Student Affairs for SCLC, said they
have no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our country is in trouble and it's our children who are
suffering,'' Davenport said. ''So youths have to be the catalyst
for change in our organization.''
</P>
<P>
   About 500 young people, from adolescents to college students,
are participating in the five-day conference, which started
Saturday and ends Wednesday. A number of them gathered Sunday in a
conference room of the Omni Shoreham Hotel, the convention
headquarters, to hold church, seek guidance, and to get fired up
about a rejuvenated SCLC
</P>
<P>
   Over the next year, Davenport said, King has pledged that the
organization will implement mentoring programs in communities
throughout the nation, recruit new members and provide support to
chapters that adopt projects that meet the specific needs of their
communities.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first college chapters is slated to organize this
fall in Atlanta at Morehouse College. But Corey McCaskill, a rising
senior at Morehouse and one of the chapter's leaders, would rather
refer to it as a re-activation or revival of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   That's because he recalled the Morehouse men _ the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr., Julian Bond, chairman of the NAACP, and Martin
Luther King III _ who made their presence known in the civil rights
movement as undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   A tad embarrassed by the lack of activism on Morehouse's campus,
McCaskill said: ''Not only is it our duty to inherit the legacy,
but as youths, we have to carry on the SCLC movement.''
</P>
<P>
   King was officially installed as president of SCLC here Saturday
during a ceremony in which political and religious leaders from all
over the nation came to wish him well.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Coretta Scott King, was among the well-wishers. She
told him that SCLC's success hinges on its leaders being
passionate, courageous, visionary and unselfish.
</P>
<P>
   ``This spirit of service is in your blood,'' his mother said.
And she went on to predict that historians would ``one day write
you did indeed bare the burdens and the blessings of your name with
grace and dignity.''

BRITISH INVASION OF L.A.?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tim Henman is getting rock-star treatment in his
native England, but all he really wants is to be known as the
tennis star he could soon become.
</P>
<P>
   Henman, ranked No.11 in the world and coming oh so close to the
top 10, arrives in Los Angeles this week with the same aspirations
as so many Hollywood hopefuls: to grab his own small sliver of the
spotlight. Winning the Mercedes- Benz Cup, which opens today at
UCLA, could make Henman a top-10 hit. It would also make him a
household name in more than just Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   First, he'll have to contend with a Mercedes field that includes
reigning U.S. Open champ Patrick Rafter, Wimbledon finalist Goran
Ivanisevic, Thomas Enqvist and Andre Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, with the way my ranking has gone up since
Wimbledon, I'm No.11, and I've said breaking the top 10 is a
definite goal,'' second-seeded Henman said Sunday. ``I don't know
whether it's mathematically possible this week. But all the results
help.''
</P>
<P>
   It could send the Brits _ starved for a tennis torch bearer _
into a euphoric tizzy. Earlier this month at Wimbledon, where
Henman became the first British male to reach the semifinals since
1973, screaming fans chased the 23-year-old through the rain to get
snapshots as he left the All England Club grounds.
</P>
<P>
   He'll have no such concerns in Westwood, where he'd rate
somewhere in the Judge Reinhold range on the celebrity meter. He's
not exactly a household name yet, outside of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's fair to say,'' said Henman, 26-17 this year.
``If I continue to have more good results away from home as well as
at home, it's inevitable that more and more people will know who I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   Henman's ranking has improved every year since 1992, climbing to
No.17 by the end of 1997 after breaking the top 20 for the first
time about 18 months ago. After back-to-back Wimbledon quarterfinal
appearances, Henman went through Rafter and Petr Korda en route to
the semifinals this year only to lose a gutty match to eventual
champion Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   It infused Henman with the full gamut of emotions, from the joy
of his best Grand Slam performance on home soil to the
disappointment of being ousted just short of his goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, looking back, a good fortnight for me,'' Henman said.
``For quite a few days after that, I was still very disappointed.
But then you have to reflect and take away the good of it.... But
it's no disgrace to lose to someone of Sampras' class.'' Henman,
who opens against Grant Stafford on Tuesday, won't have Sampras to
worry about this week. The world's No.1 player is recovering from
surgery on his right foot and informed ATP officials Friday that he
would be a no-show. The L.A. native hasn't played in the tournament
since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that Pete's going to be missed,'' said
tournament director Bob Kramer. ``It's disappointing for us,
because we've grown up with Pete here, and we got Pete to come and
play again.... We hope Pete gets well soon, because we all want to
see him win another Slam.''

STATE RESTRICTIONS ON HOSPITALS ARE EASING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Ohio, Pa., Mo.)  (lb) 
 By JENNIFER PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Under pressure from hospitals demanding greater
flexibility to compete, New Jersey and a growing number of other
states have begun to lift restrictions on the kind of specialized
services and new technology that hospitals can provide.
</P>
<P>
   Most states began imposing the restrictions two decades ago,
mainly to hold down costs by limiting duplicative services at
hospitals in the same area. The states required hospitals and other
institutions to demonstrate a need in the community before
expanding services like cardiac surgery and organ transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with managed-care squeezing costs out of the health-care
system, some hospitals say the restrictions are no longer needed.
And some hospital officials say the regulations impede their
efforts to compete aggressively for patients and for contracts with
managed-care companies looking for hospitals that can offer an
array of services for their members.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to loosen the restrictions is opposed by many urban
hospitals, which now offer most of the specialized services. They
are concerned that allowing suburban and smaller community
hospitals to offer many of the same services will jeopardize their
financial standing, because they are likely to lose some insured
patients.
</P>
<P>
   For patients who live in suburban and rural areas, the changes
could mean that they would get more specialized services at
hospitals closer to home. But critics say the quality of care could
be compromised at some of those hospitals if they do not have
expertise in providing highly specialized services.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Gov. Christie Whitman signed legislation earlier
this month that ends the requirement that hospitals win state
approval to open pediatric and maternity wards and to expand other
services like ambulatory surgery and magnetic resonance imaging.
</P>
<P>
   The new law, though, would continue to require state approval
for some highly specialized services like cardiac surgery, organ
transplants and neonatal intensive care while a new state
commission studies whether state approval should remain mandatory
in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven states still require some approval of specialized
services under what are known as certificate-of-need laws, and
efforts to eliminate the review process failed in several of those
states, including Georgia and Washington, this year.
</P>
<P>
   New York and Connecticut have maintained the state approval
laws, but they have recently taken steps aimed at streamlining what
hospital officials view as a cumbersome and costly approval
process.
</P>
<P>
   Several states have ended the approval process. In Pennsylvania,
the Legislature did not renew its certificate-of-need law in late
1996, allowing suburban and rural hospitals across the state to
begin opening maternity wards and offering cardiac bypass surgery.
North Dakota also rescinded its approval law. Ohio phased out its
law this spring, setting off fierce competition among hospitals in
some cities and towns over what services to provide.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of certificate-of-need laws say that allowing
hospitals to offer whatever services they want could jeopardize the
quality of health care. They point to numerous studies that show
quantity drives quality in some specialized procedures like organ
transplants and bypass surgery. They say patients have better
outcomes at hospitals that perform a high volume of such
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe that the market is going to control
unnecessary spending,'' said Suzanne Ianni, executive director of
the Hospital Alliance of New Jersey, which represents mostly urban
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process now also recognizes the unlevel playing field
between urban hospitals and other institutions. Many of the
specialized services and technology are now at the urban hospitals,
which brings in a suburban population to pay for those services.
Paying patients help subsidize the other community services and
coverage for the uninsured that urban hospitals now provide to a
medically underserved patient population.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the regulations say that patients who do not
want to travel to big-city hospitals for specialized care should be
able to find similar services closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just does not make sense in today's market,'' said Valerie
Sellers, vice president of health-care planning at the New Jersey
Hospital Association. ``Hospitals need more flexibility. They need
to be able to respond to market forces. The process is too
burdensome. It is too costly.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ohio completed phasing out its state approval laws in March. As
a result, community hospitals are now considering performing
cardiac surgery, and for-profit hospital chains are moving in and
building ``boutique'' hospitals that offer only cardiac and
orthopedic surgical services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a real building boom,'' said Gretchen McBeath, a
lawyer for the Ohio Hospital Association. ``We have seen it in a
lot of areas, particularly ambulatory surgical centers and new
hospitals. Another area that has exploded is obstetrics.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McBeath said that in towns with two hospitals, only one of
the hospitals usually offered obstetric care, but that is changing.
``We have had 14 new obstetrics services added, which is a lot,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McBeath said there has also been a huge expansion in the
number of kidney-dialysis stations opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can improve access,'' she said. ``But the other side of the
argument is that you need to have a critical mass to guarantee
quality.''
</P>
<P>
   To address concerns about the quality of care, New Jersey's new
law would increase the state's oversight of new hospital services
through stricter licensing procedures. Both Ohio and Pennsylvania
have also imposed new rules to help protect quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are no longer in the franchise business,'' said Daniel
Hoffman, Pennsylvania's secretary of health. ``We are no longer in
the business of saying yes you can, or you cannot, have open heart
surgery. But if you have open heart surgery, you do have to follow
our rules and regulations relative to quality and access. The rules
cover everything from architectural design to staffing requirements
to support services.''
</P>
<P>
   Len Fishman, New Jersey's health commissioner, said the state
commission would consider the impact of a further lifting of
restrictions on hospital services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that one of the most important issues that the
commission will consider is what effect any further exceptions
would have on inner-city hospitals,'' Fishman said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Piper, director of the certificate of need program in
Missouri and a former past president of the American Health
Planning Council, said he thought that it was a mistake for states
to lift all or most of their requirements, considering the billions
of state and federal dollars spent on health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The certificate of need is one of the few ways that government
and the public have a say in developing health-care services,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Daniel Kane, president of Englewood Hospital and Medical
Center in Bergen County, said that government cannot expect
hospitals to be more competitive and then not give them the tools
to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``The barriers to entry oftentimes have little to do with
quality or cost,'' he said. ``It really is a question of protecting
existing providers from competition.''

AMERICAN DANCE FESTIVAL: MODERN DANCE ON ICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Md.)  (lb) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ When he began the solo that opened the American
Dance Festival's program here on Friday night, Nathan Birch
appeared to be a shadowy figure stepping onto a dark if
conventional stage.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this was no conventional dancer. A splash of blue light
revealed that the black-clad performer, pausing for a moment of
stillness, was wearing skates; the stage was covered with ice.
</P>
<P>
   In its deliberate confusion between floor and ice, between
dancer and skater, this initial image implied a fusion of skating
and dancing. It was a perfect introduction to the Next Ice Age, a
skating company that Birch has directed since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   An ice show in the heat of North Carolina is like Christmas in
July. As novel as the idea might sound, it is also easy to
understand why Charles and Stephanie Reinhart, directors of the
American Dance Festival, invited the Next Ice Age to appear for the
first time at a mecca for experimental dance.
</P>
<P>
   Skating as a form of artistic expression is not a new concept
and the Next Ice Age, based in Baltimore, is not the only troupe
devoted to new choreography on ice. It is unusual nonetheless for
its emphasis on ensemble skating, Birch's solo notwithstanding, and
the company's creative potential is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breezeway,'' the opening solo, was used by Birch as a
springboard for one of two premieres that the company presented
from Wednesday through Sunday at the Reynolds Industries Theater at
Duke University, the festival's summer home. ``Syllabice'' used the
same Finnish composer, Jukka Linkola, and was an inventive
pure-movement piece that also referred to the basic skating
vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   The second premiere was ``Starr-Struck,'' set to 1950s
recordings, including ``Wheel of Fortune,'' by the popular singer
Kay Starr, who attended the first performance. The piece was
commissioned by the festival through its Doris Duke Awards for New
Work, initiated this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starr-Struck,'' like ``Bright Blue Skating'' and ``Machines,''
two works by Tim Murphy, was a crowd pleaser on the program.
Murphy, especially polished in his choreography for eight dancers
in ``Bright Blue Skating,'' set that piece to Michael Torke's
music. Skating elements, the equivalent of standard steps, were
recognizable as such in this ensemble piece, predicated on speed,
smoothness and changing formations.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``Breezeway'' and ``Syllabice,'' Birch's choreography
goes beyond convention and has a more artistic tinge. It does not
ask skaters to imitate dancers but provides them with novel
configurations of body shapes that are similar to movement
explorations by modern-dance choreographers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breezeway'' (1991) suggests a journey of self-discovery. Birch
circles the stage with long hair flying behind him or whipping
around his face as he abruptly changes directions. The ice revealed
by Jeff Davis' blue lighting was on a small stage. The size, 60
feet by 48 feet, was a challenge amazingly well met by all the
skaters during the program. That Birch could summon so much speed
and yet stop short when needed was astonishing. When he dropped to
the ice and reached out, there was a sense of reverie.
</P>
<P>
   Birch may be too faithful to the mood of his music, and the
occasional coyness of Linkola's score (for a Finnish film, ``The
Snow Queen'') led to some cuteness in the choreography for
``Syllabice.''
</P>
<P>
   But essentially the ensemble in black tights (Murphy, Patrick
Brault, Jeri Campbell, Chis Conte, Chrisha Gossard, Dawn Latona,
Jeff Merica, Cara Morrissey, Nancy Pluta, Gig Siruno and Richard
Swenning) had a range of varied movement. Three skaters zigzagged
around one another while moving backward, and six sprang up into a
delightful burst of cabrioles.
</P>
<P>
   There were occasional rough edges, but also energy and
eye-catching shapes: Miss Latona, nose to ankle in a 180-degree
arabesque, and the entire group advancing in a galumph.
</P>
<P>
   As much as one could appreciate the creativity of ``Syllabice,''
it was clear why the show-business veneer of ``Starr-Struck''
appealed more to the audience. Ms. Starr's rich voice had more than
one middle-aged spectator mouthing the lyrics in the recordings,
which Birch either illustrated or treated with a comic twist. The
song ``Side by Side'' did not have a man and woman in love but two
clowns (Murphy and Birch) hooked at their insteps as they glided
past one another.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The retro images had a cheerful wit. The first section, ``Slow
Boat to China,'' featured two sailors and their girls. Ms.
Gossard's yearning solo, ``I Cover the Waterfront,'' was at its
best when she did not roll on the ice. But ``Night Train,'' the
Pullman car number for Ms. Latona, her luggage and six bellboys,
dazzled with the right jazzy exuberance. Ms. Latona, lifted
horizontally by men moving sideways, exited in her inventively
fashioned upper berth.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gossard was a knockout in ``Goin' to Chicago.'' Ms. Latona
had a lickety-split solo in ``Indiana,'' exciting for its shifts in
speed and dynamics. ``Wheel of Fortune'' was a good joke: Six
dancers in 1950s attire circled around Conte, who spun on his back
until his feet pointed to the fortunate party.
</P>
<P>
   There was an engaging fervor about the skaters, an impressive
seriousness about the choreographers. They fit right into the
festival, whose origins at Bennington, Vt., in 1934 are celebrated
in an exhibition at the Perkins Library at Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Among the photographs of modern-dance pioneers, one notices
official letters to aspiring dancers. Paul Taylor is told in 1953
to do his share of the work as a stage-crew apprentice, and Madonna
is informed in 1978 that she has received a tuition scholarship.

WRECK DEBRIS KILLS THREE FANS AT U.S. 500 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (lb)

<P>
   Three spectators were killed and six injured Sunday when a wheel
and other car parts flew over the fence and into the stands at
Michigan Speedway during the U.S. 500, Championship Auto Racing
Teams' most prestigious race.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in more than a decade, since the 1987
Indianapolis 500, that spectators were killed at a major auto race.
</P>
<P>
   Two people died instantly, said Dr. Gregory Baumann, the chief
medical director of the speedway in Brooklyn, Mich., and a third
died after resuscitation efforts at one of the track's medical
units failed.
</P>
<P>
   The dead were identified as Kenneth Dale Fox, 38, of Lansing,
Mich.; Sheryl Ann Laster, 40, and Michael Terry Tautkus, 49, both
of Milan, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The six spectators who were hurt were taken to Foote Hospital in
Jackson, Mich., with injuries ranging from neck and back bruises to
a broken leg, said Robin Kirkpatrick, a hospital spokeswoman. Four
were treated and released, while two remained in the hospital in
stable condition with injuries that were not life-threatening,
Kirkpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   The debris was thrown from the car of Adrian Fernandez, the pole
winner, who lost control in the fourth turn on Lap 175 of the
250-lap race. Fernandez's car hit the wall, and the right front
tire and parts of the suspension cleared a 15-foot fence atop a
concrete wall and went into a crowded section of the grandstand,
where the victims were sitting in the eighth and 10th rows, track
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing I know, a tire was flying in the air right at
us,'' Gerald Bramer of Livonia, Mich., told The Associated Press.
Bramer, 31, and his brother Richard, 20, were among the six injured
spectators.
</P>
<P>
   The wheel did not hit any part of the fence, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Haskett, the speedway's president, said he could not say
how high a fence would have to be built to prevent such an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to say how high something would bounce or fly
over,'' he said. ``Thirty-one years of racing here on the oval and
this being our first incident of this nature is just something
that's very, very unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sections of the grandstand adjacent to the accident were
completely empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul Tracy was coming behind me on the inside, and he took the
air off me,'' said Fernandez, who sustained bruised knees but was
otherwise not injured. ``He didn't hit me. I got up high, and there
was nothing I could do.'' Fernandez was in third place at the time
of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only express the deep sorrow felt by everyone within the
CART community,'' Andrew Craig, the chief executive officer of
CART, said in a statement. ``There is, of course, nothing we can
say or do that in any way will reduce the deep sadness felt by the
families and friends of the victims, but on behalf of all of us at
CART, I extend our heartfelt sympathies.''
</P>
<P>
   CART is one of the two Indy-car racing circuits in the United
States. The other is the Indy Racing League, which split from CART
in 1996. That schism took the United States' most famous open-wheel
race, the Indianapolis 500, away from CART, and the U.S. 500 is now
CART's showcase race.
</P>
<P>
   The other injured spectators, all Michigan residents, were
identified as Steve Dawson, 31, of Lansing; Doris Shuman, 70, of
West Bloomfield; David Silva, 35, of Dearborn, and Joyce Thompson,
48, of Spring Arbor.
</P>
<P>
   All but Shuman and Silva had been treated and released Sunday
night. Kirkpatrick said Shuman would be seen by an orthopedist and
might require surgery.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a grim coincidence, many of the people sitting in the section
of the grandstand where the accident happened were employees of the
hospital where the injured fans were taken. Foote Hospital had been
given more than 4,000 complimentary tickets by the speedway, and
``in this section there was a big concentration of hospital
employees,'' Kirkpatrick said. Thompson, one of the people treated
and released, was a hospital employee.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn is in a mostly rural area of Michigan, about 80 miles
southwest of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The last spectator death at a major oval-track auto race
occurred at the 1987 Indianapolis 500, when 41-year-old Lyle
Kurtenbach of Rothschild, Wis., was killed when he was hit in the
head by a tire while in the top row of the grandstand. The tire
came loose from the car of Tony Bettenhausen, apparently because it
was improperly attached, as he approached the home straightaway and
was hit by the car of Roberto Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtenbach's widow filed a $9 million wrongful death suit
against the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, charging that the car and
tire were defective and that spectators were not accurately
informed of the potential dangers of watching the race.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other cases of deaths since then in minor track
races and in road races. At the Molson Toronto Grand Prix in 1996,
a CART road course race, a flagman, Gary Avrin, was decapitated
when airborne debris from a car struck him. The driver, Jeff
Krosnoff, was also killed.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, whose crash led to Sunday's tragedy, was declared the
winner when the Toronto race was stopped. It was his first victory.
</P>
<P>
   Five people died and 23 were injured in Alencon, France, in 1996
when a car driven by Jos Sterkens of Belgium hit a bump and flew
into a crowd of spectators in a European race on a track that was
asphalt and dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's race resumed once the debris from the track was
cleared, with many of the drivers unaware of the deaths in the
grandstand. It was won by Greg Moore, who took the lead on the
final lap after seven caution flags.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths were the first on the two-mile oval at Michigan
Speedway in 31 years, and the first spectator deaths ever. A fan
was killed during a race on the speedway's road course in 1969.

TANGLEWOOD FESTIVAL: CIRCLING BACK TO A TIME OF MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (lb) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENOX, Mass. _ While much of the rest of the world was savoring
one of John Williams' latest film scores on Saturday evening, in
Steven Spielberg's new drama, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Williams and
8,000 or so listeners were attending to another of his new
creations _ a much more delicate one _ at the Tanglewood Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Williams conducted the Boston Symphony Orchestra in the premiere
of a lovely orchestral song cycle, ``Seven for Luck,'' with Cynthia
Haymon as the soprano soloist.
</P>
<P>
   This sketchy but insightful account of a black woman's life
consists of seven settings of enchanting poems by Rita Dove, three
of which Ms. Haymon and Williams had previewed in May with the
Boston Pops. Ms. Dove, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1987 and was
poet laureate of the United States from 1993 to 1995, was on hand
to read two of her poems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven for Luck'' begins in the mystery of infancy and the
fantasy of youth, proceeds through romance and pregnancy, and
circles back on itself.
</P>
<P>
   Williams traces the poems' shifting moods with fine sympathy and
precision, ranging from semispeech to full, glorious song, all of
which Ms. Haymon only enhanced with splendid and versatile
vocalism. She was as captivating drawling, ``But we can't do it _
naw, because the wages of living are sin,'' as she was suspending
an exquisite pianissimo high note on the wondrous, childlike ``And
I was older than I am today.''
</P>
<P>
   The composer turns a large orchestra to the various purposes in
Mahlerian fashion, reducing it simply to flute and cello for the
wistful ``Adolescence.'' The Boston Symphony's new principal
flutist, Jacques Zoon, was superb, and other solos were handled
well by Martha Babcock, a cellist, and Ann Hobson Pilot, a harpist.
</P>
<P>
   Williams led another of his own works, the Violin Concerto, of
1976, which also places a seemingly fragile solo voice in front of
huge forces, sometimes scaled down. The soloist, Gil Shaham, hardly
older than the work itself, played with a tone meaty enough to
withstand even the more clamorous moments yet unfailingly
beautiful, and made an excellent case for the music.
</P>
<P>
   It is especially attractive in the second and third movements,
where Williams lets his natural lyricism shine through. The first
movement gets a little bogged down in abstraction, as if to
establish the work's seriousness of purpose. Or perhaps Williams
was grappling with difficult emotions, for the work is dedicated to
the memory of a deceased wife.
</P>
<P>
   As conductor, Williams filled out the substantial and
exhilarating program with Barber's ``School for Scandal'' Overture
and Stravinsky's ``Firebird'' Suite: good company, in which
Williams' own music could stand without embarrassment and even, in
``Seven for Luck,'' with pride.

RED SOX TURN JAYS INSIDE OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ For the Red Sox, this was less a homestand than a
pitstop before the last leg of a journey that essentially began in
mid-June near the old stockyards of Chicago and will end in
mid-August in the blast furnace of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   While the Sox completed a successful refueling behind Pedro
Martinez with a 6-3 win over Toronto Sunday that also featured
Nomar Garciaparra's inside-the-park home run, the Blue Jays had the
look of a team whose wheels were coming off after dropping three
out of four to Boston while trying to defuse their own in-house
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who is praised for his arm and his heart but doesn't
receive enough credit for his brain, was at his cerebral best while
shutting out the Blue Jays on six hits through seven innings, the
third straight start in which he has not allowed a run in Fenway
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's eighth win in his last nine decisions, which was
witnessed by his mother, Leopoldina, improved his record to 14-3
while lowering his league-leading ERA to 2.59. He struck out Blue
Jays cleanup hitter Carlos Delgado and past (and future?) Sox
designated hitter Mike Stanley three times apiece, including
back-to-back whiffs in the sixth, after the Jays opened the inning
with consecutive singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to turn it up a notch there,'' said Martinez, who was
threatened one last time in the seventh on a two-out infield hit by
Ed Sprague and a double by Alex Gonzalez but escaped when Tony
Phillips hit a roller to Mo Vaughn. ``Delgado is a great, great
hitter. You have to respect him.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps to outsmart him, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throttled Delgado real good,'' pitching coach Joe Kerrigan
said. ``His first time up, he threw him all changeups. Next time
up, it was all fastballs. The third time, he went soft, hard, and
soft again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro goes off a previous at-bat a lot. He really feeds off
that. He has a real good memory, and really knows the mindset of
what the guy stepping into the box wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Jays starter Pat Hentgen, meanwhile, couldn't dismiss
thoughts of how he nearly was snubbed by his own manager Sunday in
favor of Roger Clemens, the subject of will-he-or-won't-he-pitch
speculation that Toronto manager Tim Johnson was either unwilling
or unable to quash. Hentgen, himself a former Cy Young Award
winner, felt so slighted that he openly talked about wanting to be
traded, even though Clemens never strayed from the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm not good enough to start here,'' said Hentgen, ``then I
do want to get traded.''
</P>
<P>
   For a day, anyway, Mo Madness took a back seat to the Toronto
Tiff.
</P>
<P>
   And Garciaparra didn't help Hentgen's frame of mind any by
breaking the game open with a three-run, inside-the-park home run
in the seventh inning, the first in more than seven years by the
Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just put down my head and ran,'' said Garciaparra, who saw
Blue Jays right fielder Tony Phillips pull up a few feet short of
the lower grandstand wall as his hooking line drive dropped in
safely and kicked into the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's inside-the-parker, which made it two straight
games in which he has delivered late-inning home runs, expanded the
Boston lead from 2-0 to 5-0. Damon Buford had homered into the
screen (No. 7) for a 1-0 lead in the second, and Troy O'Leary's
double over the head of left fielder Jose Canseco scored
Garciaparra to make it 2-0 in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco, incidentally, was in right field for Oakland and fell
down when Luis Rivera circled the bases for the last Red Sox
inside-the-parker, June 21, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely the hardest right field in baseball, no
question about it,'' said Sox right fielder Darren Bragg, who
Sunday had two singles, one driving in a run, and also was hit by a
pitch and scored in front of Garciaparra's full-court sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get caught in no-man's land. There are two ways to
play it. One is to concede a double, or the other is to take a risk
and try to catch it. But one like that, where you think you have a
chance to catch it and you don't, that's when you're trapped in
no-man's land.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have a right to feel trapped in a never-ending
succession of airport departure gates, hotel lobbies, and
Spectravision TVs. They leave Monday on a 14-day, 12-game trip,
their longest of the season, that begins in Oakland, stops in
Anaheim and Seattle, then winds up in Texas. That will bring to a
close a stretch of 24 road games out of 30 since the All-Star
break, 36 out of 50 since mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I unpack my suitcase? No, I just added stuff to it,'' said
Buford, who filled in for a hobbled Darren Lewis and singled and
walked in addition to his home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like we've been constantly on the road for the last
two months. We still have another long road trip, but hopefully we
can get by and be mostly home for the last month and a half of the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   So, with barely enough time for Martinez to kiss his mother
goodbye, it was on to the tarmac, with Toronto fading in the
rear-view mirror, 9 1/2 games behind in the wild-card picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard,'' Martinez said, ``but this is going to
tell us exactly how we'll go.''

PATE FINAL PGA WINNER AT PLEASANT VALLEY 
</HEADLINE>
 CHARITY CLASSIC-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUTTON, Mass. _ Joey Sindelar left the Pleasant Valley locker
room in tears, and Steve Pate completed a comeback from multiple
injuries incurred in a 1996 auto accident to bring an end to an era
Sunday at the CVS Charity Classic at the late Cuz Mingolla's dream
course in the Blackstone Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Pate played out the 18th hole that had given up
eight eagles Saturday like someone playing in a Sunday nassau, he
had a shot in his back pocket and the bogey 6 didn't prevent him
from becoming the 32d champion in 32 tournaments here since
Champagne Tony Lema won the old Carling World in 1965. Lema bought
champagne for the assembled press 33 years ago, and Pate obliged
and picked up the tab for the press.
</P>
<P>
   When he got down in two putts, Pate completed a round of
15-under 70-65-67-67_269. The one-shot victory was worth $270,000;
tied for second were Scott Hoch (65) and Australian Bradley Hughes
(66), who finished with four straight birdies. Pate, who missed
most of 1996 following a broken wrist suffered in the auto
accident, felt strangely at home. He won the Southwest Classic and
it's defunct, won at Eagle Trace and it's gone, won LaCosta and
it's under a different format, and the Honda that's on a different
course.
</P>
<P>
   This was a day mourned by many of the players, Sindelar chief
among them. Maybe it said something that Pate has played 14 years
on the PGA Tour and he only missed this event in '96, when he
tail-ended a truck en route from Phoenix to his home in Agoura
Hills, Calif. His final round Sunday started slowly, but birdies on
the 10th (7-iron, 12 feet), 12th (sand wedge, 15 feet), 13th
(6-iron, 15 feet) and 15th (lob wedge, 3 feet) helped him break out
of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   The 18th was a journey he didn't want, but it was one he could
afford to joke about. His drive drifted into the left rough. He
pulled a 7-iron 60 yards out of a divot. He hit a 4-iron third shot
that caught a tree limb and left him about 100 yards to the green.
He lofted a sand wedge out of the rough to within 20 feet and
lagged it just to the right for a tap-in bogey that lifted him to
his first triumph since 1992 at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't pay attention until I birdied 15,'' said Pate. ``I
didn't get much going on the front, but things started going well
on the back. It means a lot because, basically, two years ago I was
starting over. I never felt I could win again last year, but this
year I thought I could. Now I know I can. I'm just happy to be out
here able to play again. I had a positive result in mind and I
didn't screw up.''
</P>
<P>
   The final round of the final Pleasant Valley tournament started
with Dave Stockton Jr. (who finished 71_272, tied for seventh) and
Willie Wood (70_271, tied for fourth) atop the leaderboard. Since
there were 16 players within four shots of the lead and the weather
was warm and breezy, it figured to be a shootout. It was.
</P>
<P>
   Hoch made the most significant jump when he birdied the 15th and
17th holes to post an early 270 that was matched by the four-birdie
finish of Hughes. Pate simply did his thing over the first six
holes of the back nine.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time Hoch had played in the event since 1982,
when he was disenchanted by the condition of the greens. He
welcomed the conditions this week, and made a putting change with
Bay Hill pro Bill Deaton Monday after missing the cut at the
British Open. ``I was disappointed with my third shot (on 18),''
Hoch said after hitting a wedge 15 feet past the pin, ``because my
wedge shot is my bread and butter and I expected to have that
within 5 feet. The ball was below my feet, and I didn't crouch down
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   So it remained for Pate to end the dreams of defender Loren
Roberts (66_272, tied for seventh), Paul Azinger (69_273, tied for
12th), and Barrington, R.I.'s Brad Faxon (75_279, tied for 34th) to
become the first player to win at Pleasant Valley twice. Faxon's
highlight after a solid British Open was when he chipped in on the
ninth, but he faded to a 39 on the back nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a fat iron on the first and made bogey,'' said Faxon,
``and I couldn't get anything going. I never got any momentum.''

FERNANDEZ PROVES HE BELONGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At the beginning of the week, a sub-70 round at
Riviera Country Club seemed a preposterous pursuit to the man with
the feeble hip. Vicente Fernandez might as well have been 20 years
younger and at his home in Buenos Aires waiting for an invitation
to the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   That bid never was forthcoming, but Fernandez forged a
3-under-par 68 at Riviera Sunday just in time to deliver an
arresting finish to the 19th U.S. Senior Open.
</P>
<P>
   Playing four groups ahead of the final pairing of Hale Irwin and
Raymond Floyd, Fernandez strung together four birdies en route to
the second-best round of the day and of the tournament, behind Jack
Nicklaus' 67.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez was the leader in the clubhouse at 2-over-par 286 for
41 minutes, or as long as it took Irwin to lip out a birdie putt at
No. 17 and sink a 12-foot birdie at 18. With that final stroke,
Irwin warded off an 18-hole playoff today against possibly the best
PGA Senior Tour golfer you've never heard of.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin gave the runner-up his due during the awards presentation
at the 18th green, telling him and a hillside half-stacked with
onlookers, ``You've proved once again you can play with the best.''
</P>
<P>
   What Irwin didn't say is Fernandez could have done that a long
time ago, given half a chance. In the late 1970s he won the
Argentinian and Brazilian opens and emerged as a worthy successor
to countryman Roberto DiVicenzo.
</P>
<P>
   DiVicenzo had shaped the dreams of Fernandez and other
Argentines with his win in the 1967 British Open and his near miss
in the 1968 Masters (he settled for second after inadvertently
giving himself a higher score on one hole).
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, 52, dreamed of some day making amends for the error
that had all of Argentina crying for DiVicenzo, but Masters
officials ignored him much as they did Dane Thomas Bjorn this year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``I never judged myself as somebody who really
deserved to play (in the majors),'' said Fernandez, who played in a
couple of British Opens but that was it. ``I took success as it
came.''
</P>
<P>
   Success found him, just not on this continent. Fernandez played
in 11 PGA Tour events in 1977 and 1978 and made the cut in all of
them but won none of them.
</P>
<P>
   The European Tour was where Fernandez made his mark and much of
his money. He had five victories on that circuit, the last of which
he managed at the 1992 English Open when he was a doddering (by his
competitors' standards) 46.

   Fernandez joined the senior tour in 1996 and won a tournament in
each of his first two seasons. If not for Irwin, he'd probably have
won his first major by now.
</P>
<P>
   During his rookie campaign, Fernandez battled Irwin before
settling for third at the PGA Seniors' Championship. Sunday, he
knew his name was off the winner's trophy as soon as Irwin
perfectly struck his 4-iron second shot at 18 to leave himself with
a dead-straight putt for the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw that, I didn't even think, `If I'm lucky, I'll go
to a playoff (today),' '' Fernandez said. ``I had a feeling he was
going to hole that putt,'' Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   His playing partner in the final round, Gil Morgan, had a
feeling it was Fernandez's day when he watched the affable
Argentine hit every fairway but one on the front nine and one-putt
eight of the first 16 greens.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the 576-yard par-5 17th. After two good shots,
Fernandez was 107 yards from the flagstick, which is a couple of
yards more than a shot hit with his wedge ordinarily travels.
Fernandez went with the wedge, anyway, and hit a shot that flew the
green and landed in rough stuff. He did well to chip it out and
make the subsequent 18-foot par putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tactical error'' is what Morgan called Fernandez's third
shot, explaining, ``I'm thinking, `Man, here he has a chance to win
the tournament. He shouldn't have put himself in that position.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez said he was trying to land the ball below the
flagstick, only ``I hit a bad shot, a wristy shot.''
</P>
<P>
   One bad stroke out of 68 he could live with, even if it did cost
him a chance at a title that he and all of Argentina could be proud
of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten weeks ago I thought I might not play golf again, so I'm so
happy to be able to compete at this level,'' said Fernandez, who
suffered acute pain in May after ramming his hip into the edge of a
sharp, wooden table, causing a build-up of fluid in the joint.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the week Fernandez didn't even know if he'd
be able to walk Riviera, much less tame it. A fellow competitor,
Jim Colbert, gave him some magnets to place on the hip and that did
the trick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturday, just like that, I started feeling better,'' said
Fernandez, who shot a third-round 74 to start Sunday five shots
behind the leader, Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   He passed Floyd but couldn't quite catch Irwin, a three-time
U.S. Open champion who called this victory one of the highlights of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he says that,'' Fernandez said, ``it makes me feel even
better to have been beaten by a player like him.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth? Irwin should feel that much better, having squeaked
by a player like Fernandez.

RAGING AGAINST PGA MACHINE 
</HEADLINE>
 CLASSIC-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   SUTTON, Mass. _ Even in the end, they never caved to The
Machine. Never. They were like letter-writers in an E-mail world;
jazz listeners who prefer album static to silently humming CDs;
defiant owners of the last house standing among the debris,
preventing big-city developers from razing the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Machine didn't like that resistance. It wanted a
Pleasant Valley CC that would take any tournament date it was given
for the CVS Charity Classic. So what if it was a week before or
week after the British Open? The PGA speaks. Clubs do as PGA says.
It's simple.
</P>
<P>
   But not here. Ted Mingolla wouldn't let his club _ with life and
a love of golf coursing through its greens _ become a golf cliche
with no soul. So after 32 tournaments here, the PGA is leaving
town. With Sunday's one-stroke win, Steve Pate will go on record as
the last male to win a pro golf tournament at Pleasant Valley.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Blaine McCallister was in the shadow of the 18th
hole, shaking his head and saying, ``I'm very disappointed in the
PGA.'' That's why Mingolla rolled his eyes and walked away when
someone asked his opinion of PGA commissioner Tim Finchem. That's
why Joey Sindelar was standing by his car in the players' parking
lot with tears in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``First he gave us all a big hug,'' David Benson said of
Sindelar's goodbye. ``After that, I looked at him and saw that he
was going to cry. I couldn't look at him anymore; I had to turn
away because I was going to cry, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Most golf fans know Sindelar, a 17-year pro. They may not know
David Benson and his brother, Chris. Both are clubhouse workers,
putting in 90-hour weeks during the tournament, mostly for free.
Chris began his Pleasant Valley career 12 years ago as a dishwasher
and eventually moved his way into the clubhouse. He got the
clubhouse job in classic Pleasant Valley fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an informal interview with Mr. Mingolla, he liked me and
that was it,'' Chris said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Benson brothers work with 80-year-old Charlie Reilly, who
has volunteered here 19 years. All have become familiar with the
players, so much so that they are known by their first names.
Sindelar quickly put in perspective what the end of this tournament
means _ he won't see his friends anymore _ so he gave them his
address in New York before driving away.
</P>
<P>
   Mingolla promised that he wouldn't become emotional. He and his
son, Steve, presided over the tournament as usual. Next year, they
will host the LPGA and immediately become directors of one of the
best stops on that tour. So pro golf will continue annually in New
England. That's good news for those who plan to come here and see
the newest LPGA star, Se Ri Pak. But there are enough quality
courses and there is enough sponsorship money for pro men and women
to play close together throughout New England.
</P>
<P>
   The Machine, fed by Finchem, made that impossible. The PGA
wanted the tourney to have a bigger paycheck (Pate received
$270,000 for his win Sunday; the purse was $1.5 million), so CVS
was willing to double the purse to $3 million. With that in mind,
you would think there was no need to bring up the money. Well, as
much as it hurts to say again, the decision to leave was about the
money. Indirectly. Finchem wanted Pleasant Valley to accept dates
that would ensure the absence of many top players. Mingolla would
have preferred a fall date as opposed to a week after the British
Open. Last year, the final day of the tournament coincided with
Bill Parcells's return to Foxborough. Attendance was well over
60,000. It was the same story this year, numberswise. But when you
love golf, you want to see the best players. And the best are less
likely to show a week after one of the four majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there's a pecking order to things and I'm sure one of
the things determining the pecking order is money,'' Lee Rinker
said. ``Nobody wants bad dates. Somebody has to get them. It's too
bad; I hate to leave here.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Pleasant Valley couldn't get the dates it wanted
because it didn't flex its cash quickly enough. But that's not the
Mingolla way. He and his staff never have fit into golf's
stereotypes. Eight years ago, The Story in golf was Shoal Creek CC
and its admission that it did not allow black members. It was not
an issue with Pleasant Valley. They did not and do not broadcast
their membership numbers because they are comfortable with
themselves. Know how their selection process works? Ted and Steve
Mingolla usually sit down with people and talk with them. If they
like them, they're in.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way Cuz Mingolla did it. It's how Ted Mingolla does
it. It's how Steve Mingolla will do it if he takes over the club,
continuing the family tradition. That's not the way of The Machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what's going to happen,'' Steve Mingolla said. ``The
PGA is going to turn all these tournaments into cookie-cutters.
These guys are not going to know what cities they're in because
everything will look the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Players and volunteers always knew they were at Pleasant Valley.
Roger Maltbie can tell you that. His $40,000 check from 1975 hangs
on a clubhouse wall. The golfer thought the check was lost, but it
was discovered by a worker sweeping up a floor. In any other place,
you wouldn't be surprised if the check had been discarded along
with other bits and pieces on the floor. Not here. They are big on
details.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday, Ted Mingolla was no closer to tears than he was at
6 a.m. He listened to Pate thank him and hundreds of yellow-shirted
volunteers for many great years. Maybe he eventually would go home
and cry himself to sleep. Pleasant Valley, the little guy,
maintained its purity. But The Machine had another undeserved win.
