<HEADLINE> US Producer Prices Decline for 7th Month in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. producer prices declined
for the seventh consecutive month in July, a record since the U.S.
government has kept track on the index in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Labor Department reported today that the producer
price index fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
Prices paid to food producers fell by 0.2 percent -- the sixth
decline in eight months. That offset a tiny 0.1 percent increase
in energy prices.
</P>
<P>
Outside of food and energy, light truck prices fell by 0.8
percent. Computers, alcoholic beverages and floor coverings also
fell. But the cost of clothing, books and civilian aircraft rose.
</P>
<P>
So-called core prices -- excluding volatile food and energy
costs -- declined 0.1 percent in July, the fourth drop in six
months.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, monthly decreases in the U.S. producer price
index have ranged between 0.1 percent and 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The longest previous string of price declines since the
government began compiling the index in 1947 was five in a row,
from August through December 1952.
</P>
<P>
But many U.S. economists have been predicting that inflation
will rise during the second half of the year as economic growth
rebounds from a second quarter lull.

<HEADLINE> Britain Denies Shifting Stance on Lockerbie Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The British government has flatly
denied it was looking for new ways to break an impasse over
extraditing two Libyans who were suspected of blowing up a Pan
American plane over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a press report that said the London government
was considering a new approach to resolve the Lockerbie issue, a
British Foreign Office spokesman dismissed the media speculation
by saying, "There has been no change in policy."
</P>
<P>
The British and U.S. governments insist that the two Libyan
suspects be tried in either Scotland or the United States and they
have rejected Libya's proposal that they should be tried by
Scottish judges under Scottish laws in a third neutral country.
</P>
<P>
The British spokesman reaffirmed London's policy that the two
Libyans "must be put on trial in Scotland or the United States."
</P>
<P>
He also explained that Prime Minister Tony Blair was "concerned
at the continuing impasse, but he is not concerned about the legal
case against the Libyans."

<HEADLINE> UK Honor Guards Likely to Lose Bearskin Hats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The British Ministry of Defense
is considering to use synthetic alternatives to replace the honor
guards' bearskin hats made from the Canadian brown bearskin.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Defense Minister for defense procurement John Gilbert
has urged the army to look at synthetic replacements for the
present headgear, known as the busby, according British defense
sources.
</P>
<P>
However, synthetic fake fur could prove to be a disaster. An
army spokesman said, "When the (synthetic) hats are dry, they
attract a great deal of static electricity."
</P>
<P>
"In the rain they look like a lady might look when she steps
out of the shower. Synthetics don't imitate long-haired animal
furs well," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported nearly 3,000 British soldiers from five
regiments such as the Grenadier, Scots and Welsh Guards have worn
busbies since the battle of Waterloo in 1815.

<HEADLINE> UK's Unemployment Total Lowest for 17 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The jobless total in Britain fell
again last month to its lowest figure since 1980, according to the
latest figures released here today.
</P>
<P>
The number out of work and claiming benefit was down 49,800 to
1,550,000 in July -- 5.5 percent of the workforce and a larger cut
than many economists in the City had expected.
</P>
<P>
It was the 17th consecutive monthly fall in the
seasonally-adjusted total.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, official figures showed average earnings rose by
4.25 percent in the year to June, unchanged from the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
Education and Employment Minister Baroness Blackstone welcomed
the latest fall in the jobless total. But she warned that youth
unemployment still presented a danger.
</P>
<P>
The government's welfare-to-work scheme designed to get 250,000
under-25s off benefit and into jobs would be the key in keeping
unemployment down, she added.
</P>
<P>
The new deal, funded by the windfall tax from privatized public
sectors, would provide skills and experience for young people to
find jobs, she said.

<HEADLINE> Foodborne Diseases More Serious Than Indicated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) warned today that foodborne diseases may be 300 to 350 times
more frequent than reported cases indicated.
</P>
<P>
"It is believed that hundreds of millions of people worldwide
suffer from diseases caused by contaminated food," WHO says in its
latest edition of the World Health Statistics Quarterly.
</P>
<P>
It says: "Developing countries suffer the most from a wide
range of diseases including cholera, campilobacteriosis,
Escherichia coli infections, salmonellosis, shigellosis,
brucellosis, and hepatitis A."
</P>
<P>
The annual cases of about 1.5 billion episodes of diarrhoea
among children under five years old, resulted in more than three
million deaths, WHO said. It is an indication of the seriousness
of the problem, since a significant proportion of the diarrhoea
disease cases are of foodborne origin.
</P>
<P>
WHO said that a number of industrialized countries have
experienced an increase in cases of foodborne diseases in recent
years, despite safe water supplies, sound standards of hygiene and
application of technologies such as pasteurization.
</P>
<P>
It said the emergence of Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia
coli O157 and multi-antibiotic resistant Salmonella typhimurium
are perceived as new significant threats to public health." Japan
and Scotland saw severe outbreaks of Escherichia coli O157 last
year.
</P>
<P>
The organization also warned that foodborne diseases would
cause substantial economic costs, affecting individuals and
families, industries, health care systems and entire communities.
</P>
<P>
It cited an example when cholera broke out in Peru in
1991. More than 700 million U.S. dollars were lost in fish and
fishery products exports, and in the three months following the
start of the epidemic, 70 million dollars was lost due to closure
of food service establishments and a drop in tourism.
</P>
<P>
The WHO would continue to "promote the concept of shared
responsibility among government, industry and consumers in the
fight against foodborne diseases," said Dr Fritz Kaferstein,
Director of the WHO Program of Food Safety and Food Aid.
</P>
<P>
He urged the world to make concerted efforts in research,
regulatory control, infrastructure development, epidemiology and
training, and education to ensure the safety of food.

<HEADLINE> Gold Cleared in London Increases Sharply in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- There was a big rise in the
volume of gold cleared last month in London after the price of the
precious metal fell to a 12-year low, the London Bullion Market
Association (LBMA) said today.
</P>
<P>
The LBMA said that the average daily clearing turnover for gold
rose from 32.2 million troy ounces in June to 37 million ounces in
July.
</P>
<P>
This was only below the record 40.3 million ounces a day, worth
14 billion US dollars, cleared in February, when the average gold
price tumbled by 25 US dollars an ounce and fell below 350 US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The association reported that as a result, the average daily
value of turnover also rose to 12 billion US dollars last month
from 11 billion in June although the average price fell to 324.10
US dollars an ounce from 340.76 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The LBMA said that the big rise in the daily gold clearing
turnover in London, the international settlement center for gold
bullion, was mainly due to greater volatility of the gold price
and additional positioning and hedging.
</P>
<P>
As the association started reporting clearance data only from
October last year, there are no comparative figures for July 1996.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Hold Senior Officials' Conservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean ministry said today
it has embarked on a national campaign to sensitize senior
officials from the government, non-governmental organisations and
the private sector on the implementation of the Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA) policy.
</P>
<P>
An official of mines, environment and tourism ministry said
the ministry, in conjunction with the University of Zimbabwe's
Institute of Environmental Studies, would run week long training
courses on the policy processes before it became law.
</P>
<P>
"The aim is to expose participants to the purposes, principles
and methods of EIA as an environmental planning and management
tool, as well as raise level of appreciation for those who
already know it," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that participants would be provided with the capacity
to take part in the EIA implementation by carrying out and wisely
administering natural resources management studies themselves.
</P>
<P>
The ministry was exploring ways to entrench the EIA policy
into law so as to enforce Zimbabwe's mostly "environmentally
unfriendly" developers into determining potential and known
effects of proposed land/water use on the cultural, social,
economic and ecological health of the area affected.

<HEADLINE> Bonn to Talk Compensation With Holocaust Survivors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The German government and a Jewish
group will open talks on compensation to thousands of Holocaust
survivors now living in the former East Bloc.
</P>
<P>
"The government will be seeking to reach quick agreement after
the summer recess (of parliament)," government spokesman Herbert
Schmuelling said today.
</P>
<P>
Schmuelling said Chancellery Minister Friedrich Bohl and
Finance Ministry officials would meet representatives from the
Jewish Claims Conference next week to talk about the matter.
</P>
<P>
Germany has faced growing pressure to pay compensation, in the
way of pensions, to elderly Holocaust survivors in eastern Europe
and the former Soviet Union, who were excluded from reparations
made to western victims during the Cold War. Most of the up to
20,000 Holocaust victims live in the former East bloc.
</P>
<P>
Bonn's announcement of the talks came as a German Jewish leader
called on the government to pay compensation to Jewish Holocaust
survivors in eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the Holocaust survivors will die if one just keeps
talking about the issue for another two years," said Ignatz Bubis,
chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany. He was being
interviewed by the Berlin newspaper Tagesspiegel published today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also said that 83 United States senators would
issue an open letter to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in an
advertisement campaign to protest against the Bonn government's
failure to approve pension claims by Holocaust survivors living in
eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
The full-page advertisements, financed by the American Jewish
Committee, will be carried by the New York Times and the
International Herald Tribune in the coming weekend.

<HEADLINE> Lower Crude Oil Prices Forecast for Future Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- There will be a global crude oil
surplus and prices are expected to fall following the resumption
of Iraqi oil exports, Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citing the latest world commodity forecast by the Economist
Intelligence Unit (EIU), the newspaper said that the average
global growth in oil consumption will be at 2.5 percent this year
compared with 2.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Of all the growth, countries outside the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development will account for more than 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, it said that the main factor behind the bearish
outlook for the oil price is oversupply, exacerbated by Iraqi
exports.
</P>
<P>
The EIU expected the cost of oil imports to the main
industrialized countries will average 18.50 US dollars a barrel
next year and 18.30 US dollars in 1998 and prices will remain flat
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the unit believed that growth in non-OPEC oil
output, hit by a number of field delays earlier this year, will
soon resume the strong upward trend seen in recent years. It
expected non-OPEC output to rise by 3.29 million barrels per day
between 1996 and 1999.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Commercial Farmers Support Land Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean Commercial
Farmers Union (CFU) said it will continue to support the land
reform programme, but reiterated earlier warnings that market
forces should be allowed to determine price of land to be
acquired.
</P>
<P>
CFU vice-president Arthur Baisley told Zimbabwe News Agency
today the programme should be based on the
willing-buyer-willing-seller principle which would, among other
things, consider infrastructural development on the farm and land
tenure.
</P>
<P>
"The form of tenure we are looking at is not a permit to
reside, but new settlers need some form of tenure (lease with
option to purchase) so that there is some degree of
accountability and conservation of resources as well as the means
to raise finance through some form of security," Baisley said,
adding that forceful means of getting farms for resettlement
should not be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
The comments followed the announcement this week by president
Robert Mugabe that resettlement of landless Zimbabweans was going
to be accelerated with a further 1,772 farms already identified
for redistribution.
</P>
<P>
Without giving figures, Baisley said a significant number of
farms had been redistributed, and he hoped the forthcoming
resettlement exercise would be done correctly and on a
sustainable basis.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that they were in support of the new thrust of
commercial resettlement -- based on freehold title, of indigenous
farmers.

<HEADLINE> German Economy to Keep 2 Percent Growth Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The German economy is expected to
continue a growth rate of 2 percent in the third quarter of 1997,
to be powered solely by the booming exports, a German economic
research institute predicted today.
</P>
<P>
In its latest economic report issued today, the Berlin-based
German Institute for Economic Research put the German growth in
the first six months at around 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
While exports continued to expand, domestic business remained
sluggish.
</P>
<P>
The institute also challenged the notion that the current
German export boom was driven solely by the favorable exchange
rates.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the rises in exports had set in before the German
mark began its steady depreciation against the U.S. dollar,
indicating that the German industry was competitive even without
the help of the mark's weakness.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the German central bank, the Bundesbank, today also
went to defend Germany's position as a production base.
</P>
<P>
In its monthly report for August, the Bundesbank noted that the
huge deficit registered by Germany in its direct investment
balance should not be traced back to the high labor costs and
sales strategies of companies alone.
</P>
<P>
Besides the higher taxes and fees, there were also other
factors including the numerous environmental regulations and the
rigidness of the labor market which had deterred foreign
investors. But corrections were already taking place in those
areas, the Bundesbank said.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank, however, admitted that further efforts were
still needed to be made by Germany in order to "correct past
mistakes and to participate successfully in the competition of
highly-developed industrial nations."

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Preparations for Mozambique's
first municipal elections started amid political tension in the
country, the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana reported today.
</P>
<P>
The elections, after which load will be taken off the central
government and resources be placed in the hands of elected
officers, are viewed by most Mozambicans as a crucial step
towards power sharing. The elections would cover 33 cities and
towns.
</P>
<P>
Manica provincial Governor Arthur Canana told Ziana today that
training of more than 100 senior government officials,
representatives from non-governmental organisations on how to run
the elections had begun this week in Chimoio.
</P>
<P>
The government was also busy teaching people about the law and
the relevance of the elections, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, there is political tension that has been threatening the
elections. But now we think it has been overtaken as we have
ironed out relevant issues with opposition parties," the governor
of the ruling party Frelimo said.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts viewed the elections which will take place
on December 27, as a key test for democracy in a country ravaged
by 16 years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The country's first national census since 1980 would be held
in this month alongside registration for the elections.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties, on the other hand, said the date for the
elections was too close to allow proper planning, training and
preparations.
</P>
<P>
The elections, to be contested mainly by Frelimo led by
President Joaquim Chissano and Alfonso Dhlakama's Renamo, would
cost 14.36 million U.S. Dollars, coming from the donor community.

<P>
LUANDA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Amante Da Rosa, Cape Verdean
Ambassador in Angola said here today the forth-coming visit to

promote the friendly cooperative relations between the two
countries.

The ambassador called on UNITA to carry out fully the peace

<HEADLINE> Food Situation Deteriorating in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The food supply situation in
Sierra Leone has deteriorated and, famine is imminent if the
present insecurity persists.
</P>
<P>
In its report "Food Supply Situation and Crop Prospects in
Sub-Saharan Africa" released at a press conference here today,
the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said that there
was a real possibility of famine in that country.
</P>
<P>
The recent political upheaval erupted in May and the resulting
widespread civil unrest has aggravated the already precarious
food security situation in the West African country, the report
noted.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that planting and weeding of the main crops
during the period between April and June had been seriously
disrupted as a large number of refugees had crossed into
neighbouring countries.
</P>
<P>
Prospects for food production in 1997 are very bleak and the
country will continue to need large amounts of food aid to meet
its consumption requirements, the FAO report stated.
</P>
<P>
The food supply situation has tightened in the main towns with
the price of rice, the staple food for the local people, tripling
since last May in the capital city of Freetown, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Before the upheaval, the cereal import requirement for 1997
was estimated at 260,000 tons and the food aid requirement at
80,000 tons, said the FAO, adding that "the situation is being
closely monitored".

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Intensified in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Foreign companies and relief
organizations are withdrawing from Sierra Leone due to worsening
insecurity and social situation, leaving hundreds of workers in
the south of the country jobless.
</P>
<P>
In Bo, Sierra Leone's second largest city, more than 100
workers at two international agencies, have been laid off.
</P>
<P>
The two organizations, one from Britain and the other from
Germany, have already stopped their operations in the troubled
country due to insecurity and deteriorating social situation, the
British Broadcasting Company reported today.
</P>
<P>
No more relief activities have been able to continue since the
May 25 coup which ousted the elected government led by Ppresident
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, it said.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of operations of the two organizations will not
only have a huge impact on the workers who have lost their jobs,
but will seriously hamper relief and development efforts in this
area.
</P>
<P>
Last month, some 300 workers of a foreign agency, World Vision
were laid off. This agency is also likely to suspend its
operations in the southern and eastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports said that more than 200 people, including
some children, in the Southern Province died of starvation last
week.
</P>
<P>
Relief agencies which have been supplying food and medicine to
these areas have pulled out due to persistent cases of harassment
and seizure of supplies by security personnel.
</P>
<P>
Such an incident occurred Tuesday when relief supplies being
taken into a town in the south by catholic relief organizations
were hijacked by soldiers on the highway.
</P>
<P>
The shortage in food, medicine, fuel and other supplies is
expected to be intensified since west African countries have
reinforced economic embargo and sanction against the country in
order to oust the military junta in power.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Various activities have been
organized throughout the southern African region to celebrate the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) Day on August 17,
said a Zimbabwean government statement today.
</P>
<P>
On August 17, 1992, leaders of the then Southern African
Development Coordination Conference (SADCC) met in the Namibian
capital, Windoek where they signed a declaration and treaty that
gave birth to the 12-member SADC.
</P>
<P>
SADCC had for more than 10 years survived as a regional
grouping to counter then apartheid South Africa's destabilisation
activities.
</P>
<P>
SADC now seeks to transform itself into a more dynamic
organisation that will lead the region to greater cooperation and
economic integration.
</P>
<P>
The statement said, ''Experience in the region and elsewhere
has shown that sustainable development is only attained when
economic growth does not leave aside socio-cultural interests.''
</P>
<P>
''Development has to take people as its central focus since
its primary concern is to meet human needs,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
It said, ''SADC has therefore decided to put people at the
centre of its development strategy by harnessing their
energies and capacities.''

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Immediate Halt to Violent Acts in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations today issued a presidential statement, urging
the two parties in the Republic of Congo to halt all acts of
violence immediately.
</P>
<P>
Expressing its deep concern over the plight of civilians caught
up in the fighting, which had resulted in widespread loss of life,
displacement of the population and severe humanitarian condition
in Brazzaville, the council underlined the need to respect the
cease-fire agreement signed on July 13, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council expressed its full support for the efforts
of the International Mediation Committee under the Chairmanship of
the President of Gabon and the National Mediation Committee under
the Chairmanship of the Mayor of Brazzaville to persuade the
parties to reach agreement on a cease-fire and a peaceful
settlement of the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
It also called on the two parties to resolve the crisis on the
basis of the proposals by the president of Gabon currently under
discussion in Brazzaville, including agreement on an interim
government of national unity and a timetable for the holding of
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The council urged both parties to respect relevant provisions
of international humanitarian law and to ensure safe and unimpeded
access by international humanitarian organizations to persons in
need of assistance as a result of the conflict, and in any other
way to facilitate the effective implementation of humanitarian
programs.

<P>
PARIS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- France today denied a report by a
British newspaper that there is a Franco-German plan to postpone
the launching of the European single currency by one year, if
Britain is not ready to join it.
</P>
<P>
"Jacques Chirac has always recalled his attachment to the
strict respect of the calendar of the single currency," said the
French presidential office.
</P>
<P>
The French prime minister's office also said that the report is
"without any foundation."
</P>
<P>
The British newspaper Evening Standard reported today that the
French and German governments had told the British government that
they were ready to delay the launching of euro, if London does not
wish to join it now.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was directly made by President Jacques Chirac and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, said the paper, which is considered to be
well-informed.
</P>
<P>
Both France and Germany are having a difficult time fighting to
meet the budget criteria set by the Maastricht treaty for joining
the euro.

<HEADLINE> Food Supply Remains Difficult in Great Lakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Serious food supply
difficulties continue in Burundi, Rwanda and the eastern part of
the Democratic Republic of Congo despite the easing of the
refugee crisis in the Great Lakes Region.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. report, entitled "Food Supply Situation and Crop
Prospects in Sub-Saharan Africa" said that massive population
movements in the recent past was the main reason of the food
supply difficulties in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The report distributed at a press conference here today said
that as a result of the massive return of refugees, Rwanda would
have to feed 1.6 million more people in the second half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it said, the overall food production in 1997 in
Rwanda is estimated at 18 percent below the 1990 level.
</P>
<P>
The adverse impact of population movement and displacement on
food production is clearly seen in Rwanda and Burundi where most
fields were abandoned, the report stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Republic of Congo has been the scene of one of
the largest and the most dramatic refugee movements in Africa's
history, leading to the critical food supply situation in the
east part of the country, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Discusses Pressing Problems With Top Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today met with Chairman of the Federation Council Yegor Stroyev
and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to discuss the most
pressing problems in the political, economic and social life of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted presidential press secretary
Sergei Yastrzhembsky as saying Yeltsin and Stroyev focused during
their meeting on problems pertaining to the draft law on religious
confessions and made necessary amendments to meet constitutional
requirements.
</P>
<P>
The press secretary said that the president and the chairman of
the Federation Council discussed a draft Taxation Code. Subjects
of the Russian Federation have different points of view on this
draft law.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Stroyev share the opinion that a number of
amendments should be made when the draft law is submitted for
discussion, which will create favorable conditions, above all, for
domestic manufacturers, Yastrzhembsky said. Besides, the Taxation
Code should contain provisions facilitating the position of those
"who have been working on land," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president and the prime minister traditionally discussed
payment of back wages owed to budgetary workers, servicemen, and
payment of pensions, Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin told the president that there was no lagging
behind the schedule of payments. In accordance with the
president's decision, overdue debts are being paid in a stable
rhythm as the government had promised.
</P>
<P>
According to the press secretary, a draft budget for 1998 was
discussed during the meeting. The main parameters of the 1998
state budget had been outlined. On August 21, it will be endorsed
by the government and on August 25 will be submitted to the State
Duma for approval.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin also viewed the problem of Chechnya.
Preparations for the meeting between Russian President Boris and
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov are underway, but it is
premature to announce the date of the meeting yet, the press
secretary said.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Scarcity Worsens in Nigerian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Worsening fuel scarcity is forcing
most of the civil servants in Abuja, the Nigerian capital to abandon
their offices in searching for oil, the official News Agency of
Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
One of the agency's reporter visited the federal secretary but
found that most of the offices were empty as officials were either
stranded in their homes, bus stops or at filling stations waiting
endlessly for fuel.
</P>
<P>
Though the capital authority has made best efforts, including
consulting with the official Fuel Distributing Company, restricting
the amount of each filling, the fuel scarcity is still worsening the
last few days, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Fuel scarcity has attacked most Nigerian cities ever since the
beginning of the year, mainly due to the lack of money to conduct
critical repairs on its major refineries, though the country is one of
the biggest oil producers worldwide, with a daily crude oil output of
2.3 million barrels.

<HEADLINE> Tajik Officials Deny Fightings in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Tajik Deputy Interior Minister
Abdusattor Radzhabov and the commander of a rapid response
brigade, Colonel Sukhrob Kasymov, categorically denied today that
armed clashes are continuing in Kurgan Tyube and the Gisar valley
as some reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency reported from Dushanbe, capital of
Tajikistan, that Radzhabov said there has been no fighting since
this morning and the situation remains calm. Kasymov's troops have
under control together with presidential guards the entire highway
south of Dushanbe down to Kurgan Tyube and the Gisar valley.
</P>
<P>
The two officials also denied that Tajik President Emomali
Rakhmonov met with Colonel Makhmud Khudoiberdyev, commander of an
elite brigade, at one of the Russian military units earlier today.
</P>
<P>
They said that Khudoiberdyev has stepped down and is expected
to attend the surrender of weapons by its brigade Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition defense council of Tajikistan's central
and southern regions, which has been recognized by the Tajik
government as anti-constitutional, has disagreed with Rakhmonov's
decision to sack Khudoiberdyev.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass quoted Kasim Babayev, deputy head of the Kurgan
Tyube regional administration and a member of the defense council,
as saying that the decision was taken after the brigade insisted
that Khudoiberdyev stay.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it said Rakhmonov has signed a decree on some
measures to stabilize the military and political situation in the
republic.
</P>
<P>
The decree gives all citizens who illegally possess weapons
three days to turn them in to authorities. If they do that by
midnight August 16, they will be exempt from criminal
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The president also ordered the Interior Ministry to remove all
illegal roadblocks and checkpoints by 9:00 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decree establishes a state commission for the acceptance of
weapons, ammunition and special property of Khudoiberdyev's
brigade.
</P>
<P>
Report said that the Tajik authorities have asked the command
of the Commonwealth of Independent States peacekeeping troops in
Tajikistan and personally Lieutenant-General Boris Dyukov to
assist the newly established commission in the performance of its
duties.

<HEADLINE> France Suggests Increasing Aid if Comorans End Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- France today suggested that it
could increase its economic aid for the Indian Ocean nation of the
Comoros, if a lasting solution to the political crisis on the
archipelago is found.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux said that
France will "draw consequences from what concerns its cooperation
policy" on the basis of the results of dialogue to be held among
the Comorans.
</P>
<P>
Out of economic reasons, two of the three islands which form
the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros, Anjouan and Moheli
have declared "independence" and asked for the return of French
rule, which was withdrawn in 1975.
</P>
<P>
France is reducing its aid to the Comoros and plans to provide
an overall of 106 million francs (18 million U.S. dollars) of aid
to the Comoros in 1997, against 150 million francs (30 million
U.S. dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
France is cutting its overseas aid programs because of its
austerity budget plan aimed at reducing public spending and
meeting the criteria set by the Maastricht treaty for joining the
euro.
</P>
<P>
An envoy of the Organization of African Unity, Pierre Yere, has
persuaded the Comorans to accept the principle of holding dialogue
to seek a lasting solution to the crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Lagos Branch of the Nigerian
Society of Engineers is planning an exhibition of locally produced
spare parts in a bid to promote the development of the manufacturing
sector.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, tagged as Sparestech '97 to be held here in October
21-24 this year, is aimed to change the attitude of Nigerians toward
made-in-Nigeria goods, which can be compared with the best in the
world, the chairman of the branch said today.
</P>
<P>
By organizing the exhibition, he said, "We intend to resuscitate our
industry, to have more people get involved in the production of local
spares, and of cause to encourage Nigerians who have the money outside
to come to this country to invest in the production of spares."
</P>
<P>
The organizers said that to promote the buying of local products
could help Nigerians improve the quality of their life, boost economic
development and increase employment.
</P>
<P>
Foreign currencies used for importing will also be conserved, the
chairman added.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will highlight the country's manufactured spare
parts for vehicles and machinery mainly in the construction and power
generating industry.
</P>
<P>
To change the country's overdependence on the petroleum industry,
the Nigerian government has been encouraging local manufacturers,
producers and the public to be sensitized to the advantages of buying
made-in-Nigeria products.

<HEADLINE> Hussein-Netanyahu Meetings Fails to Ease Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Amman, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Today's talks between Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Jordan's King Hussein appeared short
of softening Israel's stance in the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Indeed this is a dangerous moment for the peace process, the
king said after emerging from the talks at the Royal Palace in
Jordan's Red Sea port city of Aqaba.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Netanyahu insisted that the Palestinian side takes
concrete actions to improve security and combat terrorism before
Israeli-imposed closure can be relaxed.
</P>
<P>
At an obvious low key, King Hussein told reporters that he did
not expect to solve all the problems during this meeting. He
admitted that the present circumstances were dangerous because of the
"regrettable" July 30 market bombings in Jerusalem which took 15 lives.
</P>
<P>
"There was a minority on both sides trying to impose their
agenda on the majority who supported peace," the king emphasized in
the ensuing joint press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jordan is committed to peace and called for
overcoming dangerous elements in order to prevent bloodshed and devastation.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been making effort to persuade Israel to ease its
harsh sanctions against the Palestinians following the suicide
bombings and bring them closer together despite current difficulties.
</P>
<P>
As part of Jordan's diplomatic move, Crown Price Hassen has met
Netanyahu and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Tel Aviv and Cairo
respectively, and the king met Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Amman.
</P>
<P>
Jordan would do its uttermost to support the Palestinians for
achieving a comprehensive, equitable peace founded on mutual respect
and confidence, said Hussein.
</P>
<P>
He warned against disasters ahead "if peoples of the region
would not strongly face up to throughts and ideas which cause
difficulties to them."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who arrived in Aqaba this morning on his first
official visit to an Arab nation since the Jerusalem bombings,
stressed that security was first and actions were urgently needed to
combat terrorists.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Palestinians to cooperate with Israel in such actions.
</P>
<P>
Israel meted out a full closure of the Palestinian self-rule
areas and stopped transfer of millions of dollars in tax revenues in
response to the July 30 terror attack.
</P>
<P>
The Aqaba summit was held amid expectations as Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy earlier today announced in Israel that his
country was interested in canceling measures taken against the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process has been stalled since March when
Israel broke ground for the building of new Jewish settlements in
dispute area in East Jerusalem, where the Palestinians want as their
future capital.
</P>
<P>
Yet it took a turn for the worse after the suicide bombings in
West Jerusalem, for which the military wing of the Islamic miliant
group Hamas claimed responsibility, and Israel answered with a
security clampdown and restriction on the movement of Palestinian
people and goods.
</P>
<P>
Today's Hussein-Netanyahu meeting was also attended by Jordanian
Crown Prince Hassan, Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali, Israeli
Foreign Minister Levy and other senior officials from both sides.

<HEADLINE> Albright Says Argentina to Be Close Ally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said today that the United States would likely
choose Argentina as its close military ally outside the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
"This status is open to other countries, including Chile,"
Albright said at a news conference with visiting Chilean Foreign
Minister Jose Miguel Insulza.
</P>
<P>
"The announcement has not yet been made but we do wish to
recognize Argintina's role," she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the U.S. president
has authority to designate close allies, a status that does not
require U.S. help in case of attack, but these allies can buy
excess weapons from the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The new designation could bring Argentina more American arms
and other military favors.
</P>
<P>
Nations already designated as close non-NATO U.S. allies
include Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Last week the Clinton administration lifted a ban on sale of
high-tech arms to Latin America. The ban was imposed in the 1970s
when most countries in the region were under military rule.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the moves by Washington in Latin America are
designed to compete with France, Russia and other European
countries for the arms market in the region.

<HEADLINE> World Chemical Trade Doubles in Six Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- World trade in chemicals
and chemical products amounted to some 450 billion dollars in
1990, about 10 percent of the total trade in all commodities,
according to United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.
</P>
<P>
The commission reported that the trade value doubled that of
six years earlier, representing an annual average growth of 11-12
percent.
</P>
<P>
Western Europe accounted for more than half of world imports in
chemicals and nearly two thirds of world exports, according to the
Annual Bulletin of Trade in Chemical Products published by the
commission.
</P>
<P>
Chemical trade contributes some 30 billion dollars to the
Western European trade balance, while generating a 46 billion
dollar trade deficit in Asia. North America imports half as much
as Asia but exports similar amounts, the commission reported.

<HEADLINE> Military Action Urged to Sack S.leonean Junta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean refugees in Nigeria
today called on the west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) to use
military action immediately to flush out the junta in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of the refugees, who visited the News Agency of
Nigeria, pleaded with Chairman of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS), General Sani Abacha, to mandate ECOMOG to
sack the junta without further delay.
</P>
<P>
"It is better for ECOMOG to use military force to solve the problem
in our country. There is no food, no medicine and more civilians are
dying daily," a spokesman for the seven-man group said.
</P>
<P>
"The options of dialogue, sanctions and economic blockade will
never force the rebels out of Freetown. Force is the only option that
can work effectively to overturn the coup," he said.
</P>
<P>
The coup on May 25 overthrew Sierra Leone's civilian government led
by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, and invited international
condemnation.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has urged the coupers to step down without delay
and ECOMOG has tightened blockade after the military announced a
four-year transition to civil rule program two weeks ago.

PARIS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Former French President Charles de
Gaulle was a descendant of Irish immigrants in France, an Irish
historian said today.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted Pat Power, the historian, as saying
that he had found the maternal family tree of the former president

He said that Marie Angelique Forde, the great-great-grandmother
of de Gaulle who was born in Lille, northern France, was Irish.
</P>
<P>
Pat said that the family of de Gaulle quit Ireland in 1691, and
that the father of Marie Angelique, Felix Forde, joined the French
army.
</P>
<P>
However, it is impossible now for people to make pilgrimage to
the home of de Gaulle in Ireland, as the house of the Forde family

<HEADLINE> FAA Says New Safety Alarms May Prevent Jet Crashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A new kind of altitude
warning system could prevent aircraft from crashing into mountains
and the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) may
require all airliners to install such equipment, The New York Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The FAA said such system, already being placed in some passenger
jets by American, Alaska and United Airlines, Lufthansa and
British Airways, might have save the Korean Air Lines jumbo jet
that crashed on Guam. The crash on August 6 in a hillside near
Guam's International Airport killed more than 220 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
The new system learns the aircraft's location, altitude and
course from existing navigation equipment on board. It then
compares that information with a computerized map of all the
world's mountains and predicts the length of time before an impact
would occur. It sounds a warning at 60 seconds before impact and
again, more sharply, at 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Conventional systems sometimes fail to give any warning at all.
The existing system, known as ground proximity warning systems,
became standard in the early 1970s, but they have no ability to
assess the terrain ahead of an aircraft.
</P>
<P>
It works well enough over flat terrain. But when a plane is
approaching a mountain, its height over the ground can be reduced
to zero so quickly that the system cannot provide adequate warning.
If the slope of the mountain is steep enough and the plane is
moving fast enough, the device may not provide any warning at all.
</P>
<P>
The new instrument, called an enhanced ground proximity warning
system, has the potential to make extremely rare such kinds of
accidents as the one in Guam and the one near Dubrovnik, Croatia,
that killed U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Renews Calls for Lifting Sanctions on Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
CAIRO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today urged Israel to lift sanctions against the Palestinians for
realizing security and an early resumption of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
During a two-hour meeting with students in Alexandria
University, the president stressed that realization of security
between the Israelis and Palestinians is important and the siege
imposed by Israel on the Palestinians following the double suicide
bombings attack in Jerusalem on July 30 should be lifted.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said Egypt is against any kind of terrorist activities
against innocent civilians either in Israel or Palestine, whether
they are Israelis or Palestinians. He cautioned that preventing the
entry of food and medicine into Palestinian self-controlled areas
could lead to uncalculated acts.
</P>
<P>
"The uprising of the hungry is extremely dangerous. Progress in
the peace process is the only guarantee to realize security," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the return of U.S. coordinator Dennis Ross to work for
the resumptio of security coordination between the Palestinians and
Israelis is "necessary for both sides."
</P>
<P>
Ross, who is making shuttle diplomacy between the Israelis and
Palestinians, has urged Israel to ease the sanctions, which he
called "counterproductive."
</P>
<P>
Israel imposed economic sanctions and travel ban on the
Palestinians in the wake of the Jerusalem suicide bombing that
killed 15 people.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Mysterious Fires Cause Chaos in Lusaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Wang Nengbiao)
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Lusaka was plunged into another
disturbance this morning after a third fire in two days,
swallowed the vendors' stalls in the center of Lusaka Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Vendors went on rampage in the capital city, forcing all shops
to shut down once again in three days.
</P>
<P>
Riot police fired tear gas to disperse the vendors, gunfires
could be heard and a helicopter was seen hovering above the city.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources told Xinhua that over 60 people were arrested
and more injured in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia News Agency reported that four vehicles were
damaged and three policemen were injured slightly.
</P>
<P>
Some workers went home early because of the chaos.
</P>
<P>
Calm returned later in the morning, but all shops remain
closed. In the afternoon, few vehicles and people were seen on
the streets, but groups of riot police remained there.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday evening, a mysterious fire broke out which destroyed
old Soweto market, causing a property loss of million Kwacha on
the small scale businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Police at the scene said fire fighting engines only managed to
get there nearly an hour after the fire started around 20:00
local time.
</P>
<P>
Until 07:00 this morning, fire fighters was still battling to
put out the fire.
</P>
<P>
Early Tuesday morning, another mysterious fire gutted the
entire first floor of the Zambian cabinet office, destroying
important documents, furniture and office equipment.
</P>
<P>
Fire fighters from Lusaka City Council, Zambia Air Force and
National Airport Corporation battled for more than five hours to
put out the fire.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire in the government headquarters is not
known yet.
</P>
<P>
President Frederick Chiluba rushed to inspect the damage,
saying that the fire should be served as a lesson to the lax
government officials.
</P>
<P>
Bomb experts were on the scene to prevent possible explosion.
</P>
<P>
All the documents, electrical goods like fridges and stoves,
furniture were destroyed and window panes charred.
</P>
<P>
After touring the scene, Home Affairs Minister Chitalu Sampa
said that "This is a highly sensitive matter on which I cannot
issue a statement based on preliminary investigations."
</P>
<P>
A riot broke out Monday in Lusaka when the first of the three
mysterious fires erupted in an early morning raid. Street vendors
smashed vehicles and looted some shops and stalls after their
makeshift stalls along Lumumba and Freedom roads in downtown were
burned.
</P>
<P>
Police fired tear gas cannisters to disperse the rampaging
vendors who had completely paralyzed business in the city.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the angry vendors marched to State House to ask for
explanation over what had caused the fires.
</P>
<P>
On the way to State House, they pulled down other makeshift
stalls and burnt them, destroyed all traffic lights and glass
sign posts, looted a snack caravan and a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
After being addressed at State House, the vendors returned to
the city center, but continued a looting spree and sent motorists
fleeing in all directions in confusion.
</P>
<P>
"The streets are where we make our money. This is our villages
now we can't survive," one vendor was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government has accused the opposition United National
Independent Party (UNIP) of being behind the burning of street
vendors' stalls.
</P>
<P>
State House Affairs Minister Eric Silwamba told vendors that
the government had no hand in the burning of the stalls.
</P>
<P>
"It is only some overzealous people trying to politicize the
issue that are making such sweeping statements," Silwamba said.
</P>
<P>
The police authority warned that anyone loitering around
public buildings with intended purpose of sabotage will be
arrested.
</P>
<P>
Some government officials, trade union and opposition leaders
condemned the fire incidents rocking Lusaka and called on the
government to investigate the incidents and bring the culprits to
book.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday President Frederick Chiluba promised to provide
decent and modern markets and rehabilitate the existing ones to
enable both sellers and buyers to conduct their business
transactions in a conducive and hygienic environment.
</P>
<P>
When Chiluba officially opened the newly built Lusaka city
market, he told those who did not get a stall in the new market
to be patient.
</P>
<P>
Many street vendors have been doing business in Zambia's
downtown centers because of inadequate of market places.

<HEADLINE> Ontario Hydro to Close 7 Reactors in Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Ontario Hydro announced
today that it will temporarily shutdown seven of its nuclear
reactors in a major overhaul of its production facilities.
</P>
<P>
The board of directors at North America's largest power utility
approved the overhaul in response to an extensive evaluation of
its nuclear assets conducted during the past few months.
</P>
<P>
The evaluation report, which prompted Hydro president Allan
Kupcis to resign Tuesday, gives the utility barely a passing grade
on safety but says it's still at an acceptable level.
</P>
<P>
Hydro board decided that four units at the Pickering generating
station and three at Bruce will be laid up for the next year for
overhauls.
</P>
<P>
Other reactors at the two plants will be given technical and
organizational upgrades over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The overhaul is estimated to cost Hydro up to 5.8 billion U.S.
dollars from 1997 to 2001.
</P>
<P>
To make up for the loss in production from nuclear plants,
Hydro will increase electricity production from its fossil-fuel
plants and bring back into production units that have been
mothballed at the Lennox plant.
</P>
<P>
Ontario Energy Minister Norm Sterling said today the problem is
with the way Hydro operates its plants, not with CANDU technology.
</P>
<P>
There is nothing wrong with the Canadian nuclear technology,
the minister stressed.

<HEADLINE> New Safety Alarm Device to Prevent Jet Crashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 13 (Xinhua) -- All airliners in the United
States may soon be required to install a new altitude warning
system to minimize the possibility of crashes.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will publish a
proposed rule next year to make the system mandatory, the New York
Times today quoted a FAA official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thomas E. McSweeney, FAA director of aircraft certification,
said actually airliners have already begun to purchase such
equipment due to its importance.
</P>
<P>
The device could especially reduce the number of plane crashes
into mountains as it learns the aircraft's location, altitude and
course and gives warnings twice before an impact would occur.
</P>
<P>
The system compares the information with a computerized map of
the world's terrain and airports, and then displays any peaks high
enough to be of concern.
</P>
<P>
Currently, planes use radar to measure the distance plane and
the ground directly below, but such a system is less sensitive as
it may not give sufficient warning of a mountain ahead because the
distance closes too rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The only warning may come 10 seconds or less before impact
instead of two warnings that sound 60 and 30 seconds separately
ahead of impact in the new equipment.
</P>
<P>
Experts say at least two crashes are linked to warning systems.
One occurred in Guam last week with Korean Air Lines which claimed
more than 200 lives and the other with a U.S. Air Force plane
which crashed near Dubrovnik, Croatia last year, causing ex-U.S.
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown's death.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union, a major
donor of aid to Cambodia, today appealed for immediate cessation
of violence in that country.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation union expressed concern over the situation in
Cambodia and extended support to the mediation efforts made by the
ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN foreign ministers, at a meeting held Monday in Singapore,
did not rule out the possibility of calling an informal meeting
for all the parties involved with a view to restoring stability in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's political framework was put in place by an
international agreement in Paris in 1991 that ended decades of
domestic conflicts. The coalition government took form from
U.N.-supervised elections two years later.
</P>
<P>
The EU appreciates the role played by King Norodom Sihanouk who
offered to abdicate if stability can be restored in the country.
</P>
<P>
But army units loyal to ousted First Prime Minister Prince
Ranariddh were reportedly preparing an offensive against
opposition troops controlling a zone in the northwest of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The fighting is expected to escalate as both sides attempt to
grab as much territory as possible before monsoons intensify to
halt military operations for a few months.

HONG KONG, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Olympic gold and silver
medalists at last year's Atlanta Olympic Games Cuba and China will
join Japan and Italy in the Hong Kong leg of this year's World
Women's Volleyball Grand Prix which starts here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The three-day Vittel Cup event is one of the five legs for the
preliminary stages for this year's Grand Prix series, which offer
a total purse of 1.5 million U.S. dollars. The top three teams
from the stages will join host Japan in the grand finals set for
August 29-31 in Kobe, Japan.
</P>
<P>
After two stages held simultaneously in Macao and Seoul, teams
from Russia, Sough Korea and China lead in top three of the Grand
Prix standings.
</P>
<P>
The six Vittel Cup matches are to be played in the Hong Kong
Coliseum. The event is organized by the Volleyball Association of
Hong Kong, China, and sponsored by Spectrum.
</P>
<P>
China, winners of the Macao leg for the last two years, made a
flying start this year by beating Italy and the United States. But
Russians proved to be stronger with their third straight win in
the three-day leg in Macao, beating China three sets to one
Sunday. Russia won the leg and China was runners-up.
</P>
<P>
Cuba, world number one and Olympic champion, felt difficult
getting into the Seoul leg of the Grand Prix. It finished third
after winner South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
China and Cuba never failed to make to the World Volleyball
Grand Prix Finals in the last five years. Japan made the finals
only once, in 1993, and the Italians are trying to reach their
first final.
</P>
<P>
Another three-day leg is to get started Friday in Chinese
Taipei, with the participation of Russia, the United States, South
Korea and the Netherlands.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The groundwater level in Haikou,
Hainan Province, which has been dropping in the past few years,
has returned to what it was in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"The rise indicates that the ecosystem of this island province
is improving," said Feng Tinghan, senior engineer and head of the
province's Geological Environment Monitoring Station.
</P>
<P>
Feng attributes the recovery to the province's effort to
upgrade its programs for water use, growing trees, and conserving
water resources.
</P>
<P>
Hainan became one of China's five special economic zones in
1988. Soon after, the once agriculture-oriented region has become
the country's largest construction site, flooded by industrial
projects and businesses.
</P>
<P>
It also plans to build some heavy industrial projects involving
natural gas, fertilizer, paper pulp, oil refining, and steel, to
bring in an estimated excess of 40 billion yuan in industrial
output by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The province has given equal priority to economic development
and environmental protection. It has adopted more than 20
regulations and policies concerning environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hainan closed 75 small factories that were polluters
to eliminate 5,600 tons of waste water, 18 million cubic meters of
waste gas, and 84 million tons of solid waste.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, more than 400 older enterprises were required to
treat their pollutants within three years, and faced shutdown if
they failed to do so.

To improve the environment, a 15-billion-yuan fertilizer
project, the largest of its kind in China, scheduled to be located
in the tourist city of Sanya will be built elsewhere. As a result
of the change, the investor had to spend more than a billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
"Economic losses can be measurable and affordable, but we
cannot estimate and make up for the sacrifices that a polluted
environment would bring," said an expert who participated in the
decision on relocating the factory.
</P>
<P>
And at least another three large projects each with 50 million
to 150 million yuan of investment have been canceled in Sanya due
to failure to meet environmental protection standards.
</P>
<P>
"Those measures are doing well to prevent the economically
booming province from being polluted," said Cheng Dongwei, a
government official in charge of environmental protection and
resources.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 years, the province has recovered more than
200,000 ha of tropical forests, and established 73 nature
reserves, covering 2.68 million ha. Consequently, local gibbons,
mangrove forests, and other rare species of plants and animals are
well-protected, and the forest coverage rate is more than 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
A non-governmental organization for environmental protection has
been formed, and in 76 primary and secondary schools, courses on
environmental protection are now offered.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Oldest Human Skeleton to Be Displayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A 20,000-year-old human skeleton,
the oldest found in Egypt, will be shown to the public for the
first time in October.
</P>
<P>
The skeleton will be exhibited at the new Nubia Museum that
will be inaugurated by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Aswan,
Upper Egypt, on October 11.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East News Agency today quoted Head of the museum's
Scientific Committee Ibrahim al-Nawawi as confirming that the
skeleton dates back to the stone age.
</P>
<P>
The skeleton was unearthed by a German excavation team in a
valley in the West Desert, northern Aswan in 1982.
</P>
<P>
It was unearthed headless and the parts found were only the
neck, the torso and the limbs. It had been sent to the U.S. for a
year where it underwent thorough studies and tests to define its
age, Nawawi said.
</P>
<P>
It will be displayed together with 2,000 other pieces of
antiquities selected from museums across the country to depict
Egypt's 5,000-year civilization, according to Nawawi.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: Supply of Medicine Far From Enough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today said the inadequate
supply of medicine under its oil-for-food deal with the United
Nations is the main reason for a complex health situation.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Health Minister Omed Medhat Mubarak said in a press
release that the medicine sent to Iraq during the first stage of
the deal stood less than 10 percent of the need.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal allowed Iraq to export 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil in six months for buying food and badly
needed medicines. The first stage of the deal went into effect
last December and on June 8 the U.N. Security Council agreed to
extend it for another six months.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has signed more than 550 contracts with foreign countries
for importing medicine and medical requirements in the first stage
of the oil-for-food deal which was signed in May last year,
according to Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
But he complained that only 84 percent of these contracts were
ratified by the U.N. and the arrivals of medicine were delayed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the incidence of several epidemic diseases,
including cholera and infantile paralysis has increased in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The environmental conditions are also deteriorating, making the
health situation more complexed, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The purification of potable water and elimination of chemical
wastes have become big problems in the country, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The 15-nation European Union
posted a slight positive growth as a whole as Eurostat, the EU's
statistics arm, today reported a 0.1-percent growth in the first
quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
The growth was compared to the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The small increase was attributed to a slight upward move on
the part of private consumption offset by the slowdown of the
gross fixed capital formation.
</P>
<P>
Available figures showed that only Britain, Spain and France
recorded a rise in the January-March period whereas Denmark,
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden all registered
negative growths.

On an annual basis, Eurostat reported, the EU's GDP rose 1.6
percent from the first quarter of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Waigel Calls for Tough Stand on Foreigner Inflows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 14 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
has called on the government to take a hard line in curbing the
massive inflows of foreigners which, he said, was one of the
reasons for Germany's ever-continuing high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"We must be firmer both in sending back illegal foreigners
living here, and limiting immigration where it is possible and
justified," Waigel said in an interview with the German
mass-circulation newspaper, Bild.
</P>
<P>
There should be a cap on immigration and the deportation of
rejected asylum-seekers should become a rule with no exceptions,
Waigel said in the interview published today.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the countries which refused to take back
their deported nationals should face cuts of development aid from
Bonn. He did not name these countries.
</P>
<P>
Waigel noted that Germany was suffering from the highest rate
of immigration in the world.
</P>
<P>
Germany's jobless rate hit a post-war record of 11.4 percent in
July, highlighting economic and political strains on Bonn only a
year ahead of the legislative election. A total of 4.354 million
people were unemployed last month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking as government and oppositions were juggling for
position in the run-up for next year's election campaign, Waigel
said immigration was a problem not only for the job market.
</P>
<P>
Bonn has so far failed to push through a sweeping tax reform
package while facing a sharp decline of the mark against the
U.S. dollar, and fears over Germany's ability to meet strict
criteria to qualify for a single European currency.

PARIS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A court in Paris today put on
trial a skinhead charged with murdering a Moroccan by pushing him
into the Seine River in central Paris in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
Michael Freminet, 21, was charged with murder by pushing Brahim
Bouarram, 29, into the river where he drowned.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place after the extreme-right National Front
held a demonstration in the area.
</P>
<P>
Freminet could face 30 years in jail under the criminal code of
France.
</P>
<P>
Three other people, who were with Freminet during the attack
but did not push Bouarram, were charged with "non-assistance to a
person in danger."
</P>
<P>
The attack was widely condemned in France and former President
Francois Mitterrand himself threw a spray of flowers into the
Seine River where Bouarram was drowned.

cases and have arrested 41 people in the first seven months of

GUANGZHOU, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The import and export volume

Exports from the province's Maoming and Qingyuan cities

<HEADLINE> U.S. Involvement in Somalia Met with Varied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The political status in
Mogadishu, the Somali capital, has been struck by the U.S.
attitude towards the on-going reconciliation attempts.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to the five co-chairmen of the National
Salvation Council established in Ethiopia early this year, the
American Assistant Secretary of State, George E. Moose, said
America will watch with interest the progress towards Bossaso
conference to be held in November.
</P>
<P>
He said he will find it difficult to understand if any single
Somali leader remains unready to make the political compromises
necessary to achieve national reconciliation, the first step
toward the renaissance of Somali.
</P>
<P>
Moose added that his government endorses Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi's initiatives in the reconciliation efforts for Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Referring to this letter, the faction led by Hussein Mohamed
Aidid has strongly criticized the American stance in the Somali
politics.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Qanyare Afrah, the interior minister of Hussein
Aidid's government, said America should not be deceived by
Ethiopia who deliberately sides with the factions opposing his
government.
</P>
<P>
Qanyare said Ethiopia is not only partial in the Somali
politics but also occupies parts of Somalia's territory,
violating the territorial integrity of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
However, Qanyare said according to the agreement they signed
with Ali Mahdi Mohamed in Cairo in late May this year, his
government accepts a national reconciliation conference provided
that the criteria and its venue be agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
Qanyare said the letter by the Americans will not change
anything about their political position and will in no way go to
Bossaso for any meeting.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, the north Mogadishu faction led by Ali
Mahdi Mohamed has appreciated the American support in the
anticipated Bossaso meeting for the formation of a legitimate
Somali government.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Sheikh Ahmed Kadare, Information Secretary for Ali
Mahdi, said they welcome the first American involvement in the
Somali politics.
</P>
<P>
Kadare has called on U.S. to contribute a tangible support to
the forthcoming Bossaso meeting and appealed to the European
Union to take similar measures for the common good of the
Somalis.
</P>
<P>
On the streets of the Somali capital, both the politicians and
the ordinary people have been talking about the possible
consequences of the American position towards the current
political maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
The ordinary citizens have similarly been discussing the issue
in the tea-shops and business stalls following the BBC Somali
Service broadcast of the American letter in Somali language.
</P>
<P>
People have expressed mixed feelings about the current
political uncertainty and the message the letter conveyed.
</P>
<P>
They ruled out any military involvement by the Americans but
indicated fear against the use of African soldiers especially
Ethiopians once a military option is taken.

<P>
LANZHOU, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The second phase of work on a
jointly funded Sino-US power plant at Jingyuan in northwest
China's Gansu province has been completed and two generating units
with an installed capacity of 600,000 kilowatts are operating.
</P>
<P>
This helps ease the power shortages in northwest China, from
this area about 140 kilometers from the provincial capital of
Lanzhou, near the Jingyuan Coal Mine.
</P>
<P>
To ease the power crunch in the northwest network, the country
decided in 1993 to ask the US's Westinghouse Electric to jointly
fund the second-phase of construction.
</P>
<P>
The US company provided 30 percent of the 2.5 billion yuan
dollar cost.
</P>
<P>
The two new generating units are computerized. One is fully
operational and the other is undergoing trials.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Leader Declares Close Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian First Prime
Minister Ung Huot said here today that the top leaders of the
country will cooperate closely with each other to maintain
political stability and develop the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Ung Huot made the remarks at the Phnom Penh international
airport this afternoon after returning from Beijing where he and
his delegation met Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk who is under
medical treatment in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The delegation also included Cambodian Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen and Acting Head of State Chea Sim.
</P>
<P>
The delegation briefed Sihanouk on the latest situation in
Cambodia, Ung Huot said. He said the king showed satisfaction over
the restoration of law and order in the country.
</P>
<P>
"During the five-hour-long talks, Hun Sen, Chea Sim and I
promised to comply with the king's wish to cooperate with each
other closely," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said all Cambodian people need King Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
"We must adhere to the constitutional monarchy and fight
against anybody who seeks to overthrow such system," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the fate of the ousted former First Prime Minister Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, Hun Sen said that Ranariddh "must be brought to
trial as he violated the laws."
</P>
<P>
"It is meaningless for the ASEAN to persuade the Phnom Penh
government to hold informal talks with Ranariddh," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh was ousted after heavy fighting between troops loyal
to him and Hun Sen in early July. Ung Huot was then nominated by
Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC party as the new first prime
minister and his nomination was approved by the parliament and the
acting head of state, Chea Sim.
</P>
<P>
The top-level Cambodian delegation including Ung Huot, Hun Sen
and Chea Sim started its visit to China on Monday and met with
Chinese Premier Li Peng and Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen on Wednesday.

<P>
Song says that the violent movement of the sea and atmospheric
temperatures indicate that this year is probably the worst this
century.
</P>
<P>
When the "El Nino" happens, the number of tornados formed in
the western Pacific and those landing on China's mainland will
decrease than normal, and the date of the first tornado hitting
the mainland this year was August 2, one day earlier than the
previously recorded date of October 3, Zhao Zhenguo, researcher of
the National Climate Center, said.
</P>
<P>
"El Nino" is one of the most important factors affecting global
climate, causing frequent heavy rains and storms in central and
eastern parts of the Pacific, and droughts in the west of the
ocean," said Zhao.
</P>
<P>
"Under its influence, the distribution of precipitation on the
Chinese mainland during the summer and autumn will appear to have
an imbalance between the north and south, with the north getting
less rain and the south more than needed.
</P>
<P>
"El Nino" occurs once every two to seven years, the number of
its emergence has amounted to 13 since 1950, and they have come
more frequently since the beginning of the 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmer Uses Lawyers For Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Zhao Longyun, a 52-year-old
farmer in Ningbo, a port city in China's Zhejiang Province, ran
into contract problems with his hired hands, so he did something
new - he got some lawyers to represent him.
</P>
<P>
The farmer had made quite a lot of money after years of hard
work on his 53 mu of land (3.6 hectares) in Ningbo, but he was
having more contract disputes with hired hands and problems of
quality in the materials he used.
</P>
<P>
"Now I can sleep more soundly at night after I pasted a notice
on the wall about hiring two lawyers to represent me at the
beginning of the year. Its effects were quickly felt, and now no
one tries to find faults with me any more," Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
The old man's schooling had stopped after two years and he knew
nothing about the world of law, as was the case with millions of
Chinese farmers before him, but, he says, "I've learned what laws
mean from the lessons that life taught me."
</P>
<P>
Last year, when he was accused of being a thief who stole
neighbor's cotton, it cost him a lot of time and money to set the
matter straight. "It's quite tiresome and time-consuming to deal
with these problems by yourself. I had to delay my work to deal
with the case," he explains.
</P>
<P>
So, he turned to the law for help and hired the two lawyers, Li
Yuefei and Chen Shiyao, as consultants. They can sign contracts
and handle other daily affairs on his behalf, allowing him to
focus all his attention on his work and leave his troubles behind.
</P>
<P>
Now some of Zhao's neighbors have also been turning to lawyers
for help when they run into troubles.

NEW DELHI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Inder

its relations with Nepal and ruled out any review of these
friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
During question hour in the Upper House of Parliament here,
Gujral said that Nepal was a very good friend of India.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government would take up with Nepal the issue
of problems being faced by Indian teachers in educational

There are 68,489 Indian citizens in Nepal with a majority of
them engaged mainly in industry, trade, teaching and semi-skilled
jobs.
</P>
<P>
Turning to Indo-Sri Lankan ties, Gujral said that the
government had worked out certain details on the basis of which
the waters between India and Sri Lanka could be used by Indian
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi had expressed its concern at recent incidents of
violence against its fishermen in the waters between the two
countries, he said. Discussions had also been held with a Sri
Lankan government delegation during which the need for a mechanism
to prevent recurrence of such incidents was reiterated.

<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The "El Nino" phenomenon is
expected to be stronger by the end of the year, perhaps the
strongest in this century, Chinese environment watchers warn.
</P>
<P>
"El Nino" refers to a rapid rise in temperature in tropical
parts of the central and eastern Pacific Ocean, usually lasting
about one to two years, followed by severe flooding or droughts
the next year.
</P>
<P>
Although further research is needed to understand this process,
it can trigger abnormal tropical atmospheric conditions and result
in various natural calamities.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Marine Environmental Prediction Center,
this year's "El Nino" began in March and was formed in May.
</P>
<P>
"Its strength and formation were so rapid that they are
unusual," said Song Xuejia, deputy director of the Center.
</P>
<P>
Its strength is equal to one that occurred in 1982, the
strongest this century, and it is expected to grow stronger by the
end of this year, Song said.
</P>
<P>
Sea water temperature in the eastern Pacific, one of the most
important indicators, has been rising steadily from minus 0.2
degree Celsius in February to 2.7 degree Celsius in July.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Mutual Interests to Ensure Success of Jiang's US Visit By Liu Yunfei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The fact that China and the
United States are seeking common strategic interests will ensure
the success of Chinese President Jiang Zemin's state visit to US
this fall.
</P>
<P>
Four groups of prominent figures from the US political circle
have visited China for meetings with top Chinese leaders since the
beginning of August.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders and members of American delegations discussed
the forthcoming US visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
bilateral relations as well as various other issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States attach great importance to the
visit and are seeking shared strategic interests to ensure the
substantial success of the visit, the first US visit by a
Chinese head of state in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Recent US dignitaries visiting China include Assistant to the
US President for National Security Affairs Samuel Berger, who
came to prepare for Jiang's trip; President Pro Tempore of
the United States Senate Strom Thurmond; a delegation of the US
House of Representatives International Relations Committee led by
chairman Benjamin Gilman; and a delegation from US Center for
Democracy, jointly headed by chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs Craig
Thomas and center president Allen Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
Local observers noted successive visits by US political
figures, and the fact that the high-level reception granted to
each demonstrates the anticipation of both sides on expanding
stable, healthy and cooperative Sino-US ties into the 21st
century, and the landmark impact of Jiang's impending visit.
</P>
<P>
Observers say China and the United States should approach their
relationship from a strategic viewpoint and work diligently to
expand mutual understanding, enhance mutual trust, and narrow
differences to create a common future.
</P>
<P>
The year 1997 has witnessed steady improvements of Sino-US ties
and significantly increasing exchanges at different levels.
</P>
<P>
US Vice-President Al Gore and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright have visited China, in addition to trips by Speaker of
the US House of Representatives Newt Gingrich and dozens of other
congressmen.
</P>
<P>
Meetings between leaders from the two countries have in the
past and will undoubtably continue to inject new impetus into the
advancement of bilateral relations. The smooth development of
Sino-US relations since the second half of last year have laid a
sound foundation for the success of Jiang's visit.

<HEADLINE> Australia, ROK Streamline Nuclear Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Australia and the Republic of
Korea (ROK) have taken the first steps towards a new agreement
which facilitate transfer of Australian uranium to third countries
for purposes such as enrichment.
</P>
<P>
Australia and ROK officially exchanged diplomatic notes this
week, which will lead to a new agreement as soon as domestic
political requirements are satisfied, the Australian Associated
Press (AAP) today quoted the Australian Department of Foreign
Affairs and Trade (DFAT) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ROK is a major customer for Australian uranium, accounting
for an increasing share of exports, AAP said, but it did not go
into details.
</P>
<P>
The agreement relates to nuclear material before it is actually
placed in reactors, and is similar to agreements Australia has
with other uranium customers.
</P>
<P>
Such material often has to be processed in separate countries
at different stages of the nuclear fuel cycle, with Australia
agreeing to transfers for purposes such as conversion, enrichment
to less than 20 percent of uranium 235 and fuel fabrication.
</P>
<P>
"Until now requests by the ROK to retransfer to third countries
nuclear materials subject to the 1979 'Australia-ROK agreement
concerning the cooperation in peaceful uses of nuclear energy and
transfer of nuclear material' have required Australia's written
consent on a case by case basis," DEAT said.
</P>
<P>
"Under the new agreement such consent is expected in advance on
a generic basis for retransfers for specified purposes at the
front end of the nuclear fuel cycle."
</P>
<P>
DFAT said the agreement would not detract from
non-proliferation and security objectives and would preserve
Australia's right to approve retransfers and to designate
countries to which transfers could be made.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Decides Not to Defend Its Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JASKARTA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
announced here today that the Monetary Authority would float the
Indonesian rupiah by removing the spread of the rupiah exchange
rate.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Finance Minister Mar'ie Mohamad
said that the purpose of the move is to reduce the negative
affects on the rupiah caused by speculative activities. The
rupiah's value will be decided by the market.
</P>
<P>
In a swift reaction, the rupiah tumbled to a record low of
2,775 to the U.S. dollar this afternoon, reducing 112 points from
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time for the rupiah to breach the 2,700 level.
The currency Wednesday closed at 2,645 to the greenback after
hitting a record low of 2,682.
</P>
<P>
The new policy is suitable to the development in monetary
market in Southeast Asia, the minister said, adding that Malaysia
had earlier abandoned its original policy to defend its currency.
</P>
<P>
Experiences in the region indicated that the government
intervention has no obvious effects as "the regional factor" is
the main factor affecting the value of the rupiah, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, if it is necessary, the government would
exert its influence on the monetary market through indirect
financial and monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
To defend the rupiah fluctuation which began in mid-July, the
central bank has widened the spread of the rupiah exchange rate
from 8 percent to 12 percent. The government has also sold 1.5
billion U.S. dollars and raised overnight interest rate.

Observers note that the common and major interests of the two
powers have intensified rather than weakened despite major changes
in the international situation since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huaqiu, director of the State Council Foreign Affairs
Office, and Samuel Berger jointly expressed hope that the two
countries will maintain world peace and stability and avoid new
wars. They noted that both countries are interested in expanding
strategic dialogues and cooperation, and also expressed hope for
peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific Region, as well as
economic cooperation and development.
</P>
<P>
The two officials noted that the two countries are becoming
increasingly complementary in economic and trade development, and
that vast untapped potential exists for bilateral cooperation in
education, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The officials pointed to the fact that many Americans
understand the shared strategic interests between China and the
United States, and they agreed that the two countries need to
expand channels for dialogue, especially high-level dialogue.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with "Newsweek International", US
Ambassador to China James Sasser said the two countries share
numerous areas of strategic interest, including maintaining peace
and security in the Asia-Pacific Region, dealing firmly with
terrorism, and cooperating in environmental protection efforts.
</P>
<P>
Sasser also noted that the forthcoming summit "will establish a
strategic framework wherein the United States and China can relate
to each other in coming years".
</P>
<P>
China and the US already share a common understanding that
developing stable and sound bilateral relations is in the best
interests of people in the two countries, as well as people around
the world.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin's trip to the United States will not only
verify the restoration of high-level dialogues in the capital
cities of the two countries, but will signal that bilateral ties
have ushered in a new era of development.

<HEADLINE> Implementation of Scientific Progress Law Inspected (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A leading Chinese lawmaker
called today for greater efforts to step up the reform and
macro-controls to legally ensure scientific and technological
progress.
</P>
<P>
Fei Xiaotong, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), told a national conference on
the inspection of law enforcement that the entire nation
should enhance their sense of promoting scientific progress in
accordance with law.
</P>
<P>
In mid-August, the NPC Standing Committee will send three
groups on a ten-day fact-finding tour to inspect the legal
enforcement of scientific and technological progress in Shandong,
Liaoning, Sichuan, Jiangxi and Fujian provinces.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the standing committees of local people's congress
in provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities throughout the
nation will undertake internal inspections.
</P>
<P>
Inspection will focus on the reform of related systems and
inputs in scientific progress. This round of inspections will be
the fourth large-scale inspection tours the NPC Standing Committee
has organized since the beginning of this year. The previous three
inspection tours covered law enforcement in the forestry, food
hygiene and product quality sectors.
</P>
<P>
Fei noted that China has recorded great achievements in
scientific and technological progress since the promulgation of
the Law on Scientific and Technological Progress in July,
1993. Some 20 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities
have adopted their own rules and regulations for the
implementation of the Law, he said.

<P>
A recent report by the State Science and Technology
Commission shows that promulgation of the Law on Scientific and
Technological Progress has enabled China to introduce successful
and effective practices in advancing its scientific and
technological system reform in conjunction with economic
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The technology market has emerged as an important market for
essential production factors, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The number of technological contracts for 1996 reached 220,000,
with the total turnover of 30 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Some 600 research institutes now serve as major technological
developers for enterprises, while another 500 institutions have
joined some form of cooperation with enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The industrial output value of the country's 52 national-level
development zones for hi-tech industries hit 210 billion yuan in
1996. The zones earned 2.9 billion US dollars in foreign
exchange from exports and generated 17.6 billion yuan in profits
and taxes.
</P>
<P>
The over 50,000 hi-tech non-state-run enterprises established
as a result of the reform have developed into a major force in the
country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
The report points out that technological development in
agriculture, animal husbandry and fisheries contributed greatly to
this year's good grain harvest and increased meat production last
year.
</P>
<P>
It indicates that China has recorded remarkable progress in
basic scientific research and hi-tech development.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, China became the first country in the world to draft
the national-level 21st Century Agenda, a document which has since
gained worldwide cooperation and drawn the attention of the
governments at all levels and Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The report notes that the country's expenditures in scientific
and technological research and development have increased on an
annual basis, but still fall short of the high rate of economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The country spent a total of 116.6 billion yuan on scientific
and technological development in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Top Palestinian Legislator on Peace Talks With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A top Palestinian legislator said
today that the Palestinians have no objection to entering talks
with Israel on a final peace deal if the interim peace accords are
carried out simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians are not against final-settlement talks but
the final status talks must run parallel to the implementation of
all agreements reached during the transitional period,"
legislative Palestinian Council (PC) Speaker Ahmed Queria told the
Egyptian Voice of Arabs radio.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian problem must be dealt with and solved as a
whole package. Otherwise the conflict would never be settled," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have agreed to resume security coordination
with Israel with the help of the United States, Queria said,
hoping that in return "Israel and the U.S. would respond to the
Palestinian demands."
</P>
<P>
Queria made the statement as U.S. Mideast Coordinator Dennis
Ross wound up his four-day shuttle trip to Israel and the
Palestinian National Authority, bringing what he called "a new
beginning" in restoring security cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
His mission will pave way for the visit to the region by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who is expected to
take a major initiative that reportedly would address some kind of
freeze of Israeli settlement expansion and an acceleration of
talks on a final peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
Queria told the Arabic radio that the Palestinians discussed
with Ross the reasons that led to the present tension in the peace
process, atop of which "Israel's disrespect of agreements and the
continuation of Jewish settlement activities."
</P>
<P>
He said that Ross heard the Palestinian viewpoint and told the
Palestinians that his mission is only limited to restoring
confidence and resuming security coordination between the Israelis
and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Queria expressed the hope that Albright's upcoming tour would
reassert the principle of trading land for peace and the return of
Palestinian rights.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks and security coordination between Israel and the
PNA stopped in March when Israel began to build a housing project
for Jews in East Jerusalem. Resumption of the talks were disrupted
again as two bombing attacks hit Jerusalem on July 30, killing 15
people and wounding 170 others.

<HEADLINE> Food Expo '97 Opens in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Food Expo '97, an event
featuring mouthwatering delicacies from all over the world, was
kicked off today in Hong Kong, a metropolitan renowned for varied
cuisine.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of Food Expo '97, Mrs. Lessie
Wei, director of agriculture and fisheries, said that Food Expo is
possibly the most important annual event in Hong Kong for the food
industry.
</P>
<P>
"The event has been successfully held for a number of years,
attracting a large number of exhibitors and visitors, both local
and overseas," she said.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC),
Food Expo '97 is running at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center through August 18.
</P>
<P>
This year the food exposition attracts more than 170 local and
overseas companies to present an extensive array of products from
traditional and regional delicacies, specialty drinks to kitchen
utensils.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the "Snack Parade" has been specially set
up to let consumers know more about different kinds of snacks
through exciting games including "Guessing Game" and "Snack Smart
Quiz".
</P>
<P>
With a population of 6.3 million, Hong Kong is certainly a big
market for food products. Last year, Hong Kong's imports of food
and beverages reached 58 billion HK dollars (7.4 billion US
dollars), a four-percent rise over 1995, according to TDC
Executive Director Michael Sze, who was also speaking at the
ceremony.
</P>

"World-renowned for fine cuisine, Hong Kong is backed up by a
strong catering industry. With one eating place for about every
650 people, Hong Kong may well have the world's highest ratio of
restaurants and cafes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's processed food and beverages industry has continued
 to flourish, with last year's total exports amounting at 26.2
billion HK dollars (3.4 billion US dollars), up 9 percent over
1995. Major markets include the Chinese mainland, Japan and the
United States.

LUANDA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Minister for Women
Affairs Joana Lina has urged women in the country to be united
and fight for dignity and social equality.
</P>
<P>
She made the appeal on Wednesday evening at the closing
ceremony of a seminar on violence against women in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The seminar with the theme of "Contribute to Family Unity and

bad phenomenon completely.
</P>

Affairs, the participants from all over the country and some
foreign diplomats discussed the seriousness of violence against
women, its consequences and measures to be taken to cope with the

factor in ridding of violence against women, proposing that
anti-violence courses should be added to education programs in
schools.
</P>
<P>
They also suggested that procuratorates for women should be
established to deal with cases of violence against women and laws
for the protection of women should also be issued.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Pakistan Celebrates Independence Day with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan today celebrated the
50th anniversary of its independence with a renewed pledge to
enter the 21st century as a progressive, democratic and
self-reliant country.
</P>
<P>
The 50th birthday of Pakistan, dawned with the booming of
31-gun salute in the federal capital, has witnessed an unusual
enthusiasm among the people for the golden jubilee celebrations.
</P>
<P>
About 15,000 of people of all age group, wearing bright and
glittering dresses and raising the national flags high over their
heads, jampacked a grand square in front of the Parliament House
where Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif hoisted at 8 a.m. the crescent
and star flag at a colorful special ceremony marking the
historical moment.
</P>
<P>
As hundreds of multi-colored balloons were released to the
bright blue sky, ministers, chiefs of all services, senior civil
and military officials joined the Prime Minister in singing the
national anthem accompanied by a band of children in national
ceremonial dress.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, sirens blared throughout the country and the elite
gathered outside the parliament building as the nation observed
one-minute's silence at 7.59 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Making his second speech of the day after heralding the golden
jubilee with a midnight televised address, Sharif envisioned a
"glorious future" for the nation of about 140 million people,
which was founded on August 14, 1947.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan will enter the 21st century with the determination to
become a "great nation which should serve as an inspiring model
for other nations", Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
"Gone are the days of despondency and despair," he declared,
adding now the economy of the country is showing sign of revival
as there is political stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We want to make a modern Islamic welfare state on scientific
lines which should be free of exploitation and based on tolerance,
justice and forbearance."
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister invited the talented youth of the country to
come forward and take part in nation building.
</P>
<P>
"I invite my youth, hope for the entire nation, to contribute
their energies to make Pakistan a developed country free of
ignorance, disease and backwardness," he said.
</P>
<P>
The usually tranquil Islamabad was pleasantly noisy today. All
the public and private buildings in the federal capital were
decorated with spectacular lights and buntings. Long queues of
cars and traffic jams became frequent.
</P>
<P>
Most drivers played the national songs at full volume in their
cars while children and youngsters, some of them riding tops of
the cars, shouted patriotic slogans. These indeed created a
somewhat sensational scene.
</P>
<P>
"This is a historical moment of promise and hope for the people
of Pakistan," said a senior government official when asked what he
was thinking at Today's special occasion. "It is indeed pretty
encouraging to see the national spirit so high."
</P>
<P>
"It was evident that despite all the hardships and financial
constraints faced by the common people, they still have strong
confidence in the country's future," said the middle-aged
official.
</P>
<P>
"Today is the day of jubilation and it also demands
reflection," he said. "The government should work earnestly with
the hardworking people to make the country strong and prosperous."

<HEADLINE> Golden Summer for Egyptian Gold Lovers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A drop in world gold prices this
year means that consumers no longer need to be born with a silver
spoon in their mouths to make a purchase, the Egyptian newspaper
Al Ahram reported today.
</P>
<P>
Egyptians and Arabs, whose rising demand for gold during the
summer traditionally drives up the price of the metal, look set to
a good bargain this season as gold prices dropped to their lowest
levels in years, according to the English weekly.
</P>
<P>
The price of one gram of 18 carat gold stood at roughly 34
Egyptian pounds (10 U.S. dollars) last year, but dropped to 27
pounds (7.9 dollars) by this summer.
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason behind the decline in prices on the Egyptian
gold market is a 20 percent tariff cut on gold bullion which came
into effect earlier this year, according to a jeweller.
</P>
<P>
The drop in gold prices in Egypt is also linked to the
declining price of gold on the international market, where the
cost of gold has fallen to its lowest level in 12 years, reaching
315 dollars per ounce on the London precious metals exchange.
</P>
<P>
Similar cuts in prices have also been registered on the Arab
markets, with a kilogram of 24 carat gold in Saudi Arabia, for
example, now selling for 38,000 riyals (10,059 dollars) compared
with 48,000 riyals (12,706 dollars) the same time last year.
</P>
<P>
Further fueling this decrease in global prices is the fact that
businessmen and investors have turned to dollar deposits instead
of gold, according to Sultan Abu Ali, a former Saudi minister of
economy.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever the interest on dollar deposits increases, the price
of gold decreases," he noted.
</P>
<P>
An increase in the supply of gold on the international market,
with a number of countries such as Germany, Russia and Australia
selling a sizable chunk of their gold stock for a variety of
reasons, has also helped drive down prices.

<HEADLINE> Kanu to Play Against Guinea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian star and African
footballer of 1996, Nwankwo Kanu has accepted the invitation to
play in Sunday's World Cup qualifier against Guinea, local media
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Responding to calls from the Nigeria Football Association, the
Inter Milan player reportedly told Italian media Tuesday, "I'm
sure I'm going to play".
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old player led the Nigerian team to last year's
Atlanta Olympic Games and won the first Olympic gold medal for
Africa.
</P>
<P>
After a successful operation in the United States to correct
his faulty heart earlier this year, Kanu appeared shortly in
Italy's soccer league recently.
</P>
<P>
It seems, however, he will have a long way to go before he can
fully resume his career, as Inter-Milan doctors have reportedly
given him only a three-month permit to play, pending further
examinations.
</P>
<P>
His club teammate, defender Taribo West is also set for the
match against Guinea, which is actually only a formality, as
Nigeria has already snatched the ticket to France 1998 World Cup.

<P>
MANILA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
inaugurated here today an ASEAN village to mark the 30th founding
anniversary of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
A highlight of the week-long celebration of the ASEAN's 30th
birthday, the village is a garden with miniature structures
representing each of the nine ASEAN member countries, including
Laos and Myanmar which were admitted to the grouping last month.
</P>
<P>
A portion of the garden is devoted to honoring the five
founding fathers of the ASEAN through five bronze busts, one of
which was the late father of President Ramos.
</P>
<P>
The village also features two memorial plaques of the 1967
Bangkok Declaration which gave birth to the ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN was founded on August 8, 1967 with five original
members -- Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand. Brunei, the sixth member, joined the ASEAN in 1984 and
Vietnam, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos said in his inauguration address that as the
ASEAN moves into the next century, it faces the daunting task of
sustaining its dynamism and maintaining its good record.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The new Director of the Xinhua
News Agency Hong Kong Branch, Jiang Enzhu, called on Chief
Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
Tung Chee Hwa this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from their hour-long meeting at the Chief Executive's
Office, Jiang told reporters that he and Tung had a "very good
conversation".
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the two made "cordial and friendly exchanges"
at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Tung told Jiang that Xinhua has done a lot
in the past decades to promote the link between Hong Kong people
and the mainland as well as to enhance local people's
understanding of the motherland, particularly since Hong Kong
moved into the transition period. Xinhua has played an important
role and made significant contributions to Hong Kong's stability,
prosperity and smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
"With the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR, Hong Kong has
entered a new era in history. There is still much to be done to
foster the link between the people of Hong Kong and their mainland
counterparts, and to enhance mutual trust and understanding," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Enzhu, who arrived in Hong Kong on August 6 to replace
Zhou Nan, said at the meeting since the establishment of the Hong
Kong SAR more than a month ago, the SAR government led by the
Chief Executive has been making steady progress in various
aspects.
</P>
<P>
With a stable society and a thriving economy, people are fully
confident in Hong Kong's future, he said. He also wished the SAR
continued success.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Hong Kong is practicing "one country, two systems",
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and "a high degree of
autonomy", Jiang said that the Xinhua Hong Kong Branch will not
interfere with matters which fall in the domain of the high degree
of autonomy of the SAR government, but will cooperate with the SAR
government and support its work.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Xinhua will maintain extensive contacts with
people in various walks of life in Hong Kong and continue its
efforts to enhance communication and interflow between the Hong
Kong SAR and other parts of the motherland so as to maintain the
long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> HK Economy Continues to Grow: Hang Seng Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's economy is
expected to attain GDP growth of 5.4 percent in 1997 due to
sustained growth in consumer and investment spending, according to
the latest Hang Seng Economic Monthly issued by Hang Seng Bank,
one of the major of its kind in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the expanding economy, Hang Seng Bank revised
downward its inflation rate projection for the year, from 7 to 6.5
percent, as a result of the drop in import prices helped by the
strong dollar.
</P>
<P>
But the report cautioned that domestically-generated price
pressures are expected to pick up in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
It said that in light of the economic recovery in Hong Kong's
major export markets, export growth is expected to rebound mildly
in the second half of the year. The forecast for total export
growth in 1997 was lowered from 9.7 to 4.6 percent due to the
lackluster export performance in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The report also predicts that the surge in the transshipment of
goods arranged by Hong Kong traders will continue, leading to
continued strong demand for trade-support services such as
banking, finance and shipping.
</P>
<P>
The report also forecast that building activities in Hong Kong
would continue to accelerate, reflecting both private and public
sector efforts to boost flat supply.
</P>
<P>
Investment in plant and machinery is also projected to maintain
steady growth, it said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Elephant Population at 4,000-4,500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The latest census taken by the
Wildlife Conservation Department shows that the present elephant
population of Sri Lanka is from 4,000 to 4,500, according to the
department sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that an earlier survey conducted on an
improper basis had inaccurately estimated the elephant population
at 2,500-3,000.
</P>
<P>
However, the latest census conducted on a scientific basis
including the internationally accepted "dung count" and personal
data gathered from field interviews with villagers in
elephant-populated areas, shows that in fact there are 4,000 to
4,500 elephants in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
They also revealed that elephant corridors are being
established connecting the country' national parks at
Lunugamwehera, Uduwalwe and Yala in the south up to Kumana and
Lahugalle in the east of the country.
</P>
<P>
These corridors will be officially declared elephant corridors
and protected areas by the government.
</P>
<P>
The big advantage here is that elephants can move from one
protected area to another particularly in times of drought in
their usual habitat, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
There were over 10,000 elephants at the start of this century
in Sri Lanka. However, about 60 to 70 elephants are killed every
year by predators who go for tusks and by farmers defending their
crops.

<HEADLINE> German Finance Minister Repeats Call For Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 14 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
has shrugged off a rejection from Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
repeated a call for a German cabinet reshuffle soon.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German newspaper Bild, Waigel said a
shake-up would strengthen Kohl's 17-member cabinet and improve his
chances to win the next general elections due in September next
year.
</P>
<P>
Waigel also rejected speculations that by proposing a cabinet
reshuffle, he was actually seeking Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel's
job. "I enjoy my job," he said.
</P>
<P>
Suggesting that some ministers did want to leave but were just
trying to hang on to their jobs until the election, Waigel urged
Kohl to drop them now for the benefit of the whole ruling
coalition.
</P>
<P>
A similar call was made by Waigel in an interview with the
German news magazine Der Spiegel during the weekend. But Kohl, who
is now on vacation in Austria, was quoted by a government
spokesman as saying on Monday that a cabinet reshuffle was not
necessary at the moment.
</P>
<P>
In view that the government's tax reform plan has been foiled
by the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the
economy is growing too slowly to bring down Germany's record
unemployment, analysts said that a shake-up in Kohl's cabinet was
overdue and could help reverse the government's steep slide in
opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
A columnist of the Welt newspaper even questioned whether Kohl
himself had instructed Waigel to speak out.
</P>
<P>
According to an Allensbach Institute poll published Wednesday,
Kohl's party continued to trail the SPD in popularity.
</P>
<P>
His Christian Democratic Union (CDU), along with its Bavarian
sister party Christian Social Union (CSU) chaired by Waigel, would
win just 33.4 percent of the vote if elections were held next
Sunday, the poll said. The SPD meanwhile would win 37.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, in office since 1982, has announced his plan to run for
an unprecedented fifth term. The SPD says it will not choose its
challenger to Kohl until early next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria, a military power in west
Africa, is to re-appraise its air defense system in a bid to map
out strategies for its sustainable growth and development.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chief of Air Staff, Air Vice Marshall Nsikak
Eduok, the Air Force needs to be re-appraised and streamlined
because of the changes in the world's strategic environment.
</P>
<P>
The move is underlined by the imperative of a comprehensive
national air defense system, which the Nigerian Air Force has not
been given the prominence it deserved, senior Air Force officers
said.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions imposed by western countries in the past several
years have brought problems to Nigeria's armed forces, which are
suffering from short supplies of spare parts of weapons and
shunned from sophisticated military equipment.
</P>
<P>
The military government has to turn to the East for
assistance. The Chief of Defense Staff, Major-General Abdulsalam
Abubakar, has just concluded a 17-day visit to China and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea to seek military
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
This was the highest ranking military officer of Nigeria to

<HEADLINE> Belgian Biplane Crash Caused by Human Error: Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Belgian aviation authorities
have attributed to human error the July 26 acrobatics plane crash
at Ostend, the Free Belgium daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Transportation Minister Michel Daerden as
saying that the crash, which killed 10 people and injured 56
others, was not caused by technical failure.
</P>
<P>
The minister pronounced Wednesday the preliminary results of an
investigation by aviation specialists along with designers and
manufacturers of the German-made Falcon XT300 biplane.
</P>
<P>
The specialists concluded after analyzing video recordings of
the lethal flight that the plane was at a height of only 10 to 15
meters from the ground after the pilot, Captain Amr Hani Bilal of
the Jordanian Royal Falcon Squadron, did almost a vertical drive
following his last of a series of loops.
</P>
<P>
It was impossible to pull up the plane again at such a height.
</P>
<P>
The plane then crashed onto a first-aid tent at the edge of the
spectator area, spraying debris and burning kerosene on to
spectators.
</P>
<P>
The crash was the first fatal accident of the Ostend air show,
which has been held five times.
</P>
<P>
Belgian aviation and military authorities have called off all
ensuing acrobatic flights scheduled for the next few months
pending the conclusive results of the investigation.

BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- China's financial sector has
witnessed continuing stability this year, and the central bank
will adhere to the moderately tight monetary policy to help
facilitate sustained, rapid and healthy national economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, the

financial risks, and supporting economic structural adjustments,"
Dai said.
</P>
<P>
China's money supply has increased appropriately this year,
according to the central bank governor.
</P>
<P>
He noted that broad money (M2), the combination of cash in
circulation and all types of deposits, rose by 34.4 percent in
1994 and 25.3 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the value of M2 approached 8,345 billion yuan (about
1,000 billion US dollars) at the end of July, a year-on-year rise
of 18.1 percent and a 7.2 percentage point drop on ending figures
for last year.
</P>
<P>
The value of narrow money (M1), the combination of cash in
circulation plus the demand deposits of enterprises, grew to 3,110
billion yuan by the end of last month, up 18.4 percent on July
1996 figures and equal to levels at the end of last year.
</P>

<P>
Dai said that increased lending has basically met this year's
requirements for China's continued economic development.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding loan balance for all financial institutions
reached 6,870 billion yuan by the end of July, up 450.3 billion
yuan from the beginning of this year. However, actual growth fell
by 15.6 billion yuan on last year's same period, according to Dai.
</P>
<P>
Of the total lending, 287.8 billion yuan was loaned by the
state-owned banks, 24.6 billion yuan less than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Combined deposits for all financial institutions totaled 7,610
billion yuan by the end of July, with enterprise deposits rising
by 26.6 percent on the previous year's period to 2,573.3 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The marked growth in enterprise deposits indicates the
strengthened overall payment capability of enterprises, said Dai.
</P>
<P>
He added that other signs of financial stability center on the
fact that the central bank has appropriately controlled base
money, and money market transaction has remained steady throughout
the year.
</P>
<P>
The value of base money, a major indicator of the money supply,
reached 2,750 billion yuan by the end of July, a year-on-year rise
of 18.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Dai noted that increased foreign exchange holdings resulted in
an additional 175.4 billion yuan of liquidity by the end of July,
a substantial 33.5 billion yuan rise on the same 1996 period.
</P>
<P>
The central bank recalled 107 billion yuan in loans from
financial institutions during the first seven months of the year,
up 63.7 billion yuan on the same 1996 period.
</P>
<P>
Dai told reporters that the ratio of standby liquidity of
commercial banks was 7.7 percent at the end of July, a rate he
said indicates a sufficient payment capability of banks.

<P>
China's foreign exchange reserves continued to expand during
the first seven months, reaching 126 billion US dollars by the end
of July, up 21 billion US dollars from the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate for Chinese currency, the Renminbi (RMB)
yuan, has largely remained stable at 8.29 against the US dollar
this year.
</P>
<P>
"The real exchange rate of the RMB has experienced a certain
range of appreciation due to the country's falling prices," said
Dai.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that China's financial sector continues to face
various problems and difficulties.
</P>
<P>
State banks must still deal with problems related to increasing
overdue loans and decreasing interest collections which have
resulted from the excessively high debt ratios of the state-owned
enterprises (SOE) and the increasing losses suffered by some SOEs,
as well as poor bank management, Dai noted.
</P>
<P>
Wholly state-owned banks had an unrealized interest rate income
of 143.1 billion yuan due on overdue loans by the end of June, up
24.6 billion yuan on the beginning of this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that idle production capacity can be attributed to the
inability of outdated industrial and product structures and the
inability of older enterprises to adapt to the market demand
changes in the course of economic restructuring, as well as to
redundant construction in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it will be impossible to solve related problems
by relaxing overall economic controls and stressed that related
efforts must focus on deepening enterprise reform and accelerating
the pace of economic restructuring.

Liberation from Japanese rule in 1945, the Justice Ministry
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners have already taken two-month training and

</P>
<P>
Among those to be released Friday are nine lifetimers and 35
serving sentences of 10 years or longer.

Dai said the central bank will continue to adhere to a
moderately tight monetary policy and will make appropriate
fine-tunings of macro control.
</P>
<P>
Growth in lending must be reasonably checked and state banks
must strictly control their loan portfolios and effectively
improve cash management, said Dai.
</P>
<P>
In economic restructuring, appropriate loans can be made to
facilitate selected efficient capital construction projects
capable of guaranteeing both principal and interest payments,
according to Dai.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that provisions for bad loans in state-owned
banks should be managed in accordance with relevant rules and
regulations in order to support efforts such as enterprise
mergers, bankruptcies and the reemployment of redundant workers.
</P>
<P>
Dai stressed the need to timely review and improve the credit
policy. While focusing support on state-owned enterprises,
commercial banks should make every effort to reasonably satisfy
the requirements of credit needs of enterprises with different
types of ownership, he said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will introduce various measures to prevent and
mitigate the effects of financial risks and create a favorable
financial environment for smoothly implementing monetary and
credit policies, he said, adding that related measures will
include further intensifying supervision and regulation over
financial institutions; banning illegal financial institutions and
activities; seriously investigating and punishing those
responsible for violations of laws and regulations; and preventing
and cracking down on financial crime.

<HEADLINE> Citibank Expands Operation in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Citibank N.A. of the U.S. has
expanded its operation in Nigeria by opening a branch in the
capital Abuja and raising its share in a local joint venture
bank, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
As a result of an investment of 15.6 million U.S. Dollars,
Citibank increased its share in the Nigerian International Bank
from 40 to 75 percent. The bank was thus renamed Citibank Nigeria
on Tuesday, the report revealed.
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony marking the two cases on Tuesday in Abuja, the
Citibank's African Division head Anjum Ikbal said his bank has
become more "enthusiastic about Nigeria because its macro-economy
is better."
</P>
<P>
Besides in Nigeria, he said, slow but steady growth is being
witnessed all over Africa, as countries on the continent have
settled down to improve their economies and the lot of their
people.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that African countries are now doing more
business with one another and that there is a tremendous future
for intra-African trade.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Abuja branch is Citibank's 15th in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Citibank first came to Nigeria in 1975 but was forced to
divest from the west Africa country in 1979 as a result of the
indigenization decree.
</P>
<P>
It returned in 1984 with a 40 percent stake in the Nigerian
International Bank, which is among the 10 best banks in Nigeria.

PARIS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Eight people were killed and 24 wounded when a bus crashed
with a truck in Landes, southwestern France. All the victims were
members of a Portuguese folk song band on their way back to
Portugal from Belgium.
</P>
<P>
-- After three years of fleeing and extremely weak, the last
group of some 2,500 Rwandan Hutu refugees in former Zaire are
waiting to be repatriated to Rwanda. Many of them are dying of
weakness and diseases despite the efforts by non-governmental
organizations to help them.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- From now on until 2020, the population of southern France,
mainly Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur, Rhone-Alpes and the Corsica,
will increase while the population in the north, east and central
parts of the country will decrease, says a Direction of Population
and Migration study. The Paris region will also see its population
increasing during that period.
</P>
<P>
-- French automakers benefited from the strong U.S. dollar in
the past year as it helped them in increasing exports. Three big
brands of French cars, Renault, PSA and Michelin, have all seen a
6.3-10 percent increase in sales. The major markets are Britain,
Spain and Italy, whose currencies stood firm against the dollar.

<HEADLINE> Food Situation Remains Tight in East Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Food supply is still very tight
and food prices remain high in the east African region following
the drought hitting the sub-region at the beginning of this year,
a U.N. report has said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) issued the
report at a press conference held here on Wednesday, saying that
the impact of the drought affecting most of east African
countries was still being felt in all the affected countries.
</P>
<P>
The report of "Food Supply Situation and Crop Prospects in
Sub-Saharan Africa" said that the overall food supply situation
in Kenya remained tight with food prices sharply increased.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the areas planted to maize, the staple food for
Kenyans, had fallen short of the target in spite of the
prevailing high prices of maize.
</P>
<P>
The late rains during the long rain season resulted in delayed
planting of maize, it said, adding that the maize output in the
country was estimated above last year's below-normal crop, but
lower than the bumper crop of 1994.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda, the report pointed out, the food supply situation
has tightened with prices of beans and maize doubling during the
past year.
</P>
<P>
The situation is particularly difficult in the eastern and
northeastern districts which were affected by drought and floods
while insecurity in northern districts is hampering food
production and distribution, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The food supply situation is still tight in the
drought-affected areas of north, northeast and the coast area of
Tanzania, said the report, adding that these areas appear to be
headed for another poor harvest this year.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the report stated, the 1996/97 cereal production of
Tanzania is forecast to decline by some 18 percent compared with
last year.
</P>
<P>
In Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan, the outcome of the
main season crops is uncertain as much depends on weather
developments until harvesting in November and December.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Launched on Illegal Direct Selling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration for
Industry and Commerce (SAIC), the watchdog of the government
market, today announced it has launched a national crackdown on
illegal direct selling.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the campaign, to be carried out in August and
September, is to combat the numerous forms of unlawful activities
now running rampant in the country, according to Gan Guoping,
deputy-director-general of SAIC.
</P>
<P>
SAIC has concluded that some companies during their employee
training process have used false advertising to lure people into
direct selling schemes, propagating superstition, involvement in
underworld gangs, and heresy.
</P>
<P>
Other activities include the selling of fake or substandard
products, smuggling commodities or those products prohibited by
State law to be sold, cheating, and making excessively high profit
from direct selling.
</P>
<P>
Government employees, military personnel, full-time students
and other people as named in relevant laws are also prohibited
from engaging in direct marketing sales.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will also clamp down on authorized direct selling
enterprises that are engaged in cross-regional activities or
trading commodities out of their scope of business and
single-level direct selling businesses involved in tiered selling.
</P>
<P>
According to Gan, SAIC branches across the country in the first
half of this year revoked the license of over 200 illegal direct
selling enterprises, dealt with over 1,100 illegal cases, seized
commodities worth over 40 million yuan (4.82 million US dollars),
and collected fines amounting to over 12.6 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
"Due to immature market conditions, direct selling is being
developed in a restricted and controlled manner," Gan said.
</P>
<P>
SAIC has approved 40 enterprises throughout the country for
multi-level direct selling, including 17 overseas-funded
enterprises now being re-examined by the SAIC, since their
operation qualification was due in April.
</P>
<P>
The organization also will review the qualifications of the
enterprises involved in single-level direct selling.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim said today more local institutional
participation would contribute towards reducing excessive
volatility" in the Kuala Lumpur stock Exchange (KLSE).
</P>
<P>
He stressed that more local institutional participation in the
KLSE would balance off a twin problem in the market: volatility
and sudden changes in market direction.
</P>
<P>
"This is not to say that we do not want retail investors in the
market, but there is a need to balance the current proportion
where the market is more retail-based," he said at the Third
Malaysia Capital Growth Opportunities Exposition here today.
</P>
<P>
Local institutional participation could reduce the dominance
foreign funds had in swaying the market to events which were not
directly related to the domestic capital market or economic
conditions, said Anwar, who is also finance minister.
</P>
<P>
"As the capital market in this region grows in tandem with
economic growth, it has to be ensured that the Malaysian market
stands out as a competitive and efficient capital market in this
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
On average, about two-thirds of KLSE's daily trade is retail,
the individual players buying and selling. Institution trade
refers generally to large amounts of shares traded by fund
management companies, foreign and local.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Vows to Build Its Own Defense Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is making efforts to
develop its own defense industry, in a bid to meet strategic
needs of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Daily News today quoted reliable defense
sources, whose names were not given, as saying that Turkey should
give priority to domestic defense industry and make the country
capable of selling weapons abroad.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Turkey would lag behind in the next
century's rapidly-growing defense sector unless it speeds up its
efforts in this respect.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Turkey, as a regional
military power, has to import nearly 80 percent of its arms from
Western countries to meet the demands of the Turkish Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
Defense experts hold that Turkey should raise the proportion
of the home-made weapons in its military equipment by expanding
financial input for the domestic defense industry.
</P>
<P>
This could prevent Turkey, which owns the second largest force
in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), from making
concessions in case an arms embargo is imposed on it, the experts
said.
</P>
<P>
Ankara was greatly angered when the United States suspended
last year the delivery of three frigates ordered by the Turkish
Navy, under strong pressure from anti-Turkish lobbies.
</P>
<P>
Recently the Clinton administration has given signals that it
is willing to go ahead with the deal.

service sectors accounting for 73.6 percent of total rural supply
and demand. The two sectors currently employ more than 130 million
redundant rural laborers, or nearly 50 percent more than in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The SSB report also noted that another eight million members of
the rural labor forces are moving to non-agricultural regions.
</P>
<P>
Booming economic growth has led to marked improvements in the

overall quality of the rural population, promoting agricultural
mechanization and building rural communities.

<HEADLINE> Civil Service System Established in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- China has basically established
its own civil service system within a short four years, Chinese
vice-minister of personnel Zhang Xuezhong said here today.
</P>
<P>
The idea of setting up an efficient civil service system was
first put forth by Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who is also
General-Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China (CPC), in his report to the 14th CPC National Congress in
1992.
</P>
<P>
On August 14 of the following year, Premier Li Peng signed an
order to enact the "Temporary Regulations on Civil Servants."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here today marking the fourth anniversary
of the promulgation of the temporary regulations, Zhang said that
the civil service system has to date been adopted in all
departments of the State Council, China's central government, and
most local governments at the provincial and prefectural levels.
</P>
<P>
"Transitional work in governments at the county and township
levels is expected to be largely accomplished by the end of this
year," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in recent years, an open and fair recruiting
system, a competitive and vigorous management mechanism, and a
complete and strict legal supervisory system have been gradually
taking shape in China's civil service.
</P>
<P>
The civil service system China is now promoting nationwide
includes a series of specific sub-systems, such as categorization
of posts, recruiting through open exams, annual performance
examination, exchange of posts, withdrawal, and dismissal of
incompetent officials.
</P>
<P>
"Most of these systems have been practiced in most parts of the
country," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that since 1994, the central government
departments have for three consecutive years recruited new civil
servants through open exams, and governments of 28 provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions across the country have
followed suit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, almost all personnel in China's administrative
bodies at all levels have in recent years undergone performance
reviews, and some 52,000 civil servants exchanged jobs in 1996
alone.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some 5,500 civil servants across the country have
been dismissed for incompetence or other problems during the past
four years, and another 16,000 have been allowed to quit.
</P>
<P>
"We have worked out 36 specific regulations and detailed
stipulations to manage the civil service contingent in accordance
with the temporal regulations," said Zhang, adding that his
ministry is now working on a draft law on civil service.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-Minister highly praised the adoption of the civil
service system, which he said has remarkably enhanced the vitality
of government bodies, raised the general quality of the civil
servants, and promoted the building of a clean and efficient
government.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministry of Personnel will make every effort to further
deepen the reform of the existing personnel system and
continuously improve the newly-established civil service system,"
he concluded.

<HEADLINE> 5,000 Flee in Western Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Some 5,000 people of western
Uganda have fled their homes to avoid a possible raid from
rebels, ''the New Vision paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Muhongya, the local council chairman of Bugoye
sub-county in kasese district, told the paper that the whole
Katoke parish have been deserted. A parish consisted of several
villages.
</P>
<P>
Residents in neighboring villages confirmed the report, saying
they had admitted their relatives or friends from the parish.
Many displaced people fled without food and some of them
sheltered in churches.
</P>
<P>
Local people saw rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF)
last week. The ADF rebels threatened to launch another raid in
the sub-county. A sub-county includes some parishes.
</P>
<P>
Kasese is the haunt of the rebels of ADF, which at present has
some 300 members.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni pledged to reorganize the
army in the west and send reinforcements of 3,000 troops to the
west to put down the rebellion of the ADF late last month. But
there was no major operation reported in the west since then. A
recent report said the Uganda army has killed 15 ADF rebels in
western Budinbugyo district.
</P>
<P>
The ADF sent a detachment of 50 rebels to Budibugyo, another
western district to collect food in mid June. But the Uganda army
in the district foiled the attempt, killed the commander of the
detachment and drove the remnants of the detachment into Rwenzori
mountain at the Uganda-Congo border.
</P>
<P>
The ADF had some 1,500 fighters last November and its members
have been declined under the attacks mounted by the Uganda army.

<HEADLINE> China to Drawn on Lesson from Thai Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Currency volatility in East
Asian countries will prompt China to adhere to a moderately tight
monetary policy and ensure the rational use of foreign funds,
according to Dai Xianglong, governor of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
"The currency crisis in East Asian countries has provided a
very good lesson," said Dai.
</P>
<P>
He also warned against excessive foreign debt, excessively high
foreign liabilities, and a bubble economy resulting from
overheated real estate and stock markets.
</P>
<P>
"The stability of a nation's currency depends on economic
balance, soundness of the national economy, the exchange rate
system and the government's ability to prevent speculation," said
Dai.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China has no problem in balance of payments in
foreign exchange since 64 percent of the foreign capital in the
country comes from direct foreign investment and 80 percent of
foreign debt totaling 120 billion US dollars is in the form of
long-term loans.
</P>
<P>
Dai also said that China will contribute one billion US dollars
to an international package to help Thailand tide over its current
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The support of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and other Asian countries will enable Thailand to
overcome its current difficulties and successfully restructure
its economy."
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor acknowledged that the Renminbi yuan,
China's currency, is now facing pressure for further
appreciation due in part to growing foreign exchange reserves
which reached 126 billion US dollars at the end of July.
</P>
<P>
Dai also noted that the central bank is fully capable of
maintaining basic stability of the country's exchange rate,
although changes in market supply and demand for foreign
exchange may affect the exchange rate to some degree.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's 1998 Budget to Curb Imports, Expand Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim said today his country's budget for 1998
will look at serious measures to curb imports and focus on
expanding exports.
</P>
<P>
"The government would take into account "any monetary measures"
including the use of taxes to increase exports and reduce
imports," he said at the opening of the Third Malaysia Capital
Growth Opportunities Exposition here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia recorded a trade deficit of 2.8 billion Ringgit (about
1.07 billion U.S. dollars) for June this year due to the increase
of imports by 23.7 percent year-on-year to 19.3 billion Ringgit
(about 7.42 billion U.S. dollars) with the bulk comprising lumpy
imports.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the current deficit position was only temporary and
that the import of capital goods was necessary in order to avoid
the situation of continuing trade deficits in the future.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's June trade deficit figures were not all that
alarming, Anwar said, adding that the data required further
clarification, especially as to how they were computed.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia was following international norms when
computing these data and had no choice but to follow. "That is why
we have to be seen to be tough in handling these issues," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He raised the possibility that the government might defer
non-critical projects to help ease the pressure on the current
account deficit.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 budget is scheduled to be tabled in Parliament in
October this year.

conscripts who served in the armed forces prior to the first
non-racial general elections in april 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, Kasrils said, during a state of emergency or a state
of national defense declared in terms of the constitution if
their services were required, all current and future volunteers
in the SANDF would be liable to be called up after completion of
their term of service.
</P>
<P>
A new act would provide that personnel that are liable to do
additional service but refuse to do so on grounds of conscience,
would be entitled to render alternative non-military services,
Kasrils said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh Garment Industry Faces EC Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's garment industry, the
biggest foreign currency earner in this South Asian country, is
facing an embarrassing situation as its biggest buyer threatened
to close the huge profitable market.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission (EC) has threatened once again early
this month to withdraw the General System of Preference (GSP)
facility if Dhaka fails to cancel the inaccurate GSP certificates
by October 1.
</P>
<P>
The deadline was set by the commission after the Bangladeshi
government failed to take any measures to cancel 6,910 GSP
certificates which, an EC investigation team found late last year,
were not issued in compliance with the rules of origin.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's garment industry has been enjoying the GSP
facility in the European Union countries since 1986 without any
quota restrictions. In other words, the exported products of
Bangladesh can enjoy duty-free or low-duty treatment from the
European countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the products must be made of indigenous materials to
get these privileges, which give this country's garment industry
an edge over its competitors.
</P>
<P>
In the case of knitwear, entrepreneurs may import raw materials
like wool and cotton but they must go through three stages like
preparing yarn and fabrics for knitwear products while in woven
garments, only a two-stage transformation should be performed.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Dhaka fetched a total of 763
million U.S. dollars from its exports of knit items in the 1996-97
fiscal year while 605 million dollars or 79 percent of which came
from the European markets.
</P>
<P>
But ready-made garment exports faced a disruption after the EC
investigation team found irregularities in issuing GSP
certificates by the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) following
complaints that the rules of origin clause are being violated.
</P>
<P>
The EC also required the Bangladesh authorities to carry out an
investigation into some 8,562 "doubtful" GSP certificates, but the
Bangladesh side failed to take any action, thus annoying the EC
further.
</P>
<P>
In a recent letter to the EPB, an EC official informed that the
commission would withdraw the tariff privileges if the conditions
are not met by October 1.
</P>
<P>
However, the Bangladeshi government has yet to decide on this
critical issue because of the apprehension that once it admits
that the forged GSP certificates were issued, this will not only
create an image problem for Bangladesh's exporters but also make
them liable to pay compensation.
</P>
<P>
If Bangladesh cancels the 6,910 GSP certificates, an estimated
28 million dollars would have to be given as an indirect
compensation while the cancellation of the other 8,562 GSP
certificates will cost another 30 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
But if Bangladesh refuses to cancel the 6,910 GSP certificates
by October 1, the Customs authorities of the European Union would
ask their respective importers to pay a duty of 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
That would deal a severe blow to the ready-made garment sector,
especially the knitwear exports, as the confidence of the European
buyers in Bangladesh exporters might be eroded.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Commerce and Industries Minister Tofael Ahmed, who
went to Brussels and tried to find a solution to this dilemma in
January this year, said that he is likely to visit the EC
headquarters again next month.
</P>
<P>
The minister indicated that a decision by the government
regarding the cancellation of the GSP certificates may be delayed
until the end of his proposed visit.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said the government will request the EC to
derogate the rules of origin clause of the GSP, as well as to send
another delegation to Dhaka to re-investigate the alleged forged
certificate cases.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dhaka will also call for a sympathetic consideration
of Bangladesh's position, mentioning the social implications
likely to be created following a ban on the exports of ready-made
garments to European countries.
</P>
<P>
"The main victims will be the female garment workers because
the ban will lead to closure of at least 100 garment units," said
an official of the Commerce Ministry, adding that some 1.3 million
female employees will lose their jobs due to the ban.

<HEADLINE> New Chinese Treatment for Leukemia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have shown
that realgar, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine that has been
used for hundreds of years, is effective in treating an acute form
of leukemia.
</P>
<P>
Realgar is a mineral containing arsenic disulfides and is used
as a detoxicant and parasiticide.
</P>
<P>
Lu Daopei, a professor at Beijing Medical University's People's
Hospital, said during a recent Beijing medical symposium attended
by experts and scholars from China and the Republic of Korea that
his research group has been doing research on the deadly disease
with realgar since December, 1994, and 32 patients with acute
promyelocytic leukemia did not suffer a relapse after taking
realgar orally for a period of time.
</P>
<P>
The patients are mostly between the ages of 30 and 40, and the
eldest is 61.
</P>
<P>
None of them took any other anti-leukemia medicine during the
treatment.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Lu said, patients of the disease were given bone
marrow transplants, and although the success rate was as high as
80 percent, it was very difficult for doctors to find suitable
bone marrow for patients.
</P>
<P>
He said his research has shown that the survival rate from
taking oral realgar is the highest of all treatments, and his
hospital has taken to using oral realgar as the first choice in
treating this form of leukemia.
</P>
<P>
Lu Daopei is China's pioneer of bone marrow transplants in
treating leukemia, and he has helped establish Asia's largest bone
marrow transplant center.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Ex-combatants Loot Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 14 (Xinhua) --- Hundreds of ex-combatants
protesting the suspension of pension commutation payments have
ransacked Zimbabwe's ruling party ZANU (PF) national headquarters
in Harare, local paper "The Herald" reported today.
</P>
<P>
They cut telephone lines, looted food and cigarettes, and
cordoned off the area holding hostage party employees and
visitors on Wednesday, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
At least three police officers, including Chief Superintendent
commanding Harare District Munyaradzi Musariri, were assaulted.
</P>
<P>
The ex-combatants for Zimbabwe's independence also smashed a
police video camera and a camera of a "Herald" photographer whom
they threatened to assault and also burned his car.
</P>
<P>
They stormed ZANU (PF) headquarters just before lunch and cut
telephone lines at the reception area. Some went downstairs where
they looted food and cigarettes from the canteen.
</P>
<P>
After the looting, the ex-combatants assembled outside the
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Acting Police Commissioner Godwin Matanga has reportedly
instructed his officers to arrest the ex-fighters to face charges
of malicious damage to property. No arrests had been made by
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is dangerous. We also have lives to protect," a
senior officer said at the site at that time.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, at least a hundred ex-fighters held a demonstration
to disrupt the Heroes Day celebration at Heroes Acre in Harare.

<HEADLINE> Dry Season Sees Sharp Rise in Veld Fires in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Numerous veld fires have been
reported in Zimbabwe since the beginning of the current dry
season, with incidents in Harare shooting up from a normal 10
fires in a month to 89.
</P>
<P>
This increase was due mainly to the dry season and the school
holidays, during which some school children are believed to be
going around starting fires.
</P>
<P>
Harare Fire Brigade's Divisional Fire Officer Erasmus Gudza
said on Wednesday that the dry season was always characterized by
a sharp rise in veld fires.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the incidents in Harare have risen from a normal 10
in a month to 89 incidents during the same period."
</P>
<P>
"What is most disturbing is that most of these veld fires
developed into house or factory fires, particularly in cases
where proper fire guards are not in place," he said.
</P>
<P>
He blamed school children for causing most of the fires. Some
of the fires took long to be put out, as they would be fanned by
strong winds.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to parents to ensure that their children did not
start fires, as some of the fires ended up destroying property.

<HEADLINE> Documentary on Dalai Lama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- China Central Television (CCTV)
is preparing to televise the "Dalai Lama", a 90-minute TV
documentary featuring major historical incidents in China's Tibet
from the 1930s to the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese version will be aired by the CCTV Overseas Service
on August 24, with the English version scheduled for August 31.
</P>
<P>
The documentary features more than 20 eyewitnesses of
historical incidents, including fellow villagers, relatives, cooks
and serfs of the 14th Dalai Lama (Dainzin Gyaco), as well as
officials of the former Tibetan local government, religious
figures, historians and elderly men who worked with the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitnesses provide narrations of personal experiences and
stories about the 14th Dalai Lama, including how Dainzin Gyaco,
son of a farmer, was selected as one of the candidates for the
soul boy of the 13th Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
Other accounts depict enthronement ceremonies, and how the 14
Dalai Lama became the leader of old Tibet's feudal serf system
which integrated religion with politics under a meticulous and
strict system based onto Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the documentary explains how the Dalai Lama
ratified the agreement signed with the central government on
peacefully liberating Tibet; how he maintained close cooperative
relations with the central government from 1954 to 1956; and how
he later embarked on the path of splitting the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The documentary provides a detailed explanation of the
origins of the title of the Dalai Lama and reincarnation in Tibetan
Buddhism, as well as relevant historical conventions and religious
protocols.
</P>
<P>
A large segment of materials used in the documentary will
be made public for the first time.

<HEADLINE> West Urged to End Bias Against Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- President Daniel arap Moi has
called on western countries to end political bias against Kenya
which is facing the general election this year, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Some western countries and donor agencies have tended to
support the Opposition at the expense of the political and
economic achievements of the ruling Kenya African National Union
(KANU) party, he charged in western Kenya.
</P>
<P>
He said on Wednesday that the introduction of multi-party
system in the east African country had brought with it strong
tribal feelings which, fuelled by the Opposition, culminated in
the clashes that characterized events in the run-up to the last
elections in 1992.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret over the suspension of 215-million-Dollar
aid package to Kenya late last month by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) which cited high-level in Kenya as a key
reason.
</P>
<P>
Corruption is a vice rampant world-wide and could not be
identified with Kenya alone, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The conditions being pegged on aid by the IMF were not based
on economic considerations but were political decisions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he stressed the government's commitment to both
political and economic reforms, saying it would not backtrack on
the reforms.

first time in 22 years in Belo Horizonte on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sporting Cristal was stopped from becoming the first Peruvian

In the 73rd minute, Sporting Cristal earned a free kick which
was eventually saved by goalie Dida.
</P>

Minutes later, Cruzeiro's free kick was headed off the bar, and
Elivelton converted the winner in the 75th minute from the corner
kick.

<HEADLINE> Highway Construction Booming in Hebei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 14 (Xinhua) -- People driving through
Hebei Province are enjoying a smooth ride these days, owing to a
massive highway construction plan that began five years ago.
</P>
<P>
"While in the past it sometimes took a whole day to cover a
hundred kilometers on narrow and rugged roads, we no longer have
to worry about the road conditions and can travel more quickly,"
said Shang Yuhe, a long-time driver.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, Hebei in north China has built ordinary new roads
totalling 6,682 kilometers, and 8,299 kilometers of high-grade
highways, bringing the total length of its roadways to 54,146
kilometers by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Also at the end of 1996, the province had 359 kilometers of
expressways, the fifth-highest amount in the country. The new
roads link Beijing and Shijiazhuang; Beijing, Tianjin and
Tangshan; Shijiazhuang and Taiyuan; and Tangshan and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Hebei also had 261 kilometers of first-grade roads, ranking
eighth in the country; and 1,411 kilometers of second-grade
special motor vehicle roads, ranking first.
</P>
<P>
The province has an ambitious plan for the future, which calls
for the construction of eight expressways before the end of this
century designed to form a high-grade highway network with Beijing
as the center and Tianjin and Shijiazhuang as hubs. This system
will provide access to the province's four major sea ports of
Tianjin, Jingtang, Qinhuangdao, and Huangye.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Increase Income in South China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 14 (Xinhua) -- More than a third of farm
families living in south China's Guangdong Province earn 3,400
yuan (400 US dollars) on average annually.
</P>
<P>
The state says that income is the country's standard for a
comfortable living for families in the countryside, meaning having
sufficient food and clothing, and being able to afford some luxury
goods like color TVs and washing machines.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that farmers' average income has increased
in the province in the past few years, with the number of poor
families (per capita annual income of less than 845 yuan)
declining to 0.7 percent of the total number of families.
</P>
<P>
A recent local government study also shows that the average
annual income of farmers in Guangdong last year was 3,183 yuan, up
17.9 percent from 1995.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in the Pearl River Delta seem to be much better off
than their cousins in other places, with an average annual income
of 4,267 yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that the income gap among the farmers has been
narrowed somewhat because of rapid development and higher
profits. Most farmers' income comes from farming, with money
earned from work in township enterprises accounting for a quarter
of their total.

GUANGZHOU, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Financiers said Guangzhou, the
capital of south China's Guangdong Province, expects to increase
co-operation with Hong Kong in the finance sector.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong province, a neighbor of Hong Kong, is the country's
economic powerhouse, and has more Hong Kong investment than most
other provinces.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong is a door for Hong Kong investors to reach interior
provinces, with their cheap labor and natural resources, and the
two should co-operate in finances for mutual benefits, according
to experts.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou will depend on investors from overseas to make up 40
percent of the funds needed for its economy, topping 7.3 billion
US dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's banks and financial institutions were among the
first to enter Guangdong after it opened its financial sector to
overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Partially owing to cash inflows via these banks and financial
institutions, Guangzhou has been able to complete massive
construction and infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local commercial banks have opened offices in Hong
Kong. Co-operation between Guangzhou and Hong Kong will help
develop the economy of south China as well, and the effects will

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 13 (Xinhua) -- After a hiatus of one whole
year, former Argentine international Claudio Caniggia made his
comeback by resigning with his old club Boca Juniors on Wednesday
for a one-year-and-six-month contract.
</P>
<P>
Apart from assuring 40,000 US dollars per match into his
pockets, the contract also stipulated that Caniggia was free to go
after next January as long as Boca's requirements are satisfied.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old striker had been linked with several European
clubs after his farewell to Boca Juniors last August, but all fell
through.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing, Caniggia said he had never thought of
leaving professional football though he had stayed out for one
year.
</P>
<P>
He hoped to make his return debut on August 24 when the
Argentine National League kicks off.
</P>
<P>
The contract means the resurrection of the Maradona-Caniggia
partnership which awarded Argentina a silver medal in the 1990
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
The volatile Argentine superstar Diego Maradona this year made
his fifth comeback to the professional field as Boca Juniors
recruited him at the expense of 50,000 US dollars for every league
match.

LONDON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States won for the
first time since 1969 on Wednesday by defeating defending champion
Italy on the Admiral's Cup at Cowes, Isle of Wight, Britain.
</P>
<P>
Italy seemed to repeat the way it overtook the United States
two years ago for the title as its "Madina Milano" crossed first
ahead of "Flash Gordon 3" of the United States in the 974-km
Fastnet race, the final event of the nine-race regatta.
</P>
<P>
The turnaround occurred when Italy's "Brava Q8", which looked
certain to finish first in the ILC 40 class, was suddenly dropped
by a wind.
</P>
<P>
American John Kolius' "MK Cafe" took the chance to catch up and
finished second behind Germany's mid-boat "Pinta" with Italy at
sixth.
</P>
<P>
The victory of Kolius and his crew insured the slim lead for
the Americans and helped them revenge Italy.
</P>
<P>
Italy dropped to third overall in the Admiral's Cup, with
Germany moving up to second. The fourth to seventh places were
Australia, Britain, New Zealand and Scandinavia.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Becomes Flower Export Center of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan
Province has become the heart of the country's flower exporting
business, registering a 100 percent annual growth rate of fresh
flowers since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The province produced 400 million fresh flowers last year,
occupied 40 percent of the domestic market, and turned out more
than four million US dollars in export volume.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan, which is located in an area with low latitude and high
above sea level, has a range of different climates -- tropical,
temperate and frigid -- and can grow a variety of flowers.
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 years, many developed countries with superior
natural conditions have become the world's major flower suppliers,
said deputy governor of the province Liu Jing.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan, which is seeking international status on the flower
market, has set a series of preferential policies for the
development of its flower industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
The province has finalized a long-term cooperative deal with
Israel, the world's fourth largest flower exporter, to introduce
advanced techniques and equipment for flower production.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than a dozen overseas flower companies from the
Netherlands, the United States, Israel, Japan and the Republic of
Korea as well as companies from Hong Kong and Taiwan have invested
in the province, he said.
</P>
<P>
The seed cultivation centers for tulips and lilies were built
in northwest Yunnan and the largest flower market in southwest
China was built in the province's capital city of Kunming.
</P>
<P>
The production of tropical plants and flowers developed quickly
in the southern part of the province, with more than three million
tropical orchids grown each year.

<HEADLINE> Ross Wraps Up Shuttle Mission With Limited Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 14 (Xinhua) -- United States special envoy
Dennis Ross concluded his four-day shuttle mission overnight
with a limited success in restoring the Israeli-Palestinian
security relationship.
</P>
<P>
Before returning to Washington, Ross held the final and fifth
meeting Wednesday night with Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat in Ramallah, West Bank. Before the
meeting, Ross already conferred with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in his car on the way from Tel Aviv's
Ben-Gurion Airport to Jerusalem, when the latter returned from a
visit to Jordan's Aqaba to meet with King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Summarizing his mission to reporters after meeting Arafat,
Ross said his trip was aimed at affecting the security relations
between Israel and the PNA in order to prevent the situation from
deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
He said he had succeeded in creating a mechanism to
reestablish the Israeli-Palestinian security ties. "We certainly,
at this point, have a beginning which makes it possible to do
what is essential - settle the political differences," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ross was apparently referring to the two heigh-level meetings
between Israeli and Palestinian security officials arranged by
him and supervised by the station chief of the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency based in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
He also believed that Israel would ease some of the sanctions
imposed against the Palestinians following the twin suicide
bombings in Jerusalem's Manahe Yehuda market on July 30,
including the total closure on West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and
halt of transfer of tax money. But he did not elaborate when
Israel would do so.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel and the PNA had different interpretations of
Ross' self-claimed success.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's spokesman David Bar-Illan said Israel gave Ross
credit for succeeding in setting up the security ties and
influencing the PNA to take security seriously, but it had yet to
see "any concrete actions" by the PNA to stamp out terrorism.
</P>
<P>
On its part, the PNA was less positive in their assessment of
Ross' mission. Senior Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath said
that Ross came "empty-handed" to meet Arafat overnight in
Ramallah because he had failed to persuade Israel to ease the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Former Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat praised Ross
for having "managed to put damage control mechanisms into effect
and stop the deterioration."
</P>
<P>
But he also expressed regret that Ross failed to obtain any
concessions from Israel to ease the anti-Palestinian sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Due to his success in restoring the Israeli-Palestinian
security ties, Ross said that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright would be sure to visit the region for the first time in
the near future. Erekat agreed that "the road is open for a
visit by Albright" to get the peace process rolling again.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the speculation is that Albright is likely to
visit Middle East in the first week of September and that Ross
will return before then to prepare for her much-expected
trip.

<HEADLINE> New Scheme for Girl Child to Be Launched in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Inder Kumar
Gujral is set to announce a unique scheme for the girl child on
the golden jubilee of independence of India on August 15, a
government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The union government will open a separate bank account for
every girl born in the country, putting in 5,000 rupees ( about
140.85 U.S. dollars) as the initial capital.
</P>
<P>
According to the scheme, the money put in the bank will grow as
the child grows and by the time she becomes old enough to join
school, the corpus will generate enough monthly interest to
support her necessities. The scheme is particularly aimed at
promoting female literacy, checking the comparative disadvantages
suffered by a girl child in the family and, most importantly,
prevent female infanticide and foeticide.
</P>
<P>
In the man-dominated society of India, the social status of
women is very low, not to say the girl child. The new scheme for
the girl child will be the second major step taken by the Gujral
government to improve women' status in the country after expansion
of the council of ministers to induct only four women ministers
early this year.

<HEADLINE> New Wheat Hybrids Likely to Pierce Yield Barrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have expressed the
hope to come out with wheat hybrids in the next few years to break
the present yield barrier.
</P>
<P>
Top wheat scientists from India and abroad, who are
participating in a three-day international meet in India on wheat
research needs of the next century, said that hybrid and
transgenic wheat is now a distinct possibility. They are
attempting to transfer genes from other plants into wheat to
change the physiological and genetic nature of the wheat plant.
</P>
<P>
They said that the evolution of genetically superior plants,
coupled with the improvement in cultivation practices, will help
ensure a steady increase in wheat productivity.
</P>
<P>
S. Rajaram, successor of Nobel Laureate Norman E. Borlaug as
the head of the wheat breeding program at the Mexico-based
International Wheat and Maize Research Institute said at the
meeting Wednesday that scientists are now quite close to producing
a new type of wheat plant which will have a better root system,
stem and leaf architecture and grain-bearing ears. The new
"robust plant" could have a far superior yield potential than the
types available at present.
</P>
<P>
Indian wheat breeders also seem enthusiastic about the
prospects of hybrid wheat.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Sends Message on Golan to Assad: Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly sent a secret message Syrian
President Hafez Al-Assad three week ago on renewing talks on the
Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
According to the Israel Radio today, in the message conveyed by
an anonymous envoy, Netanyahu said Israeli concessions on the
occupied Golan depend on the security arrangements it gets from
Syria.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that Netanyahu expressed his
willingness to make concessions on the issue of Golan Heights
Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak denied the report
today, stating that there is no change in Israel's position
regarding the peace talks with Syria: Israel is still insisting on
a return to the negotiations without prior conditions.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor Party leader Ehud Barak has also sent a
message to Assad, commending him on inviting an Israeli Arab
delegation to visit Damascus this week and calling on the Syrian
leader to renew peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak criticized the new Golan formula attributed to
Netanyahu, terming it "a major political mistake." He said the
concessions on Golan Heights should only be dependent on the depth
of peace instead of security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Coalition members criticized Barak for sending a message to
Assad with the Israeli-Arab delegates, who have angered Israeli
rightist camp by calling for the return of all Palestinian
refugees to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Likud's lawmaker Michael Kleiner said Barak made a mistake by,
and would pay a price for, using Arab delegates, "traitors" as he
called, as messengers.
</P>
<P>
In his reaction, Barak said he only called on Assad to renew
direct negotiations with Israel, so he did not need anyone's
permission to do so. He denied he had called for the return of
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
In Damascus, Assad on Tuesday told the visiting delegation of
Israeli-Arabs that he desires true peace with Israel. He said he
did not want war and did not foresee deterioration.
</P>
<P>
The 44-member delegation started an eight-day visit to Syria
early this week in a bid to ease the tension between the two
countries and find a way to renew negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been frozen since March last
year and tensions have been growing since the hardline Likud
government came to power in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated Israeli call for resumption of talks without
any conditions, Syria insists that Israel should promise first to
the full withdrawal from the occupied Golan.

<HEADLINE> Woman Posting Anti-Islamic Leaflets to Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Tatiana Susskind, who posted
anti-Islamic leaflets in Hebron, West Bank, will soon stand trial
after a court ruled today that she is mentally sane.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem District Court ruled today that Susskind, 26,
from Jerusalem, is mentally fit to stand trial. This ruling
rejected her lawyer's appeal that she was mentally unstable and
not fit to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
Susskind was arrested late June after posting some leaflets
in the flash point West Bank city of Hebron, which depicted the
Islamic prophet Mohammed as a pig writing on the holy Koran.
</P>
<P>
The leaflets triggered angry protests from Palestinians as
well as Muslim across the world, and led to a wave of
anti-Israeli violence in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Susskind was indicted on July 3 in the Jerusalem District
Court with charges of offending religious sensibilities, throwing
rocks at Arab cars and supporting Jewish terror group.
</P>
<P>
When she posted the offensive leaflets in Hebron, Susskind
was wearing a shirt with the clenched fist symbol of the
outlawed extremist Kach Movement. One day before her arrest, she
threw stones at passing Arab cars on the road linking Hebron and
the nearby Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Supreme Court postponed the opening session of
Susskind's trial because of her lawyer's appeal against the
indictment citing her mental problems.
</P>
<P>
Following today's court ruling, Susskind's trial is expected
to begin soon. If convicted, Susskind could be sentenced for a
maximum of 20 years for endangering life on roads, in addition to
one year for offending religious sensibilities and another two
years for supporting terrorism.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Polish police have taken
steps to reduce the number of road accidents occurring in the
country and improve traffic safety.
</P>
<P>
An excessive number of traffic accidents from January to July
this year has resulted in an obvious increase in fatal accidents.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accidents in the first seven months of this year rose
22.7 percent over that of the same period last year, with
casualties increasing 22.6 percent and the death toll climbing by
26 percent, the Polish General Office of Police reported.
</P>
<P>
In July 1997, road accidents numbered 6,550, up 18 percent over
the same month in 1996. The number of casualties in the month
totalled 8,600 and fatalities numbered 477.
</P>
<P>
The Polish police attribute the occurrence of accidents to a
range of factors such as drunk driving, falling asleep at the
steering wheel while driving, fast driving, driving without
wearing safety belts or helmets as well as violations of traffic
regulations on the part of pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
Currently, a nationwide traffic safety campaign is being staged
in Poland. The police have taken measures to heighten inspections
of vehicles and supervision over pedestrians.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Central Bank Governor on Interest Rates, Exchange Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- China's interest rate level for
bank deposits and loans is currently faily reasonable, said Dai
Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, the central
bank, today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference, Dai said here this morning that
China's actual interest rates for bank deposits after adjusted for
inflation are at the same level of those in most Western countries.
</P>
<P>
"The actual interest rates for the present are in favor of the
interests of depositors," he said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor also acknowledged that the Chinese
currency, the Renminbi yuan, is now under pressure for further
appreciation, partly due to growing foreign exchange reserves,
which reached 126 billion US dollars by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the market change in the supply and demand of
foreign exchange will not affect the exchange rate much, since the
country's foreign exchange system, though market-oriented, is well
under the administration of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
From the perspective of foreign exchange management, the
central bank hopes to keep the exchange rate stable, Dai said.

<HEADLINE> Electric Generator Manufacturers Get Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Power equipment manufacturers in
northeast China have obtained 700 million yuan in loans to help
produce big hydropower generators for the Three Gorges Dam on the
middle reaches of the Yangtze River, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Bank of China (SDB) recently signed
contracts over the loan issue with the Harbin Power equipment
Co. Ltd (HPEC) and its holder Harbin Power Plant Equipment Group
Corp in Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The loans include a 13-year 580 million yuan commercial loans
and a 9-year 120 million yuan low-interest loan.
</P>
<P>
HPEC, one of the country's leading producers for large
hydropower equipment, will use SDB's loans to upgrade and expand
its production sites and facilities, and to improve its products
according to the international standards.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Dam Project, the world's largest dam project,
needs 26 electric generating units, each with a capacity of over
700,000 kilowatts, of which 14 will be manufactured by Chinese
companies. The rest 12 generators will involve international
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
HPEC expects to double its production capacity through the
renovation and expansion. Its annual production capacity for large
hydropower generators will be increased from the current 800,000
kilowatts to 1.6 million kilowatts on completion of the expansion
project.
</P>
<P>
Through cooperation with other companies, HPEC will provide two
generators for the Three Gorges Dam before 2003. The Three Gorges
Dam is scheduled to start power generation in 2003 and is expected
to be finished in 2009, requiring a total investment of 200
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
SDB, the largest and most important of China's three policy
banks set up in 1994, is designed to support the nation's
construction of infrastructure, basic and pillar industries. So
far, it has provided the Three Gorges Dam project with a financial
help worth 30 billion yuan.

TA Hydronics from Sweden is seeking to solve this syndrome in
Chinese buildings, said today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
TA, a Swedish company owned by IMI of Britain, sells balancing
valves, which distribute the flow of water correctly in hydronic
systems.
</P>
<P>
Apartments without balancing valves are often too cold if they
are farther from the boiler and too warm if closer. But if you
insert resistances in the piping, the heating system is balanced.
</P>
<P>
"We are having a stronger focus on China," Jeff Clarke, TA
manager for Asia/Australia, said on his first trip to Beijing last
week.
</P>
<P>
TA balancing products and formulas first came to China in 1983,
but sales have been low because China has yet to pay attention to
the comfort of buildings, explained T.S. Lim, TA regional sales
manager.
</P>
<P>
China's building market has been booming in recent years after
ups and downs in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Clarke said TA would first target high-grade commercial and
government buildings in Beijing and Shanghai. Then a variety of
valves will be available for buildings of other types.
</P>
<P>
TA (Tour &AMP; Andersson) was the first in the world to invent
modern balancing valves in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Clarke did not say for sure TA would invest in China to help
bring down production costs, but said local investment "is
something we are looking at seriously."

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar Ministry of Energy

transport problem.
</P>
<P>
The New Light of Myanmar today quoted Chairman of the Yangon
Division Law and Order Restoration Council and Commander Maj. Gen.
Khin Maung Than as saying that the government's revision of fuel
prices is to control the fuel price gap.

U.S. cents according to market exchange rate) and 20 Kyats (10
U.S. cents) respectively, while those in the open market were
about 280 Kyats (1.4 dollars) and 220 Kyats (1.1 dollars).

<P>
The revised state-prescribed fuel prices were 180 Kyats (90
U.S. cents) and 120 Kyats (60 U.S. cents) per gallon for petrol
and diesel respectively.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting here Wednesday, the commander said that
the bus fares have also been revised reasonably to help bus owners

trucks showing an increase of 18,210 passenger buses and 4,385
haulage trucks over the previous year's .
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, Myanmar imported annually nearly
100 million dollars worth of fuel oil in the last nine years to
meet local consumption, up from about 20 million dollars annually
in the past.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide daily distribution of petrol is over 150,000 gallons
(681,900 liters) and diesel oil over 400,000 gallons (1.818

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian PM Shows Confidence in New Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's new cabinet is an
organized working group with great potentialities to carry out
reform in the country, Ukrainian Prime Minister Valeriy
Pustovoitenko said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference to state the government's future
policies and tasks, Pustovoitenko showed great confidence in his
new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
He said that his ministers are all experienced and professional
people, and they have the same goal and cherish a collective
spirit.
</P>
<P>
Pustovoitenko, 50, was named prime minister on July 16, the
seventh in Ukraine's six-year independence.
</P>
<P>
In less than one month, Pustovoitenko formed his new government
following the principle of efficient and simple administration. He
cut the government ministries from 27 to 21, and set up 23 special
commissions.
</P>
<P>
Talking about national economy, Pustovoitenko admitted that
Ukraine's economic situation at present is quite complicated, but
promised that his government would shoulder all the
responsibilities to restore economy.
</P>
<P>
As for specific measures, Pustovoitenko said that his
government would first pay the back salaries and pensions.
</P>
<P>
It would also take comprehensive measures to control financial
crisis, adopt new budget policy and start economic structural
reform, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that to promote the development of small and
medium-sized enterprises as well as high-tech industries is also
one of the highlights of his economic policy.
</P>
<P>
All of Pustovoitenko's six predecessors have failed to bring
Ukraine out of the downward economic spiral since the former
Soviet republic gained independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said Pustovoitenko and his cabinet raised new
hope for the Ukrainian people but it would take time to help the
country get rid of economic crisis.

WARSAW, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Polish police have taken
steps to reduce the number of road accidents occurring in the
country and improve traffic safety.
</P>
<P>
An excessive number of traffic accidents from January to July

22.7 percent over that of the same period last year, with
casualties increasing 22.6 percent and the death toll climbing by

BANGKOK, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand will begin
to issue 100 million new 50-baht banknotes to replace the old

<HEADLINE> China to Adhere to Moderately Tight Monetary Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank will adhere
to a moderately tight monetary policy and at the same time make
appropriate fine-tunings of macro control, Dai Xianglong, governor
of the People's Bank of China, said at a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
First of all lending growth must be reasonably checked and
state banks strictly bring their loan portfolio under control and
effectively improve cash management, Dai noted.
</P>
<P>
He also said that more efforts must be made to restructure the
economy.
</P>
<P>
For some efficient capital construction projects which can
guarantee payments for principals and interests, he added,
Renminbi yuan loan facilities could be appropriately extended.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that provisions for bad loans in the
state-owned banks should be well managed in accordance with
relevant rules and regulations in order to support efforts in
enterprise merger, bankruptcy and re-employment of the lay-offs.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he stressed the need to timely review and improve the
credit policy, saying that while focusing support on the
state-owned enterprises the commercial banks should also
reasonably satisfy requirements of credit funds from enterprises
with different types of ownership.
</P>
<P>
To prevent and mitigate the effects of financial risks and to
create a favorable financial environment for smoothly implementing
the monetary and credit policy, the central bank will further
intensify supervision and regulation over the financial
institutions, ban illegal financial institutions and activities,
seriously probe into and punish operations in violation of laws
and regulation, and prevent and crack down on financial criminal
activities, the governor said.

<HEADLINE> Prices Cut as Retailers Chase Summer Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Major retailers in China are now
embroiled in a price-cutting campaign to promote sales marked by
low inflation and improved after-sales service, today's "China
Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
State Statistics Bureau (SSB) economists noted that retail
prices went down from June to July in China, but this drop did not
have a great influence on the buying mood of Chinese consumers as
they became more choosy.
</P>
<P>
The supply of some consumer goods exceeded demand in some areas
of the country. Grain prices in the 36 major cities went down 1.6
percent on average last month due to a bumper cereal harvest this
summer. The retail prices of garments, cloth, household
appliances, transportation and telecommunications were on a
downward trend.
</P>
<P>
However, there was also some bad news for Chinese urban
residents. The retail prices of drinking water, electricity and
fuels went up by 1.4 percent on average in the major cities from
June to July. SSB also noted that it was more expensive to travel
by air last month.
</P>
<P>
On a year-on-year basis, retail and consumer prices racked up
increases of 0.9 percent and 3.5 percent respectively in July in
the 36 major cities, the paper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Foreign tourists will be charged
the same as domestic tourists for admission tickets to all tourist
attractions across China, according to a report in today's "China

</P>
<P>
Some major sightseeing spots in Beijing City and Shaanxi and
Guangdong provinces have taken the lead in abandoning the old
practice of charging foreigners more than domestic visitors, it
said.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, a single price for both domestic and overseas
visitors was introduced last week in some of its major tourist
attractions, such as the Great Wall and the Summer Palace.
</P>
<P>
For example, the unified ticket price of the most popular
section of the Great Wall in Badaling, north Beijing, is 25 yuan
(three dollars). The old prices were 15 yuan for domestic visitors
and 30 yuan for foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Despite some Chinese tourists' complaints about the raised
prices, many foreigners interviewed were happy with the unified
admission prices, according to the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Czech Munitions Trade Down in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic's munitions
trade in 1996 declined by one third of the previous year's to some
150 million U.S. dollars, a report of the Industry and Trade
Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
Of the figure, exports dropped by 24 percent to 120 million
dollars, and imports to 34.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The poor performance has moved the country from the world's 7th
largest munitions trade power in the late 1980s to the 14th
nowadays, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic enjoys a long history of munitions
export. During the First World War in 1914-18, it became one of
the world largest producers and exporters of arms and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
And in the two world wars, its munitions exports reportedly
occupied 40 percent of the total world munitions trade.
</P>
<P>
The munitions industry had at times accounted for 30-50 percent
of the country's foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic's flourish munitions industry plummeted
after the 1989 tremendous change in the country, with the new
leadership asserting that it was not to be arms dealer any more.
</P>
<P>
However, in 1993, the leadership changed its mind and said the
country should regain its reputation of a munitions power by
recapturing its lost world market share.
</P>
<P>
Following that, the country's 40 major factories and
enterprises joined efforts to form a manufacturing group that has
greatly boosted Czech munitions output.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government to Help Small-Fund Property Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will
continue to fund the country's ailing property sector, but this
time only for those projects involving funds less than 2 million
baht (67,000 U.S. dollars) or 80 percent completed.
</P>
<P>
The policy was stressed at a special committee meeting convened
to solve the problems in the property sector on Wednesday, local
newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
The government would assist the low-income and mass-housing
projects instead of luxury ones, Minister of the Prime Minister's
Office Bokhin Polakula said.
</P>
<P>
The government would not be able to help all projects, but only
those targeting low-income earners and at least 80 percent
completed, he said.
</P>
<P>
The representatives from property associations who attended the
meeting were urged to present accurate information about their
projects to the related committees for review before the total
amount for the projects is set on August 25.
</P>
<P>
Bokhin also said that some of the International Monetary Fund's
aid to Thailand may be helpful for the property sector, but only
to those designated projects.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Thai Finance Ministry is also
considering to cut the three-percent special tax on land
transactions to ease the tax burden on property developers.

<HEADLINE> New And Better Rare Fish for Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Fishermen in China's northernmost
Heilongjiang Province have shown some interest in salangid (or
whitebait), a variety of fish that is expected to earn foreign
currency for them.
</P>
<P>
This year they hope to get more than 100,000 tons of the fish
from the province's 65,000 hectares of fisheries, officials there
said.
</P>
<P>
The salangid, which is native to China, likes living in large
bodies of water at a temperature of from 2 to 6 degrees Celsius,
and grows to an average length of 11 to 19 centimeters. China
often exports the fish to Japan and Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang province has good conditions for raising the fish,
and began breeding and doing researches on them in 1995. Central
China's Henan Province has provided the fish eggs, a traditional
product.
</P>
<P>
After two years of experiments, Heilongjiang began breeding
them on a large scale this year.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Government Supports Shipbuilding Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Mykola Kruglov, mayor of Ukraine's
shipbuilding city Mykolaiv, today praised the Ukrainian government
for its measures to stabilize the shipbuilding industry.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on a local TV channel, Kruglov said the central
government is likely to offer the Pontic Navy Yard of the city a
contract to construct 16 all-container ships and bulk cargo
carriers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the government has promised to grant
credits to the State Committee for Fisheries to buy two 5,500-ton
fishing trawlers from the Pontic Navy Yard.
</P>
<P>
Another major manufacturer of the city, the Ocean Shipyard, is
also likely to win a contract to build a large carrier for the
Black Sea Shipping Company, Kruglov added.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Ukrainian shipbuilding industry slipped
into a crisis due to economic hardship and lack of orders from
domestic companies.
</P>
<P>
Producers who cannot adjust to the market economy and stiff
international competition made the situation worse.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian cabinet, meeting last Wednesday, considered
writing off the sector's financial obligations to help it tide
over the difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Bank Indonesia Intervenes in Currency Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian currency of
rupiah plummeted to a record low against the U.S. dollar
Wednesday, promoting the central bank to intervene in the market.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah hit the weak end of the intervention band at 2,682
rupiah but recovered to 2,615 rupiah after Bank Indonesia sold an
estimated 500 million U.S. dollars. But the rupiah slipped back to
close at 2,645/05.
</P>
<P>
Early Wednesday morning, Bank Indonesia raised overnight
interest rates to 15 percent, while one week rate was raised to
10.5 percent, two weeks to 11 percent, one month to 11.625
percent, six months to 12.125 percent and one year to 12.75
percent.
</P>
<P>
The interest rates hike is likely to result in a further
tightening of liquidity in the next few days, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the pressure on the rupiah was not driven by
internal factor, but is "still a spillover from regional
economies."
</P>
<P>
They said the volatility of the rupiah has not reached its
peak. Therefore it is necessary to keep a close eye on regional
factors.
</P>
<P>
Rupiah fluctuation began on July 11 after Bank Indonesia
enlarging spread of rupiah exchange rate from 8 percent to 12
percent. The lowest plunge took place on July 21 when rupiah
dropped to 2,660 per U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the finance minister, the Bank Indonesia governor
and the information minister Wednesday asked the press to help
reduce the adverse effects on the Indonesian economy caused by the
monetary condition.
</P>
<P>
They felt that the media played a significant role in
overcoming the effects, because the negative consequences to the
money market and the stock exchange were often caused by media
reports.

<HEADLINE> Three World Records Smashed in Zurich Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Three world records were broken
on a single day of Wednesday at the Zurich Grand Prix, including
the oldest mark in track and field.
</P>
<P>
Danish Wilson Kipketer, a former Kenyan national, had his dream
come true by smashing Briton Sebastian Coe's 16-year-old record in
the 800 meters with a winning time of one minute 41:24.
</P>
<P>
The Dane once tied Coe's 1981 mark of 1:41.73 earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Wilson Boit Kipketer also had his glory moment by beating
the 3,000-meter steeplechase record in 7:59.08. The previous mark
of 7:59.18 was set by fellow Kenyan Moses Kiptanui in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia broke his own 5,000 record in 12
minutes 41.86 seconds, a big stride from his 1995 mark of 12:44.39.
</P>
<P>
Both Kipketers, winners in the World Championship in Athens
last week, were awarded 50,000 US dollars and a kilo of gold as a
bonus for their record-smashing feats.
</P>
<P>
The star-studded Grand Prix depicted a clear contrast against
the World Athletics Championships wherein no single world record
was broken in its nine-day competitions.
</P>
<P>
World champion Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco was only a step
away from setting the fourth record in the 1,500 meters.
</P>
<P>
He clocked the year's fastest time of three minutes 28.91
seconds, which ranked the second best only next to the 1995 world
record of 3:28.91 set by Nourredine Morceli of Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Fermin Cacho of Spain, the Olympic and world championship
silver medalist, finished second with a European record of 3:28.95.
</P>
<P>
Frankie Fredericks of Namibia and Merlene Ottey of Jamaica won
the 100 meter dashes, gaining some revenge for their disappointing
performances in Athens.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old Ottey clocked her winning time of 10.96 seconds
to justify her world-class caliber. Ottey finished a miserable
seventh in Athens, beat all the three medalists in Zurich.
</P>
<P>
Noah Ngeny of Kenya posted a junior world record in the 1,500
meters by clocking three minutes 34.54 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Tagged as the biggest meet in the world, the Zurich meet drew
67 medalists from Athens, including 25 champions.

<HEADLINE> World Trade in Chemicals, Chemical Products Double in Six Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- World trade in chemicals and
chemical products amounted to some 458 billion U.S. dollars in
1995, accounting roughly for 10 percent of the world's total
trade, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for
Europe (UN/ECE).
</P>
<P>
The value is double that of six years earlier, from around 230
billion U.S. dollars in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Western Europe accounts for more than half of world imports of
chemicals and nearly two thirds of world exports.
</P>
<P>
Chemical trade contributes some 30 billion U.S. dollars to the
western European trade balance, while generating a
46-billion-U.S.-dollar trade deficit in Asia.
</P>
<P>
In North America, Canada's imports of chemicals and related
products in 1995 amounted to 13 billion U.S. dollars and its
exports to 11 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The chemical imports of the United States in the same year were
42 billion U.S. dollars and its exports 60.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, Japan imported 24 billion U.S. dollars worth of
chemicals and related products in 1995, China 17 billion
U.S. dollars and South Korea 13 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, Japan's exports of chemicals stood at 30
billion U.S. dollars, China's at nine billion U.S. dollars and
South Korea's at 8.9 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Right-Wing Gains Ground in Norway: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- With little more than one
month remaining before Norway's parliamentary election on
September 15, opinion polls are predicting that the ruling Labor
Party will lose ground, while the far-right Progress Party may be
the big winner, according to a press report here today.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Labor Party led by Prime Minister Thorbjeorn Jagland
has the support of only 28.7 percent of the voters, according to a
recent poll. This result, if confirmed in September, would
represent a sharp decline compared to Labor's 37 percent showing
in the last election.
</P>
<P>
The Progress Party led by Carl Hagen is now supported by 22.7
percent of the electorate. This is a big increase compared to the
6.3 percent vote it gained in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Despite his increased popularity, it is doubtful if the
Progress Party will play a role in the next government. "No other
party wants to talk to me about cooperation. So I will not become
prime minister even I have the second-largest party," said Hagen.

<HEADLINE> Sharif Vows to Make Pakistan Developed, Prosperous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
today vowed to make "a developed and prosperous Pakistan" for the
coming generations while calling upon the nation for "starting a
new era of development and progress".
</P>
<P>
In a nation-wide address at one minute past midnight to mark
the beginning of the country's Golden Jubilee Day, Sharif said
that "the objective of our efforts and performance will be the
creation of a developed and prosperous Pakistan for our coming
generations."
</P>
<P>
During his 25-minute live-telecast speech, Sharif dwelt at
length on the socio-economic and foreign policies of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the nation's determination to uphold its image and
dignity in the comity of the nations.
</P>
<P>
"We are entering into next half of the century with vigor and
determination, and the time is not far when the ideals of
independence would be realized in letter and spirit," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif also underlined priorities of his government and said
all possible measures would be taken for economic development and
to improve the living conditions of the people.
</P>
<P>
The world has undergone drastic changes and the strength of the
nations lies not in weaponry but in sound economic base, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Only those who have mastered the fields of science and
technology will move forward," he said. "If we failed to adopt to
these new strategies, we cannot achieve the goal of progress."
</P>
<P>
On Pakistan's relations with other countries, the prime
minister particularly referred to the long and fraternal ties with
China and the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
"Friendship with China is one bright chapter of our history and
the ties with Islamic countries are stronger than before," Sharif
said.
</P>
<P>
"Our role in the Islamic Conference has always been very
effective and will strengthen relations with them in the field of
trade, economy, education, science and research," he said.
</P>
<P>
Relations with the United States were improving and Pakistan
was finding new avenues of cooperation with countries in Europe
and South Asia as well as Japan, he said.
</P>
<P>
In respect of relations with India, he said, the government was
trying to take confidence-building measures while reiterating that
Pakistan will continue to give moral, political and diplomatic
support to Kashmiris.
</P>
<P>
"Our independence will complete only when our Kashmiri brothers
will join us in our celebrations," he said.

<HEADLINE> More Children Use Hard Drugs in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The percentage of pre-teen
children who know their classmates or friends use illegal drugs
more than doubled in the past year, a survey by a private group
said today.
</P>
<P>
The survey, sponsored by the Commission on Substance Abuse
Among America's Adolescents, found that 23.5 percent of
12-year-olds said they knew someone who used hard drugs such as
cocaine or heroin, 122 percent higher than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The commission, created two years ago by the National Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, conducted
the survey by telephone interviews in June and July with a random
sample of 1,115 teens aged 12 to 17. An abbreviated version of the
survey was released today.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the government reported that more teen-agers had
tried heroin for the first time last year than ever before. The
Columbia University study showed that heroin use by teen-agers had
doubled between 1991 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Also the percentage of eighth-graders using marijuana during or
before seventh grade climbed from 7.7 percent to 12.7 percent
between 1992 and 1996 and the use of heroin by teens doubled from
1991 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
"It is another wake-up call that we have not changed youth
attitudes about drugs which, if unchecked, presage future use,"
said Barry McCaffrey, U.S. President Bill Clinton's drug policy
adviser.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies NATO Forces Trained to Capture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
denied reports that teams of British, U.S. and French commandos
are being trained in Europe to capture Serbian leaders accused of
war crimes in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to what has been reported... U.S. forces are not now
training for or participating in any unilateral or multinational
commando operation to apprehend indicted war criminals in the
former Yugoslavia," Pentagon said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) news reported Tuesday
night that the teams of commandos are separate from the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and a late fall operation is
expected.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at a regular briefing today, Pentagon
spokesman Kenneth Bacon said that NATO forces have begun
inspecting weaponry held by paramilitary units in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"This is an effort to take forces that we believe should have
been treated as military forces and treating them as military
forces," Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
In Bosnia, the so-called Stabilization Forces led by NATO
announced Monday that special police forces will be banned except
for protecting senior elected officials or dignitaries. Any armed
units not certified by the U.N. will be considered illegal.
</P>
<P>
As the deadline of June 1998 for the peacekeeping forces pull
out of Bosnia is approaching, analysts say the U.S. and its allies
are stepping up their efforts to arrest the indicted Bosnian Serb
leaders.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. considers former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic
as the major obstacle on the road to a full peace in Bosnia and
accuses him as a war criminal, insisting he should be put on
trial.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cracks Down Health Care Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Justice Department
study shows greatly increased efforts against health care fraud,
but says the General Accounting Office still estimates "more than
100 billion dollars may be lost in fraud, waste and abuse
annually."
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno listed the problem as a top Justice
Department priority in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Health care fraud investigations by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation rose from 657 in fiscal 1992 to 2,200 last year.
</P>
<P>
Criminal prosecutions rose from 83 cases and 116 defendants in
1992, to 246 cases and 450 defendants last year. Convictions,
including guilty pleas, rose from 90 in 1992 to 307 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Civil health care fraud probes rose from 270 in 1992 to 2,488
last year.
</P>
<P>
The study -- "Department of Justice Health Care Fraud Report,"
says frauds are being committed by every type of health care
provider across the country, and the schemes include billing
frauds, kickbacks and a number of lesser dodges.
</P>
<P>
The report says, "Health care fraud not only costs money, it
also can place patients at risk of serious physical
harm...teenagers... unnecessarily hospitalized because of
kickbacks...senior citizens across the Midwest had medically
unnecessary, poorly fitting knee, leg and back braces," while
others underwent "unnecessary cataract surgery..."

<HEADLINE> Canada to Consider Visa Requirements for Czech Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Canada might have to consider
reimposing visa requirements for Czech tourists so as to stop the
growing number of Gypsies seeking refugee asylum here, reports
said today.
</P>
<P>
The number of Gypsy refugee applicants have grown steadily
since Canada removed the requirement for a visa for Czech
nationals in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
And even more Gypsies are expecting to ask for refugee status
in Canada following a Czech television documentary shown last
week, which portray Canada as a generous country for refugees.
</P>
<P>
"It showed Canada as a pretty comfortable country with a pretty
generous assistance and it was perhaps a good idea for Gypsies in
that country to consider moving themselves to Canada," a Canadian
immigration official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
As a result, many of the Czech Gypsies have acted on the
program's advice and flooded the Czech national airline CSA with
ticket requests.
</P>
<P>
CSA says it has sold three times as many tickets to Canada as
normal since the broadcast ran last Monday. And flights from
Prague to Toronto and Montreal are virtually full until the end of
October.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Canada received 189 refugee claims from Czechs, of
which only three were approved. The rest are either pending or
have been rejected.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, there were 302
applications for refugee status, of which 38 have been rejected or
withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
Canada faced a similar situation in 1995 when visa requirements
were removed for Chilean visitors. Thousands arrived seeking
refugee status, causing Canada to reimpose visa requirements.
</P>
<P>
This time, Canada might have to resort to the same solution,
said a senior spokesman for Canada's ministry of immigration and
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
"It's not an option we like, but it's always an option," the
spokesman said. "There are other means of correcting this
particular situation, but I cannot say it is not an option."

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Swing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street swung
wildly today, as good news on the economy was translated
differently by investors.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrials ended down 32.52 points at 7,928.32.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by 1,483 to 1,363 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 554 unchanged. NYSE volume totaled
587.21 million shares, up from 498.9 million in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 4.51 to 922.02, and
the NYSE composite index fell 2.34 to 478.42.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 6.87 to 1,583.11, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.17 to 641.06.
</P>
<P>
In the first hour of trading, the blue-chip index charged
higher by 80 points and plummetted to down 70 points, then bounced
between negative and positive territory for the rest of the
session.
</P>
<P>
Causing the swings were two government reports on the economy.
The Labor Department said that prices paid to factories and to
other producers inched down by 0.1 percentage point in July for
the seventh straight month. Economists had predicted a rise by 0.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
That was good news because it showed that inflation, a big
concern for bond investors, is under control.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported at the same time that retail
sales rose 0.6 percent in July, the second consecutive increase.
That was about in line with expectations.
