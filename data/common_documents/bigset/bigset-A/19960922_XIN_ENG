<HEADLINE> World Famous Comic Strip Duo Resurrected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Professor Philip Mortimer and
Captain Francis Blake, two comic strip characters whose popularity
is comparable with Tintin among children worldwide, have been
resurrected nine years after their creator Edgar-Pierre Jacobs died.
</P>
<P>
Two Belgian artists, Jean Van Hamme and Ted Benoit, have
presented a new Mortimer and Blake story, "The Affair of Francis
Blake", a Cold War spy story which has just been published by
Belgian publishing house Dargaud.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Tintin, the young journalist who fought Chicago gangs,
the Japanese imperial army and European thugs in Africa, but died
along with his creator Herge, Mortimer and Blake's stories will
live on, said Hamme and Benoit in an interview with the daily
paper Liberation.
</P>
<P>
Since their first appearance in 1946 in the story "Secret of
the Swordfish", Mortimer, a pipe-smoking genius physician, and
Blake, a faithful officer never out of his uniform, have been
fighting a malicious and treacherous army officer called Colonel
Olrik all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Their stories have enthralled children as well as adults with
their exotic backgrounds, non-stop intrigue, a combination with
modern scientific knowledge, and above all, surprise and humor.
</P>
<P>
The professor and the captain have helped the British Royal
Family win back its crown from Olrik, stopped him from destroying
the world's weather system, discovered a new treasure in the
Pyramids, and protected android creator Professor Sato from
Olrik's stooges.
</P>
<P>
"It is a pleasure to re-discover the heroes of my childhood,
and my childhood itself," said Hamme. "All actors dream of
playing Hamlet. We have the chance of playing a great classic.
Nothing is more classic than Jacobs."
</P>
<P>
Born in 1904 in Brussels, Jacobs began to cooperate with Herge
in 1944 when the latter was already publishing his masterpiece
cartoons in the weekly "Tintin" comic strips.
</P>
<P>
He started producing his own stories in 1946, with titles
including "Mystery of the Great Pyramids," "Enigma of the
Atlantic," "SOS Weather Forecasts," "Diabolic Trap," "The
Affair of the Necklace," and "Three Formulas of Professor Sato,"
before he died on February 20, 1987.
</P>
<P>
The Dargaud publishing company spent 18 million francs (3.6
million U.S. dollars) to buy the rights to "The Affair of Francis
Blake" and the workshop of Hamme and Benoit, and to promote sales
of the new comic strips series.
</P>
<P>
Dargaud is also planning to put the new story onto the
Internet, make a new cartoon series and a movie based on the
strip.

<HEADLINE> Britain Should Not Rule Out EMU Membership: Clarke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- British Chancellor of the
Exchequer Kenneth Clarke has pledged that Britain should not rule
out its membership of the European Monetary Union (EMU) even
though it is not among the founding members of the EMU, according
to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the meeting of the European Union (EU)
finance ministers in Dublin today, Clarke said that a single
European currency could be beneficial for Britain and he would not
yield to the demands of the Conservative Euro-sceptics who want
Britain to stay away.
</P>
<P>
"The cabinet settled its position five months ago and said we
would make a decision about whether Britain would join in due
course, when we knew how it would work and whether it was in the
British interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clarke stressed that "a single currency could offer the
prospects of stability, low interest rates, and a zone of economic
conditions which attract investment and stimulate the growth of
trade."
</P>
<P>
Asked on a series of attacks upon a single European currency
from within the ruling Conservative Party, Clarke said that the
in-fighting of the Conservatives could destroy its chances of
winning the next general election due to be held next May.
</P>
<P>
"What we need to win the next election is for the Conservative
Party to remain a cohesive party," he added.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Army Reinforces Position against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese Army has
reinforced its positions in Western Beqaa, guarding against
possible Israeli attacks on southeastern Lebanon, the state-run
Lebanese National News Agency reported this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The report said that a contingent of the army's
special forces was sent to reinforce the Lebanese troops in the
area "in preparation for confronting any possible Israeli
aggression in light of the recent Israeli threats."
</P>
<P>
It quoted security sources in the Israeli-occupied border
strip in south Lebanon as reporting that Israel was
planning to clear away obstacles which could impede Israel's
counter-attacks against hit-and-run operations by Moslem
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The security sources said that the Israeli forces were
"determined to advance to the Litani River and they would try to
scorch the area by bombardment in a bid to protect the Israeli
troops from any guerrilla attack in the future."
</P>
<P>
The report added that Israel continued reinforcing its
occupation forces in south Lebanon, which were receiving more
and more equipment and military vehicles day by day.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, an officer of the Israeli Defense
Forces was wounded by guerrillas of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or
Party of God, in the so-called "security zone" in south Lebanon,
an Israeli army spokesman announced this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of the Israeli occupation forces in south
Lebanon told Israel Radio that an Israeli armored vehicle was
hit by an anti-tank rocket in the northeast part of the
850-square-kilometer border strip.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in the capital, the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah announced that one group of its fighters carried out
the attack at an Israeli tank at Gassar Aurouj, and the attack set
the tank ablaze, wounding three Israeli soliders inside.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that another group of Hezbollah
guerrillas bombarded the Israeli positions of Sojoud and Bir
Kalab, killing and wounding a number of Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes launched around 2:20 p.m. (11:20 GMT) today
a series of air raids at bases of Hezbollah guerrillas in a
mountainous area some 60 kilometers southeast of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The air strikes were launched two days after a violent clash
between Hezbollah guerrillas and an Israeli force in south
Lebanon, in which two Israeli soldiers were killed and eight
others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The casualties have brought to 20 the number of Israeli
soldiers killed by Hezbollah in south Lebanon since the
beginning of this year.

ATHENS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Over 8.5 million Greeks will
go to polls Sunday to elect a new 300-member parliament in early
general elections.

<HEADLINE> Israel Vows to Fight against Violent Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli official
warned here today that Israel will fight back against any new
violent attacks against targets of this country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with Israel Television, Public
Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani expressed his belief that
Israel "should try to find another way to destroy facilities of
terrorist groups even they are in Syria."
</P>
<P>
His remarks came after Ramadan Abdallah Shalah, head of the
Islamic Jihad Movement, has said in Damascus, capital of
Syria, that his organization will soon resume suicide bombing
attacks against Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani said he was worried about the suicide bombing
attacks, which he termed as "big problems" for Israel. He vowed
that Israel will find a way to stop them and fight back.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that Israel will try to convince the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) of trying to fight against
facilities of the extremist groups inside the Palestinian
autonomous areas.
</P>
<P>
Shalah, currently resides in Damascus, said in an interview
published today in the Arabic Daily of Al-Hayat that the PNA
will also be targeted by his organization because of its
hard policies against Islamic Jihad member in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Shalah added that the Islamic Jihad movement still wants to
revenge for the assassination of its former leader Fathi
Shkaki last October in Malta.
</P>
<P>
Shkaki, founder of the Islamic Jihad, was shot dead by a
gunman in front of a hotel in Malta on October 26, 1995,
when he was on his way back to Syria from Libya.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Jihad has claimed that agents of Mossad, Israeli
intelligence organization, carried out the assassination, and has
called for revenge since then.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli officials at that time declined to comment
either on the incident, or on foreign reports pointing to Mossad
agents as responsible for the killing.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, the Islamic Jihad has claimed
responsibilities for several suicide bombing attacks against
Israelis, including the Dizengoff Center bombing in Tel Aviv
last March, which left at least 12 dead and over 100
wounded.

<HEADLINE> Israel Proposes Long-Term Solution to Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Public Security
Minister Avigdor Kahalani proposed today replacing Israeli troops
in south Lebanon with international peacekeepers as a long-term
solution to the Israeli-Hezbollah conflict.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani made the remarks in an interview with Israel
Television Channel 1 after Israeli planes and tanks this afternoon
shelled some pro-Iranian Hezbollah targets in the Israeli
self-claimed "security zone" in south Lebanon .
</P>
<P>
One Israeli soldier was slightly wounded by rocket fires
launched by Hezbollah forces against Israeli tanks in the eastern
sector of the zone, an army spokesman was quoted by Israel Radio
as saying.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, two Israeli soldiers were killed and eight
others wounded in heavy fighting with Hezbollah gunmen in the
same area. Israeli planes and artillery also retaliated with
heavy bombings of Hezbollah targets.
</P>
<P>
The army spokesman said that Israel would beef up its forces
in the security zone to counter the escalated attacks by
Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the escalation of south Lebanon conflict,
Kahalani, a former army general, said Israel should attack all
Hezbollah targets in the zone in a bid to try to destroy its
facilities.
</P>
<P>
However, he proposed that another solution should be found to
solve the conflict in a long term.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the real solution that we should find out is to
find some kind of international forces to be in the security
zone. And these forces can be some Arabs like Jordanians,
Egyptians and Americans together. And we should withdraw (from
south Lebanon)," Kahalani said.
</P>
<P>
He added this was the only way to solve the problem of
Lebanon and even the dispute with Syria. "I know the Syrians do
like this, but this is a solution, a good solution for Israel,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has charged Hezbollah for violating the understandings
on cease-fire signed in late April after Israel's 17-day
Operation Grapes of Wrath. The cease-fire agreement banned
attacking each other using civilian covers.
</P>
<P>
Israel has filed a complaint to the five-nation international
monitoring group on the cease-fire, which is to convene a meeting
Sunday. Israel claimed that of about 100 Hezbollah attacks
since the cease-fire, at least 14 operations violated the
understandings.

<HEADLINE> Iran Launches Military Exercises in Persian Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Islamic Revolution
Guards Corps (IRGC) today launched military exercises in the
Persian Gulf although the United States is continuing to mass its
military forces in the region.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the war games
were carried out by the navy of the IRGC on the first day of the
Defense Week.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters of the IRGC navy's first zone said the
exercises are underway to promote the training level of the
personnel and preparedness of the missile-launcher vessels.
</P>
<P>
The exercises would serve to evaluate the capability of the
navy units, functioning of the equipment and telecommunications
systems, testing the preparedness of the back-up units for the
units in action, said the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
However, the report gave neither details about the military
exercises nor the number of participating military forces or
warships.
</P>
<P>
The fear of Iranian authorities is growing over the potential
military attack by the U.S. forces in the Gulf since Washington is
still massing military forces in the Gulf region though the Iraqi
government has retreated from the previous position.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian military forces have been at red alert for about
two months. Rahim Ebrahimi, Deputy Commander of the Ground
Forces for Intelligence and Operation, has called on the United
States to "obliterate from their minds imagination of aggression
against Iran."
</P>
<P>
"By its military presence in the Persian Gulf and its recent
attacks on Iraq, the United States is in quest of nothing but
its own interest," the deputy commander said.
</P>
<P>
However, he claimed "Iran did not lean towards any aggression
or expansionist policies," adding that Iran followed a defensive
stance toward the potential military attack by the American
forces in the Gulf.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government
has adopted a new regulation to enable exporters to retain 10
percent of the foreign currency they earn.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today by Dubal Jale, Governor of the
National Bank of Ethiopia at a seminar organized for exporters to
familiarize government's new regulation.
</P>
<P>
Dubal said exporters will also be able to either auction 40
percent of their earning at the National Bank, or sell it to any
domestic banks.
</P>
<P>
He said the measure is aimed at increasing income from export
and boosting the competence of Ethiopian exporters in the
international market, adding that this in turn will help improve
Ethiopia's negative trade balance.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Ethiopian government decided to give
substantial support to five export items to implement its export
diversification including coffee, which is the country's largest
foreign exchange earner, meat, textile, leather, fruits,
vegetables and flowers.
</P>
<P>
All these measures are aimed to stimulate export of the
country.

HARARE, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe experienced a sharp
increase in cases of corruption in the first six months of this
year with 170 cases having been reported, resulting in 54
convictions.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa said on Saturday that
from January to December last year, there were 237 reported cases
of corruption with 107 convictions.
</P>
<P>
Presenting a paper on ''Corruption: Its Impact on the
Development of the Human Factor in Africa'' at an international
institute for human factor development conference, the minister
said Zimbabwe is slowly moving toward a dangerous trend and
culture of corruption as each case involved thousands of dollars.
</P>

However, he assured delegates to the conference that as
minister in charge of the police, all reported cases would be
treated with the urgency they deserved.
</P>
<P>
''The police will not tire in their efforts to unearth new
forms and varieties of corruption as our continent becomes more

He challenged the delegates to come up with ways of improving
transparency and evaluation systems.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Inspects Beijing-Kowloon Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing-Kowloon Railway
will markedly advance the development in China's central areas,
especially in former revolutionary areas and poverty-stricken
areas, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said during a recent
inspection tour along the railway.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it will play an important role in strengthening the
economic ties between Hong Kong and the inland areas and promoting
the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
"China will resume the sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997,"
Jiang said. "And we must do a good job in all aspects of work to
ensure a prosperous and stable Hong Kong after its smooth return."
</P>
<P>
Jiang started his trip at the Beijing West Railway Station on
the evening of September 16 and arrived at Shenzhen, in south
China's Guangdong Province, on September 21 via Hebei, Shandong,
Henan, Anhui, Hubei and Jiangxi provinces.
</P>
<P>
Jiang visited poor peasant households along the way, pointing
out that the development of poverty-relief work in various areas
is unbalanced and it is still a hard work.
</P>
<P>
To solve the food and clothing problem of the poor population
in the rural areas is of importance to the overall realization of
the Ninth Five-year Plan (1996-2000), the coordinated development
and long-term stability of the entire society and the authority of
the Party among the people, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not merely an economic issue," he said. "It is a
political issue."
</P>
<P>
This year is the 60th anniversary of the Long March of the Red
Army. Jiang visited former revolutionary bases of the Red Army and
expressed his best wishes to the people in the areas.
</P>
<P>
In Hubei and Jiangxi provinces, Jiang visited revolutionary
martyrs' cemeteries and laid wreaths at the tombs of the heroes.
</P>
<P>
He encourage local soldiers to learn from fine traditions of
the Red Army, struggle hard and listen absolutely to the
leadership of the Party.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the whole nation should cherish and safeguard
the current good situation and work harder to greet the smooth
return of Hong Kong and realize the Ninth Five-year Plan
(1996-2000) and Long-run Goals for the Year 2010.

<HEADLINE> African Film Industry Short of Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean film-maker Tsitsi
Dangarembga said poor funding is a major setback for black movie
producers and she has called on local businessmen to invest in
the film industry.
</P>
<P>
''The bottom line in the film industry is not whether you are
male or female. It is finance,'' she said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
''All black film-makers are struggling. They rely on asking
for donations from organizations and it is difficult to convince
them that your project will be viable. The idea is for local
business people to invest in the industry,'' Dangarembga said.
</P>
<P>
She said because of poor funding, most African films could not
match the technical quality and standards of international
productions.
</P>
<P>
On the seven-day Southern African Film Festival (SAFF), which
began on Friday and has attracted over 150 participants from
throughout the world, she said it offers an opportunity for
film-makers from the continent to establish contacts and enhance
distribution and marketing of some local products.
</P>
<P>
SAFF is a showcase of over 20 African feature films as well as
34 documentaries and short films which will be screened to the
public up to September 27.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Women Still Disadvantaged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean women are still
disadvantaged despite guarantees in the country's laws for equal
rights between men and women, Rudo Kwaramba of the Women Lawyers
Association said.
</P>
<P>
She told over 1,000 women attending the Women's Action Group
(WAG) annual general meeting on Saturday that social norms and
cultural beliefs still inhibited women from fully participating
in issues that directly affected them.
</P>
<P>
''Those (the legal instruments) are just the legal provisions
on paper. In reality, however, obstacles that women have to
contend with remain very real,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
Women constitute about 51 percent of Zimbabwe's 10.5 million
people and are the major producers of food in the communal
farming areas.
</P>
<P>
Kwaramba said economic reforms, introduced to spur economic
growth, have impacted badly on women.
</P>
<P>
The reforms, backed by the International Monetary Fund, the
World Bank and other western governments, were introduced to
ensure the nation paid what it owed the financial institutions
and foreign governments, she said.
</P>
<P>
While women did not directly benefit from the debts incurred
by the government, they were expected to bear the brunt during
repayment, she said.

KAMPALA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-six civilians were
killed by rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in Gulu
district, northern Uganda in the last two days, reported "the
New Vision" paper today.
</P>
<P>
Most of them were killed in Aswa county in the district, where

the county, the paper said.

<P>
In face of this situation, Major General Salim Saleh,
Presidential Advisor on Military and Political Affairs in the

in the villages."
</P>
<P>
"The army can provide better security when the villagers are
gathered in one locality. I intend to ask Gulu district council
for permission to depopulate the villages. The killing rate has
gone too high," he complained.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said depopulating villages could scale down the
killings.

<HEADLINE> Vanilla Suitable for Growth in Coastal Clay Areas, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian researchers
has found vanilla, a high value crop, suitable as an intercrop
under mature coconut trees in the coastal clay soils of Peninsular
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute
(MARDI) has successfully grown the plant at its research center at
Sungai Sumun which is a coastal clay area, MARDI Food and
Industrial Crops senior research officer Abdul Jalil said today.
</P>
<P>
The vanilla plant grew very rapidly with a rate of about 10-20
centimeters/month in the nursery and the field growth rate was
40-50 centimeters/month in the second year and remained at stable
growth rate at 70-80 centimeters/month in the third year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the experiment by MARDI indicates the potential
of vanilla in this country, especially as a source of additional
income under intercropping system with coconut," he was quoted by
Malaysian news agency Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
With about 160,000 hectare of land under coconut cultivation in
the peninsula, the potential of vanilla as an intercrop is very
promising, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said more research needed to be done to realize the full
potential of vanilla and its growth suitability in inland areas
which are more fertile and favorable.
</P>
<P>
Vanilla (vanilla fragrance) from the family of "Orchidaceae" is
well known as a flavoring material being used extensively to
flavor ice-cream, chocolate, beverages, cakes, custards, pudding
and other confectionery, besides being used in perfumery and in
medicine to a small extent.

NEW DELHI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Japan airlines (JAL), which
suspended its flights to India four years ago, has rediscovered
the country, the Indian express said today.
</P>
<P>
JAL will resume its service from October 3, operating two
non-stop flights every week from new Delhi to Japan, one to Tokyo,
the other to Osaka.
</P>
<P>
Though JAL suspended its flights from India in October 1992, it
maintained a sales network in the country. India's economic policy
and a steady growth in demand from Japanese travelers has led to
the resumption of flights, JAL sources said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
About 73,000 Japanese flew to India last year. About 25,000
Indians traveled to Japan in 1994. Air India operates three
flights a week to Japan.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting President
Museveni has promised to increase the volume of Uganda transit
cargo passing through the Dar es Salaam Port.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after touring the port on Saturday, Museveni directed
Minister for Works, Transport and Communications John Nasasira
and Managing Director of Uganda Railways Enos Tumusiime to look
into the possibilities of increasing cargo through the port.
</P>
<P>
"I doubt if the transportation here is cumbersome. What you
need to do is to explore the possibilities of increasing the
volume of cargo through his port," said the president.
</P>
<P>
According to local press today, he told Nasasira and Tumusiime
to liaiseilities with their respective counterparts in removing whatever
bottlenecks which were there to raise the volume of cargo.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the volume of Ugandan transit cargo is about 95,000
tons per year with the bulk being handled at the Mombassa Port in
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The president, who toured the Uganda coffee shed at the port,
stressed that the respective officials from the two countries
should work out modalities to ensure faster delivery of his
country's cargo.
</P>
<P>
During a state banquet hosted in his honor Friday evening,
President Benjamin Mkapa called on his counterpart to increase
the volume of transit cargo through Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
He said although there was an increase from 50,000 tons in
1993/94 to 95,000 tons last year, the rise was far too low still.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, the Ugandan leader leaves for
Zanzibar today where he is scheduled to have official talks with
Zanzibar President Salmin Amour.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Germans took to
the streets across the country over the weekend, demanding that
the rights to residence of homeless women be protected.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was designed to draw attention from
authorities concerned so that they can take measures to help the
many homeless women who will soon face the severe winter, said
Martin Berthold, chairman of a federal work committee to help the
homeless.
</P>
<P>
At present, a total of 180,000 women have no homes in the
country, which is a shame for Germany, local press said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Neues Deutschland today attributed the large
number of homeless women to high unemployment among women and high
housing rents.
</P>
<P>
Berthold said the issue has not received enough attention from
the authorities, and as a result, the number of the homeless has
increased sharply, with that of homeless single women doubled
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Anke Fuchs, president of the German Tenants' Federation, said
that the federal government's housing policy was unfavorable to
women.
</P>
<P>
She called on the government to safeguard the rights and
interests of the tenants, increase housing subsidies, and build
more houses with lower rents to deal with the situation.

COLOMBO, September 22 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
 Kumaratunga has indicated willingness to accept third party
mediation between the government and the Tamil rebels to end the
country's ethnic war, according to today's local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that In an interview with a popular magazine
published in India, the president said the government would insist
that the liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) lay down arms
before any negotiation could start.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question on third party mediation, she said
that it would be accepted "if the conditions are correct", adding
that the government had been trying to persuade the LTTE to agree
to that in the past.
</P>
<P>
The president during the interview appeared to be skeptical
about the LTTE's seriousness to enter into a negotiated
settlement, saying "it is very clear that the LTTE leadership does
not believe seriously in negotiated settlements", the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Her inclination to accept a third party mediation was seen as
a significant move to bring the government and the LTTE back to
the negotiating table, the reports noted.

<HEADLINE> Thai-Cambodian Border Trade Expected to Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Cross-border trade between
Thailand and Cambodia is expected to improve as a result of talks
on peace and national reconciliation between Khmer rouge
dissidents led by Ieng Sary and the Phnom Penh government,
according to Thai businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The reconciliation talks are a good sign for cross-border trade
between the two countries, said Chart Sakulpanich, secretary of
the chamber of commerce of northeastern Thailand's Trat province.
</P>
<P>
If there is peace in Cambodia, Thai traders will no longer need
to pay under-the-table money to Cambodian government or the Khmer
rouge when they transport goods to that country, he was quoted
today by local daily the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
He hopes Thai traders will soon be allowed to retrieve logs
from Cambodia. Hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of logs for
which Thai companies received concessions remain in the war-torn
country due to UN sanctions in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Yanyong Netsamanond, vice-president of the Trat Chamber of
Commerce, said as a result of the UN sanctions, Thai gem and
jewelry businessmen have suffered from a severe shortage of raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
He expected that more gem-mine concessions will be granted it
the situation in Pailin, Cambodia, returns to normal.

BANGKOK, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's six coalition
parties are to begin discussions on choosing a successor to
Banharn Silpa-Archa from Tuesday, according to Prachakorn Thai (
Thai Citizen) party's leader Samak Sundaravej.
</P>
<P>
There was no precondition that the next premier must be a
member of Chart Thai (Thai Nation) party led by Banharn.
</P>
<P>
But the party would be given priority to choose one of its
members and if the choice did not meet with the approval of the
coalition, other parties would select their people for
consideration, Samak was quoted by reports as saying.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Banharn has promised to step down in seven days.
His announcement came shortly before the House voted to determine
his fate. He survived the censure with 207 votes against the
opposition's 180.
</P>
<P>
Samak said after the coalition reached agreement on the issue
that Banharn will announce the name of his successor.

WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The last of 3,000 American
troops scheduled to be deployed in Kuwait in the latest
U.S. military buildup in the Gulf flew out of Fort Hood, Texas,
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Defense officials said the last of 12 flights carrying the
3,000 1st Cavalry Division soldiers left at 8:50 a.m. CDT (13:50

</P>
<P>
The deployment of the 3,000 Fort Hood troops in Kuwait, ordered
by President Bill Clinton, began on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The troops, once in Kuwait, will move quickly to join training
exercises with M1-A1 Abrams tanks and M2-A2 Bradley fighting
vehicles in the desert about 40 kilometers from the Iraqi border.
</P>
<P>
Most of the tanks and heavy equipment were already in place in
Kuwait, but the departing troops took key satellite and radar
equipment with them.
</P>
<P>
They are joining 1,200 American soldiers already there before
the latest Gulf crisis began.
</P>
<P>
Fort Hood is the U.S. Army's largest base. It holds 45,000

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Dole to Hold Two Presidential Debates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton and
Republican challenger Bob Dole will hold two debates this fall
without Reform Party presidential candidate Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
The two major-party negotiators made the decision on Saturday
after nine hours of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Dole and Clinton campaigns said they
agreed to debate on October 6 in Hartford, Connecticut, and ten
days later in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
Vice presidential candidates Al Gore and Jack Kemp will face
off October 9 in St. Petersburg, Florida.
</P>
<P>
All three 90-minute debates will be nationally televised.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's lead negotiator, Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor,
said his group pushed for the inclusion of Perot and his Reform
Party running mate, Pat Choate.
</P>
<P>
"We did everything we can," Kantor told reporters afterward.
"The Dole campaign took the position they would not debate with
Mr. Perot or Mr. Choate and there would not be debates unless we
agreed."
</P>
<P>
Dole's team contended that Kantor yielded on the Perot question
early in the day. "It wasn't a bloody fight," said former South
Carolina Governor Carroll Campbell, the lead negotiator for Dole.
</P>
<P>
Less than an hour before the final agreement was disclosed,
Perot announced that he will file a lawsuit on Monday morning in
Washington seeking an injunction against sponsorship of the
debates by the Commission on Presidential Debates if the Reform
ticket was excluded.
</P>
<P>
The bipartisan commission recommended last week that Perot be
denied a spot in the debates because he has no "realistic chance"
of winning the election.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bloody Politics Continues in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The bloody politics in
Pakistan continued as Murtaza Bhutto, the brother of Pakistani
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, died in a gun battle between his
bodyguards and the police in Karachi on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Murtaza, 42, was the leader of Pakistan People's Party (Shaheed
Bhutto group) which has been pursuing the policy of
non-cooperation with both the Pakistani government and the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
There appeared considerable tension between Murtaza's
supporters and the Karachi police recently as the latter
considered Murtaza's party as the major suspect of two bomb
attacks in Karachi Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of a key assistant of Murtaza and some other party
members triggered some low-intensity clashes between the police
and Murtaza's men, in which nobody was killed.
</P>
<P>
The tragic death of Murtaza took place at his residence in
Karachi late Friday, just several hours after Murtaza claimed that
the police would face trouble if they wanted to nab him without
legal warrant.
</P>
<P>
A heavy contingent of police stationed outside Murtaza's
residence stopped Murtaza and his escort for a check when Murtaza
returned home from a reception.
</P>
<P>
According to a police spokesman, Murtaza's aides suddenly
opened fire, injuring several policemen and a passerby.
</P>
<P>
Police retaliated in self-defense, killing six, nabbing six and
injuring five including Murtaza who died later in hospital, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Having got the information of the death of her brother, Benazir
Bhutto was in deep grief and air-dashed to Karachi from Islamabad
early Saturday morning. Meanwhile, she ordered concerned officials
to hold immediate inquiry into the incident.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani President Farooq Leghari, many Federal and Provincial
Ministers, and opposition Leader Nawaz Sharif also showed their
deep condolences for Murtaza's death.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the inquiry is being undertaken by both
Pakistan's Sindh provincial government and the police on whether
right procedure was adopted by the police in the incident.
</P>
<P>
A detailed report on the incident will be submitted to senior
government and police officials by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The accidental death of Murtaza recalled the tragic history of
Bhutto family in the bloody politics in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, the father of Murtaza, was hanged on April
4, 1979 by General Zia-ul-Haq who staged a coup in 1977 and
arrested Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
Shah Nawaz Bhutto, the younger brother of Murtaza, was poisoned
to death in Paris on July 18, 1985, and the murderer is still at
large.
</P>
<P>
After Haq was killed in a mysterious air crash in 1988, Benazir
Bhutto, the leader of Pakistan People's Party, came to power and
tried hard to introduce democratic system in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the bloody politics can not be easily stopped due to
the complex elements in the Pakistani society and the loose
control of weapons.
</P>
<P>
Terrorist acts such as massive killings and bomb blasts have
been common these years, which are becoming one of the main menace
to the stability of the country.
</P>
<P>
The present Pakistani government led by Benazir Bhutto is
making all-out efforts to fight against terrorism and analyst here
believed that with the great efforts by the government, terrorism
and bloody politics could be put to an end in Pakistan in the
future.

<HEADLINE> NATO to Start Expansion Next Year, Says U.S. Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry said here today that the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) will begin its eastward expansion next year.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after meeting with his Finnish
counterpart, Anneli Taina, Perry said that NATO will start
negotiations in July next year with some countries which have
applied for NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
Not all countries applying for membership of the military
alliance could join it, he said, adding that those who are
qualified can be accepted in two or three years.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that NATO's eastward expansion does not mean a
threat to Russia and that it will take Russia's concerns into
consideration before taking in any new members.
</P>
<P>
Russia could not be excluded from the issue of European
security cooperation, said the U.S. official, who arrived here
earlier today on a two-day visit to Finland.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that Finland, with its special location and
history, can still play an important role as a bridge between the
West and the East, helping and urging Russia to join in European
security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Perry said Europe should form a "security ring," which can
include countries not joining NATO.
</P>
<P>
Finland is the first leg of Perry's Nordic tour, which will
also take him to Sweden, Denmark and Norway.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to attend a meeting on the security of the
Baltic region in Copenhagen, Denmark, and an informal meeting of
NATO defense ministers in Bergen, Norway.
</P>
<P>
Finland, which is militarily non-aligned, is not a NATO member
and is not pressing to join the alliance, as are its smaller
Baltic neighbors Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- After two years of lying
idle, the Tumen River Area, a triangular zone between China,
Russia and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, has again
become interesting to investors.
</P>
<P>
Local observers say the new investment craze is related to a

local governments.
</P>

Hunchun and Tumen cities in Jilin Province, cover the Chinese
part of Tumen River Area. This year, local governments of both
cities have been making greater efforts to improve infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
A railway between Hunchun and Tumen will be extended to Russia
and local governments are waiting for approval from the central
government on building a high-grade highway to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the area's prospects, a number of large foreign
investment projects have been introduced in Hunchun since, which
has taken the lead among the country's 14 coastal open cities in
terms of overseas investment.
</P>
<P>

LONDON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) finance
ministers laid a solid foundation today for three critical areas
of the monetary union, taking a great leap towards the realization
of a common currency, according to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, at their meeting in the Irish capital, reached
agreement on the setting up of a budget stability pact to punish
countries joining the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in 1999 if
they pursued lax budget policies.
</P>
<P>
There was consensus on the outline for a new Exchange Rate
Mechanism (ERM) which would link a new Euro currency to those not
participating in the EMU.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also agreed to clarify the legal basis for the
Euro as quickly as possible to install confidence among businesses
and financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference following the meeting, Irish
Finance Minister Ruairi Quinn predicted that any outstanding
issues would be resolved by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Issues still to be resolved include how much countries would be
fined for running annual deficits above 3 percent of the gross
domestic product and how long a government would have to put its
finances back in order before incurring a penalty.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed that a new ERM should be voluntary and
include relatively wide and flexible trading bands for currencies
outside the EMU zone.

<HEADLINE> Truce Monitor to Discuss Lebanese, Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 22 (Xinhua) -- International Monitors
overseeing a cease-fire in south Lebanon are scheduled to hold a
meeting today to study complaints lodged by Lebanon and Israel,
Lebanese foreign ministry sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that there are three complaints, two filed by
Lebanon and one by Israel, to be discussed by the cease-fire
monitoring committee comprising representative from the United
States, France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
This is the forth meeting of the committee, but the
first held at Lebanon's request. The previous three
meetings were called by the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The sources at the Lebanese Foreign Ministry said that
Lebanon on Thursday night lodged a complaint to the committee
against Israel's bombardments earlier that day at southern
Lebanese villages, which led to the wounding of two civilians.
</P>
<P>
In the complaint, the Lebanese government asked the
five-state committee to meet and discuss the complaint Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Two hours after the Lebanese complaint, Israel filed its
own complaint to the monitoring group, claiming that Hezbollah,
Lebanon's pro-Iranian Party of God, opened fire at Israeli
troops "from inside inhabited villages."
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Lebanon handed over its second complaint against
Israel because the Jewish state deported two Lebanese families
from the occupied border strip in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
David Greenlee, chairman of the cease-fire monitoring
committee, did not agreed on the Lebanese demand that the
meeting be held Saturday since it was rejected by
Israel on the grounds that the day was a holy day in the
Jewish state, the Lebanese official sources added.
</P>
<P>
The chairman, an American, decided Sunday morning as
the meeting time, while Lebanon made its conservation
on the date for Sunday is an official holiday in this
country, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
The committee was set up under a cease-fire understanding
reached by Lebanon and Israel on April 26, after some 200
Lebanese, mostly civilians, were killed in a two-week Israeli
blitz against Lebanese Moslem guerrillas in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Brokered by the U.S., the understanding bans the conflicting
sides from attacking at civilian targets and launching attacks
from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Lebanese National News Agency reported that the
Lebanese delegates would present to the committee some evidences
which would help justify the Lebanese complaints and refute
the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese delegates would bring with them a report
prepared by the U.N. peace-making forces in south Lebanon along
with some photographs, the official news agency added.
</P>
<P>
Tensions has been high in south Lebanon since last Thursday when
Hezbollah guerrillas ambushed an Israeli patrol in Israel's
self-proclaimed "security zone" in the area, killing two Israeli
soldiers and wounding some eight.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for the attack, Israel launched air raids
and bombardments at Iglim Al-Toffah, a ridge opposite the
occupied border strip, wounding two local villagers.
</P>
<P>
Israeli occupation forces and Hezbollah guerrillas traded fires
in the last two days, causing damages to each other.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Army has reinforced its positions in Western
Beqaa, guarding against possible Israeli attacks at southeastern
Lebanon, the state-run Lebanese National News Agency reported.

advertisements, telling people that Aids is not terrifying, it
can be prevented as long as people love themselves and preserve a
life style of pure mind.

<HEADLINE> Roundup:  China Makes Progress in Promoting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China has always attached
importance to the exploitation and use of renewable sources of
energy and made great progress in this field in the last decades.
</P>
<P>
Renewable sources of energy have become an indispensable and
integral part of China's current energy system, said Shi
Dinghuan, Director of the Industry Department of the State
Science and Technology Commission of China, during the World
Solar Summit, held here last Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Various kinds of renewable energies in China, which include
solar, hydro, wind, geothermal, tidal and biomass energies,
provide an equivalent of about 300 million metric tons of coal at
present, Shi added.
</P>
<P>
Renewable energy sources have played an important role in
promoting national economic development, alleviating the
shortages of conventional sources of energy in the remote and
border areas and reducing damage to eco-environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's achievements in the construction of mini hydropower
stations, each with a generating capacity of less than 25 MW, are
world-acclaimed. By now, there are more than 60,000 such
hydropower stations across the country, with an aggregate
installed generating capacity of 15,650 MW. Currently, 87 percent
of China's 900 million rural population have gained access to
electricity.
</P>
<P>
In afforestation for firewood in China, the achievements are
also remarkable. In the last 13 years, China has afforested over
4.72 million hectares of firewood forest, bringing the national
total to 5.4 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
New advances have been made in the technology for utilizing
firewood energy sources. Firewood-efficient stoves, which save
about one third of firewood consumption compared with the
conventional stoves, have been used in over half of the farm
households living in China's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
China began large-scale exploitation of biogas in the rural
areas as early as in the late 1950s. The last decades saw a stage
of steady development in the field. Some 5.25 million
methane-generating pits have hitherto been built across the
country, producing over 1.2 billion cubic meters of biogas a
year.
</P>
<P>
Of these biogas-generating pits, 600 are large and
medium-sized projects, each with an annual generating capacity of
more than 100 cubic meters. In addition to supplying biogas to
farm households, the biogas pits have also contributed greatly to
the environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
To further improve the use of biomass energy and increase
efficiency, China has conducted researches in the past years on
new technologies to turn agricultural and forestry refuses like
stalks into gas and liquefied fuel. Several projects have been
completed to demonstrate the new technology.

<HEADLINE> UN Officer: No Unusual Activity on Golan Heights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The situation on the
Golan Heights is calm with no signs of any unusual activities on
either the Syrian or Israeli sides, a U.N. observer, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post said that Johannes Kosters, the Dutch
commander of the U.N. Disengagement Observer Force on the Golan
(UNDOF), said in an interview with the newspaper that there had
not been any increase of tension or change in the military
situation on the Golan.
</P>
<P>
Kosters, who is stationed at the UNDOF's headquarters in
Damascus, made a special crossing Friday to the Israeli side
at Kuneitra for the interview with the Post. This was his first
interview with Israeli reporters since he took over as the UNDOF
commander 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
"I deal always in facts in my area, meaning the Golan Heights
from Mt. Hermon on the one side to the Jordan border on the
other. In this area there are no unusual things," said Kosters,
commenting on reports of troop movements on the Israeli and
Syrian sides.
</P>
<P>
"Looking at the inspections of the last two months, the
levels of troops, tanks, artillery, missiles and all these kinds
of things, are the same," he said, adding that recent military
exercises on both sides were normal and routine.
</P>
<P>
"So from my point of view, on the Golan areas, there
is no buildup of troops, no buildup of tension, so I cannot
support the reports in the newspapers," Kosters said.
</P>
<P>
The UNDOF was established in 1974 to maintain the ceasefire
agreement between Israel and Syria. Under the terms of the
agreement, there is a separation area between Israel and Syria
stretching 80 kilometers, where both sides are forbidden to
deploy any troops, armor, or artillery.
</P>
<P>
The UNDOF force, comprising 1,050 personnel from four
contributing countries, namely Canada, Japan, Poland and Austria,
carries out weekly inspections on both sides to ensure Israel and
Syria are adhering to the limitations.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the UNDOF had taken any precautions or changed
its procedures in light of the reports of tension between Israel
and Syrian, Kosters said that the UNDOF had an emergency plan in
the event of an outbreak of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
"This plan is executed in alert phases from green to red and
I can declare that I haven't started yet even to give the green
alert. Of course, we watch closer, we do a little bit more
patrolling, but there is no alert state yet," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The technology of using solar
energy has entered a new stage of development. Thanks to 10 years
of efforts, China now can produce solar water heaters, solar
stoves, passive solar houses and solar dryers.
</P>
<P>
Today, there are five million square meters of solar water
heaters across the country, 2.7 million square meters of passive
solar houses, 342,000 hectares of solar greenhouses, 140,000
solar stoves, and 20,000 square meters of solar dryers. And, the
development in this respect is gaining momentum.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1980s, China introduced from abroad seven
production lines of solar cells, increasing its yearly production
capacity to 4.5 MW. In terms of application, China uses solar
photovoltaic panels mainly in the communications systems and the
remote and border areas without electricity.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has built four solar photovoltaic power
stations in Tibet, each with a generating capacity ranging from
10 to 20 KW. Five others are under construction there.
</P>
<P>
In the development of wind energy, China has built 14 large
wind power stations in the northwest and southeast and more than
150,000 mini wind power generators are operating in the grassland
of Inner Mongolia in the north, Xinjiang and Qinghai in the
northwest and the coastal areas without power grids. They have a
total installed generating capacity of 47 MW.
</P>
<P>
China now can mass-produce mini wind power generators with a
capacity of less than 200 W. Small and medium-sized wind power
generating units of one to 20 KW are in the stage of small batch
production. It is now conducting researches on large wind power
generators of 50 to 200 KW.
</P>
<P>
In the development of geothermal resources, progress has also
been made. The geothermal resources utilized in China are now
equivalent to four million metric tons of coal.
</P>
<P>
The Yangbajing geothermal power plant in Tibet, the largest of
its kind in China, now has an aggregate installed capacity of 25
MW and produces 97 million KWH of electricity annually. It
provides 50 percent of the power needed in Lhasa, capital of
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
As to the exploitation and use of marine energy, China has, in
its coastal areas, built several tidal power stations, which have
a total installed capacity of 5.93 MW and produces 10.2 million
KWH of electricity a year. An experimental coastal wave power
station is under construction.
</P>
<P>
China has put stress in its rural areas in the development of
renewable energy sources, because many remote and border areas
and isolated islands off the coastal line cannot be linked with
the national power grids. People in these areas have to make use
of the local energy resources for power supply for themselves.
</P>
<P>
China has listed the development and use of renewable energy
sources as one of the priority areas in "China's Agenda 21." And,
it has recently blueprinted the "1996-2010 Outline on the
Development of New and Renewable Sources of Energy ".
</P>
<P>
It is expected, therefore, that China will make greater
achievements in the exploitation and utilization of renewable
sources and energy in the years to come.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientist Raises New Theory on Brain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSAlEM, September 22 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli scientist has
found an explanation for the connection between the brain's
evolution and the loss of its ability to repair itself, the
Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
This finding could lead to a technique for renewing the brain
neurons' ability to repair themselves after trauma, the post
reported, citihng a bulletin issued by Weizmann Institute of
Science based in Rehovot, Israel.
</P>
<P>
Such a technique could also allow damaged neurons in mammals'
central nervous system (including the spinal cord) to recover,
especially the ability to facilitate movement by the muscles, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of a way to "reeducate" immune system cells and
renew their connection with the brain has just been published in
the journal of the American Society for Experimental Biology,
FASEB.
</P>
<P>
The work was carried out by Professor Michal Schwartz of the
Weizmann neuro-biology department, along with Dr. Ayre Solomon
of Sheba Hospital's eye research students Orli Lazarov- Spiegler
and David Hirschberg.
</P>
<P>
They explained that evolution usually led to important
improvements in higher species, but sometimes resulted in the
loss of beneficial functions. Lower animals such as fish can
repair nerves that have been damaged, while humans and other
mammals cannot.
</P>
<P>
In lower animals, damaged nervous tissues alert the immune
system's microphages to remove dead cells and heal wounds. But
in higher animals, the body does not call for help. Why this is
so has puzzled scientists for many years. Schartz says mammals
have a mechanism that protects the central nervous system from
the immune system to protect the stability of new connections of
neurons created in individuals by learning and
understanding.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Holocaust Education Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Holocaust education
in Israel has taken to the information highways with a project
created to integrate the Holocaust studies into computers.
</P>
<P>
The Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority, or
Yad Vashem, has launched a multi-faceted 45 million dollar
project, Yad Vashem 2001, to computerize its educational
materials and documentations system on the Holocaust education.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, an International School for Holocaust
Studies was created at Yad Vashem for training teachers and
developing innovative educational materials. In addition, its
educational materials and documentations system are expected to
be completely computerized by the year 1999.
</P>
<P>
Yad Vashem, long considered a venerable old-fashioned Jerusalem
institution that informed and educated the public mostly through
visits to its museum, decided to take the 21-century approach
under the pressure of rapid revolution in communications,
culture and society.
</P>
<P>
"The world," said Yad Vashem Chairman Avner Shalev, "is
rapidly advancing towards the close of the second millennium
under the pressure of the cultural universalism characteristic
of an open-market economy, hyper-consumerism, the world
communications revolution and a flood of boundary-reducing
tourism."
</P>
<P>
Yad Vashem is hurrying to collect and transfer from Europe to
Jerusalem numerous documents that might otherwise disappear; it
is also videotaping survivor testimonies, in cooperation with
U.S. film director Steven Spielberg's Visual History Foundation.
</P>
<P>
One of the first fruits of this effort was a CD-ROM
called The Return to Life, the first multi-media program of
its kind aimed at school children and the general public to
teach the history of the aftermath of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
Produced in both Hebrew and English, it cost some 250,000
dollars to make, much of it donated by Canadian businessman
Leslie Dan.
</P>
<P>
The computer disk was the result of a year's work by Yad
Vashem's unit for the development of educational programs in
the International School with the help from the Israeli
multimedia company Icons.
</P>
<P>
The well-planned and extremely moving disk brings to life
the stories of the Holocaust survivors, many of them gave
on-the-scene explanations of the historical events in World War
II.

The UNIP stand was reiterated at its 31st national council
session that was opened in Kabwe, Central Province, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
UNIP Central Province Chairman Richard Banda said the party is
convinced that Kaunda is the right candidate and the issue is not
debatable.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, ''at no time can UNIP be swayed and dictated to
on the choice of its leader, all parties are free to choose a
leader of their choice.''
</P>
<P>
Kaunda in his speech said that the party was meeting at a time
when Zambia was in a ''deep crisis socially and economically''.
</P>
<P>
Party spokesman Bweendo Mulengela said the general feeling
among delegates at the council was that if Kaunda is barred from
standing in the presidential election and the issue of voters
cards prepared by the Israeli Nikuv Company is not fully
resolved, then UNIP might boycott the polls.
</P>
<P>
According to an constitution amendment adopted earlier this
year, only the second indigenous generation Zambians are
qualified to be president of the state. This actually bars Kaunda
from standing in the forthcoming general elections as his parents
immigrated to Zambia from neighboring Malawi before the country
got independence.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties argue that the new constitution is not
impartial and they demand it be repealed.
</P>
<P>
However, the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy insists
that the constitution amendment was adopted in parliament and
signed by the president so that everybody should abide by it.

<HEADLINE> Deportation of Nigerians From Benin to Be Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The federal government of
Nigeria has called for full investigations into the questionable
manner in which some 2,000 Nigerians were deported from the Benin
republic recently.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper Sunday Punch, the situation at the
border post in Seme town at the Nigeria-Benin border is still
sense as more people are still being deported.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a Nigerian immigration officers at the
border as saying that Nigerians were bundled out of Cotonou of
Benin Republic in a ''despicable and undiplomatic way''.
</P>
<P>
''Imagine Nigerians being packed in a trailer, like cows,''
the officer said, adding that ''it's very unfortunate that
Nigerians should be treated in such a way.''
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Beninoise authority claimed that
their action followed consistent cases of armed robbery attacks
in Cotonou allegedly by Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
But sources at the Nigerian border said the claim cannot be
substantiated.
</P>
<P>
''There are other civil ways to deal with armed robbery
incidents, if that was the case indeed, but i doubt the claim.
There is more to the deportation than the claim of armed robbery
attack,'' a source said.

DALIAN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Resource-abundant Guizhou
Province in southwest China is welcoming entrepreneurs in Dalian
to set up firms in the province.
</P>
<P>
Vice governor Hu Xiansheng, said Guizhou Province would like to
carry out long-term cooperation with Dalian, a port city in the
northeast, as the two areas complement each other economically.
</P>
<P>
At a recent conference held in Dalian, Hu said Guizhou has over
3,700 plants for traditional Chinese herbal medicine, accounting
for 80 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
The province also ranks seventh in the country in terms of
waterpower resources that can be developed. Proven reserves of
coal in Guizhou surpassed the total amount of those in nine
provinces or regions south of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
After years of development, the once-disadvantaged province has
scored successes in six sectors, including energy, raw materials,
chemicals, mechanical and electronics, brand-name cigarettes and
wines, and tourism highlighted by natural scenery and ethnic
culture.
</P>
<P>
Hu said his province will offer a range of favorable policies
to investors from Dalian.

<HEADLINE> Syria Blames Israel for Sabotaging Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Syrian newspapers blamed
today Israel for sabotaging peace process.
</P>
<P>
To set up a greater Israel has been Netanyahu government's
policy since he came into power three months ago, said Syrian
newspaper Al-Thawara in its editorial.
</P>
<P>
Israel's intensification of tension in the region indicates
that Israel wants to take advantage of the U.S. preoccupation
with its current presidential election campaign so as to serve
its own policy of delaying and sabotaging the Middle East
peace process, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is an essential and pressing need to both the Middle
East and the entire world. Syria, together with all the Arab
nations, has shown readiness to achieve peace, while Israel has
failed to do so," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It urged the U.S. to act firmly to press Israel to abide by
and "implement the peace foundations."
</P>
<P>
Another Syrian newspaper, Teshreen, described today in its
editorial the actual practices of the Israeli leaders as a
"flagrant violation" of the foundations of the Middle East peace
process and relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu has dropped the land-for-peace principle and
replaced it by peace-for-peace or peace-for-security principle,
the paper complained.
</P>
<P>
Al-baath, mouthpiece of the Syrian ruling party, today also
accused Israel of taking the redeployment of Syrian forces in
Lebanon as a pretext for intensifying its "aggression and seeking
to undermine the peace process."

<P>
MOGADISHU, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior officer from the
USC/SNA led by Osman Hassan Ali Atto has been murdered in his
house in Waberi district of south Mogadishu by four to six gunmen
driving a new white Toyota.
</P>
<P>
Abdi Abshir Kahie, Press Secretary of USC/SNA, was killed late
last night by the gunmen who proceeded to the sleeping room and
shot him right on his bed after his wife opened the door.
</P>
<P>
So far, no group has claimed the responsibility of the
killing. However, Osman Atto's group put the blame on Hussein
Aidid's faction.
</P>
<P>
Kahie, a close relative of Osman Atto living in the
territories controlled by Hussein Aidid, was an outspoken critic
to the government of Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Osman Atto's faction said the killing was a politically
motivated act aimed at silencing what they called those peace
activities.
</P>
<P>
Kahie was lately deeply engrossed in pacifying Bermuda area
opening all the main roads and markets in the area. He was lately
living in north Mogadishu for his safety and just before his
death came to south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Kahie had said in a press release that he was being hunted by
Hussein Aidid's security men.
</P>
<P>
Osman Atto was the former finance minister of Hussein Aidid
who was killed in early August during fightings with the North
Mogadishu warlord in alliance with Osman Atto.

<P>
MACAO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of voters queued up
in the courtyard of a school, waiting quietly for their turn to
cast ballots, with some fluttering pieces of paper to cool
themselves as the weather was hot and humid.
</P>
<P>
The voting was basically in good order since it started at
nine o'clock this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Legislative Assembly (LA) has a total of 23 seats
out of which eight are directly elected, another eight indirectly
elected by interest groups and the remaining seven appointed by
the Macao governor.
</P>
<P>
The new LA will be the sixth in Macao. It will straddle the
handover to China on December 20, 1999 to become the first LA of
the Macao Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
"I think the voting is very important since it is near 1999,"
said a middle-aged man surnamed Luo who was waiting outside the
school that is used as a polling station. "Macao will be governed
by the people of Macao, and I would vote for someone who has high
conscience and will do good for the public rather than for
himself."
</P>
<P>
Most of those casting ballots this morning are middle-aged
voters. It is said that the peak period of casting votes will
arrive at about seven to eight o'clock before the end of the
balloting.
</P>
<P>
Bus companies have arranged more buses to carry people to the
14 voting stations the authorities set up in the Macao peninsula
and its two islands. Some 60 percent of the 116,000 registered
voters are expected to participate in the polling today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 62 people in 12 groups are competing for the eight
seats that are up for direct election. They represent the
interests of different groups ranging from the labor, neighborhood
associations, business, liberal organizations and others.
</P>
<P>
The polling will end at 8:00 p.m., and the counting of votes
will follow immediately. But the result will not be known until
midnight Sunday.

<P>
LONDON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Brazil won a 4-1 Davis Cup
World Group qualifying game over Austria after Thomas Muster left
court in the doubles match at Sao Paolo, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
According to the London-based International Tennis Federation,
Muster, in protest of the behavior of Brazilian fans, defaulted
the match that gave Brazil a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
Muster also was disqualified from playing in Sunday's reverse
singles and now faces the the possibility of a suspension from
future Davis Cup matches.
</P>
<P>
When the Austrian team declined to play Sunday's two remaining
singles, the match was abandoned and Brazil declared a 4-1 winner.
</P>
<P>
Muster, ranked third by the ATP Tour, complained that someone
in the Sao Paulo crowd was blinding him with a mirror in his
doubles match with partner Udo Pamberger against Brazil's Jaime
Oncins and Gustavo Kuerten.
</P>
<P>
He also accused Brazilian fans of making noise and insulting
him and he walked off court with the Brazilians leading 2-0 in the
final set.
</P>
<P>
However, the Portugal referee Antonio Flores Marques said that
Muster's complaints were not justifiable. According to a ITF
statement, the issue will be considered again by the Davis Cup
Committee at their meeting in London on October 7.

<HEADLINE> China to Speed Up Development of SDH Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese telecommunications
experts urged the government to accelerate the development of
synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) technology, the most advanced
high-speed optical transmission method, so as to reinforce its
information superhighway infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Scientists with the Fourth Institute of Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications said that the localization drive of SDH
technology can effectively lower the prices of foreign SDH
products, which dominated Chinese market for years, and give rise
to the country's fledgling information industry, according to
People's Posts and Telecommunications News.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they said, China's SDH industry should be blessed
with a high technical benchmark through closely tracing and
importing the latest achievements in global microelectronics
research.
</P>
<P>
They said that the government should stick to the industrial
policy of "exchanging technologies for markets," and encourage the
foreign companies to set up development and research centers in
China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the SDH products of Lucent Technologies,
formerly AT&AMP;T system and network business, account for 80 per cent
of the sales in the country.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the company made a deal with Ministry of Posts
and Telecommunications to install its SDH systems to the
Beijing-Jiujiang-Guangzhou and Beijing-Wuhan-Guangzhou optical
cables, so as to form a high-speed information corridor between
the north and south.

<HEADLINE> Qualified Officials Crucial to Development: Hu Jintao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Better-qualified officials
who guide their work with the Chinese Communist Party's basic
theory, guidelines and principles are needed for the healthy
development of reform and construction, according to a
high-ranking CPC official.
</P>
<P>
During a recent trip to southwest China's Sichuan Province, Hu
Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee, said that
the overall quality of officials should be improved -- especially
their political quality -- to ensure the healthy development of
China's reform and economic construction.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee, made an inspection tour of Sichuan from September 14 to
21.
</P>
<P>
He said he was pleased to see marked improvement in the living
conditions of residents of Sichuan, China's most heavily populated
province, which is also one of the country's largest grain
producers.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that local people should concentrate on improving
agriculture technology and infrastructure, as well as the
development of a diversified economy.
</P>
<P>
Hu pointed out that in Chengdu, the provincial capital, the
reform and development of state enterprises is not only a pressing
economic issue, but also one of major political importance.
</P>
<P>
He said that the decreasing profits of certain enterprises show
that those businesses still have not adapted to the changes and
needs of both the domestic and overseas markets, and that some
fundamental problems still exist in the firms' operations and
management.
</P>
<P>
While visiting the Three Gorges reservoir area, Hu said he
hoped that local officials will take the whole situation into
account, in order to ensure the smooth going of all work and
sustainable development of the local economy.
</P>
<P>
Hu said great achievements have been made in Sichuan since
1978, when the country adopted the reform and opening-up policy,
adding that the province should seize the current opportunities
and create a brighter future.

JERUSALEM, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A 100-day
rat-extermination campaign has begun in the Palestinian
Authority (PA)-ruled Gaza Strip, to avoid health, economic and
agricultural hazards, according to a report by the Palestinian
newspaper, The Jerusalem Times.
</P>
<P>
Khamis Al-Najjar, Director-General of the PA Health Ministry
and a member of the Rodent Control Committee, said that the
campaign started late last week.
</P>
<P>
Technical supervisors who had been given training would be
deployed with their assistants throughout the Gaza Strip to
examine the places where rats are found, said Al-Najjar.
</P>
<P>
"Their job is to exterminate the rats to avoid health,
economic and agricultural hazards," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to scientific estimates, there are around 3 million
rats throughout the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Najjar said, "This campaign is different from the previous
ones organized by the municipalities and village councils in
terms of scale."
</P>
<P>
"The problem becomes bigger when we know that every pair of
breeding rats can multiply into 5,000 during their lifetime," the
PA official said.
</P>
<P>
The poison used in the campaign is one of the best and the
most effective. It has never been used before. The effect of the
poison appears after four or five days.
</P>
<P>
Numerous precautions have been taken so that the poison would
not affect people. Health centers have been told about the
treatment that should be given if they receive any case. In
addition to this, a concerted health education campaign will
inform every individual in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is being launched jointly by the PA Ministries of
Health, Labor, Agriculture, Education and Local Government.

MACAO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- An unprecedented number of
74,964 voters join in the election of Macao's last Legislative
Assembly (LA) today despite humid weather and heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
That number accounts for 64.38 percent of the 116,000
registered voters in Macao, and is higher than the estimated 60
percent. The voting rate in 1992 election was 59.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The surge in the number of actual voters and the increase of
candidates, which rose to 62 of 12 groups, show that Macao people
are becoming increasingly confident of their future, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Joaquim Carvalho, a Macao Government official in charge of
election affairs, told reporters that he was quite satisfied with
the enthusiasm of voters, saying that it has hit the government
expectations.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in the number of candidates indicates that people
are paying more attention to the election," said Tang Chou Kei,
deputy editor-in-chief of the Va Kio newspaper. "They also wish a
better future for Macao. The enthusiasm will help the society move
in a positive way."
</P>
<P>
Counting of the votes started immediately after the vote. The
final result will not be known until midnight, according to the
Macao Regional Election Committee, which takes charge of the
election affairs.
</P>
<P>
Today's voting was basically in good order. Within balloting
period from nine o'clock this morning to eight o'clock in the
evening, the number of people grew steadily despite a heavy rain in
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A total of eight members of the LA will be directly elected
today. The Macao LA has a total of 23 seats. Besides the eight
directly-elected seats, eight other seats are indirectly elected by
interest groups and the remaining seven are appointed by the Macao
governor.
</P>
<P>
The authorities established 14 voting sites in the Macao
peninsula and its two islands. Bus companies increased buses to
carry people to the voting sites.
</P>
<P>
The 12 competing groups represent the interest of different
groups ranging from the labor, neighborhood associations, business
to liberal organizations, among others.

BONN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Bayern Munich allowed Juergen
Klinsmann to leave the club on a free transfer at the end of the
season, a German newspaper said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Welt am Sonntag weekly said it had learned from "a

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Continues Reinforcing Troops near </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The command of the Lebanese
army announced this afternoon that it continued "sending
additional reinforcements" to the southern part of the Beqaa
Valley facing the border strip occupied by Israel in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued through the state-run Lebanese National
News Agency, the army command said that "the army was going on
sending additional reinforcements to the area of Western Beqaa."
</P>
<P>
"Military convoys of the army were witnessed this morning
moving towards Western Beqaa to take precautions against any
possible Israeli aggression," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese army started to reinforce its troops in Western
Beqaa Saturday when it sent a contingent of its special forces to
the area, opposite the western part of the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces were also transferring more and more troops and
equipment into the buffer zone day by day, security sources in
the area reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes carried out frequent reconnaissance flights
at medium and high altitudes over south Lebanon this morning and
in the afternoon, breaking sound barriers in the sky, witnesses
in the area reported.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have shrouded the last active battlefront of the
Arab-Israeli conflict since Thursday when guerrillas of the
Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, ambushed an
Israeli patrol in the buffer zone, killing two Israeli soldiers
and wounding more than eight others.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for the operation, the Israeli forces launched
successive air raids and violent bombardments at Iglim
Al-Toffah, a mountain area some 60 kilometers southeast of
Beirut, wounding two local villagers.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas attacked an Israeli patrol Saturday,
destroying an Israeli armored vehicle, and Israel admitted that
an Israeli officer was wounded in the attack taking place inside
the 1,100-square-kilometer border strip.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli occupation forces and Hezbollah guerrillas traded
fire in the last two days, causing damages to each other.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and the Jewish state have lodged complaints against
each other to a five-state group overseeing a limited truce in
south Lebanon, which was set up under a cease-fire understanding
reached between the two sides in April.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon accused Israel of violating the U.S.-brokered
understanding by bombarding southern Lebanese villages and
wounding local civilians.
</P>
<P>
Israel, on the other hand, claimed that Hezbollah guerrillas
launched attacks at Israeli forces "from inside inhabited
villages," thus infringing the understanding which bans any
attack at or from civil areas.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire monitoring committee started a meeting today in
the southern Lebanese border town of Naqura, to consider two
Lebanese complaints and another filed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
All delegates from the committee's five member states, namely
the United States, France, Israel, Syrian and Lebanon, attended
the closed-door meeting in the headquarters of the
U.N. peace-keeping forces in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
This is the forth meeting of the committee, but the first
held at Lebanon's request. The previous three meetings were
called by the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the "security zone" in south Lebanon in
1985 as a buffer to shield its northern Jewish settlements from
cross-border guerrilla attacks. Lebanon has demanded that Israel
withdraw from south Lebanon in compliance with U.N. resolution
425 without any condition.

<HEADLINE> Cease-Fire Monitors Meet in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Monitors of an international
group overseeing a limited truce between Lebanon and Israel held
a meeting at a south Lebanese border town today to consider
complaints lodged by the two countries against each other.
</P>
<P>
Three complaints, two filed by Lebanon and one by Israel, were
discussed by the cease-fire monitoring committee comprising
representative from the United States, France, Syria, Lebanon
and Israel, well-informed Lebanese official sources said.
</P>
<P>
This was the forth meeting of the committee, but the first
held at Lebanon's request. The previous three meetings were
called by the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The committee was set up under a cease-fire understanding
reached by Lebanon and Israel on April 26, after some 200
Lebanese, mostly civilians, were killed in a two-week Israeli
blitz in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The closed-door meeting started at 10:00 a.m. (07:00 GMT) in
the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping forces in south Lebanon
at the coastal town of Naqura.
</P>
<P>
The delegates of the five state left the venue around 4:30
p.m. (13:30 GMT) without issuing any statement.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Lebanese delegation said that the committee
would hold another meeting Tuesday to resume the discussions
which were paused at the request of Israel for a ceremony in the
Jewish state tonight celebrating Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
In the two complaints lodged to the committee, Lebanon accused
the Jewish state of violating the U.S.-brokered cease-fire
understanding by bombarding southern Lebanese villages and
causing damages and civilian casualties Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It also accused Israel of deporting two Lebanese families from
the occupied border strip in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel, in its own complaint filed to the monitoring group,
claimed that guerrillas of Hezbollah, Lebanon's pro-Iranian Party
of God, opened fire at Israeli troops "from inside inhabited
villages."
</P>
<P>
The April understanding bans the conflicting sides from
attacking at civilian targets or launching attacks from civilian
areas.
</P>
<P>
David Greenlee, chairman of the cease-fire monitoring
committee, stressed that the situations in south Lebanon were
still "under control."
</P>
<P>
Before today's meeting, the American chief delegate called on
the parties concerned to prevent the south Lebanese situations
from turning into a "big explosion."
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Washington had intensified its consultations
 with Israel and asked the Israeli government of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to maintain an "acceptable degree of
stability" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have shrouded southern Lebanon since last Thursday
when Hezbollah guerrillas ambushed an Israeli patrol in Israel's
self-proclaimed "security zone" in the area, killing two Israeli
soldiers and wounding more than eight others.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for the attack, Israel launched air raids and
bombardments at Iglim Al-Toffah, a ridge opposite the occupied
border strip, wounding two local villagers.
</P>
<P>
Israeli occupation forces and Hezbollah guerrillas traded
fires in the last two days, causing damages to each other.
</P>
<P>
Israel admited that an officer of the Israeli army was wounded
when an armored vehicle was hit by anti-tank rockets inside the
buffer zone Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese army reinforced its positions in the southern
part of Beqaa Valley, opposite the 1,100-square-kilometer
"security zone", Saturday and today.

<HEADLINE> Macao LA Election Ends With High Turnout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- An unprecedented number of
74,964 voters braved humid weather and heavy rains to cast their
ballots today in the last election of Macao's Legislative Assembly
(LA) before China resumes its exercise of sovereignty over the
region in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Official figures showed that 64.38 percent of the 116,000
registered voters in Macao went to the polls today as compared
with the estimated 60 percent. The voter turnout in the 1992
election was 59.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The surge in the number of actual voters and the increase of
candidates, which rose to 62 of 12 groups, show that Macao people
are becoming increasingly confident of their future, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
Joaquim Carvalho, a Macao Government official in charge of
election affairs, told reporters that he was quite satisfied with
the enthusiasm of voters, saying that it has met the government
expectations.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in the number of candidates indicates that people
are paying more attention to the election," said Tang Chou Kei,
deputy editor-in-chief of the Va Kio newspaper. "They also wish a
better future for Macao. The enthusiasm will help the society move
in a positive way."
</P>
<P>
Counting of the votes started immediately after the vote. The
final results will not be known until midnight, according to the
Macao Regional Election Committee, which takes charge of the
election affairs.
</P>
<P>
Today's voting was basically in good order. Within the
balloting period from nine o'clock this morning to eight o'clock
in the evening, the number of people grew steadily despite a heavy
rain in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A total of eight members of the 23-seat LA will be directly
elected today, while eight are indirectly elected by interest
groups and the remaining seven are appointed by the Macao
governor.
</P>
<P>
The authorities established 14 voting sites in the Macao
peninsula and its two islands. Bus companies increased buses to
carry people to the voting sites.
</P>
<P>
The 12 competing groups represent the interests of different
groups ranging from the labor, neighborhood associations, business
 to liberal organizations, among others.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi
Province, a coal production giant, is planning to expand its coal
export and promote the opening-up drive by making a full use of
its coal resource advantage.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, Shanxi, the country's largest
coal energy base, has verified reserves of 220 billion tons. It
currently produces 300 million tons of coal a year, accounting for
one quarter of the country's total output.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 million tons of the province's annual coal production
is transferred to support industrial production in areas outside
Shanxi, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said many foreign investors have offered to
import Shanxi's coal as compensation trade, in order to invest in
this north China province.

be built during the Ninth Five-Year-Plan Period (1995-2000) and
will have a total generating capacity of 1.2 million kw, will
serve as an experiment for wooing investment from businessmen from
the Republic of Korea, using coal as compensation trade.
</P>
<P>
At present, coal exports are now under state control in China,
and it is necessary to obtain quotas and permits for their
export. Last year, the province exported coal worth 265 million
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Taiwanese Investors Zealous About Property Development in Fuzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Taiwanese investors are
enthusiastic about real estate development in the east China city
of Fuzhou.
</P>
<P>
There are now 74 Taiwanese-invested real estate firms in Fuzhou,
capital of Fujian Province, or one fourth of the total
joint-venture real estate firms in the city.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, developers from Taiwan built
251,000 square meters of housing in Fuzhou, up 13.3 percent over
the same period a year ago. In the January-June period, they
invested 190 million yuan (about 23 million US dollars), a rise of
50.5 from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that there are three major reasons for Taiwanese
investors' zest for Fuzhou's real estate development.
</P>
<P>
Fuzhou is located opposite Taiwan and is close to Hong Kong and
Macao. As long as the direct exchanges of mail, trade. air and
shipping services across the Taiwan Straits are realized, Fuzhou
will be the province's prime investment site for Taiwanese
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
As Fujian's capital, and an area with a broad hinterland,
Fuzhou is considered by Taiwan investors as the best spot in the
province in which to work or live.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the local real estate market situation, the
Fuzhou city government has adopted flexible policies to encourage
Taiwanese businessmen to make investments. It recently dropped
eight miscellaneous overcharges in connection with real estate
development made by management departments. It also lowered the
fees of six items in this sector to guarantee the rate of returns
for developers.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said the city has also improved the investment
environment in the city's investment and development zones, in a
move to promote the healthy development of real estate.

Reserves and the World Natural and Cultural Heritage by the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
</P>

<HEADLINE> Fertilizer Plant Fined for Polluting Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Guizhou Fertilizer Plant
has been fined more than 1.68 million yuan (about 210,000 US
dollars) for discharging industrial wastewater into a local lake,
killing more than two million kilograms of fish.
</P>
<P>
The Guizhou Provincial Higher People's Court recently handed
down the decision after a year-long trial.
</P>
<P>
In late September 1994, 2.21 million kilograms of fish bred in
Hongfeng Lake in southwest China's Guizhou Province, perished due
to sudden water pollution. The loss is valued at 2.08 million yuan
(about 260,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Investigators determined that the lake had been polluted by the
plant's industrial wastewater discharge.
</P>
<P>
Five plaintiffs, who are the breeders of the dead fish, filed a
lawsuit against the Guizhou Fertilizer Plant.
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, China has issued 16 resource and environmental
protection laws and a series of administrative regulations and
rules. Meanwhile, 200 local laws and more than 1,000 local
administrative regulations have gone into effect.
