<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Threatens to Reject Peace Process Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein, the political wing of
the Irish Republican Army (IRA), warned Britain on Saturday not to
halt the early release of jailed republican guerrillas in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein's chief negotiator Martin McGuinness told BBC radio
that any suspension of the release would be a "serious mistake"
that could affect whether they take part in the review of the Good
Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said it was far from certain Sinn Fein would take part in
the peace process review and that stopping prisoner releases would
throw its participation further into question.
</P>
<P>
"I think that any sanction on the prisoners, coming on top of
all of that, could have very serious repercussions for Sinn Fein's
participation in any review," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mo Mowlam, Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary, hinted on
Friday she might suspend the early release of guerrilla prisoners
if she decided that the IRA had broken its two-year-old ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
But Mowlam signalled she would not expel Sinn Fein from next
month's review of the "Good Friday" accord even if she decided
that the IRA had broken the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The IRA truce has been questioned following the murder of a
taxi driver in Belfast last month.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam has received security briefings on the incidents and is
expected to give her verdict in the coming week.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Formulates Food Security Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has formulated a
program aimed at improving the country's food security, Ethiopian
News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The program is deemed to enable Ethiopia to become
self-sufficient in food, Niway Gebre-Ab, economic advisor in the
office of Prime Minister Meles Zanawi, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
By making the program, the government is exerting efforts to
minimize the number of people in the rural areas being affected by
shortage of food, Niway said.
</P>
<P>
A food crisis occurred in Ethiopia since March this year which
witnessed drought in many parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Some 4.6 million people have been affected in this Horn of
Africa country, an official statistics said.
</P>
<P>
A number of countries and world organizations have made
donations to Ethiopia in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
Although the world community has been offering food aid for
years, Ethiopia, with a population of 60 million and depending on
natural harvest, has never escaped from food shortage.
</P>
<P>
According to Niway, about two million people in the rural areas
need relief food even when there is regular rainfall.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian acting Agriculture Minister Mengistu Huluka Friday
appealed to the people of the whole country to exert efforts to
tackle the problems of food shortage and drought.
</P>
<P>
In addition to farmers, private entrepreneurs have also been
urged to play a significant role in developing the agricultural
sector of the national economy.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Raises Gasoline Price Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese government Saturday
imposed a price hike on gasoline in view of rising international
oil prices, the third time in four months.
</P>
<P>
The price hike amounts to 300 Lebanese pounds (about 20
U.S. cents) per 20 liters of gasoline, the Voice of the People
radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The new hike brought the prices up to 13,200 pounds (about 8.8
dollars) for 20 liters of unleaded or 98 Octane gasoline, with
regular going up to 12,900 pounds (about 8.6 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Oil Minister Suleiman Traboulsi told the radio that without
such a price rise, the government would lose 13 billion pounds
(about 8.67 million dollars) a week in revenue due to rising oil
prices on the world market.
</P>
<P>
The government had imposed a 400-pound (about 27 cents) hike on
gasoline prices last Thursday, in addition to tacking on a charge
of 1,000 pounds (about 67 cents) on each 10 kilograms of butane.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government funds accrued from a 2,000-
pound (about 1.33 dollars) surtax on oil prices in April have
already been eaten up by increasing oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The increase has triggered outcries from consumers, who said
they could not afford the extra charges as the country is in an
economic recession.
</P>
<P>
In the streets in Beirut, gas stations claimed that they
had run out of supplies as fuel distributors have reportedly
refused supply in protest against the increase.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Girl Rescued After Being Trapped for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A nine-year-old Israeli girl
was rescued Saturday from the rubble of a building in Turkey that
collapsed more than four days ago in a devastating earthquake,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Shiran Franco was flown home for medical treatment hours after
she was dug out at about 4 a.m. (0100 GMT) Saturday by an Israeli
army rescue team in the town of Cinarcik, 50 kilometers south of
Istanbul, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Doctors described her general condition as "good" except
suffering from dehydration. She will be relieved from hospital in
about two or three days, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Franco and her family were vacationing in Cinarcik when the
apartment they stayed in was toppled by the shattering
earthquake, which has killed more than 10,000 people so far.
</P>
<P>
Franco's mother managed to escape from the flattened building
30 hours after it collapsed. The body of Franco's twin brother,
Arye, was found Saturday, and her father and grandparents are
still missing.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli army rescue team searching for the Franco family
had almost given up hope until they heard her call for help. It
took the rescuers only an hour to free her from the ruins.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers who rescued Franco almost burst into tears when
she spoke to them, according to a special film broadcasting on
Israel's Channel One.
</P>
<P>
Besides emergency supplies, Israel has sent more than 380
rescue workers and doctors as well as sniffer dogs to Turkey to
help in the search for survivors.
</P>
<P>
It also set up a field hospital that is equipped with an
intensive-care unit and a 100-bed ward. Two babies were born in
the hospital, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli team has rescued seven people alive and found 72
bodies, the radio said. Among the 14 Israelis who were trapped in
collapsed buildings, six were rescued alive, five confirmed dead
and three still missing.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which keeps close ties with Israel, is also a popular
holiday destination for Israelis. All the 14 Israelis went to
Turkey for vacationing, the radio said.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Asks U.N. to Provide Emergency Help to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Liberian Government said Saturday
that the country does not have the means to cope with the
worsening refugee flood issue from the fighting areas between
government troops and rebels and appealed to the international
community for help.
</P>
<P>
Liberian Information Minister Joe Mulbah said that the United
Nations should give his country urgent food and medical aid to
help tide off the worsening humanitarian emergency in the northern
part of the country, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Mulbah said towns in the fighting areas along the
Liberian-Guinean border towns were being burnt in "rampant acts
of arson" -- with thousands of civilians caught in the cross
fire, and an unknown number killed.
</P>
<P>
He said government forces were exerting "all efforts to stop
civilian casualties".
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), which
says it hopes to be able to return to the area soon, pulled its
staff out of the region last week because of the security
situation and the taking of hostages by rebels.
</P>
<P>
A World Food Program official indicated today in Monrovia that
international aid organizations might not be able to provide
immediate relief to the remote-fighting region. Earlier this
week the government announced the capture of the towns of Foya,
Kolahun and Medekoma. But the government troops' further offensive
is believed to be difficult.
</P>
<P>
The fighting began last week when armed insurgents crossed into
Lofa County from neighboring Guinea. Liberian Government had
declared a state of emergency in the area and accused Guinea of
providing support for the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Guinean President Lansana Conte latter denied Liberia's charge
and accused the Liberian authorities of ingratitude toward his
country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Africa No 1 radio, Conte said, "Guinea continues to
give assistance and to harbor thousands of Liberian refugees."

rains have hit Iran's northern province of Gazvin, killing 19

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- "Everyone knows that there is only
one China in the world, the government of the People's Republic of
China is the sole legitimate government representing the whole of
China, and that Taiwan is an inseparable part of the Chinese
territory," a speaker told a seminar here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Solving the Taiwan issue and reunifying the motherland is the
common aspiration of all Chinese people," Engineer F.R. Siddiqui,
president of the Bangladesh-China Cultural, Economic and Mass
Communication Center (BCCEMCC), told the seminar on "Peaceful
Reunification of Taiwan to the Motherland."
</P>
<P>
The seminar was organized by the BCCEMCC and was attended by
some 80 scholars, diplomats, politicians and dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui's remarks and attempts to separate China received
strong condemnation by all the Chinese, including the Taiwan
compatriots and the people of Chinese origin in other parts of the
world, and met with objection from the international community as
well, he said.
</P>
<P>
China is continuing to gain greater international status, and
the United Nations and the great majority of the countries in the
world now recognize that there is only one China and Taiwan is
part of Chinese territory, he said.
</P>
<P>
Though the two sides of the Taiwan Straits have remained in a
state of separation for 50 years, history and reality have proved
that the "two states" statement by Lee Teng-hui is absurd,
Siddiqui observed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leadership have made unremitting efforts to
seriously implement the policies of "peaceful reunification" and
"one country, two systems," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
There is only one China in the world and the status of Taiwan
as a part of China remains unchanged, he said. "China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity brook no separation."

According to the paper, the loss of the tablets was made known
to officials only when the Cultural Heritage Organization decided
to hold an exhibition of ancient Iranian tablets. Moqoddam was
then summoned to the court and questioned.
</P>
<P>
An informed source told the daily that some newspapers in 1995
had run stories on the disappearance of the tablets, but Moqaddam
had refused to take any measures or report it to officials
responsible. This persuaded the court to issue a warrant for his
arrest.
</P>
<P>
The two identical precious tablets date back to more than
3,000 years ago. They were discovered during excavation
operations in the Persepolis historical site near the southern
city of Shiraz about 60 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Faction Leader in Cairo for Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The leader of an major
Palestinian opposition group arrived in Cairo on Saturday for a
meeting with Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Chairman
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Nayef Hawatmeh, secretary general of the Democratic Front for
the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), is to lead his group's
delegation to the meeting with that of Fatah, led by Arafat, on
Sunday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first meeting between the two men and also the
two groups since the 1993 signing of the Oslo accord between the
PLO and Israel, which forms the basis of the two sides' peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Fatah, PLO's most powerful faction, is the major force to
support the Oslo accord while the Damascus-based DFLP, PLO's third
largest group, opposes the peace agreement and the peace talks
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The planned meeting, which was initially scheduled for August
11, is aimed at reaching a national reconciliation among the
Palestinian groups and forming a united Palestinian position on
the final status talks between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier effort to mend fences with other Palestinian
factions, Arafat met with a delegation of the People's Front for
the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). The two sides agreeed to
further hold dialog and expressed hope that the other Palestinian
factions will join the reconciliation process.
</P>
<P>
PFLP, another radical group also based in Damascus, Syria, is
opposed to the Oslo accord, too.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Urges Dealing with Government Opponents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Saturday ordered the intelligence and interior
ministries to seriously deal with attempts to undermine his
moderate government.
</P>
<P>
"We must severely encounter the open and hidden hands" in order
to safeguard Iran's stability and security, Khatami said at the
annual governors' meeting here earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
He listed the opponents as those who cannot tolerate the
country's stability and security, the close link between the
government and the people, and the participation of the younger
generation in political life, and those who attempt to damage
Iran's international image.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the recent crackdown on Tehran University
student protests, armed robberies, killings, attacks on and
kidnapping of foreign tourists, a serial of events that troubled
the government.
</P>
<P>
He urged the ministries concerned to coordinate efforts in
uprooting such incidents and to "seriously deal with
counter-intelligence issues and vigilantly encounter various
conspiracies."
</P>
<P>
"Security is very important for us and must be maintained
at whatever cost so that the people could express themselves
and make efforts in a secure climate," he said.
</P>
<P>
There are signs that Khatami has won a victory over hardliners
who favor restricting the freedom of the press and clampdown on
student protests.
</P>
<P>
A report of the Investigation Committee of the Supreme
National Security Council blamed district security officers and
civilian vigilantes for storming into the dormitory and beating
up students.
</P>
<P>
The June 8 incident in which two people had been reportedly
killed led to widespread street riots across the country.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said the report was "fair and carefully prepared," and
this issue must be looked upon from a "national not personal or
factional angle."
</P>
<P>
Like the students, the government was also outraged by the
closure of a pro-Khatami newspaper, Salam, by the conservative
judiciary and the trial of its managing director by a special
cleric's court.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, two people were killed and five others
injured in a rare armed robbery in Qom, a religious city about
100 kilometers south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
On August 15, four foreign tourists were kidnapped in the
southern province of Kerman. Local security forces were
reportedly negotiating for their safe release.

CAIRO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iranian Minister of Energy Habibollah Bitaraf said on
Saturday that some 69 dams are now under construction in the
country and a number of them are due to go on stream by the year
end.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an inauguration ceremony for Shiyadh dam in Babol
in the Caspian province of Mazandaran, he said that construction
of 200 other dams are now under study.
</P>
<P>
"Some 71 dams have been constructed and put into operation in
the country so far," he added.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- A permanent fair of Egyptian products will be held at
the Egyptian Trade Representation Office in Pretoria, South
Africa, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The products to be shown include carpets, wooden furniture,
ready-made clothes, textiles, leather, shoes, aluminium kitchen
utensils, ceramics and paints.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran produced over 65,000 washing machines in the
first four months of the year, 16 percent more than the same
period last year, said managing director of metals and casting
affairs of the Ministry of Industries Taqi Mousavi-Pour Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's washing machine production capacity is 1
million units annually but "due to the market saturation, the plan
is to produce only 300,000 units this year."
</P>
<P>
He added that the production of electric vacuums reached
148,000 units, 48 percent higher than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months, 330,000 refrigerators and freezers
were produced, six percent lower than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt will take part in the Zagreb International
Autumn Fair to be held in mid-September in Croatia, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources at the Croatian Embassy in Cairo said this
is an important step in promoting trade cooperation between the
two countries and an opportunity to show Egyptian products in
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The sources said a large Egyptian businessmen delegation is to
visit Croatia during the fair, which they said will provide an
opportunity for businessmen of the two countries to seek ways of
enhancing trade cooperation.

<P>
ISTANBUL, August 21 (Xinhua) -- As anguished families bury
their loved ones who perished in the strong earthquake striking
northwestern Turkey Tuesday morning, life in most parts of the
quake-hit Istanbul, the largest city of the country, has virtually
returned to normal by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Communication, electricity and water supplies, which were cut
off in the metropolis straddling Europe and Asia by the pre-dawn
catastrophe, resumed later Tuesday in many parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
And since Wednesday, the vast majority of the 12 million
Istanbul residents are having their telephone lines, electric
lights and running water back in normal.
</P>
<P>
Aucilar, an outskirt in western Istanbul overseeing the
Marmara Sea, was the worst hit area of the city. While rescuers
were still digging in the debris of flattened buildings in search
for survivors and victims, power and water supplies there were
already rehabilitated Friday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the vibration which sent the whole city trembling for
45 seconds at 3:02 a.m. (0002 GMT) Tuesday with a magnitude of
7.4 degrees on the Richter scale, most buildings in central
Istanbul were unharmed.
</P>
<P>
Four days after the tremor, streets in Istanbul are already
back into their usual bustle. Department stores, supermarkets and
restaurants, which were not closed even Tuesday, are running
their normal time.
</P>
<P>
Financial institutions are among the sectors most
conspicuously affected by the quake. Many banks were closed due
to communication and power cut-offs, but most have already
resumed their business.
</P>
<P>
The Istanbul Stock Exchange, however, would not open until
next Monday after trading was intercepted by the quake since
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, one of the pillars of Istanbul's economy, seemed to
have suffered no obvious backlashes from the quake. Key tourist
attractions in central Istanbul, such as the Church of St. Sophia
and the Mosque of Sultanahmet (widely known as the Blue Mosque),
remained intact.
</P>
<P>
The seismologic nightmare has so far killed over 900 people in
Istanbul itself, mostly in the low-income outskirts, like Aucilar
and Safakoy, where shoddy construction prevails.
</P>
<P>
In the Church of St. Sophia, a young woman from Hungary, who
arrived in Turkey two days ago with her parents, said she had
consulted with the Hungarian Consulate here before going on with
their original trip schedule, and "they said it wasn't very
dangerous."
</P>
<P>
"We came from the airport, we took the taxi, we didn't see
anything. We were actually very surprised because we had expected
it to be very bad," she said, adding her family would stay here
for another two days.

<HEADLINE> Nine Shot Dead in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Nine people were shot dead
in separate incidents for no apparent reasons in a farm near
KwaMashu north of Durban in KwaZulu-Natal overnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
The killed included a three-year-old boy who was brought to
hospital after being shot but died upon arrival.
</P>
<P>
Two shacks in the area were burnt down and the occupants were
burnt beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, three people were killed in the same area.
</P>
<P>
The massacre started around 11 p.m. (2100 GMT) on Friday when
attackers shot and killed two people outside their home in the
informal settlement, South African Press Association quoted a
police officer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nearly an hour later two other people were shot and
subsequently died in a shack about 300 meters away from the first
attack.
</P>
<P>
Around 3 a.m. (0100 GMT) on Saturday a 51-year-old man and his
three sons were gunned down and their shack set on fire. A fifth
member of the family was taken to hospital in a critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
Police are investigating the incidents and at the moment they
could not say whether the killings were politically or criminally
motivated.
</P>
<P>
The police also issued a 250,000-rand (41,700 U.S. dollars)
reward for any information that leads to the arrest and conviction
of the attackers.

TEHRAN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The former manager of the Museum
of Ancient Iran was detained for the disappearance of two ancient
golden and silver tablets, the Persian-language daily "Iran"
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A court ordered Tehrani Moqoddam to be temporarily detained as
investigation continues into the loss of the invaluable tablets,
which has led to the arrest of an archaeologist who knew about the
last place where the tablets were kept.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Asks U.N. to Provide Emergency Help to Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Liberian Government said Saturday
that the country does not have the means to cope with the
worsening refugee flood issue from the fighting areas between
government troops and rebels and appealed to the international
community for help.
</P>
<P>
Liberian Information Minister Joe Mulbah said that the United
Nations should give his country urgent food and medical aid to
help tide off the worsening humanitarian emergency in the northern
part of the country, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Mulbah said towns in the fighting areas along the
Liberian-Guinean border towns were being burnt in "rampant acts
of arson" -- with thousands of civilians caught in the cross
fire, and an unknown number killed.
</P>
<P>
He said government forces were exerting "all efforts to stop
civilian casualties".
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), which
says it hopes to be able to return to the area soon, pulled its
staff out of the region last week because of the security
situation and the taking of hostages by rebels.
</P>
<P>
A World Food Program official indicated today in Monrovia that
international aid organizations might not be able to provide
immediate relief to the remote-fighting region. Earlier this
week the government announced the capture of the towns of Foya,
Kolahun and Medekoma. But the government troops' further offensive
is believed to be difficult.
</P>
<P>
The fighting began last week when armed insurgents crossed into
Lofa County from neighboring Guinea. Liberian Government had
declared a state of emergency in the area and accused Guinea of
providing support for the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Guinean President Lansana Conte latter denied Liberia's charge
and accused the Liberian authorities of ingratitude toward his
country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Africa No 1 radio, Conte said, "Guinea continues to
give assistance and to harbor thousands of Liberian refugees."

<HEADLINE> Chissano Urges Varsity graduates to Contribute to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano Saturday said the society expects more university
graduates to make contribution toward solving existing problems
and preventing future ones.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking in Maputo at the ceremony presenting with
diplomas 312 new graduates from the country's oldest higher
education institution, the Eduardo Mondlane University (UEM).
</P>
<P>
Chissano urge the university to maintain a constant link with
other levels of the national education system, so as to help solve
the multiple problems facing Mozambican education.
</P>
<P>
He stressed "the need for universities and other schools to
train productive citizens, people who produce goods an who produce
ideas, citizens with initiatives. Whoever is trained at the UEM
should leave with a spirit of enterprise."
</P>
<P>
Graduates, he added, should be trained not only to occupy jobs
"but above all to have the capacity to create employment for
themselves and for others".
</P>
<P>
Chissano added that teaching must be closely linked to
research, since " any self-respecting university must engage in
research."
</P>
<P>
He praise the UEM's efforts to introduce post-graduate courses,
saying that these would increase research capacity, with a
corresponding impact on the country's development, and an
improvement in teaching methods.
</P>
<P>
Chissano recognized that improving the university curriculum
and building up the research capacity, among others, would all
require major investment.
</P>
<P>
He urged the UEM to assist the state in carrying out this duty,
and warned that the university's administrative and financial
autonomy obliges it to introduce transparent and reliable forms of
management.
</P>
<P>
"Stringent measures must be introduced to hold back
expenditure, and to rationalize resources", he declared.
</P>
<P>
Chissano also criticized the gender imbalance among the new
graduates, 216 of whom are men, and only 96 women. He said the
university must work to mitigate this imbalance.
</P>
<P>
There is also an imbalance in the faculties from which the
students graduated. Social and human sciences contributed 153 of
the graduates, engineering and technology 58, biological sciences
49, agronomy and forestry 37, and natural sciences just 15.
</P>
<P>
In the 1997-98 academic year, the UEM graduated 243 students,
so there has been an increase in graduations of around 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the graduation rate remains shockingly low. There are
currently 6, 500 students, most of them on five year courses. One
might therefore reasonably expect 1,000 or so students to graduate
per year.
</P>
<P>
There are 811 full and part time teaching staff. In other
words, the UEM is alarmingly unproductive.
</P>
<P>
The blame for this undoubtedly lies in the system, inherited
from Portuguese colonialism, of a five year first degree known as
a " licenciatura". This supposedly lies somewhere between a
bachelors degree and a masters.
</P>
<P>
It involves writing a final dissertation, and many students
never finish this work.

to safeguard Iran's stability and security, Khatami said at the
annual governors' meeting here earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
He listed the opponents as those who cannot tolerate the
country's stability and security, the close link between the
government and the people, and the participation of the younger
generation in political life, and those who attempt to damage
Iran's international image.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the recent crackdown on Tehran University
student protests, armed robberies, killings, attacks on and
kidnapping of foreign tourists, a serial of events that troubled
the government.
</P>
<P>
He urged the ministries concerned to coordinate efforts in
uprooting such incidents and to "seriously deal with
counter-intelligence issues and vigilantly encounter various
conspiracies."
</P>
<P>
"Security is very important for us and must be maintained
at whatever cost so that the people could express themselves
and make efforts in a secure climate," he said.
</P>
<P>
There are signs that Khatami has won a victory over hardliners
who favor restricting the freedom of the press and clampdown on
student protests.
</P>
<P>
A report of the Investigation Committee of the Supreme
National Security Council blamed district security officers and
civilian vigilantes for storming into the dormitory and beating
up students.
</P>
<P>
The June 8 incident in which two people had been reportedly
killed led to widespread street riots across the country.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said the report was "fair and carefully prepared," and
this issue must be looked upon from a "national not personal or
factional angle."
</P>
<P>
Like the students, the government was also outraged by the
closure of a pro-Khatami newspaper, Salam, by the conservative
judiciary and the trial of its managing director by a special
cleric's court.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, two people were killed and five others
injured in a rare armed robbery in Qom, a religious city about
100 kilometers south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
On August 15, four foreign tourists were kidnapped in the
southern province of Kerman. Local security forces were
reportedly negotiating for their safe release.

<HEADLINE> Chissano Urges Varsity graduates to Contribute to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano Saturday said the society expects more university
graduates to make contribution toward solving existing problems
and preventing future ones.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking in Maputo at the ceremony presenting with
diplomas 312 new graduates from the country's oldest higher
education institution, the Eduardo Mondlane University (UEM).
</P>
<P>
Chissano urge the university to maintain a constant link with
other levels of the national education system, so as to help solve
the multiple problems facing Mozambican education.
</P>
<P>
He stressed "the need for universities and other schools to
train productive citizens, people who produce goods an who produce
ideas, citizens with initiatives. Whoever is trained at the UEM
should leave with a spirit of enterprise."
</P>
<P>
Graduates, he added, should be trained not only to occupy jobs
"but above all to have the capacity to create employment for
themselves and for others".
</P>
<P>
Chissano added that teaching must be closely linked to
research, since " any self-respecting university must engage in
research."
</P>
<P>
He praise the UEM's efforts to introduce post-graduate courses,
saying that these would increase research capacity, with a
corresponding impact on the country's development, and an
improvement in teaching methods.
</P>
<P>
Chissano recognized that improving the university curriculum
and building up the research capacity, among others, would all
require major investment.
</P>
<P>
He urged the UEM to assist the state in carrying out this duty,
and warned that the university's administrative and financial
autonomy obliges it to introduce transparent and reliable forms of
management.
</P>
<P>
"Stringent measures must be introduced to hold back
expenditure, and to rationalize resources", he declared.
</P>
<P>
Chissano also criticized the gender imbalance among the new
graduates, 216 of whom are men, and only 96 women. He said the
university must work to mitigate this imbalance.
</P>
<P>
There is also an imbalance in the faculties from which the
students graduated. Social and human sciences contributed 153 of
the graduates, engineering and technology 58, biological sciences
49, agronomy and forestry 37, and natural sciences just 15.
</P>
<P>
In the 1997-98 academic year, the UEM graduated 243 students,
so there has been an increase in graduations of around 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the graduation rate remains shockingly low. There are
currently 6, 500 students, most of them on five year courses. One
might therefore reasonably expect 1,000 or so students to graduate
per year.
</P>
<P>
There are 811 full and part time teaching staff. In other
words, the UEM is alarmingly unproductive.
</P>
<P>
The blame for this undoubtedly lies in the system, inherited
from Portuguese colonialism, of a five year first degree known as
a " licenciatura". This supposedly lies somewhere between a
bachelors degree and a masters.
</P>
<P>
It involves writing a final dissertation, and many students
never finish this work.

</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iranian Minister of Energy Habibollah Bitaraf said on

country and a number of them are due to go on stream by the year
end.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an inauguration ceremony for Shiyadh dam in Babol
in the Caspian province of Mazandaran, he said that construction

period last year, said managing director of metals and casting
affairs of the Ministry of Industries Taqi Mousavi-Pour Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's washing machine production capacity is 1
million units annually but "due to the market saturation, the plan
is to produce only 300,000 units this year."
</P>
<P>
He added that the production of electric vacuums reached
148,000 units, 48 percent higher than the same period last year.

In the first four months, 330,000 refrigerators and freezers
were produced, six percent lower than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt will take part in the Zagreb International
Autumn Fair to be held in mid-September in Croatia, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>

is an important step in promoting trade cooperation between the
two countries and an opportunity to show Egyptian products in
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The sources said a large Egyptian businessmen delegation is to
visit Croatia during the fair, which they said will provide an
opportunity for businessmen of the two countries to seek ways of

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Tourism Has Bright Future: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Second Deputy Premier
and Minister of Tourism, Trade and Industry Moses Ali has assured
Ugandans that the country's tourism industry has a bright future.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when meeting with local officials in
northeastern Uganda on the proposals made by the protected areas
assessment program Saturday, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
The program is charged with reviewing the status of wildlife
protected areas throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that the government is anxious to save
the more important wildlife parks, reserves and to rebuild tourist
facilities so that Uganda attracts more foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed claims that the government has intentions to
take land in Karimoja in form of gazetting it as wildlife
reserves.
</P>
<P>
The protected area plan, which was completed in March this
year, highlights those areas of high biological diversity which
should be protected in parks and reserves.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's tourism industry suffered a heavy blow in early March
when eight foreign tourists were killed in a forest park in
western Uganda. The incident was immediately followed by a spate
of mass trip cancellations.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, August 21 (Xinhua) -- As anguished families bury
their loved ones who perished in the strong earthquake striking
northwestern Turkey Tuesday morning, life in most parts of the
quake-hit Istanbul, the largest city of the country, has virtually
returned to normal by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Communication, electricity and water supplies, which were cut
off in the metropolis straddling Europe and Asia by the pre-dawn
catastrophe, resumed later Tuesday in many parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
And since Wednesday, the vast majority of the 12 million
Istanbul residents are having their telephone lines, electric
lights and running water back in normal.
</P>
<P>
Aucilar, an outskirt in western Istanbul overseeing the
Marmara Sea, was the worst hit area of the city. While rescuers
were still digging in the debris of flattened buildings in search
for survivors and victims, power and water supplies there were
already rehabilitated Friday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the vibration which sent the whole city trembling for
45 seconds at 3:02 a.m. (0002 GMT) Tuesday with a magnitude of
7.4 degrees on the Richter scale, most buildings in central
Istanbul were unharmed.
</P>
<P>
Four days after the tremor, streets in Istanbul are already
back into their usual bustle. Department stores, supermarkets and
restaurants, which were not closed even Tuesday, are running
their normal time.
</P>
<P>
Financial institutions are among the sectors most
conspicuously affected by the quake. Many banks were closed due
to communication and power cut-offs, but most have already
resumed their business.
</P>
<P>
The Istanbul Stock Exchange, however, would not open until
next Monday after trading was intercepted by the quake since
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, one of the pillars of Istanbul's economy, seemed to
have suffered no obvious backlashes from the quake. Key tourist
attractions in central Istanbul, such as the Church of St. Sophia
and the Mosque of Sultanahmet (widely known as the Blue Mosque),
remained intact.
</P>
<P>
The seismologic nightmare has so far killed over 900 people in
Istanbul itself, mostly in the low-income outskirts, like Aucilar
and Safakoy, where shoddy construction prevails.
</P>
<P>
In the Church of St. Sophia, a young woman from Hungary, who
arrived in Turkey two days ago with her parents, said she had
consulted with the Hungarian Consulate here before going on with
their original trip schedule, and "they said it wasn't very
dangerous."
</P>
<P>
"We came from the airport, we took the taxi, we didn't see
anything. We were actually very surprised because we had expected
it to be very bad," she said, adding her family would stay here
for another two days.

<P>
KAMPALA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's police force is to
embark on a computerization exercise and have a central data bank
where both the force and other members of the public can have
access to information.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by the Senior Assistant Commissioner of
Police in Charge of Administration Stephen Ounyu while addressing
police officers undergoing computer training courses here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the computer center, the first of its kind in the
police force, is aimed at increasing efficiency within the police.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that studies are underway especially at the
department of the Criminal Investigations Department to see how
they can get the necessary information and provide the necessary
computers which are Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
Ounyu challenged the officers who have acquired the knowledge
to help the police in its planning for the computerization
exercise as there is a lot of data which needs to be processed.

<HEADLINE> S. African FM Tours Uganda, Rwanda for Congo Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Nkosazana Zuma left for Uganda and Rwanda Saturday for a
new round of talks on the long-running conflict in the Democratic
Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Zuma's latest peace mission may also include a stopover in the
Congo, her spokesman Vincent Hlongwane said.
</P>
<P>
Zuma is scheduled to meet Ugandan government officials in
Kampala Saturday and hold talks with Rwandan officials in Kigali
Sunday, Hlongwane said.
</P>
<P>
Depending on the outcome of these meetings she may travel to
Goma, the rebel stronghold close to the Rwandan border in eastern
Congo, for talks with representatives of the divided Congolese
Rally for Democracy (CRD).
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda back different factions of the CRD, the main
rebel movement fighting to overthrow President Laurent Kabila and
the only party to the conflict which did not sign a cease-fire
agreement in Lusaka on July 10.
</P>
<P>
They failed to do so because of a disagreement over which
faction of the CRD should sign the accord. The most powerful
faction, backed by Rwanda and led by Emile Ilunga, is based in
Goma.
</P>
<P>
Zuma's latest peace shuttle follows discussions on the Congo at
the summit of the 14-nation Southern African Development Community
(SADC) in Maputo this week and is part of regional efforts to
ensure that the rebels sign the Lusaka cease-fire, Hlongwane said.
</P>
<P>
She was in Kisangani, the third largest city in northeastern
Congo which has been divided into two by the rebel factions, a
fortnight ago in an attempt to establish which is the "legitimate
CRD" and hence entitled to sign the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Kisangani is the main base of the second, smaller faction of
the CRD backed by Uganda and led by Ernest Wamba dia Wamba.
</P>
<P>
After Zuma's visit, fighting erupted in Kisangani between
Rwandan and Ugandan soldiers, leaving 200 dead and 50 injured.
</P>
<P>
Calm has since returned to the area thanks to a joint
cease-fire declaration by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and
Rwandan vice-president Paul Kagame.
</P>
<P>
Zuma will be accompanied by several South African officials,
including an advisor in President Thabo Mbeki's office, the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
He said the delegation will consist exclusively of South
Africans, and it will not be a joint mission by South Africa and
Zambia, as the visit to Kisangani was.
</P>
<P>
Zuma was accompanied to Kisangani by the Zambian Minister of
Presidential Affairs, Eric Silwamba, and declared afterwards that
the onus was on Zambia to establish which CRD faction should sign
the accord, as that country was leading the Congo peace process.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how long Zuma will stay in central Africa this
time.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President and First
Secretary of the ruling Zanu (PF) party Robert Mugabe has
condemned immoral behavior among some members of the Women's
League and emphasized that party members, especially men in top
party positions should refrain from being destructive to the
party.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who officially closed the two-day third National
Women's League Conference in Harare Saturday, said there was need
to strengthen ties in all provinces and cooperation with leaders
in terms of policy and correct guidance.
</P>
<P>
He repeatedly reiterated the need for party unity.
</P>
<P>
"There have been rumors and talk about some of your members who
are of loose morals and have gone to the extend of destroying
other people's families," he said.
</P>
<P>
Congratulating the newly appointed 26-member executive of the
Women's League, he said they should use their new posts to the
advantage and benefit of the people and not just hold on to them.
</P>
<P>
"Give new light in your respective provinces and the country as
a whole and there must never be any division," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also encouraged the women to meet and correct the gap
that has been created in the new executive following none
representation of an executive member in the new committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia's former prime minister
Sergei Stepashin on Saturday refused to join two other former
premiers in a new pro-Kremlin, right-centrist political bloc.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin, who was fired as prime minister earlier this month,
has been consulting with parties led by two other ex-premiers:
Viktor Chernomyrdin's Our Home is Russia and Sergei Kiriyenko's
New Force.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to media reports late Friday that the three former
prime ministers would form a coalition, Stepashin announced
Saturday that he would stay out and instead start to run for the
State Duma, or lower house of parliament, in a constituency in his
hometown of St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
"You cannot bring together people who do not fit together,"
Stepashin said. "There are too many ambitions."
</P>
<P>
"I want to be honest with myself and the people, without
deceit, without betraying my ideals," the Interfax news agency
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin had apparently been hoping the ex-premiers' bloc
would counter the coalition of Fatherland-All Russia, led by
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and another former prime minister,
Yevgeny Primakov.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Song of Life: Story of National Anthem Conductor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Editor's note: This year is the 50th anniversary of the People'
s Republic of China. Xinhua News Agency will release a series of
50 stories on Chinese men and women, young and old, to present a
picture of the changes that have taken place in China over the
past 50 years. These different people will describe their own
experiences and how they fit into the changes in the motherland.
This is the first article.
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The scene is forever fixed in
Luo Lang's memory of the day he conducted a military band playing
the National Anthem of the People's Republic China.
</P>
<P>
Tian'anmen Square was calm and a breeze was blowing in the
gentle autumn sunshine that afternoon on October 1, 1949 and,
suddenly, music rent the sky. The music was being played by a 200-
member band and a red flag was being raised and a 56-gun salute
went off.
</P>
<P>
Luo was 29. The whole square was jolted at that extraordinary
moment and it was an unforgettable splendor, he told Xinhua
recently, waving arms and humming the National Anthem in his house
in Beijing. That afternoon, Mao Zedong declared the founding of
the People's Republic, opening an brand new chapter in the history
of the 5,000-year-old country.
</P>
<P>
Luo was born in Fujian province and moved to Malaysia with his
family when he was 9, and, when Japanese troops attacked Shanghai
on September 13, 1937, he was in primary school. The news arrived
when he was on his way to school. A thousand Chinese in the small
Malaysian town rushed out, shouting and crying, and school
suspended class.
</P>
<P>
His father drew a picture of a dark future to him saying that
China was going to be conquered by the Japanese and that all
Chinese would become slaves.
</P>
<P>
Luo returned to China a few years later and heard a song titled
"March of The Militia" for the first time. It later became the
national anthem. He says he was surprisingly moved by it because
it expressed the nation's resolve to fight to the death.
</P>
<P>
Luo went to Yan'an singing the song and became an army musician
after studying at a Communist arts academy. He says he can not
remember how many times he has conducted orchestras playing the
song, but can only remember just how China changed from a dying
nation into a powerful one.
</P>
<P>
The biggest changes took place after 1949. When he went back to
his small hometown in Fujian one day, he could not recognize it.
The farmland of 50 years ago has been replaced by highways and
skyscrapers. No one could imagine the place during wartime.
</P>
<P>
And, his small army band in Yan'an has become a very big one
and the members are always proud to play the national anthems for
visiting dignitaries. Fifty years ago they had rough instruments
captured from the enemy, but today they have state-of-the-art
Chinese equipment.
</P>
<P>
Remarkable changes have also taken place in the 70-year-old Luo.
He bought a computer and spent all day studying the mysteriously
new Windows 98 and says he is looking forward to sending e-mail to
old friends. But the sound of the national anthem brings him back
to reality from cyberspace. "It's the music of my soul and the
song of my life," he says in a firm voice.

<HEADLINE> Temporary Settlement Areas to be Formed for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Public Works and Housing
Minister Koray Aydin said here on Sunday that temporary
settlement areas that are close to their former houses will be
formed for the victims of the quake which hit Turkey Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Aydin said that Turkey will soon form teams to select
settlement areas which are expected to be primarily set up in the
most quake-stricken provinces of Sakarya, Kocaeli and Yalova.
</P>
<P>
He said that the damage assestment work had already begun in
the less affected provinces of Eskisehir and Bolu and would begin
in Istanbul on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Similar work will start in the most devastated province of
Kocaeli and Sakarya once the rescue operations end, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
He added that prefabricated cities will be established in
temporary settlement places and the citizens will be able to pass
the winter in those places.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel has said that over 100,000
houses have been destroyed by the monster quake which has killed
at least 12,000 people in western Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Sakarya Governorship Crisis Administration Center said that
a total of 8,700 buildings collapsed in Adapazari (Sakarya)
province, over 11,000 buildings were seriously damaged and nearly
4,800 buildings were mildly or slightly damaged.

<HEADLINE> S'pore PM Stresses "Honesty, Efficiency" in Globalization Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong Sunday emphasized the importance of keeping "honesty and
efficiency" in the city-state's economic globalization process.
</P>
<P>
Goh said in a speech delivered at the Nation Day Rally here
that "honesty and efficiency are two values that have helped
Singapore to overcome the economic crisis."
</P>
<P>
With the help of the two values, the Singapore economy, unlike
others in the region, has not been harmed by the crisis and is
recovering with healthy growth in the first half of 1999, Goh
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the next stage of development, Singapore must
globalize its economy and "make the quantum leap from being a
regional economy to become one of the few global centers of
excellence."
</P>
<P>
As a resource-poor country, said Goh, Singapore must depend on
intangible assets, that is, honesty and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"If we lose these great assets, foreign investors will lose
confidence in us. Singapore will be finished," Goh cautioned.
</P>
<P>
He said that instead of relying solely on buying and selling
other people's products to make a living, Singapore have to look
for new opportunities and adjust its strategies in tandem with
changes in the environment.
</P>
<P>
"This is time for us to go global, competing head on with the
developed economies," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Singapore companies to have products which can
sell in the world market so as to "build a first-world economy and
a world-class home."

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Saga Reproduced On Beijing Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A modern drama based on a
Tibetan saga from the 13th century has ended its week-long
performance in Beijing to mark the 50th anniversary of the People'
s Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The drama "Basiba -- the Teacher of the Emperor of the Yuan
Dynasty" was created and performed by the Shanxi Modern Drama
Theater and portrays a phase of Chinese history some 750 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old theater has put a tremendous amount of work in
the drama and spent an estimated one million to create a true
historical and ethnic atmosphere. Stage and costume designers
tried to reflect the regional and ethnic characteristics in every
detail. Basiba's costume was made in Tibet at a cost of some 10,
000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The drama tells the legendary experiences of Basiba in
developing the Mongolian language and his role as a Lamaist leader,
a great politician, a thinker, and a religious teacher of the
first emperor of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368 AD).
</P>
<P>
Basiba devoted his whole life to the reunification cause and
made Tibet an inseparable part of the Chinese nation, explains Yao
Dashi, the director and co-writer of the drama, who explains that
he wanted to let the great historic figure be remembered by the
whole nation.
</P>
<P>
The drama tells an attractive legend whose theme is peace and
unity, one critic remarked, and it is a contribution to the nation
in telling the history of reunification.

<HEADLINE> Innovations Needed in Science, Technology: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin has
called for greater efforts in developing new ideas and making use
of scientific know-how to step up the country's modernization.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's goals for the socialist modernization
drive in the new century require efforts to carry out the strategy
of revitalizing the country by relying on science and education
and by making innovations in science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The remark came during Jiang's visit to the Institute of
Chemical Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in
Dalian, on August 20.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, he said that a greater effort needs to be
made in science and technology and this has strategic significance
for China's economic development, social advancement, national
defense, and the standard of living.
</P>
<P>
People need to work harder in spreading scientific knowledge
and improving the level of science and culture of the whole nation,
which will provide a basis for scientific advancement and
technological innovation, he said, pointing to the fact that there
is still a struggle between science and superstition, and
civilization and fatuous ideas even though there have been great
developments in science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Scientific truth can play a role and educate people only in the
struggle against superstition and fatuity, while pseudoscientific
ideas and malicious heresies preached by a few people need to be
fought, said Jiang, who also encouraged scientists to be
responsible for expanding scientific awareness.
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Chemical Physics was founded in 1949 in the
coastal city of Dalian in Liaoning Province, northeast China, and
has become a comprehensive chemical research base with several key
laboratories doing major research.
</P>
<P>
Jiang visited four key labs there and heard reports from CAS
head Lu Yongxiang and the Institute's head Deng Maicun on the
national knowledge-based innovation program.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Urges External Effort to Advance Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat on Sunday underlined the need for external effort to push
forward the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak in Alexandria, Arafat indicated he would asked
United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to intervene
to break the deadlock in talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The situation needs an external effort to be exerted to push
the negotiations forward in a bid to implement what has been
agreed upon between the Palestinians and Israel, said Arafat, who
arrived in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria earlier
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Albright is expected to visit the Mideast region in early
September after putting off an earlier visit due to Israel's
opposition to any third parties influencing the talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat expressed readiness to continue negotiations with Israel
to reach solutions satisfactory to the Palestinian people despite
frustration over Israel's delay of implementing the Wye peace
accord signed last October.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators have been trying for days
to reach agreement on a timetable for completing all obligations
under the Wye agreement. The main points still to be resolved
remain the timetable for further Israeli troop withdrawal from the
West Bank and the release of Palestinians from Israeli prisons.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, a frequent visitor to Egypt, keeps close contacts with
Mubarak, who, as the president of the first Arab country to sign a
peace treaty with Israel, plays an active role in mediating the
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Mubarak, Arafat flew to Cairo for
a meeting later in the day with Nayef Hawatmeh, leader of the
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), as part
of the effort to reach a Palestinian national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first meeting between Arafat and Hawatmeh
since the 1993 signing of the Oslo accord, the main basis of the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Needs Local, Foreign Talents to Be World-Class: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong Sunday said that a competitive Singapore needs the help
from both local and foreign talents to become a world-class city.
</P>
<P>
To compete against the best in the world, Singapore has to
nurture its own talent and also bring in world-class companies and
the best people from outside, Goh said this in a speech delivered
at the National Day Rally here.
</P>
<P>
"Three million Singaporeans will not have enough talent to run
a first-world economy," said Goh. "we have to actively attract
able, creative and dynamic people from elsewhere."
</P>
<P>
By combining the strengths of both local and foreign talents,
Singapore can bring about faster growth and development and a
higher standard of living for all Singaporeans, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also, the talented Singaporeans will be very outward-looking
and more mobile as they will be able to choose where they want to
work and live, he said.
</P>
<P>
But if these people choose to work or stay away from Singapore
for long periods of time, Goh warned, the other Singaporeans and
the country will lose the help from them.
</P>
<P>
"This is an inevitable trend," he said. "we have to address,
rather than avoid, the issue."
</P>
<P>
By making itself a world-class home and a cosmopolitan city
with supplementary foreign talents, Singapore will be able to
secure more high-value investments to create good jobs, Goh said.
</P>
<P>
"All these will help to ensure that talented Singaporeans will
remain here to do their part for society and country," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Scheduled for 2 p.m. at the Tennis International Centre of
Canada's largest city Toronto, the 18-year-old Swiss is ready to
topple Seles from her pedestal at the 1.05 million U.S. dollars
women's tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
"She's almost unbeaten at this tournament and has won it four
times in a row so it's about time someone else gets on the board
in the winner list," Hingis said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
Four-time winner and defending champion Seles, 25, remains on
course for a fifth consecutive Canada Open title. "It's going to
be a very difficult match for me," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I played Martina in Canada last year and I won so I'm sure
Martina wants to beat me," she added.
</P>
<P>
Rain forced postponement of most of Friday's play to Saturday,
when Hingis beat third-seeded Mary Pierce of France 7-6 (7-3), 6-3
while Seles swept unseeded Anne-Gaelle Sidot of France 6-3, 6-4 in
the semi-finals.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Says People Should Learn A Lesson From Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper "
People's Daily" carries an article in Monday's edition that says
the Chinese should learn a lesson from the struggle against Falun
Gong and that the effort to expose Li Hongzhi, its founder, has
achieved a great deal.
</P>
<P>
People also need to ponder why so many people were deceived by
the Falun Gong cult, it says, even though it was against science,
human beings, society, and government.
</P>
<P>
The article says that cadres and Communist Party members should
improve their political sense and political study and that the
fight against Falun Gong has an important bearing on the
fundamental faith of communists, on the ideological basis for
uniting the Chinese people, and on the destiny and future of the
Communist Party and the government.
</P>
<P>
Party members need to increase their Marxist study, with
emphasis on materialism and atheism, which are powerful weapons in
defeating the enemy, it says, as well as develop a scientific
spirit and fight against superstition and to be vigilant.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China is the ruling party with over 61
million members and it has many advantages that include theory,
organization, and policy, it says.
</P>
<P>
It is also very important to rule the country by law and to
improve social management, which will improve people's legal sense,
it says. Many Falun Gong practitioners have the desire to improve
their health but didn't clearly understand the nature of Li
Hongzhi and his anti-government goals so more attention should be
paid to people's need for health and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
The article concludes by saying that no one can stop the great
undertaking because people have matured after the struggle with
Falun Gong and have united around the CPC with Jiang Zemin at its
core and are insisting on the Party's basic line.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Calls for Battle Against Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A greater effort needs to be
made in the battle against pollution, Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao said
today at a national conference on pollution prevention and control
in China's major river basins.
</P>
<P>
Wen said that although a great deal has been achieved in
curbing pollution in recent years and the water quality in some
major basins like Taihu Lake, the Huaihe River and Dianchi Lake
has improved, people still need to understand more about
environmental conditions.
</P>
<P>
There are three problems to deal with: air pollution, water
pollution, and pollution caused by urban garbage, Wen said,
emphasizing that great importance must be placed on pollution
prevention and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
According to him, China's pollution problem can not be solved
in a short period of time, and a long-term program is needed to
tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
Wen asked government departments to make an effort to prevent
and curb pollution, to collect funds for environmental protection,
and to develop an environmental protection industry.
</P>
<P>
The conference was presided over by Xie Zhenghua, director of
the State Environmental Protection Administration. Its purpose was
to discuss water pollution prevention in major basins like Taihu
Lake and the Haihe and Liaohe rivers and to draw up a national
pollution control campaign.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, august 22 (Xinhua) -- Australian Ian Thorpe smashed
the 400 meters freestyle world record at the Pan Pacific swimming
championships in Sydney on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Thorpe completed the day by anchoring the Australian relay team
to victory over the United States.
</P>
<P>
Splashing in the very same pool for next year's Olympic Games,
Thorpe sliced almost two seconds off the previous 400m world mark.
</P>
<P>
Thorpe clocked three minutes 41.83 seconds to beat the previous
mark of 3:43.80, set by fellow Australian Kieren Perkins at the
1994 world championships in Rome.
</P>
<P>
Thorpe later helped the Australian 4x100m freestyle team down a
U.S. four for the first time. His final leg of 48.55sec helped
the Australian team win gold in 3:16.08 -- less than a second
outside the world record. And that brought about the first ever U.
S. defeat in the event at any major swimming meet.
</P>
<P>
The Americans came back to win the women's 4x100m freestyle
relay with Jenny Thompson anchoring the team to victory, and the
women's 25km open water race through the efforts by Briley Bergen,
who completed the race in five hours 16 minutes five seconds.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Joanne Malar took the women's 400m individual medley
in 4:40.23 while Australia's Mark Saliba won the men's 25km open
water event.

<HEADLINE> Lamas Attend China's National Games for Ethnic Solidarity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- We came here not only for the
medals, but also for the ethnic solidarity, the Lamas of Beijing-
based Yonghe Palace said after their competitions at the on-going
Chinese national ethnic games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The three lamas, which represented Beijing to compete in the
top-whipping event, showed little sign of frustration although
they failed to make the last eight.
</P>
<P>
"We came here mainly for the sake of ethnic solidarity.
Whether win or loss doesn't matter much to us," said Kang Yujie,
the housekeeper of the Yonghe Palace.
</P>
<P>
His words were underlined as the three applauded sincerely to
congratulate on the victory of their opponents.
</P>
<P>
The lamas said they had long been inspired by the inscription
of Qian Long Emperor of the Qing Dynasty placed inside their
Beijing temple which read "The 56 nationalities in China are a
whole family."
</P>
<P>
"We have kept our faith to what he had said," said Kang. "We
have felt strongly the atmosphere of ethnic solidarity here and we
will cherish forever such friendship among us."
</P>
<P>
The failure in the competition, however, did not wear away
their interest in sports as they reeled off their daily sports
activities.
</P>
<P>
Kang, a sports fan himself, said that although they were
occupied with the routine Buddhist services, they have tried to
spare time for sports activities.
</P>
<P>
"Almost half of the lamas in Yonghe Palace are under 35, so
sports have been our major leisure activities," Kang said.
</P>
<P>
"We have managed to find some room from the parking lot in the
palace for basketball. We also built a badminton court to
entertain ourselves."
</P>
<P>
Kang has been a major factor in the sports enthusiasm in the
lamasery as he has so many business to handle every day.
</P>
<P>
"He often gets up at five every morning for Buddhist services.
And he also has to care about the daily management and reception,
but he has managed to find time to organize sports activities for
us," said another lama Bao Quangui.
</P>
<P>
"Under his push, we have sports games almost every week," Bao
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- As the century ends, the Chinese
government is making its biggest ever attempt to encourage
scientific and technological innovation.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to rank among world scientific giants in the
21st century and the Central Committee of the Communist Party and
State Council have decided to hold a National Technological
Innovation Conference later this month.
</P>
<P>
Some observers say that it will be important for building a
national innovation system and for high-tech ventures. The
government has already adopted measures to help build a national
innovation system and high-tech ventures in the past few months
and announced earlier this year that it will allocate 5 billion
yuan (600 million U.S. dollars) for the system. It will also
provide 600 million yuan for outstanding Chinese scientists
overseas to participate in the system research programs.
</P>
<P>
The government has established the State Supreme Science and
Technology Award that provides winners with 5 million yuan to
encourage scientists to work for major breakthroughs in research.
</P>
<P>
Early in 1995, President Jiang Zemin said that "innovation is
the soul of advancement in a nation and is the dynamic power for
building a prosperous and powerful country."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Wine Consumption Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese drink a third of a liter
of wine on average, which accounts for five percent of the world's
wine consumption per capita, according to the latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
It is still less than 0.5 percent of that in Western Europe,
according to the China Food Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
China's wine output in 1998 was 350,000 tons, which can meet
only 8.4 percent of the world's total demand. It is only five
percent of France's wine output.
</P>
<P>
China established more than 100 new wineries in 1997, with last
year's wine production increasing 52 percent from 1995. The
country also imported about 50,000 tons of wine last year.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Li Hua, a professor at Northwestern Agricultural University,
said that wine has been popular among Chinese since about 1995 and
has considerable opportunities at the Chinese market. Dry red wine
has been gaining much more in popularity than white in recent
years, mainly because of advertising and the romantic appeal,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
A greater effort is still needed to get Chinese to try the
taste of both red and white wine.

<HEADLINE> Arafat-Mubarak Talks Positive: Palestinian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
held "a positive and good" meeting with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak on Sunday, a senior Palestinian official said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Egypt's Mediterranean port city of Alexandria
earlier the day and briefed Mubarak on the Palestinian-Israeli
talks on reaching a timetable for the last two of the three-phased
Israeli troop withdrawals from the West Bank under the Wye peace
accord signed last October, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival at the Cairo International Airport following the
Palestinian-Egyptian summit, Palestinian Minister of Planning and
International Cooperation Nabil Shaath said the talks between the
two leaders underlined the key role Egypt plays in promoting the
Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
Shaath said the Egyptian president has exerted his utmost to
help the Palestinians and Israel work out the timetable for the
implementation of the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed to continue daily contacts in an
effort to keep Mubarak posted on the developments of the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators have been trying for days
to reach agreement on a timetable for completing all obligations
under the Wye agreement, including the opening of a safe passage
for the Palestinians between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and
the opening of a Gaza seaport.
</P>
<P>
The main points still to be resolved remain the timetable for
completing further Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank and
the release of Palestinians from Israeli prisons.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the planned meeting between Arafat and Nayef
Hawatmeh, secretary general of the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), Shaath said the meeting is "very
important" and will bolster the efforts for Palestinian national
dialog.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is scheduled to lead later Sunday a delegation of his
Fatah movement to the meeting with the DFLP delegation to seek
reconciliation between the two rival groups within the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO).
</P>
<P>
The upcoming meeting will be the first between Arafat and
Hawatmeh since the 1993 signing of the Oslo accord, the main basis
of the Palestinian-Israeli talks. It is part of Arafat's effort to
reach national reconciliation and a united Palestinian position on
the final status talks with Israel on the thorny and significant
issues, including Jerusalem and the Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier step on August 1, Arafat met with a delegation of
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), another
radical group in the PLO. The two sides agreed to continue dialog
and called on other groups to join the process.
</P>
<P>
Fatah is the major force to support the Palestinian-Israeli
peace talks. DFLP and PFLP, both based in the Syrian capital of
Damascus, are opposed to the Oslo accord.

<HEADLINE> Postal Union Fighting Illegal Issuing of Stamps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Universal Postal Union (UPU)
has appointed a special task force recently to assist in combating
illegal postage stamps that are issued without authorization of
postal administrations.
</P>
<P>
According to a UPU news release at today's press conference for
the 22nd Universal Postal Congress (UPS), the sharp increase in
the number of illegal postage stamps issued without authorization
has caused deep concern among UPU member countries.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Leavey, director general of the UPU's International
Bureau, says that the problem is a serious one, especially for
developing countries that are losing revenues badly needed for
postal development.
</P>
<P>
These illegal activities mislead stamp collectors and tarnish
philately's image and it is time that the rules on issuing postage
stamps be re-examined, he said.
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting of the UPU's World Association for the
Development of Philately, it was agreed that urgent action is
needed and a special task force was set up to develop a program
that will allow malefactors to be identified more easily and
information on illegal stamp issues to be exchanged more rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The 22nd Universal Postal Congress will open here on Monday.
Priority will be given to strengthening the UPU's Philately Code
of Ethics and to establishing sound philatelic strategies.

development institutes in China.
</P>
<P>
The government has also allocated a large amount of funds for
major scientific research projects. The second-phase of the
national synchrotron lab, an earth crest monitoring system, a
large fiber spectroscopy telescope, and the HT-7U Tok Mark fusion
device have been going on since 1996. They are expected to provide
support for major research programs.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yongxiang, the president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
says that the world is entering an era of knowledge-backed
economies and, in some developed countries, new developments
contribute 60 to 80 percent of economic growth, but China has a
lot to do in improving its innovative ability and applying high-
tech discoveries.
</P>
<P>
He says China could achieve sustainable development in the 21st
century if it adopts a rational development strategy and faces the
reality of challenges in scientific and technological development.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's quake-stricken areas are
in need of more aid materials, Turkish officials said here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the areas need tents, blankets, cleaning
and toilet materials, clothes, working machines to shift the
rubble, water tanks to store water and a 30-ton water tank for
the open-air hospital in Kocaeli province, about 110 kilometers
east of Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
The officials requested a total of 16 garbage trucks, 50,000
medical waste bags, mobile toilets and showers, tents and
blankets for the most seriously devastated provinces of Kocaeli
and Yalova.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Interior Ministry issued a circular on Sunday,
calling on entertainment and shows in public entertainment places
to be reduced to the minumum.
</P>
<P>
The circular also requested the governors of Kocaeli, Sakarya
and Yalova to make the business vehicles to work for 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkey's Bogazici University Kandilli Observatory
said two aftershocks measuring 4.0 on the Richter scale occurred
in Istanbul on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 aftershocks at least 4 on the Richter scale have
happened since the killer earthquake with a magnitude of 7.4 hit
the western Turkey on August 17.

The Italians won the match 13-25, 22-25, 26-24, 25-14, 15-10.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans put up a solid defense to win the first two

</P>
<P>
While Italy continued to play well, South Korea suddenly lost
its composure, which allowed the Italians to control the fourth
and fifth set.
</P>
<P>
During the time-out, Italian coach Angiolino Frigoni told his
players to play with more intensity. The Italians responded well
and eventually won the next three sets with more co-ordinated
performance by Francesca Piccinini, Antonella Bragaglia, Simona
Gioli and Simona Rinieri.
</P>
<P>
Piccinini led the scorers with 24 points, including eight in
the fourth set where the Italians raced to an 12-2 lead before
taking the set 25-14.
</P>
<P>
Ku Min-Jung from South Korea was second with 20 points, who
posted a 10-9 lead in the fifth set before the Italians scored six

<HEADLINE> Photo Exhibition on Deng Xiaoping Held in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A five-day photo exhibition
featuring the ordinary family life of Deng Xiaoping, the chief
architect of China's reform and opening-up, was launched here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is held as August 22 this year is the 95th
anniversary of Deng Xiaoping's birth. Deng died on February 29,
1997.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a historical photo exhibition, it is the indelible
memory of a daughter about her father," said Deng Lin, the eldest
daughter of Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Except several pictures which show Deng Lin's staying together
with her father, the rest of some 110 photos were shot by Deng Lin.
</P>
<P>
"I expect that the exhibition will enable Macao residents to
know more about the aspect of household life of my father," Deng
Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping put forward the concept of "one country, two
systems," which resolved the questions of Hong Kong and Macao.
Following Hong Kong's return to the motherland on July 1, 1997,
Macao's return will come on December 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
"It was a regret that my father was not able to go to Hong Kong
and Macao, so I think the exhibition may help fulfill his wish,"
Deng Lin said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Artists Calls for Setting up Art School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambian artists have urged the
government to set up an art school at any of the country's two
universities so that the development of art into an industry and
major tourist attractions can be accelerated.
</P>
<P>
A group of artists made the call when they met here Saturday to
discuss the forthcoming art exhibition to be held in the capital
later this month, according to Sunday Mail.
</P>
<P>
They said that art in Zambia has not been given the necessary
exposure to fully develop and encompass it as a major tourist
activity that can earn the country lots of money.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of an art school will encourage a lot of
people to fully develop their art skills and produce international
quality materials that will earn the country more money, they
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are getting into fourth decade of independence but we still
don't have an art school in university. We're probably the only
country in this part of the world that is denying the development
of creative thinking that goes with the teaching of art at higher
institutions of learning," an artist complained.
</P>
<P>
The art exhibition to be held is aimed at depicting the African
blend of culture as well as the technical aspect of the artists.
</P>
<P>
"We want to show the people that art is a profession like any
other form which you can earn a living," said the artist.

<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Editor's note: This year is the
50th anniversary of the People's Republic of China and, over the
past 50 years, China's achievements have attracted worldwide
attention, with comprehensive national strength increasing and
earth-shaking changes taking place in all sectors.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua News Agency will release about 20 reports on these
development and provide the latest information on the nation's
economy. The first of the series was released on August 17. This
is the third.
</P>
<P>
China's industrial economy was marked by small workshops 50
years ago, but has grown into a modern comprehensive industrial
system with increasing competitiveness, putting an end to the
shortages of manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reports that
manufacturing industry's total value added in 1998 amounted to
more than 2.6 trillion yuan, fourth in the world. China has also
ranked first in steel, coal, cement, chemical fertilizer, and TV
set production, since 1996.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector has begun to cooperate with the rest of
the world as China's market-oriented reforms and opening up
continue. Manufactured goods have come to account for some 90
percent of the nation's total exports.
</P>
<P>
The steel industry, an important indicator of the national
economy and of comprehensive national strength, produced more than
100 million tons of steel in 1996 and has given backbone to
national economic development.
</P>
<P>
But, even though China has developed into the world's largest
steel producer, it is still far from being a steel power,
according to Wang Wanbin, the former director of the State
Metallurgical Industry Administration.

<TEXT>
<P>
China remains an agricultural country, but, taking its current
economic scale and speed of development into account, analysts say
that it will grow into a modern industrialized country in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
Now in the country, large enterprises have begun to appear,
earning increasing international credibility. There are more than
1,600 enterprise groups above the provincial level that compete in
world markets and lead China in industrial development.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, the average growth rate of the
industrial sector was 13.6 percent, with the added value of
industrial output rising from less than 12 billion yuan in 1952 to
over 3.3 trillion yuan last year, and the number of employees
increasing 11 folds to 139 million and the number of enterprises
increasing 47 folds to about eight million, the NBS says.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector has been contributing more to the country
's gross domestic product, which was 42.2 percent last year, and
remained to be the biggest single contributor to state revenues.
</P>
<P>
Market-oriented reform policies, a modern enterprise system,
and management expertise overseas have all breathed new vitality
into the country's industries, which have had new development
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the industrial economy, China began to
encourage the development of overseas-funded and privately-run
industrial enterprises, which provided nearly 34 percent of the
country's total industrial output value in 1998, becoming a major
component of the national economy.

HONG KONG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 people were
injured and some wooden shelters were destroyed as Typhoon Sam
raided Hong Kong on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The No. 8 northwest gale or storm signal was hoisted at 12:30

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Assist Nigeria on Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has listed
environmental projects and promised to support this projects with
community-based approaches and targets the reversal of
environmental degradation and poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
Trever Byer, Resident Representative of the Bank to Nigeria,
stressed the need for the bank to consolidate its alliance with
organizations like the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWN) and the
Nigerian Conservation Foundation (NCF), the Guardian, a leading
newspaper in the country reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We have to look for areas where we can move forward," he said
noting that "it is not how much that counts but the level of
expertise and commitment demonstrated by people in doing things."
</P>
<P>
The organization has suspended all forms of new assistance to
Nigeria since 1993 due to what the bank called "poor results and
unfavorable political environment."
</P>
<P>
"Since 1993, our portfolio of activities has worn down
considerably", said Byer, adding that since then the Bank's
projects have reduced from 58 to 8. By March next year, all its
current projects would have been wound up.
</P>
<P>
The bank official agreed that Nigeria is bedeviled by many
environmental problems ranging from desert encroachment in the
North and pollution problems in the south to massive soil erosion
in the East.

<HEADLINE> Gemstones Smuggled out of Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Most of quality gemstones
produced in Tanzania are not available in the country but are
found in the neighboring country Kenya, a local newspaper said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by the Sunday Observer, Kenyan capital
Nairobi is fast becoming the unofficial regional marketing nerve
center for Tanzania's gemstones.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that most of Tanzania's gemstones find their way
outside the country's border through Nairobi, east Africa's
biggest city, where they are said to fetch a much higher price
than elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's gemstones find their way to Nairobi through porous
border between the two countries, it said.
</P>
<P>
A number of mineral and gemstone dealers in Dar es Salaam last
week told the paper that people can hardly find quality gemstones
in the formerly self-created marketing towns in Tanzania. By
contrast Nairobi abounds in all sorts of quality gemstones from
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is believed to be second only to the Democratic
Republic of Congo as the most important source of precious stones
in the southern African region.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that things began going wrong as long ago
as the early 1980s, particularly as tanzanite gained in
importance. Tanzanite is a precious blue stone produced only in
Tanzania, specifically in the volcanic soils to the southwest of
Mount Kilimanjaro. Strangely, Kenya now stands as the world's
largest exporter of this unique product.
</P>
<P>
Apart from tanzanite, Tanzanian gemstones most commonly found
on sale in Nairobi include green tourmaline, sapphire, garnet,
diamonds, rubies and emeralds.
</P>
<P>
Local mine dealers and brokers observed that gemstones and
minerals were also smuggled out of the country to Zambia, Malawi
and South Africa because of loose border checks.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian House Speaker Counter-attacks President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 22 (Xinhua) (C Nigerian Speaker of the House of
Representatives, Alhaji Ghali Na'aba Saturday accused President
Olusegun Obasanjo of high-handedness on state matters, saying that
most of his policy initiatives and actions are capable of
derailing democracy.
</P>
<P>
Na'aba made the counter-attack when addressing the secretariat
of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) in the country's
Northern state Kaduna, the Guardian, a leading Nigerian
newspapers reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said that, "I want to say that the executive arm of
government in Nigeria has been high-handed towards its legislative
and judicial counterparts and this is undermining democracy and I
want to assure you all that we shall resist it and we shall
continue to resist it."
</P>
<P>
The House had earlier demanded an apology from Obasanjo for his
 criticism on some legislators
</P>
<P>
But the president's spokesman, Doyin Okupe, said at the weekend
that Obasanjo does not intend to offer an apology. He said the
president's criticism on the top legislators lackluster was based
on an honest assessment of the lawmakers' showing.
</P>
<P>
Members of the National Assembly had frowned at the remarks
made by the president that the Assembly had been doing little or
nothing in its almost two months of inauguration.
</P>
<P>
Okupe said, "It is ridiculous to ask the president to apologize
for a statement he made as a citizen of this country, as a
president of this country.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a military regime. This is democracy. The
president combines two rights as the president. The president
says I have sent so much to the place and not much has happened.

ISLAMABAD, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Afghan Taliban official for
foreign affairs Mohammad Hassan Akhund will make a four-day visit
to Pakistan starting next Tuesday for talks on a number of issues,
focusing on Afghan transit trade.
</P>
<P>
Hassan will lead a high-level delegation and will hold talks
with Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz to discuss bilateral
issues, especially controversy over the transit trade agreement,
official sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan imposed restrictions on Afghan transit trade a couple
of years ago, arguing that most of the goods imported under the
agreement are smuggled into Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Smuggling of the goods has affected Pakistan's local industry,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban authorities has repeatedly asked Pakistan to lift
the restrictions on transit trade.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Islamabad's latest diplomatic efforts for
the peaceful settlement of the long-running Afghan crisis will
also come under discussion.

<HEADLINE> New China At Fifty (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- In the eyes of the Chinese, this
year is one of big events and jubilation.
</P>
<P>
The 50th anniversary of the People's Republic is the most
important. On October 1, there will be a grand ceremony in the
capital, Beijing, and parties all across the country for the
occasion. The 50 years of achievements are the pride of every
Chinese, who have every reason to express their enormous joy.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese spent
years fighting for the socialist China that was established on
October 1, 1949. For the past half century, although there have
been detours, the government has devoted itself to living up to
its goal of working for the interest of the people.
</P>
<P>
Now the country's overall strength has increased and all 56
ethnic groups are getting along well with each other and have
peaceful and happy lives and the nation's international status has
grown considerably.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jun, a TV producer from southwest China's Sichuan Province,
says that in the more than 100 years before 1949, China struggled
much of the time against foreign invasions or in wars between
warlords and every year several million people died from conflicts
and calamities.
</P>
<P>
A stable and secure government would have been a luxury in
those dark years, he says, but Chinese governments before the
founding of the People's Republic failed to produce the yearned-
for political stability. Only in 1949 was China, led by the
Communist Party, able to bring about what the Chinese had longed
for and to establish national pride.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Hu An'gang, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, says that
since the founding of the New China, a powerful central government
has been established, bringing about the successful
industrialization and modernization and social stability and
economic prosperity have helped increase people's confidence in
the government.

<HEADLINE> China to Play Leading Role in World Postal Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- China will play a leading role
in the world's postal services in the next five years because of
its extensive postal network, a senior official of the Universal
Postal Union (UPU) said here today.
</P>
<P>
As the presiding nation of the UPU Administrative Council in
the five years to come, China will serve as an example for the 170
developing countries of the 189 member countries in upgrading
postal services, said Thomas Leavey, director-general of the UPU's
International Bureau.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held today on the eve of the 22nd
Universal Postal Congress (UPC), which opens in Beijing on Monday,
he said that China is an important member of the international
community and a permanent member of the UN Security Council while
it has a prominent role in the UPU.
</P>
<P>
Leavey said he has never seen such good preparations and
facilities for a UPC, adding that at the International
Telecommunications Union congress last year in the United States
he did not see facilities as good as what he saw in Beijing in the
past two days.
</P>
<P>
Liu Pingyuan, secretary-general of the UPC organizing committee,
said that all preparatory work for the congress is completed and 2,
319 delegates are expected, including 68 at ministerial level and
260 at vice-ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
This will be the most heavily attended highest level congress
of the UPU in its 125-year history, Liu added.
</P>
<P>
The congress will be held from August 23 to September 15.
Chinese President Jiang Zemin will preside over an opening
ceremony on Monday.

<P>
YANGON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar gained a total of 246
million U.S. dollars in customs duties in the first four months of
this year, 321 million dollars less than that received in the same
period of last year which was 567 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest economic indicators published by the

duties obtained in the four-month period, import duties were 221
million dollars, while that in the corresponding period of last
year amounted to 353 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The indicators also show that the country's customs duties
income dropped from 1.274 billion dollars in 1997 to 1.135 billion
dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Myanmar has made some adjustments in the rate
of customs duties in an effort to boost the development of
agriculture. The country exempted import duties on agricultural
implements including machinery, pesticide and fertilizer while
raising import duties on luxury goods.

<HEADLINE> Arafat in Egypt for talks with Mubarak, Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
arrived in Egypt's Mediterranean port city of Alexandria on Sunday
for talks with President Hosni Mubarak and for a meeting later in
the day with the leader of an opposition Palestinian faction.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, accompanied by the planning minister and an advisor,
was greeted by Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa upon arrival
at the Bourg al Arab Airport, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to discuss with Mubarak the talks between the
Palestinians and Israel on the timetable for the last two of the
three-phased further pullback of Israeli troops from the West Bank
under the Wye River peace agreement signed last October.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Arafat, a frequent visitor to Egypt for
consultations with Mubarak on the Mideast peace process, will fly
to Cairo for a meeting with Nayef Hawatmah, secretary general of
the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), the
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be the first between Arafat and Hawatmah, who
arrived in Cairo on Saturday, since the 1993 signing of the Oslo
Accord, the main basis of the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming meeting is part of Arafat's efforts to mend the
fences among Palestinian factions and try to reach a national
reconciliation and a united Palestinian position on the coming
final status talks on thorny and significant issues, including
Jerusalem and the Palestinian statehood, with Israel.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier step on August 1, Arafat met with a delegation of
another Palestinian opposition group - the People's Front for the
Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) - in Cairo. The two sides agreed to
continue dialog and called on other groups to join the process.
</P>
<P>
DFLP and PFLP, both based in the Syrian capital of Damascus,
are opposed to the Oslo Accord.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Soldiers Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were wounded
Sunday morning in south Lebanon during attacks by Lebanese
guerrillas, Lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The two Israelis were slightly injured when Lebanese guerrillas
fired mortars toward their position in the central sector of the
Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, said in a
statement that its fighters attacked Israeli troops near Sojud
in the central sector.
</P>
<P>
Its guerrillas also launched assaults on nearby Israeli
positions at Melikh and Armata villages with heavy machine-guns
and mortars.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli artillery troops fired shells toward
suspected Hezbollah targets in the border enclave, destroying at
least four civilian houses.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of this year, 13 Israelis have been killed in
south Lebanon and 44 others wounded, while 19 Lebanese guerrillas,
mostly from Hezbollah, have been also killed.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon' resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli occupation forces
out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo to Have Public Email Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigerians are to get directly in
touch with President Olusegun Obasanjo through an E-mail messaging
system expected to come into effect before the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
Steve Itugbu, special assistant to the president on press
matters, said that the introduction of the system would offer the
opportunity to discuss government policies and actions with the
president, The Post Express reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The special assistant noted that the move was part of the
efforts of the Obasanjo administration to encourage transparency
and discourage rumor mongering with regards to government policies
and actions.
</P>
<P>
The president's address is "President
Obasanjo@nigeria.gov.org.". The official added that a reply
acknowledging the receipt of the mail will be relayed instantly.
</P>
<P>
After investigation if necessary, the president will personally
send a reply to the mailer addressing the issues, and any
information will be kept secret as the email would be assessed
only by the president and his personal assistant, Itugbu said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the novel approach to government/citizen
relationship would eliminate the tedious process Nigerians go
through to see the president often times without success as their
efforts are thwarted by both security operatives and an army of
personal aides.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the email system, he disclosed, there are also
efforts in the pipeline for a presidency website that would be
used by any information seeking Nigerian or non-Nigerian
interested in the activities of the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government Sunday
assured several million Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) that it
remains committed to help them have gainful jobs in the
Philippines once they return for good.
</P>
<P>
The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) has lined up
seminars and other programs that would help returning OFWs start
their own livelihood programs, President Joseph Estrada said in a
statement issued here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I encourage you to go to OWWA. It has a livelihood division
that has projects for OFWs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that the OWWA and its partners also give seminars
and loan assistance packages to returning OFWs who wish to start
their own businesses in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government considers OFWs as modern-day heroes because of
the vital role they play in their host countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the government, at least 4 million OFWs are
working in 182 countries and regions in the world and remit 5
billion to 6 billion dollars a year to their country.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the government has lined up several benefit
programs and packages for them and their families, such as loan
assistance, entrepreneurial opportunities, housing programs and
medical care packages.

JERUSALEM, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- One of the first things Texas Governor George W. Bush would
do if elected U.S. president in November 2000, is to start the
process of moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem,
Republican Congressman Roy Blunt of Missouri said Saturday in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Department of Defense has approved the sale of 100
Israeli-developed Popeye air-to-air missiles to South Korea's air
force. The missile, developed by Rafael and manufactured in a
joint venture with Lockheed Martin through the U.S.-based firm
Pegasus, is considered one of the most accurate air-to-air
missiles in the world, and can be mounted on F-15s and F-16s
currently used by South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- A nine-year-old Israeli girl, Shiran Franco, was rescued
Saturday from the rubble of a building in Turkey, nearly 100 hours
after she was buried alive with her family during the
earthquake. Experts say people trapped in such situations usually
can survive only 72 hours because of dehydration.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Ahronot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli and Palestinian negotiating teams met Saturday to
continue their attempts to forge an agreement on the
implementation of the Wye accords and the conducting of
accelerated negotiations on the final status agreement.
</P>
<P>
The two sides were working on a joint draft, but there were
still gaps on the two central issues of a timetable for completing
the planned Israeli withdrawals and the number of Palestinian
prisoners to be released from Israeli jails.

<HEADLINE> Abducted Foreigners to Be Freed Soon: Iranian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran's law enforcement forces
in the southern province of Kerman have reached agreement with
kidnapers of four foreign tourists, and the hostages will be
freed soon.
</P>
<P>
According to a provincial official, negotiations had been
conducted with the captors through local tribal head, who acted as
intermediary.
</P>
<P>
The hostages were taken from their hotel by three men and two
women armed with automatic weapons. The tourists were identified
as three Spaniards - Khoykin Fernandez, Cosmi Poetra and Pedro
Garcia - and an Italian Massimo Cattabriga.
</P>
<P>
The official, who was not named, said the kidnapers had no
political motives but are only drug smugglers. There is no
evidence to show any possible link between the kidnapers with the
Afghan Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Iran's relations with the Taliban, which now rules most of
Afghanistan, became worse after eight Iranian diplomats and a
correspondent were killed by the militiamen a year ago in the
northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The official said the kidnapers want the exchange of the four
foreign tourists with two fellow tribesmen, Gader Shah-Bakhsh and
Hossein Khassi-Farahani who are in government custody.
</P>
<P>
He said the police formed a security triangle Thursday in
southeastern Iran to trap the kidnapers, who are members of
the Shah-Bakhsh, one of the two main tribes in the area.
</P>
<P>
President Mohammad Khatami has asked his intelligence and
interior ministries to look into, among others, the root cause of
the kidnaping.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- India's inflation rate rose to
1.70 percent for the week ended on August 7, due to increased
prices of food articles and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve Bank of India, inflation rate was
higher at 8.07 percent during the same period last year due to
abnormal rise in prices.
</P>
<P>
Annual inflation rate, based on the Wholesale Price Index,
stood at 1.62 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
Lower rate of inflation this year is mainly on account of a
higher base last year when prices of food articles, especially
vegetables rose substantially.

MOSCOW, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian troops fighting Chechen
infiltrators in Daghestan captured the key village of Tando and an
important rebel supply route overnight, the Defense Ministry said
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We took over Tando and the Kharami mountain pass," a ministry

The spokesman said Russian troops were continuing artillery
strikes on two other key villages, Ansalta and Rakhata, but no
infantry attack was under way.

He revealed that one Russian officer died in action on Saturday,
while 28 guerrillas were killed and one captured in the attack on
the mountain pass. During the fighting several vehicles were
destroyed and 17 anti-tank rocket launchers recovered.
</P>
<P>
Tando, which is located near the town of Botlikh in Dagestan's
southern mountains, has been the scene of much of the fiercest
fighting between Russian troops and the muslim guerrillas since
clashes began two weeks ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian troops fighting Chechen
infiltrators in Daghestan captured the key village of Tando and an
important rebel supply route overnight, the Defense Ministry said
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We took over Tando and the Kharami mountain pass," a ministry
spokesman told reporters, adding that the pass was the main route
by which the rebels brought armor into Daghestan from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Russian troops were continuing artillery
strikes on two other key villages, Ansalta and Rakhata, but no
infantry attack was under way.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that one Russian officer died in action on Saturday,
while 28 guerrillas were killed and one captured in the attack on
the mountain pass. During the fighting several vehicles were
destroyed and 17 anti-tank rocket launchers recovered.
</P>
<P>
Tando, which is located near the town of Botlikh in Daghestan's
southern mountains, has been the scene of much of the fiercest
fighting between Russian troops and the muslim guerrillas since
clashes began two weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> Pak Facilitating Afghan Factions to End Conflict: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz said Sunday Pakistan is only trying to facilitate the
Afghan warring factions to put an end to the war and find a way
for restoring peace in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
"We are not mediating rather only trying to facilitate the two
sides (the Taliban and the opposition alliance) to hold talks,"
the Associated Press of Pakistan quoted Aziz as saying during an
interview with BBC.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that the anti-Taliban alliance itself had asked
Islamabad to help end the long-running fighting.
</P>
<P>
"We had received a message from Professor (Burhanuddin) Rabbani
(former Afghan president) that the war has prolonged and we should
assist them in this regard. Obviously we have since long been
trying to put an end to the war and find a way for restoration of
peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Pakistani government earlier this week sent a
delegation to Dushanbe, capital of Tajikistan, for talks with the
anti-Taliban alliance.
</P>
<P>
"Now our delegation has been sent to Kandahar to inform the
Taliban of the proposals and views of the opposition," he added.

<HEADLINE> Massive Strike Looming In S.Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- An estimated one million
public- sector workers are expected to down tools on Tuesday in
what could be an unprecedented war of attrition between the labor
movement and government over salary increases.
</P>
<P>
This industrial dispute is spearheaded by four unions
affiliated to the Congress of South African Trade Unions and the
mainly white Federated Unions of South Africa, the City Press
newspaper reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Unless a way out the impasse is found soon, the one-day strike
could turn into a long, drawn-out test of strength between the
government and trade unions, some of whom are its alliance
partners.
</P>
<P>
The government on Saturday maintained a stony silence on the
pay dispute with civil servants, saying it has nothing to add to
Public Service and Administration Minister Geraldine
Fraser-Moleketi's statement earlier in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Fraser-Moleketi said government would not tolerate an illegal
strike by unions pursuing their won narrow interests to the
detriment of society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
She also rejected demands that employees who participate in
the strike should be exempted from the no-work no-pay rule.
</P>
<P>
The government has also made it clear that it will not budge
from its offer of a 6.3 percent increase. The unions, on the other
hand, are demanding an average increase of 7.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last week Fraser-Moleketi broke off negotiations when she
unilaterally decided to implement the 6.3 percent wage increase.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Artifacts Back to Egypt from Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Sunday took back home 28
pieces of ancient antiquities handed over by Jordan, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Gaballah Ali Gaballah, head of the Egyptian Supreme Council for
Antiquities, who represented Egypt in the handover ceremony of the
antiquities in Jordan on Wednesday, returned to Cairo with the
precious pieces earlier on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon arrival at Cairo International
Airport, Gaballah praised the Jordanian government's assistance in
the return of 28 artifacts to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
"The interference of the Jordanian prime minister and the
tourism minister has helped in the retrieval of the Egyptian
artifacts smuggled (into the kingdom)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan on Wednesday handed over to Egypt the 28 pieces of
ancient anticrafts stolen from various Egyptian archaeological
sites, smuggled into the kingdom but intercepted in Jordan's Red
Sea port of Aqaba last April.
</P>
<P>
Gaballah said the antiquities include six turquoise and brown
magic charms believed to have fended off illness and date back to
650 B.C. or the Late Period, and 21 bluish Pharaonic statues, each
10 centimeters high, called the Shawabti, or the answer, which
used to be buried with the dead to serve them in the other world.
</P>
<P>
He said the most significant of all was a 30-kilogram head of
the statue of Serapis, an ancient god worshiped by the people of
Alexandria in the Ptolemaic age that dates back to the first
century A.D.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: High Technology Industry Flourishing in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- China began to launch the "Torch
Program" for the commercial and industrial use of scientific
developments and the promotion of high technology industry in
August of 1988. The program has helped increase the proportion of
high technology remarkably in the whole national industry.
</P>
<P>
The key technological development fields for the program
include new materials, biological technology, electronics and
information, the combination of mechanics and electronics, new
energy and environment protection, and other high technology
fields.
</P>
<P>
The "Torch Program" has effectively promoted the development of
China's high technology industry during the past 11 years. In 1998,
projects of the "Torch Program" turned out a total of 144.5
billion yuan (about 17.4 billion US dollars) in output value and
26.6 billion yuan (about 4.2 billion US dollars) in revenue, and
earned 2.4 billion US dollars from exports.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the program has established more than
12,000 projects, and developed a large group of hi-tech products
which include the New Era high-performance computer, type-04, type-
08 and SP-30 large and middle-sized program-controlled exchange
machines and other products.
</P>
<P>
The program also brought some large scientific group into
existence such as Founder, Legend and Stone, which have more than
one billion yuan of total assets and can turn out more than 100
million yuan in revenue each year.
</P>
<P>
To better implement the "Torch Program" and promote the
development of hi-tech industry, China has approved the
establishment of 53 national hi-tech industry development zones
across the country and granted them with favorable policies.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, those hi-tech development zones have
reported more than 480 billion yuan in their total income, and
produced 430 billion yuan in the total industrial output value,
both of which are much higher than the end of the previous year.

NAIROBI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Senegal claimed the 16th and

defeating Eritrea 2-0 in Asmara, Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Henry Kamara gave Senegal the lead in the 46th minute and
Traore Mambara added the another goal in the final minute.

<P>
The victory gave Senegal a 3-0-1 record and nine points in the
three-nation playoff group, same as Zimbabwe but ahead on goal
difference.
</P>
<P>
The three-nation playoff was created after the African Football
Confederation (CAF) rescinded its decision to have Zimbabwe host
the finals in February, saying the country was unprepaped to stage
the biennial continental championship.
</P>
<P>
Ghana and Nigeria were selected to replace Zimbabwe in March.
</P>
<P>
The victory qualified Senegal for its sixth African Cup finals
and first since 1994.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Tries to Attract More Foreign Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
taking measures to entice millions of Filipino expatriates or
foreigners with Filipino roots to visit the Philippines and
convince their neighbors or fellow workers to do the same.
</P>
<P>
In a report released here Sunday, Tourism Secretary Gemma Cruz
Araneta said that her department aims to tap overseas Filipinos
with its recent launching of "the Tourism Frontliners" and "the
Discover Your Roots" projects.
</P>
<P>
To help market the country as a premier tourist destination in
the region, Araneta said her department would revive the Overseas
Philippine Tourism Councils and at the same time establish
Philippine overseas youth councils in key cities in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Frontliners program aims to tap 6.97 million
overseas Filipinos as frontliners for tourism marketing and
promotions in their places of work and their communities in return
for a package of incentives, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Discover Your Roots program, the official said, is designed
to woo third-and fourth-generation Filipino-Americans living in
the United States to visit their ancestral homeland and rediscover
their cultural roots.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show there are 2,940,082 Filipinos working
abroad; another 2,153,967 are residing permanently in different
countries; and 1.88 million more are undocumented ones.
</P>
<P>
A Philippine delegation led by Araneta launched these projects
earlier this month during a two-week sales mission in the United
States, which is home to 1.69 million Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
The United States remains as the country's main tourist market,
accounting for 468,808 tourists last year, 65,821 of them
Filipino-Americans.

KAMPALA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Uganda People's Defense Forces
(UPDF) has rejected tinned food rations and biscuits recently
imported from South Africa after chemists declared them unfit for
human consumption.
</P>
<P>
The decision follows the findings of top chemists who inspected
the food in Jinja and Magamaga Ordinance Depot where the
consignment was kept.

The rations, supplied by Kramer Trade and Technology and meant
for UPDF soldiers in war zones, are worth two billion shillings

<HEADLINE> 4 More Earthquake Victims Rescued in Turkey After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Weak but alive, a 95-year-old
woman was pulled out of the ruins of a vacation home by a Turkish
rescue team in the earthquake-hit township of Cinarcik Saturday,
the Turkish Daily News reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A few hours earlier, nearby, a 10-year-old Israeli girl who
had been buried under the rubble of her family's summer house
since Tuesday had been rescued by Israeli rescue teams, said the
English-language newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Defying ever waning hopes, four quake victims were rescued
alive on the day, four days after after Tuesday's massive
earthquake in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In Golcuk, two sisters identified as Ilknur Cengiz, 19, and
Oznur Cengiz, 10, were pulled out by French and Turkish
crews. They had been trapped under the rubble for 116 hours. The
teams were now trying to save a woman who lived on the floor below
the sisters.
</P>
<P>
Experts say people trapped in such situations usually can
survive only 72 hours because of dehydration. The sweltering heat
of the week made conditions even worse, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
The distressing truth, however, is that there are tens of
thousands of people still missing and that with every victims
pulled out of debris alive, rescuers are recovering hundreds of
corpses as official death toll rose to 12,040 Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The massive quake, with a magnitude of 7.4 degrees on the
Richter scale, rocked heavily-populated northwest Turkish
provinces near the Marmara Sea at 3:02 a.m. (0002 GMT) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Since then, there have been 1,300 aftershocks in the region,
dozens of which registered at four degrees or above.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary estimates have put direct economic loss of the
quake at between 20 and 40 billion U.S. dollars, though no
concrete figures could be concluded as rescue works were still
going on.

BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin will begin
a trip to Bishkek, capital of Kyrgyzstan, between August 24 and 26
for a five-nation summit meeting among China, Russia, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, at the invitation of Kyrgyzstan's

</P>
<P>
The heads of state of the five countries will discuss and

Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"The tour will be one of peace and friendship," said an
official of the ministry.
</P>

confidence in the military area and on mutual reduction of armed
forces in border areas, and the Alma-Ata Joint Statement.

</P>
<P>
"The five-nation summit has already played and will continue to

Officials said that the new document will, based on the border
agreements signed by the two countries in 1996, enable the two
countries to settle disputes over the last piece of disputed land.
</P>
<P>
The document comes through negotiations on the basis of
equality, mutual understanding and mutual accommodation as well as
generally-acknowledged norms of international law.
</P>
<P>
"Relevant documents are now ready for signature," said the
official. "The additional agreement will be a milestone ushering
in a new stage in good-neighborly and friendly bilateral relations
and signifying that all border problems between the two countries
are cleared," he added.
</P>
<P>
The border area between the two countries will become a bridge

he said.
</P>
<P>
China and Central Asian countries have had a long history of
friendship, dating back as early as to the "Silk Road" age of more
than 1,000 years ago. Jiang's current trip, analysts said, will
bring new vigor to that friendship.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Gets Tough On Debtor Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Council of Ministers of the
Economic Community of the West Africa States (ECOWAS) decided
Friday night in Abuja to impose sanctions against members owing
the organization some 37.2 million US dollars in contribution
arrears.
</P>
<P>
The decision, adopted at its three-day 44th session, is in
response to the financial problem hindering the integration of
the 24-year-old body, reported the Pan-African New Agency (PANA).
</P>
<P>
The ministers called for the invocation of article 77 which
among others,
</P>
<P>
stipulates that debtor nations be denied voting rights, while
their nationals are to be excluded from appointments into
statutory and professional positions of ECOWAS. grouping 16 west
African states
</P>
<P>
Such members would also lose loans and other financial
assistance and the right to air their views on community matters.
</P>
<P>
The council also set up a six-member ad-hoc committee on the
restructuring of the ECOWAS secretariat to make the organization
more effective.
</P>
<P>
The committee was given two months to prepare proposals ahead
of the October or November summit.
</P>
<P>
Some members have suggested a new structure with four deputy
executive secretaries as against the current three and the
scrapping of the position of financial controller to be replaced
by the internal auditor.
</P>
<P>
The present quota arrangement whereby posts are zoned to
countries has equally been criticized with a suggestion for an
equitable formula taking into account the geographical spread and
financial contributions of members.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS fund is also to be restructured to create what the
ministers called a holding company to be known as ECOWAS Bank for
Investment and Development which would have two subsidiaries - a
regional investment bank and development fund.

MANILA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines government Sunday
ordered local government units to beef up their forest
fire-fighting capabilities amid the resurgence of forest fires in
neighboring Malaysia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Sunday, Antonio Cerilles, secretary
of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, said that
the department's fire-fighting teams have been on 24-hour alert
and are constantly monitoring the possible occurrence of forest
fires nationwide.

He said that the government issued the order "following the
recurrence of forest fires in Southeast Asian countries like
Indonesia and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Cerilles said he has directed the department's regional
directors to mobilize all 6,000 foresters and forest rangers
nationwide to man all existing fire lookout stations and be in
close touch with local governments for forest-fire control.
</P>

Local officials should "remain on alert for possible forest
fires in their areas in view of the recurrence of the problem in
Southeast Asian countries despite the wet season," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's Sumatra and Kalimantan were again hit by
debilitating smog caused by forest fires recently. Authorities
said that the fires were caused by large plantations which burned
wooded land to clear it for planting.
</P>
<P>
As part of a long-term plan to allow government to best deal
with this problem, Cerilles said the government would initially
"seek the help of the Japanese government in acquiring free
fire-fighting equipment."

timetable" or details of which purchases could end up being
indefinitely shelved.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Accuses Burundi of Helping Rwandans in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has accused Burundi for
helping Rwandan troops the Kisangani battle in which about 30
Ugandan soldiers died.
</P>
<P>
The accusation was made by Kahinda Otafiire, President Yoweri
Museveni's adviser on the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC),
the New Vision paper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said Burundi has at least 4,000 troops in Kisangani backing
Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) against Ugandan soldiers and the
Burundi troops had participated in Kisangani clashes a week ago.
</P>
<P>
However, there has not been any response from Rwanda and
Burundi to this accusation.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Rwandan Vice President and Minister of
Defense Paul Kagame arrives in Kampala Sunday to hold talks with
Museveni on the DRC issue. DRC rebel leader Wamba dia Wamba is
also here on his way to Lusaka to sign the ceasefire agreement,
the report added.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day clashes between Ugandan and Rwandan troops
in Kisangani, both sides sustained heavy losses. The fighting
prompted an urgent meeting of Museveni and Kagame in western
Uganda on Monday and Tuesday and it came up with a ceasefire
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda, former friendly allies, turned against each
other after the DRC rebel group the Congolese Rally for Democracy
split into two opposing factions in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
This friction between two friends has widely been regarded as
further complicating the fragile peace process of the third
largest African country.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, Both Museveni and Rwandan President
Pasteur Bizimungu were invited to the 19th summit of the Southern
African Development Community to discuss the issue.

</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government launched an anti-drug drive on
November 30, 1998 and has worked out an anti-drug action program
for the 1998-2000 period, focusing on raising public awareness of
the harms of drug abuse and mobilizing everybody, every family and
the whole society to participate in the drive of preventing and
fighting drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
The National Drug Control Committee held a conference in Hanoi
on Saturday (August 21) to review drug control efforts in the
national anti-drug drive.
</P>
<P>
According to Vietnam's Minister of Public Security and Vice
Chairman of the National Drug Control Committee Le Minh Huong,
from November 30 last year to August 15 this year, Vietnam's
special task forces detected almost 8,200 drug-related crimes,
arresting 16,820 offenders and seizing more than 46 kg of heroin,
252.6 kg of opium and 319 kg of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
People's courts at all levels in the country tried 3,310 drug
cases with 4,952 defendants in the period from December 1998 to
May this year, sentencing 35 to death.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to eradicate the growing of opium poppy have also
yielded good results. From 12,000 hectares of opium poppy in 1993,
the country now has only nine hectares left scatteredly in
northern mountainous provinces.
</P>
<P>
By May this year, the country had 97,000 drug addicts under
monitoring and 8,000 drug-addicted prisoners. Over the past nine
months, almost 9,000 addicts have been treated at detoxification
centers under the Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Almost 3,340 others were detoxified at communal centers or at
home, and 1,200 rehabilitated people were given occupational
training and jobs.
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse among young people has also been reduced thanks to
intensified education and prevention measures undertaken by the
Ministry of Education and Training in coordination with relevant
agencies.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government also attaches importance to the
international cooperation in controlling cross-border drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Authorities of provinces along both sides of the Vietnam-Laos
border line had met to discuss cooperation in this field. Vietnam
has participated in six sub-regional drug control projects and
joined a system of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
to exchange information on criminals, including drug-related
criminals. It has also coordinated with Interpol (International
Police Organization) and other countries to detect more than 30
international drug-related crimes in the reviewed period. The
United Nations and a number of non-governmental organizations have
provided financial support to Vietnam's four national drug control
projects.
</P>
<P>
However, Le Minh Huong noted that the situation remains
worrisome with failures in stopping the flow of drug across the
border, the increasing complication in drug-related crimes and
unstable results in eradicating the growing of opium poppy.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, at the conference held
by the National Drug Control Committee, also pointed out the wide
spread of drug-related crimes, saying that drug abuse is causing
concern to every family and the whole society. It is a threat to
the country's sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Khai called on Vietnam's relevant agencies and the entire
people to raise their sense of responsibility and create more
positive changes in preventing and fighting drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's special task forces and relevant ministries plan to
intensify their efforts in education and prevention measures
against drug-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
The National Drug Control Committee of the country will ask the
government to allow the establishment of a "Drug Control Fund" and
an additional 10 billion Vietnamese dong (about 720 thousand U.S.
dollars) for the task in the remaining months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Committee also plans to work out and sign cooperation
agreements on drug control with the United States, China and other
ASEAN countries and boost its cooperation with the UN
International Drug Control Program (UNDCP) and Interpol.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Cuts Car Duties, Raises Petrol Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has decided to cut off
customs and taxes on cars by an average of 67 percent, but to
increase petrol prices to compensate for the losses of the state
treasury.
</P>
<P>
Duties on cars with engine capacities below 1,500 cubic
centimeters (cc) will be reduced to 60 percent from 105 percent,
1,500-2,000cc cars to 80 percent from 136 percent, according to
the a decision made after a cabinet meeting on Saturday,
</P>
<P>
Duties on 2,000-2,500cc and over 2,500cc cars will be reduced
to 100 and 120 percent respectively from 200 percent.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of duties on imported cars was expected to cause
some 37 million Jordanian dinars (51.8 million U.S. dollars) to
the state treasury, the semi-officials Jordan Times said.
</P>
<P>
The government decided to raise petrol prices to 400 fils (0.56
dollars) from 380 fils (0.53 dollars) to patch up for the losses
caused by the reduction of duties on cars.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 million dinars (28 million dollars) will be recouped by
increasing the gas prices plus registration and licensing fees,
and the remaining 17 million dinar (23.8 million dollars) will be
handled by the treasury itself, Prime Minister Abdul Raouf
Rawabdeh said.
</P>
<P>
The decision to reduce car duties was believed to be part
of the kingdom`s efforts to join the World Trade Organization,
which generally calls for the reduction of customs duties to
encourage free trade.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is unable to produce cars, and vehicles on the Jordanian
roads are mainly imported from Germany, Japan, South Korea, France
and other major world car producers.

<HEADLINE> Perkins Suffers Another Confidence Sapper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Kieren Perkins' triple Olympic
1500m freestyle hopes took another setback Sunday when he
struggled to 14th in the 400m heats on the opening day of the Pan
Pacific Swimming Championship in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old Australian dual Olympic champion appeared to be
suffering the effects of a virus as he jumped in for his first
race of the championships in the Olympic pool.
</P>
<P>
Perkins laboured home in three minutes 59.27 seconds, almost 12
seconds slower than his teammate Grant Hackett, the fastest
qualifier in 3:47.37.
</P>
<P>
Perkins' time was also more than 15 seconds slower than his
1994 world record (3:43.80) at the Rome World Championships.
</P>
<P>
Australian coach Denis Cotterell said the virus had stripped
the triple world record-holder of three kilograms in weight.
</P>
<P>
Perkins wants to become the first male swimmer to win gold
medals in the same event at three successive Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Pan-Arab Games Lower Flags to Mourn Saudi Prince </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Flags at the ninth Pan-Arab Games
in Amman will be flown half-mast for three days from Sunday to
mourn the death of Saudi Prince Faisal Ben Fahd, the eldest son
of Saudi King Fahd.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing Pan-Arab games would continue as scheduled at the
request of Saudi Arabia despite the passing away of Prince Faisal,
who died of a heart attack Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Faisal had been the de facto Saudi sports minister and also
head of the Arab Sports Federation of the 22-member Arab League.
</P>
<P>
However, competitions slated for Sunday would be postponed for
three hours and all matches will be preceded by a moment of
silence in memory of Faisal.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made late Saturday after an emergency meeting
of the Organizing Committee of the Pan-Arab Games.
</P>
<P>
"The Saudis have informed us that they do not wish to see the
Games suspended," said Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister Ayman
Majali after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Faisal visited Amman last Sunday to attend the opening ceremony
of the ninth Pan-Arab Games, the largest and last Arab sports
event of the century.
</P>
<P>
He died shortly after returning to Saudi Arabia from Amman.
</P>
<P>
"We have lost one of the pillars of Arab sports," said Sheikh
Issa Ben Rashid of Bahrain, deputy president of the Arab Sports
Federation after hearing the death of Faisal.
</P>
<P>
A record 4,600 athletes from 21 Arab countries took part in the
ninth Pan-Arab games in Jordan with Kuwait sending an official
delegation headed by a minister.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait boycotted the games to protest against the participation
of Iraqi athletes as the two countries are still hostile to each
other nine years after the Gulf war.

<P>
OTTAWA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Supreme Court Chief
Justice Antonio Lamer Saturday announced his resignation on
January 7 of next year.
</P>
<P>
Lamer said the position is no longer appealing to him years
after he was first appointed chief justice in 1989, according to
Canadian media.
</P>
<P>
"What was a very demanding, nevertheless challenging, period of
my professional life is gradually becoming a job," the 66-year-old
chief justice told a Canadian Bar Association meeting in Edmonton,
Alberta.
</P>
<P>
Lamer, the longest-serving member of Canada's highest court,
began his 10th year as chief justice in July. He was a well-known
criminal lawyer before he became a judge almost 40 years ago, the
media said.

<P>
OTTAWA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Glen Clark, premier of Canada's
western province of British Columbia, resigned a day after he was
put under criminal investigation Friday.
</P>
<P>
CTV said Clark tendered his resignation earlier Saturday, but
maintained he had done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
"I'm completely confident I will be exonerated and cleared,"
Clark told reporters later, but adding "I've concluded it would be
wrong of me to continue."
</P>
<P>
Canadian Attorney General Ujjal Dosanjh announced Friday that
Clark "is under criminal investigation" because of possible
involvement in corruption.
</P>
<P>
Clark is alleged to have worked "vigorously" for a friend to
get a casino license. In return, he could receive 15 percent of
the profits from the casino owner, the television said.

<HEADLINE> China Says Y2K Problem Is Far from Solved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese senior official said
that although China has taken many measures to solve the Y2K
problem, the situation is not satisfactory in some places.
</P>
<P>
Today's "China Daily" quoted Zhang Qi, an official with the
Ministry of Information Industry, as saying that the sectors of
finance, securities, aviation and telecommunications have finished
modifying their systems and have undergone nationwide tests,
however, there are still problems in power and petroleum
industries.
</P>
<P>
The paper did not give any detailed information, but noted that
China is also facing difficulty because there are no laws dealing
with the issue.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that there will be possible legal disputes that
might arise because of the Y2K problem, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Officials and experts will go to the United States to study
what the US has done in the legal area to tackle the problem,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K crisis would break out before and after December 31,
1999, or January 1, 2000, because many older computers would mis-
treat 2000 as 1900 because of their program design.

<HEADLINE> Former UK PM Sees Great Changes in China Over Past Decades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Former British prime minister
Edward Heath smiled as he looked back upon his "growing
understanding" of China over the years, telling the "three things"
he felt proud of as someone with a five-decade-long political
career behind.
</P>
<P>
He summed up his observation of China's changes over the
decades in the light of his exchanges with the People's Republic
of China, which will celebrate the 50th anniversary of its
founding on October 1.
</P>
<P>
As a one-time political heavy-weight in the world, the 83-year-
old Heath is one of the few foreign personalities who have had
close contacts with the three generations of the Chinese
leadership.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua, he recalled meetings with
Chinese leaders spanning the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
"All the leaders were remarkable in the way they discussed the
full range of issues, quick and sharp in thinking and talking,
each though with his own focus of interest," Heath said. "Chairman
Mao (Zedong) liked to talk about international affairs. Chairman
Deng (Xiaoping) tended to focus on domestic issues, mostly the
economy of China, and he could be so specific as to go into the
details of agriculture. And President Jiang (Zemin) seemed to be
interested in the organization of the country, or the perfection
of the institutions, political and economic, in addition to his
apparent attention to the world's issues."
</P>
<P>
He agreed that the different focuses, in a sense, reflected the
changes China had undergone over the decades.
</P>
<P>
The late 1970s, when Heath met twice with late Chairman Mao,
showed emerging signs of China's overall opening to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
The 1980s, when he had a number of audiences with Deng Xiaoping,
the chief architect of China's reform program, marked an era of
the fastest economic development in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s, Heath has met with Jiang
Zemin and other top Chinese leaders on several occasions, whose
conversations indicate China's growing maturity toward overall
modernization, along with the enhancement of national strength,
international status, and increasing influence in the global
economic system.
</P>
<P>
Heath, who will shortly go on his 24th visit to China, said
that he "never failed to be surprised" in each of his previous 23
visits to China in the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
"The nation has literally been transformed, just as the roads
and skyline of Beijing, and the newly-developed area in Shanghai,"
he said, referring to China as a country with the greatest changes
in the last decades of this century.
</P>
<P>
As he played a special part in the resolution of the Hong Kong
issue between Britain and China, the memory of that constituted a
sense of pride for Heath too. He first discussed the issue of Hong
Kong's stable transfer with veteran Chinese leaders during his
first visit to China in 1974.
</P>
<P>
He recalled his meeting in April, 1982 with Deng Xiaoping,
during which the late Chinese leader expounded for the first time
China's principles on resolving the Hong Kong issue, including the
resumption of exercise of sovereignty, establishment of a special
administrative region in Hong Kong which would be ruled by local
people while preserving Hong Kong's social system.
</P>
<P>
Having visited Hong Kong on two occasions since attending the
handover ceremony in 1997, Heath said the he was satisfied with
the social stability, economic development and smooth operation of
the political system in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has largely overcome the difficulties that arose with
the Asian crisis "due to the correct decisions made in Beijing as
well as in Hong Kong," he said, adding that the policy of "one
country two systems" has proved highly successful and produced the
best possible result for Hong Kong itself, for China, for Britain,
and for the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Hong Kong model could work elsewhere in the world
for settling problems left from history and the historic event
represented a major contribution to the development of world
politics in the 20th century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Heath believed that Macao's return at the end of this year
would undoubtedly be as smooth as Hong Kong's return and the
Taiwan issue would be resolved sooner or later with a similar
approach.
</P>
<P>
Another special episode in Heath's ties with China was the
establishment of Sino-British diplomatic relations at the
ambassadorial level in 1972 when he was the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of Sino-British relations, for example, generally
coincided with the development of China itself, said Heath.
</P>
<P>
Now, Heath noted, Sino-British relations face a new period of
expansion, for Britain and Europe as a whole increasingly
appreciate the importance of good ties with China.
</P>
<P>
So long as China would manage to sustain its economic growth
along the present path of success, the country will undoubtedly
grow stronger and more powerful, he said.

<HEADLINE> Over 50 tons of Cocaine Go through C. America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 50 tons of cocaine
out of the 850 tons moved by international drug traffickers go
through Central America every year, parliamentarians of the region
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At its fifth regional meeting held here Friday, the Central
American Interparliamentary Commission Against Corruption and Drug
Trafficking (CICONA) noted that Central America has become an
important "bridge" for international drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Among the 850 tons of cocaine trafficked each year, it said,
650 tons go to the United States and 150 tons to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Besides exchanging views on the drug-related problems in the
countries of the isthmus, the parliamentarians also proposed the
creation of antidrug regional police and the coordination of
relevant laws.
</P>
<P>
They revealed that the first regional summit against drug
trafficking will be held in Costa Rica next February to discuss
the creation of a Central American anti-drug police.
</P>
<P>
The legislators urged to study the eventual extradition of
nationals involved in drug trafficking, which is forbidden at
present by most of the constitutions.
</P>
<P>
The police chiefs of the area also agreed at the meeting to
intensify their efforts against common and organized crime in the
region.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Hails Opening of Postal Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- "People's Daily", China's
leading newspaper, carries an editorial today, expounding that the
staging of the 22nd Congress of the Universal Postal Union (UPU)
tomorrow in Beijing is very significant for both China and the
world.
</P>
<P>
This will be a great event in China's relations with the
outside world, as well as in its reform and opening-up process,
according to the editorial, titled "An Opening China Is Pleased to
Welcome Guests from Postal Services Throughout the World".
</P>
<P>
It says that the event is a part of China's multilateral
diplomatic strategy, and President Jiang Zemin has taken the
position of the honorary chairman of the organizing committee,
because the gathering is so important.
</P>
<P>
Now the country is fully ready for the grand opening, as a good
environment has been created by more than 20 ministries and
commissions and other institutions over the past years, according
to the article.
</P>
<P>
It continues that the congress will be a window for the nation
to show its achievements in the past 50 years, particularly, the
past 20 years, during which the reform and opening-up were on full
swing.
</P>
<P>
The article says that China has had postal services for 3,000
years, and since new China was founded, the Chinese Government has
taken a lot of measures to modernize the sector, which is
important in guaranteeing the right to communications, a major
part of the human rights.
</P>
<P>
"China has established the largest postal system in the world,"
the paper says, adding that it is doing something to upgrade the
technologies.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stresses that the congress will help step up the
reform and development of China's postal sector, which is being
driven by the market force and faced with huge social demands.
</P>
<P>
It says that China has established postal links with 145
countries and regions, and the opening of the congress will enable
the country to open wider to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The congress is the last one the UPU to stage in the century,
so it is significant for bringing the world into a promising
future, and the development strategy formulated by the congress
will have a great impact on the political and economic interest of
different countries, the editorial says.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Reports Trade Surplus of 468.1m U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Colombia registered a
trade surplus of 468.1 million U.S. dollars in the first six
months of this year as against a 1.822-billion-dollar deficit in
the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
A report published Saturday by the National Statistics
Administrative Department attributed the surplus to a 36 percent
contraction of imports caused by economic recession.
</P>
<P>
The imports of capital goods and building materials dropped by
41.6 percent in the period under review, followed by equipment and
transportation facilities with 35.7 percent, and raw materials
with 30.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Imports from the United States, Colombia's no. 1 trade partner,
dropped by 29.4 percent to 1.849 billion dollars. Imports from
Japan fell by 51.1 percent to 208.2 million dollars and from
Venezuela to 386.9 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Colombia's exports also dropped by 5.1
percent in the first six months of the year to 5.214 billion
dollars compared with 5.497 billion in the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Colombia starts to show a surplus in the current
account after six consecutive years of deficit that reached its
highest level in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Tottenham Win to Top Premier League Table </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Tottenham Hotspur moved into the
top spot in England for the first time in 13 years after beating
Sheffield Wednesday 2-1 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Their stay would prove to be short-lived when arch-rivals
Arsenal meet champions Manchester United at Highbury on Sunday and
whoever wins that game will leapfrog Spurs by a point.
</P>
<P>
If Arsenal and Manchester United draw then Spurs will remain in
pole position on goal difference from Middlesbrough.
</P>
<P>
Spurs victory, thanks to first half goals from Les Ferdinand
and Norwegian international Oyvind Leonhardsen, meant they have
won three successive league matches for the first time in four
years.
</P>
<P>
Middlesbrough beat Liverpool 1-0 with Brian Deane scoring the
only goal early in the second half.
</P>
<P>
With Spurs and Middlesbrough top on nine points, United slipped
back to third and are one of six teams on seven points along with
Chelsea, Aston Villa, Leeds United, West Ham and Arsenal. United,
Chelsea, West Ham and Arsenal all have a game in hand over the top
two.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea moved up from seventh to fourth with their 1-0 win over
Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge thanks to an own goal from Ugo
Ehiogu after 52 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic game of the day was at St James' Park where
Newcastle, without the suspended England skipper Alan Shearer,
squandered a 3-1 lead and allowed Wimbledon to grab a 3-3 draw.
</P>
<P>
That result gave Newcastle their first point of the season
after three straight defeats and they remain 18th with only Derby
County and Sheffield Wednesday below them.

<HEADLINE> I Feel Attached to China: Madame Mongella </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Madame Gertrude Mongella,
best known as the Secretary General of the United Nations' Fourth
World Conference on Women, has got a nickname of "Mama Beijing"
from Tanzanians since the 1995 event held in the Chinese capital.
She readily accepted the name that showed their respect and
affection for her.
</P>
<P>
"I will never forget this experience that makes me feel more
attached to China," Mongella said in her office, which is
situated in a quiet garden-like courtyard on the west outskirts of
Tanzania's capital Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
"I first learned about China in the early 70s when the Chinese
helped us build the Tanzania-Zambia Railway," Mongella said in a
recent interview with Xinhua. "At that time I was a teacher and
visited the construction site with my students."
</P>
<P>
 An eight-time visitor to China, Mongella said she still wants
to go to Beijing, especially when the country will hold a grand
ceremony to mark its 50th anniversary on October 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
During the past 50 years, particularly in the past two decades,
the living standards of common Chinese people have remarkably
improved, she said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that China has made a big change and is more and more
open to the world. Although it's a developing country, it has a
lot of elements of developed countries, she added.
</P>
<P>
Two years after the Beijing conference, Mongella went to China
and found changes again. "New technology, new buildings, new
factories, and improvements in food processing, telecommunications
and transportation-- I saw it with my eyes," she said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980s, Mongella, who served as head of three different
ministries in Tanzania, and High Commissioner to India, visited,
among others, silk factories, fishing ponds, textile mills in a
lot of places in China, from the port city of Dalian in the
northeast to the southernmost province of Hainan.
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old woman, in a silk shirt printed with red flowers,
revealed cheerfully that the shirt was bought in Beijing. She has
a preference for the Chinese food that one eats not only "with
tongue" but also "with eyes."
</P>
<P>
The interview with Mongella in the inner room of her 20-square-
meter office, stuffed with computers, file holders and books, was
interrupted by telephone calls several times.
</P>
<P>
Although Mongella is quick to smile and give someone a
reassuring embrace, her slow, deliberate manner hides the quick
mind that picks up every body language signal-- a friendly tone of
voice or a mean glint in the eye.
</P>
<P>
"I founded Advocacy for Women in Africa (AWA) in 1996 after
Beijing," she said. The AWA is a non-governmental organization
that was a response to her own view that after the ending of the
women's conference, everyone must go home and do their homework.
</P>
<P>
The project, which has links with the United Nations,
Organization of African Unity (OAU) and women's organizations all
over the world, is dedicated to peace in African countries like
Burundi, Congo (K) and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
A member of OAU Women Committee for peace, Mongella realized
that unless the African continent is free from conflicts, the
Beijing Platform for Action could never be implemented. She hopes
to open new chapters all over Africa.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting upon the Fourth World Conference on Women hosted by
Beijing, she said, "Beijing did a wonderful job" as it brought 50,
000 people from so many nations together to discuss very critical
issues of humanity and facilitated exchanges between women and "
they felt as one."
</P>
<P>
"Even now everybody talks about Beijing. Sometimes when people
talk about the women issue, they say Beijing and Beijing," she
said.
</P>
<P>
"I also made a lot of good friends in China," she said, citing
Chen Muhua, the former vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress (NPC). She described Chen as a
brilliant, courageous, well-educated person capable of leadership.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that the Chinese women have enjoyed a highly
respected position in the past 50 years and fully taken part in
the country's development, saying that China would not have made
such achievements without the contribution of Chinese women.
</P>
<P>
Mongella said that women of China and Tanzania have a profound
friendship, but their exchanges could be further expanded. She
suggested that Chinese women come to make investments and hold
commodity exhibitions together with their Tanzanian sisters.
</P>
<P>
She also sees the possibility of establishing a China-Tanzania
women's association, which will provide a new form of co-operation
between women from both countries. She said only in this way could
women of the two nations enhance expertise exchanges in fields
such as medicine and science.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relationships, Mongella said that the political
and economic cooperation is firm. However, the ties can still be
strengthened through equal trade, she noted.
</P>
<P>
She said that Tanzania is a window on the Indian coast for
China to explore the market of Africa, and China can make good use
of Tanzania's ports to do business with landlocked African
countries. She also stressed people-to-people exchanges apart from
official relationship.
</P>
<P>
Mongella expressed the hope that China could open its market to
developing countries like Tanzania and transfer technologies to
them so as to boost their economic developments. At the same time,
she hopes China can play an important role in helping African
countries out of conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Flooding in Venezuela Displaces Thousands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Flooding caused by heavy rains
in the last few days has rendered some 15,000 homeless and brought
about huge economic losses in northeastern Venezuela, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
They said the situation could worsen in the next week with more
rains whopping the country.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures, given by the Civil Defense, showed that
some 50,000 people have been affected by the rains and the number
of the displaced stood at 15,000 only in the eastern state of
Anzoategui.
</P>
<P>
The authorities lodged the displaced in the buildings of
several public schools and in a sports center of the state, where
they have been given light mattresses and blankets, medicines,
clothes and food.
</P>
<P>
The rains this week have caused the overflowing of the Aragua,
Querecual, and Neveri rivers in Anzoategui.
</P>
<P>
An Anzoategui state government spokesperson said that rain that
fell those days was 50 percent of what is expected of all the next
winter season.
</P>
<P>
The rains caused the rivers to topple the Gomez and Bergantin
bridges, two of the most important in Anzoategui, cutting the
state's communications with the central region.
</P>
<P>
The floods forced many residents to climb to the roofs of their
houses.
</P>
<P>
The authorities estimated the economic losses caused by the
rains at millions of U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Expects Strong Earthquakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican authorities expect
possible earthquakes of higher intensity than the one registered
last Friday, an official of National Emergency Commission (CNE)
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Fernando Cordero told Xinhua by telephone that the earth
movements occurred in the last two days in the country. The
research of Costa Rican seismologists shows that it is highly
possible that in the Nicoya peninsula in the Pacific coast north
of Costa Rica there will be very strong earthquakes that could
cause much damage to the population.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican authorities have taken preventive measures to
reduce the damage, said the CNE official.
</P>
<P>
He also confirmed that an earthquake with a magnitude of 4.8 on
the Richter scale occurred at 04:49 Saturday and its epicenter was
located 55 kilometers southeast of Quepos, some 120 km south of
San Jose, at a depth of 35 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
This earth movement was caused by the collision of the Cocos
and Caribbean tectonic plates, the same as Friday's, that measured
5.3 on the Richter scale. None of the two tremors caused damage or
victims.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Real Estate Sector Still in Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' real estate
sector remains in a slump as evidenced by the continued reluctance
of the banking sector to make new real estate investments or
increase its exposure to that sector.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest data revealed by the Central Bank of
the Philippines, the real estate exposure of the banking sector in
the second quarter of this year fell to 12.9 percent from the
first quarter level of 13.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said that the decline could be traced to a
combination of growth in the banks' total loan portfolio and a
decrease in real estate loans.
</P>
<P>
During the second quarter, the banking system's loan portfolio
grew by 12.2 billion pesos (310 million U.S. dollars), but the
actual real estate loan exposure of the banks declined, the
central bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the decrease in the banks' real estate loan
exposure was due to improved collection of outstanding real
estate loans or foreclosure of properties used as collateral.
</P>
<P>
Since the financial crisis started in 1997, Philippine banks
have been very cautious about the lending to real estate sector
and in investing in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The central bank then imposed a 20 percent ceiling on the
banks' exposure to the property sector to prevent financial risks.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian President Raises Conditions for Visit to Chile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori
will visit Chile if Chile agrees on the implementation of pending
clauses in the 1929 peace treaty, Foreign Minister Fernando de
Trazegnies said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Trazegnies said an invitation for a Fujimori visit to Chile is
in force and will come about when the dispute over the 1929 peace
treaty is resolved.
</P>
<P>
The treaty foresees that Chile will deliver a wharf, a customs
building and a railroad station to the southern Peruvian
department of Tacna.
</P>
<P>
Peru lost to Chile the locality of Arica, bordering with Tacna,
after a war between the countries from 1879 to 1883.
</P>
<P>
If Fujimori's visit is agreed on, it will be the first of a
Peruvian president to Chile in this century.
</P>
<P>
The governments of Peru and Chile are confident that the 1929
Peace Treaty's pending clauses will be fulfilled this year.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Paramilitary Men Slay Five Villagers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A group of armed men
shot dead five more villagers in northern Colombia Saturday,
bringing the total murdered in the week to at least 20, a police
source said.
</P>
<P>
Other three villagers were injured by firearms as they escaped
the armed men, who were searching the place for suspected members
or collaborators of the guerrillas, the source said without
mentioning the number of the attackers.
</P>
<P>
The villagers were forcibly taken from their homes and shot
dead right in front of the eyes of their relatives.
</P>
<P>
The police blamed the killings on paramilitary groups that
combat the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the biggest
rebel group in the country, criticized the government's leniency
toward the paramilitary groups, which have made a series of
assassinations recently in the rural areas of the war-torn country.

<HEADLINE> 3.5 Million Tremors Occur Every Year Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 3.5 million earthquakes
are registered every year in the world and at least one of them
surpasses the magnitude of 8 on the Richter scale, Spain's
National Seismic Network reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It said that almost 1,000 tremors of a magnitude above 5 are
reported in the world, of which 18 are between 7 and 7.9, 120
between 6 and 6.9, and 800 between 5 and 5.8.
</P>
<P>
The Seismic Network said that it must be considered that the
epicenter of many of them can be in the middle of the sea or of
the desert, so they do not directly affect the population and go
unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
The zones of the biggest risk are in the areas where the
tectonic plates meet each other, meaning between America and the
Pacific, in Japan or in the Mediterranean zone.

<HEADLINE> 3 Shot to Death in New Riot in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- At least three people were
killed and eight others were injured in a new riot in Ambon,
capital of Indonesia's Maluku province, on Saturday afternoon, the
Antara News Agency reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The incident started when large numbers of unidentified people
arrived near a market on Tulukabessy Street in Kijang vans and
trucks.
</P>
<P>
The rioters attacked a shophouse complex and torched 10 of the
complex's units with self-made incendiary bombs and molotov
cocktails.
</P>
<P>
Two fire trucks belonging to the Ambon municipal administration
could not come close enough to the burning buildings to do their
job because rioters blocked their path even though they were
escorted by a security forces detail.
</P>
<P>
Most of the dead casualties were hit by bullets fired by
security forces, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The clashes in Ambon first broke out in January, in which more
than one hundred people were killed and tens of thousands of
people were forced to flee their villages.
</P>
<P>
Local religious figures, along with the military, have tried to
reconcile the warring camps but clashes broke out again in
mid-July.
</P>
<P>
In Ambon, about 60 percent of the population is Christian. Most
of the rest are Muslims, many of them immigrants from other
islands.

<HEADLINE> American Sprinters Advance to 100m Semis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- American sprinter Marion Jones
took the first stride with the fastest time of the year in the
second round of the heats at the women's 100-meter dash of the
World Athletics Championships here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Competing in the steamy heat under the Spanish sunshine, Jones
clocked 10.76 seconds in the second round, bettering her own year'
s best of 10.80.
</P>
<P>
Only Florence Griffith-Joyner, Christine Arron, Merlene Ottey
and Jones, herself, have ever run faster.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Jones, who is going for four golds here, clocked 11.22
seconds in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
The defending champion, who has never exepriencing the taste of
defeat since the year 1997, is edging closer to Griffith-Joyner's
10.49 record for the distance.
</P>
<P>
She hinted after the heats that she may become the fastest
runner ever at the world championships. "I am not putting pressure
on myself by talking about times but if the fast times are needed,
here I'm ready to do them."
</P>
<P>
"These champinships are what it's all about. It's right here
and I'm right here. Nothing else really matters unless you can
make it count at a championships," she said.
</P>
<P>
Jones also qualified for Monday's long jump with a leap of 6.81
meters with her second attempt.
</P>
<P>
Two-times 200m European champion Christine Arron of France, who
hopes to make a slice of history by winning women's 100m and 200m
events here, also made semi-final in the women's 100m event with a
clocking of 11 seconds.
</P>
<P>
But her dream might be broken by the American sprinters
including Inger Miller, who was second fastest in the heats at 10.
86 seconds, a personal best for the joyful athlete.
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had this 100m in me, it was just a matter of time. I
have been popping all seasson and I was certain my personal best
would fall soon," she said, jumping up and down and laughing.
</P>
<P>
"This is an exceptionally fast track and I love the track
surface," she added.
</P>
<P>
Maurice Greene of the United States, the fastest men's runner,
had a easy step to defend his world title of the 100m dash at the
championships, clocking 9.91 seconds in heat five.
</P>
<P>
While in the women's long jump qualification, 1995 world
champion Fiona May of Italy produced the longest jump and the
second best of the year at 7.04 meters.
</P>
<P>
Defending world champion Russian Lyudmila Galkina leapt to the
second place at 6.88 meters while Brazilian Maureen Higa Maggi,
the season's leader with 7.26, was almost in trouble making the
final with a jump of 6.66 meters, 0.12 meters below the
qualification mark of 6.80 meters. However, this was good enough
to take her into Monday's final.
</P>
<P>
Greek Niki Xanthou, silver medalist in Athens, made a surprise
in the qualification, managing only 6.34 meters, 0.64 meters
shorter than her season best.

<HEADLINE> Hunter Wins Men's Shot Put Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- American C.T. Hunter won the men
's shot put at the 7th World Athletics Championships here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hunter, bronze medalist at the Athens championships in 1997,
registered 21.79 meters in his last efforts for the win.
</P>
<P>
Oliver-Sven Buder of Germany finished second in 21.42 meters
and Aleksandr Bagach of Ukraine third in 21.26.
</P>
<P>
American John Godina, gold medalist in the last two
championships, came a distance seventh by throwing 20.35 meters.
</P>
<P>
"How can you plan a win like that," said Hunter, who married
women's star runner Marion Jones last year.
</P>
<P>
Hunter had 21.09 meters in his fifth attempt, only second after
Buder's 21.42. But Bagach took the second position after throwing
21.26.
</P>
<P>
Hunter turned the last chance to victory with a throw of 21.79,
which finally earned him the gold.
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had it all to do on the last put and everything came
right for me. Basically I went after it. I gave it everthing I had!
maybe I had been trying too hard earlier on in the competition and
put too much pressure on myself," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The advantage with having only one throw left was it was an
all or nothing effort. I had nothing to lose and i certainly
gained here tonight."
</P>
<P>
He added: "John (Godina) has been awesome in the past, but
things change, you know. John will be back of course. A guy with
his sort of record can never be considered to be finished."
</P>
<P>
Buder said after winning the silver: "It was a great
competition! We had a great feeling out there tonight. I didn't
mind losing the gold medal, I was already satisfied with my
distance today. Silver is excellent for me."

<HEADLINE> Dragila Wins Women's Pole Vault with World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- American Stacy Dragila became
the brightest star on the opening day of the World Athletics
Championships when she won the women's paul vault with a world
record mark of 4.60 meters Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
The former world indoor champion, who had her personal best of
4.54 meters in an exhibition earlier this season, flied over the
standard in her last attempt, equalling the listed world record
set by Emma George of Australia last February.
</P>
<P>
George, who set world record 17 times, had a startling vault in
the debut-making event in which she failed three times at the 4.
35m mark.
</P>
<P>
The Australian injured her back at training in Switzerland
recently.
</P>
<P>
After clearing the bar at 4.15 meters, George passed at 4.25
and failed at 4.35.
</P>
<P>
Anzhela Balakhonova of Ukraine was second at 4.55 meters and
Tatiana Grigoryeva of Austria third at 4.45.

<HEADLINE> Markov Wins First Gold, Jones and Hunter Shine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Ilya Markov captured
the first gold medal in the men's 20 kilometers walk while
Americans Marion Jones and her husband C.T. Hunter shone in the
first day's competition of the 7th World Athletics Championships
here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 100 meters defending champion Jones, who has unbeaten in
the track since 1997, clocked the year's fastest time of 10.76
seconds in the second round race this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Jones, the second fastest woman in the world after fellow
American Florence Griffith Joyner, also took a steady step toward
the goal of winning four gold medals in the championships after
advancing in the 200 meters and long jump.
</P>
<P>
But what she would celebrate most was the victory of her
husband Hunter, who won the men's shot put with a throw of 21.79
meters.
</P>
<P>
American John Godina, the 1995 and 1997 world champion,
finished a distance seventh with 20.35 meters.
</P>
<P>
Gonina was not the only star who fell in the opening day's
competition. Women's pole vault world record holder Emma George
of Australia also crashed out after three failures at 4.35 meters.
</P>
<P>
The event, which became an medal event for the first time in
the World Championships, was won by Stacy Dragila of the United
States with a world-record tying 4.60 meters.
</P>
<P>
Markov, who was disaqualified with five kilometers to go in the
Athens championships in 1997, pulled away from the leading pack in
the last two kilometers and took the win comfortably in one hour
23 minutes 34 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Olympic Champion Jefferson Perez of Ecuador finished second in
1:24:19 and defending champion Daniel Garcia of Mexico third in 1:
24:31.
</P>
<P>
Markov, the reigning European champion and silver medallist in
the 1996 Olympic Games, contributed his gold medal to his wife. "
Today is her birthday, this gold is for her," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely hot, especially for a Russian but I'm in superb
form today. Before the competition, I know my top rival is Perez
because I lost to him in the 1996 Olympics. During walking, I'm
confident of winning the gold, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian suffered a heartbreaking defeat in the 1997
championships where he held the lead most of the time but was
disqualified as the victory was in sight.
</P>
<P>
But this time he made no such mistake. "It was after 16km that
I knew the race was won by me. To be honest, I only came here for
the gold. The other colored medals would have been a
disappointment."
</P>
<P>
Perez, who was Ecuador's first Olympic gold medalist and the
youngest ever Olympic walks champion at 22, said: "The weather and
the walking course were not to my liking today. The 15km was the
crucial point in my race. I could only think about finishing the
race as I was already so tired."
</P>
<P>
He added: "I have not seen my family very much over the last
eight months. This is the price of training to reach the top.'
</P>
<P>
The bronze medalist Garcia said: "This performance will confirm
that I will continue to Sydney. There was nothing special today in
my race, but there weren't any major problems either. I have no
secrets in my training, I just focus entirely on myself and on my
goals."
</P>
<P>
Jones, who aims to win four gold medals in 100m, 200m, long
jump and 4x100m relay, bolted off the block to clock the fabulous
time of 10.76 seconds, beating the year-best time of 10.80, which
was set by herself.
</P>
<P>
"That's a fast track," Jones said. "I'm just excited. I'm not
putting pressure on myself by talking about times but if the fast
times are needed, here I'm ready to do them."
</P>
<P>
Men's 100m record holder and defending champion Maurice Greene
showed he is the undisputed fastest man in the world by clocking 9.
91 seconds in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
World 3,000m steeplechase record holder Bernard Barmasai of
Kenya also advanced with a pedestrian time of 8:16.50 in the first
round, a far cry from his world mark of 7:55.72.

<HEADLINE> Spadea, Lapentti Contests RCA Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Two surprising finalists--
eleventh seed Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador and unseeded American
Vince Spadea--will contest the title of the RCA Championships
which started with many star players.
</P>
<P>
The 34th-ranked Spadea reached his second career ATP Tour final
by outlasting 32nd-ranked Frenchman Sebastien Grosjean 6-3, 6-7 (4-
7), 7-6(7-4) in two hours, 44 minutes on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Lapentti scored a 6-4, 6-2 victory over Jan
Siemerink of the Netherlands in a brief 69 minutes.
</P>
<P>
All the star players had gone out earlier. Top-seeded Pete
Sampras exited midway through his quarter-final match against
Spadea with a right hip flexor strain. Second-seeded Patrick
Rafter never took to the court in his quarter-final against
Siemerink because of shoulder tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil lost in straight sets to
Grosjean, and Lapentti overwhelmed fourth-seeded Carlos Moya of
Spain.

<HEADLINE> ETA Supporters Slipped into Opening Ceremony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Seville security officials have
admitted that supporters of the Basque guerilla group ETA slipped
into Friday evening's opening ceremony of the World Athletics
Championships.
</P>
<P>
Nine people including two Basque activists dressing up as
official mascots were arrested at the stadium gala on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said the two activists -- a man and a woman --
entered the stadium as normal spectators and, once inside, had put
on perfect copies of the official mascot outfits which allowed
them to dance on a central stage in front of millions of
television viewers with a pro-ETA logo in English plastered on
their outsized costumes.
</P>
<P>
Three other protesters abseiled from one of the grandstands
with banners calling for the transfer of convicted ETA members to
jals in the Basque country.
</P>
<P>
And others handed out leaflets to members of the crowd and
journalists before being hauled away by police.
</P>
<P>
The head of Spain's national police Juan Cotina told National
Radio that checks on people entering the stadium were the
responsibility of the games' organisers.
</P>
<P>
"There was certainly a mistake on the part of the organisers
and the security forces who should have responded beefore the
incidents occurred," he said.
</P>
<P>
The organisers tightened security checks on people entering the
site of the championship Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Markov Wins First Gold in Athletics Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Ilya Markov captured
the first gold medal of the 7th World Athletics Championships by
winning the men's 20 kilometers walking here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Markov, who was disaqualified with five kilometers to go in the
Athens championships in 1997, pulled away from the leading pack in
the last last two kilometers and took the win comfortably in one
hour 23 minutes 34 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Olympic Champion Jefferson Perez of Ecuador finished second in
1:24:19 and defending champion Daniel Garcia of Mexico third in 1:
24:31.
</P>
<P>
Markov, the reigning European champion and silver medalist in
the 1996 Olympic Games, contributed his gold medal to his wife. "
Today is her birthday, this gold is for her, " he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely hot, especially for a Russian but I'm in superb
form today. Before the competition, I know my top rival is Perez
because I lost to him in the 1996 Olympics. During walking, I'm
confident of winning the gold, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian suffered a heartbreaking defeat in the 1997
championships where he held the lead most of the time but was
disqualified as the victory was in sight.
</P>
<P>
China's hope of winning a medal in the race was dashed as Li
Zewen, the 1995 World Cup champion, finished only fourth.
</P>
<P>
The world's most populous country, who failed to win a medal of
any color in Athens, now must fix their eyes on the women's 20km
walking for a medal.
